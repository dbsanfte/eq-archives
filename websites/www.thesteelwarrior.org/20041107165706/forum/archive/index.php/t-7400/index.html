<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have this mission to kill all gang members in Perez Park.  I have died once trying to get to the mission, and three times trying to complete the misson.  The mission is close or at the end of and story arc.  There is a gang war with the hellions and Skulls and I have to arrest/kill them all.   <br />
<br />
  So I am working my way through the cave/dungeon killing the minons with ease then comes this room of all level 13 thugs I am like ok no big deal just got to take it slower and kite them if I get in some trouble.  I clear that room and work down this corridor and I see a minion and a boss and they are both level 13.  I am a level 12 rifle/energy manip blaster.  After a long time I finally killed the minion then comes the boss ok no problem used all my inspirations and killed him without any trouble.  SO i am thinking cool the boss is dead and the rest will be cake.  <br />
<br />
  Well that was my first mistake I started to think.  I work my way down corriders and they started to become even cons so I thought cool almost done.  Nope after that room again another room fill with level 13's skulls.   Since I just killed the Hellions boss and the same exact  setup I knew what was coming.   I killed his lackie guard and he was just left.  I didn't have alot of inspirations so I knew this was going to be close.   He was a damn scrapper, kicked my ass before I even knew I was being hit.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Now I got to re-start the whole mission again since by the time I get back to the dungeon it would reseted itself by then.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was wondering if this ever happen to you.  I solo all my missions and hardly ever group.  I like to solo in this game and I love doing the missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes the end of story arcs can be a bit harder than normal missions. I would also point out that grouped this game plays significantly differently than solo and larger groups differently than small ones. <br />
<br />
I know that Patient 0 just about killed the 2 of us who ran into him, and did kill me (the invul tank squeeked though and I did a combat rez). <br />
<br />
I would suggest either leveling and coming back or grabbing a 2nd player to go with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or being willing to take a quick run to buy more inspirations as needed.  Annoying, but the right inspirations can make all the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was working on a mission similar to that ( 2 end bosses in Skyway City; stupid outcasts ); both dark art type scrappers...but myself being a dark art/katana scrapper with a controller and tanker team up.....we took them down rather nicely.<br />
<br />
duoing it before with a tanker was messy..the added controller made all the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Glatius running for more inspirations is not an option since the mission is in PP in the forest just getting there alive is an task on its own.  I died again just trying to reach the dungeon earlier today. Also usually by the time I get back to the mission the zone will be reset and I would have to do it again.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I got to make friends on Champion sooner or later for help with these missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heres a tactic thats served me well.<br />
#1 Kill all the killable guys in the level. All minions etc<br />
#2 Play cat and mouse.<br />
   Snipe him, hit and run. Shoot then fade to the next room.<br />
   Eventually you will be back at the zone in if you do things right.<br />
#3  Hit as hard as possible then zone out.<br />
    Did you know you get a full heal when  leaving a mission?  :) <br />
    As soon as your END regens a bit go back in, and waylay the boss on the         <br />
   way  back to his spawn point, he'll be calmly walking back.<br />
   This works even better in missions with elevators. Nothing follows you thru an <br />
    elevator/door to the outside.<br />
<br />
I play a defender so the basic tactics should work the same for a blaster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Let me know when you need a hand Irmingnomers, I'm on champion and my SS invul tanker is now level 22.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can tell you the zone heal, while handy is not really a full heal. As a 24 blaster I can zone and still not have full HP--though I do have to be fairly beat up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Let me know when you need a hand Irmingnomers, I'm on champion and my SS invul tanker is now level 22.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx for the offer boss,  but I am only level 12 if you have any alts around that level then let me know when you are available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanx for the offer boss, but I am only level 12 if you have any alts around that level then let me know when you are available.<br />
<br />
Well I figured that if the bosses are giving you such grief, that powering through them with the tanker would be a quick and easy solution once you'd cleared the trash.  But if you'd rather keep the challenge, I can respect that.  I have a level 13 Fire tanker and a level 13 Claw scrapper on Champion and I can make myself available most mornings.<br />
<br />
Look for Storm Fire, Ronin Enforcer, or Immovable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you have it Hover &gt; Scrapper Boss every single time.  They can't hit you except with there range attacks which suck.  No Flurry = Win every time even if they are Orange or Red  I've done it plenty of times on my Blaster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Hover is the best. Best ability I ever got as a blaster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well I finally finished that mission.  It was differant this time one boss was level 12 and the other was level 13.   The hellion boss was level 12 and had no trouble killing him off but the Skulls boss which was the level 13 one was a pain in the ass.   His name was Bonebreaker and boy oh boy does he live up to that name.  After dieing 4 times I finally killed that bastard.  <br />
<br />
Starting this mission I had 0 debt now I have 1586 debt but I did it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Now I got to re-start the whole mission again since by the time I get back to the dungeon it would reseted itself by then. &quot;<br />
<br />
I've never had a mission reset unless I went Link Dead, or quit.  What's up? You have a mission reset on you? If so, that's a bug of some sort. I can walk out of a mission and come back to it later and it'll be cleared up to where I left it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can walk out of a mission and come back to it later and it'll be cleared up to where I left it.<br />
<br />
I've left missions a number of times to buy inspirations and not had the mission reset.  I've died and not had the mission reset.  But it may be possible that if you're gone long enough it will reset on you, although I've never seen it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've had lost connection to the mapserver (with my g/f, we were having cable modem issues mebbe, the problem seems greatly lessened - mebbe by fluke I finally got every network setting right), and had the map reset immediately, having to start anew tho I log back in as quickly as I am allowed to.  The fifth time, the house defender said *fek this* and got her highest toon out to just rampage the beggars.<br />
<br />
We went LD just before the very end, and had to be satisfied with the trail we had left.  It wasn't until an SG member was teamed with us, and in the map when we LD'ed again (the next day), that we were able to finish it.  Having someone in the map seems to have *locked* it as an instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">.. the house defender said *fek this* and got her highest toon out to just rampage the beggars.<br />
<br />
so, is the house dr00d a thing of the past now?!?!? congrats on bringing her to the dark side !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">arf arf<br />
<br />
LOL!! Yes, the house dr00d is a thing of the past, both of our accounts are cancelled and winding out.  She is the house [defender - controller - scrapper - blaster] now.  She has a stack of toons, we mix and match em with my stack.  Errant guildies who wander onto Pinnacle get pulled into our little clubhouse too, and we're slowly building up a force to be reckoned with and/or amused by (we have a few toons now on the brink of 15, waiting to try the Postitron TF before they proceed).  We're both having a blast - pun intended.<br />
<br />
Mebbe I should refer to her, henceforth, as the *house controller* ... if she isn't looking while I'm typing ...  but it's also true (he typed, a face peering over his shoulder) that no-one would go to the lengths she would to *defend* our house and home, and *house defender* seems well akin to *house dr00d (R.I.P.)*.<br />
<br />
Isn't that right, dear? ;praise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So Doggabone, what is your play time like?  Sounds like I might like to step over to pinnacle and hang with you guys from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">arf arf<br />
<br />
Roughly between 7 p.m. EST and midnight, depending on y'know .. life.  (Give or take an hour either way.)  There's some overlap, often the house defender gets on before I'm home, or I'm working that night.  Y'know ...<br />
<br />
My list atm is:<br />
The Swift Hand (MA/SR scrapper)<br />
Atta Boy (Katana/Regen scrapper)<br />
Coruscant (Elec/Elec blaster)<br />
Reticle (Assault/Devices blaster)<br />
Totality (Gravity/Kinetics controller)<br />
Professor Darke (Dark/Dark defender)<br />
Tektonikos (Stone/Stone tanker)<br />
The Iron Heart (Invuln/SS tanker)<br />
<br />
All but Reticle are 8-ish, Reticle accidentally got to 14 while helping others' alts to level.  Hah!<br />
<br />
... and the h. d.'s list, most of the names are blank to me atm.  We have em all under our SG tag [S. P. O. O. T., Super Powered Organization of Trollbraggers].  Friendly hominids willing to face ridiculous odds and yet remain reasonably intelligent about it are always welcome *hehe*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I made an alt on Pinnacle named Bio Mass a SS/Invul tanker, he's level 5 now.</div></div><hr />
