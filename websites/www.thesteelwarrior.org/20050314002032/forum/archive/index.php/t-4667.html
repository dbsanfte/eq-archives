<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. can there be only 2 instances in time?<br />
<br />
2. when does an instance start(each raid member gets temp flag), after phase 1 is completed, or after phase 2 is completed?<br />
<br />
3. how would a 3 guild rotation work?<br />
<br />
4. whats the best way to insure a 2 guild rotation doesnt conflict?<br />
<br />
<br />
possible issue im concerned with is the 2 instance limit if there is such a thing. from reading on the safehouse some there isnt much info.<br />
<br />
if there is a 2 instance limit, lets assume the instance or temporary flag from one guildA has run out. does guildB have a possibilty of starting a 2nd instance(guildB just got to time so isnt clearing much) and ruining the zone for the other guild till the temporary flags run out 4-5 days later?<br />
<br />
specifically<br />
<br />
day1 - guildB clears trials but fails to clear phase 2 or kills half of it.<br />
day2 - guildA's temp flags expire late that night at some unspecified time so they raid the next day. guildB clears trials again, not worried about who zones in first or whatever because they failed phase 2 anyway, could they get a 2nd instance going and wreck the zone for the next guild the following day?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Not sure, only two guilds in Time on my server at the moment.<br />
<br />
2. Im gonna say its phase 1. On a couple of our raids, if someone didnt participate in the phase 1 trials on the first day, and that person is the first to port into TimeB on the second day, it begins a new instance and the rest of the raid that participated the first day cant enter and youve just blown an hour until it resets. <br />
<br />
3. With only 5 day repop on the gods, a 3 guild rotation would get nasty if the guilds already in time didnt want to push their raids back a day. Top guild can clear it in 2 days, second guild can clear it in 2 days, that leaves 1 day before the Top guild can go again. The third guild will only have one day a spawn cycle to try it, or if they are really diplomatic, two. We're getting nearer this situation on Prexus, so Im curious myself how its gonna work out.<br />
<br />
4. Two guild rotation is easy. Just talk to the top guild, find out what days they are in time on a given week. When they clear the plane, then you're free for the next 3 days to do what ya want until it repops for the top guild. Just have to be willing to compromise and its cake.<br />
<br />
Your example is kinda confusing (this early it is atleast). Im not totally convinced there is a 2 instance limit in Time, so im not sure how that situation would work out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1: Nope, there can be as many instances as you want, up so some number that hasn't been discovered yet. I doubt there's a acheivable limit since it's just saving progress rather than any large amount of data.<br />
<br />
2: New instance starts the second the first person in the raid zones into Phase 1. All people in the raid who aren't already flagged with another instance, get flagged with this instance when they zone in. Anyone already flagged with a different instance can't zone in.<br />
<br />
2a: When can the next guild go in?<br />
You can't have 2 instances running at the same time. A new instance can only start once the current instance finishes. If you zone into P1 and straight out, it's an hour wait for the new instance to start. If you time-out halfway though P4, a new instance can be started immediately with P1/2/3 up. Remember though, this is ONLY for new instances - you're still flagged for 6 days, so if you were to go back immediately, youd go straight to P4 once you complete P1, with whatever gods you'd killed still dead.<br />
<br />
I *think* it's 14 hours from the start of a complete clear before the zone's ready for a new instance. It's possible for two guilds to go on the same day in different timezones, but prolly safer just to go on seperate days.<br />
<br />
<br />
3: <br />
Monday/Tues: Guild 1<br />
Weds/Thurs: Guild 2<br />
Fri/Sat: Guild 3<br />
Sun/Mon: Guild 1<br />
Tues/Wed: Guild 2 etc...<br />
That's the easiest way, provided you want to know in advance. We've got 2 guilds in Time on Zeb. We're farming the entire raid in 5 hours or less, the other guild are progressing, and are up to Quarm now. Basically, we get priority whenever we can start a full respawn instance, the other guild get it the other 5 days when we can't go back. Works fine.<br />
Monday: Guild 1<br />
Tues/Wed/Thurs/Fri/Sat: Guild 2<br />
Sunday: Guild 1<br />
Mon/Tues/Wed/Thurs/Fri: Guild 2<br />
Monday: Guild 1 etc.<br />
<br />
4: Whoever got to PoTime first, is probably clearing fastest. Let them do their 1-2 day clear whenever it's up, and then you have 4-5 uncontested days left before they bother going back.<br />
   <br />
Least I think that's how it works</div></div><hr />

There is going to much conflict with this when my guild and the others hit time. There is no love between our  guilds on our servers =X...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Demo, how do you know there can be as many instances as you want?<br />
<br />
about that situation where someone who didnt help in trials zoned in first on day2 of trials and started a new instance, yall waited an hour and redid trials? was the person who started the other instance able to join after you redid the trials or does he have to wait till your past phase2 or is he just out of luck for 4 days till his temp flag disappears?<br />
<br />
there was a thread about this a while back on the FoH board of someone zoning into another guilds instance which brought up the idea of the limit. is it just a bug when this happens thats been fixed or this still going on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that bug has been fixed..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">right now we are running a 3 guild rotation, 3 days each.  we have had some instance issues so we spaced em out. its a rather amicable rotation. I expect we will get to a 5 guild rotation in 1Q04 and have to compress the cycle. such joy !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">rag,<br />
<br />
what issues were u having and how long ago were they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, its day 4 and your temporary flag runs out from the day you beat the trials. are you immediately ported out of zone or do you simply get a new instance the next time you complete the trials?<br />
<br />
anyone got an exact number when the temp flag runs out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your instance should last FIVE days.<br />
<br />
for example, last week. explicit runs the table in one day. lotus cult in 3 days, we come in, its day five of our instance. clear first 3 phases and voila only the zeks are up in phase 4, exactly as we left them (xfingers zeks die this week). on our second day of rotation, saryn and TT repop and no we didnt have to do phase 2 and 3 again, a blessing and a curse some might say.<br />
<br />
as for the instancing issues i mentioned, we had a few messed up instances related to the known bug, circumstances have not repeated but I cant say thats due to software or good policing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i like your example, but it doesnt sound like the instance reset for you on day 6, it still remembered you had killed phase 2 and 3 from the day before.<br />
<br />
if you got a new instance, i would assume the zone would be full spawn, but the way you describe it, the instance is continuous?<br />
<br />
what is the known bug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zaos13</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well instance has to last 5 days...<br />
phase 1 = 8 hours(correct?)<br />
2/3 = 3days<br />
gods = 5<br />
<br />
unless i suck and stuff ahs changed. most is 8 guilds to be &quot;effective&quot; where no one gets caught without phase 5 repops ...its late tho so i could be off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">again, sounds like the instance never runs out. if you go in and clear thru phase 4 and phase 5 is not up but the next day it is and you dont have to reclear thru phase 4, you are still using the same instance.<br />
<br />
does the zone never completely reset, ie you are in a new instance?</div></div><hr />
