<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there,<br />
<br />
i wondered where the position of a ToD is aggro-wise.<br />
It procs a 50% slow that lasts for over 3 min, and a slow generates lots of aggro as we all know. But i didnt find it under the aggro-weapons thread.<br />
Would it be possible to hold aggro with this weapon? The ratio is definately not the best.<br />
How does the aggro of the &quot;Tepid Deeds&quot; effect compare to aggro of CHoS for example? CHoS must be ~450 aggro because of stun.<br />
If the aggro is not too bad it may be an option to Aug it with Anger3 for a real nice aggro weapon :-)<br />
Could be really handy in Situations where no slower is present. You could start fight with defensive, until it runs out mob will be slowed, and you could keep it slowed forever. If only it is enough aggro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At my level I don't use ToD in groups much anymore, but when I do:<br />
<br />
(Works best with a Ranger also trying to slow). Acquire aggro with the best possible aggro setup and Bellow every time it pops. Switch in ToD. Look for resisted Slows. Get two resists and check mob's HP's. If the mob still has high HP's swap in a Journeyman's Walking Stick. As soon as you get a debuff, swap in ToD again. If you end up killing the mob unslowed with ToD, don't bother trying to slow that mobtype again.<br />
<br />
So the short answer is ToD's not a good aggro weapon. Believe me, if there was a Tashini aug that could be put on ToD I'd do it so fast yer head would spin. But Anger III or Force of YKesha is like putting a racing saddle on a plow horse. Those augs belong on the best aggro weapon you can lay yer hands on - not ToD.<br />
<br />
It's somewhat surprising what it can slow, but like any weapon that procs you might not see one in any given fight. If you can't take the beating from the mob unslowed, then ya need a slower.<br />
<br />
ToD is teh win soloing easier blue mobs - like Kael Arena.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A ToD is decent aggro, but only if it procs obviously. When DCing with my cleric in Sol Ro, if I didn't get a proc fairly early I could lose aggro from the cleric's nukes and healing. With WA5 and something like anger 3 or ykesha, I'm sure it would hold ok aggro. It's definitely not a premium aggro weapon, but it can suffice if the slows are really worth it. Also, definitely switch it out after it slows the mob. 3 minutes should be enough time to kill most things, and it's just not good enough DPS or aggro to keep up always. Augment it only if you NEED to slow the mobs and you NEED to hold aggro at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Slow really doesn't draw that much aggro.  However, a resisted slow pulls lots of aggro. <br />
<br />
I banked the ToD a long time ago when I got my Willsapper, which is a much better way to try and slow a mob.  13/20 vs 33/44 ... I'll take the 13/20 and do the slight dps while still being able to hold aggro by putting the Bloodfrenzy in offhand, or if the mob is being resistant I'll use J-stick offhand, but thats a rarity, seeing as how the only time I bust out the sapper is when I slow too fast with the shaman and he gets resisted and then dies. <br />
<br />
Don't aug the ToD and try and pick up a Willsapper ASAP, servers will be coming up soon (12:30EST) so go check DN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Willsappers are 15% less slowing than a ToD. Debatable whether or not you think it's worth the difference. Just pointing out that there IS a difference in the amount of slow. You would definitely hold better aggro with a Willsapper and something else than a ToD though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used my trunch in ToV as my main aggro weapon and was quite suprised with the results :D of course this was years ago; but hey...it was funny. I used to bet my ( fat ) phat shammy friend who could slow the wurms first; him or me. I beat him a few times and laughed.<br />
<br />
augment it though? it's a utility weapon. leave it be and save your points for real upgrades to everyday items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I slowed Doze while tanking him. I rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been quite suprised as to the number of times that ToD has saved my ass.  If slower goes LD an you have a pissed off 1500dmg hitter in your face, it can be a life saver.  I have found that with incite, I can generally hold agro long enough to get a slow off and switch back to my BoW.  True, you can occasionally go an entire fight without it proccing.  However, you also have the chance that it will slow the target in the first couple rounds of attacks... and I find that happens much more often than it not proccing at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i love my tod, i donmt think i would trade it in for a sapper sicne i already have a trident of the deep seas and i prefer the better slow to the 1hander aggro/dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a willsapper and a friend has a truncheon, and all I have to say is that there's a night and day difference between 35% and 50% slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does ToD still drop in OS?<br />

You're wrong. bye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes it still drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ToD is a utility weapon.  Do not augment it unless you have NOTHING else left to augment!</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Frankly, if you NEED slow and NEED aggro, and use the damn thing all the time, augment it. Do not augment it thinking of it as a MT weapon; it is indeed a utility weapon.</div></div><hr />
