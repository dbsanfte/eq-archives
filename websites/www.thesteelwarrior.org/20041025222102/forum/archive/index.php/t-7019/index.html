Pretty sure that it will be comparable, or better agro than an EoE.<br />
<br />
Is that an Uqua drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rune 3 aggro is pretty much 1:1 rune/aggro. So the proc is around 230 aggro, AE. It'll be worse aggro proc than EoE, but it looks like it'd be a very solid weapon. The icon from rune 3 sucks when MTing, so I'd be a tad uncomfortable with it just due to that. I personally wouldn't trade a EoE for it, though it'd be a hell of a good DPS/survivability weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WTF is up with all the fek Elf Boot graphics! =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Higelac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">not from uqua, its from one of the primals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We got one from the 3rd primal. The cragbeast model... heck if I can remember its proper name.<br />
<br />
Is there a decent 1hs from GoD that isn't an elf shoe? The ranger 1hs from Ikkinz, 1hs from Uqua, and this 1hs are all elf shoes. The graphic doesn't go well with anything, but strangely enough, one of our rangers dual wields the Ikkinz + Uqua swords and paired with a second elf shoe I think it looks alright. Once you stop laughing and take a second glance, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's all really up to the person buying it.  The DPS on that will probably be a little higher.  I guess the proc has a little more utility in it being a rune proc, but you drop a bit of AC for it and a solid stun proc for spell interrupts.  Eh, they all pretty much work in offhand, it's just up to the individual really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Our first one dropped tonight, and ranger picked it up. Worst graphic ever, so grats him on duel weilding 2 elf shoes ~_~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Elf swords should get an aggro bonus jsut for being so fucking ugly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The 1hs from Ferubi looks nice, though it's ratio isn't anything worth looking at and the proc is more annoying than the new Olsen twin movie.</div></div><hr />
