That is just my opinion on very limited knowledge of the class... what are your opinions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beastlords are a close second after everything, but a beastlord can also fight along with the pet.<br />
<br />
Ask your friend...does he want to fight alongside his pet, or sit back and let the fireworks ride?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But a BL can ghetto buff if no shammy is in the group, and can handle the job as slower in any group.<br />
<br />
Soo.. if you want pure DPS, mage is the way to go.  If you want to be able to fill two different types of slot in an exp group (either dps or slower) then BL is the way to go.<br />
<br />
They both have utility to offer a raid (CoH, rods vs, SP and ferocity)<br />
<br />
With all that said, one last consideration is soloing.  It is actually easier to solo as a BL than a mage... but mages are certainly capable of soloing very well.<br />

 Im curious why no one has mentioned Necro for a pet class, they are by far the most powerful , and their pets are right on par with mage/BL pets.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jacl</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would take a look at the Necro. They seem to have an answer to any problem they get in. They don't have the toughest pets, but fear is an awesome thing and makes you so strong. Plus once you get some lvls the mana regen and dots will own almost anything.<br />
<br />
I think the BL is due for some poundage with the nerf bat, they been to damm happy for to long, they have a ton of utility and can solo with the best of them. Like Ninja said, if your friend wants to melee and have a pet, then to me they are the clear choice. <br />
<br />
Mages don't have anything really special about them. If I play a caster I want bells and whistles, I mean, mages have a pet, they nuke......mod rod and coh are very nice but they are situational. I dunno, my mage never really impressed me.<br />
<br />
My pick for caster/pet class is Necro<br />
My pick for melee/pet class is Beast Lord</div></div><hr />

Mofu  First off, yes, Necros are by far the most powerful. Second, Necro pets is to Mage/BST pets as Warrior aggro is to Knight aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said, I prefer a mage pet before a BST pets... I still hate that BST pets have those intense-spell-effect procs that when they chain em, make my screen lag to hell and back :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beastlords can slow and give group mana regen that stacks with everything.  Plus at higher levels they can haste as well.  'nuff said. ^_^<br />
<br />
Beastlords can survive longer than any pet class if the pet dies (unless the Necro FDs of course, but even that can fail) due to level 55 disc.  All three classes can give mana regen in some form (Mage rod, Bst SP and Paragon, Necro Mind Wrack and twitch).<br />
<br />
Honestly, each class has it's powerful points.  If you had all three in one group, they'd completely tear anything and everything apart (plus pet groups rock).<br />
<br />
Mages have variety of pets, each with differing abilities, plus a huge number of summons and different nukes.<br />
<br />
Necros have a huge control over battles and hp/mana, especially undead, and snare with lifetaps and everything cannot be underestimated (Necros are only pet class with snare...and I mean REAL pet classes, the ones with level 60 pets 61+).<br />
<br />
Beastlords have group mana regen, haste at later levels, slow (high enough to be a main slower 60+ in PoP), their pets are very powerful with procs that hold agro, can melee, and they can play shaman at times too.<br />
<br />
Just have to look at the capabilities of each class, perhaps go check out the class boards and read up on what the class can do.  That's the only thing I can say.  Some people like the simplicity and raw power and control of the Necro (only one pet buff to worry about), others like the power and melee/pet of the Beastlord, and others like the overall versatility of the Mage.  It's really whatever the person seems interested in.  Some people don't like the myriad of buffs available to Beastlords.  Some people don't like all the summons Mages must keep up with.  Some people don't like the volatile nature of the Necro with their hp-&gt;mana spells and lifetaps.<br />
<br />
Need to find the pet class that more fits with the person.</div></div><hr />

My g/f enjoys her mage, and yet she may ditch it for a necro due to the mage pet spell research issue.  IIRC, post 20th lvl, most pet spells are combines, and they require lower level combined spells as a component.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played a mage to 64.<br />
<br />
The magician's superiority in pet summoning doesn't come in a be-all-end-all form, but a versatility of pets to choose from.  Mages, as we all know, can summon fire, earth, water, and air.  Each pet has its own distict advantages and disadvantages, and post-50 each pet takes on its own class.  Speaking post-50 of course, both earth and air pets are warriors, fire pets become wizards, and water pets become rogues.  Each pet also has a high resistance to a certain element as well.  Air pets are highly resistant to cold.  Earth pets are extremely resistant to disease.  Fire obviously to fire.  Water pets are highly resistant to poison.  Don't take my words for immune though.  Certain mobs will still land the respective elements on the pets if they're high enough level and have a high enough resist check with it.  <br />
<br />
As far as interclass comparisons go, mages have the upper hand is nearly every situation.  Mage pets have much higher ac, much higher attack ratings, hit harder, and can have higher hp depending on which pet the mage summons.  The fastest hitting pet goes to the beastlord actually.  Warders hit the fastest out of all of them which is also why they have the most push.  Survivability wise, the beastlord's 64 warder is about on par with the magician's 61 air pet.  <br />
<br />
High end balancing issues the mage class runs into:<br />
<br />
1)  Pets don't scale.<br />
2)  Magicians have no way of reducing their agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not just talking about the pet survivability.  When the pet dies and you can't summon another, each class has an option.  Mages have to run/gate/die, no question about it, Mage's pets are most of their defensive abilities.  Necros can snare/run or FD/gate.  Beastlords, we can tank the bugger or keep the pet from dying in the first place with our cleric-level heals.<br />
<br />
The point is, each class has it's benefits not only in the pet, but in the class itself and what it can do.  Mages may be able to summon harder hitting pets or higher hp pets and have highest mana regen in game with pet canni, but they can't slow the mobs/buff the group/heal the pet like a beastlord, or snare-kite, lifetap/manatap and FD like the necro.  They're also heavily dependant on their pet for survivability, whereas the necro and bst aren't.<br />
<br />
Each class has their benefits and weak points, and the original poster's friend has to look at all three and see which he'd like to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to solo, necro is where it's at.  They are a born soloer class and are simply scary as hell at high levels. <br />
<br />
If you want the best pet, get a mage. They have spells and items that can make their pet do things a warrior has wet dreams over.<br />
<br />
If you want some versatility in a group or a raid (i.e., if you want people to actually want to group with you), do the typical beastlord thing.  Although a necro also offers mana and to a certain extent health.  But the BL can, as other's mentioned, slow and buff and mostly that is what groups will want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The scariest pet class I've ever seen was a 60+ shaman with mage summoned items for his pet and full shaman buffs on his pet.   His pet made me look pitiful by comparison.  It had more HP's, more AC, and way better DPS than me.  But special circumstances like that notwithstanding, Vigdis summed up pretty much everything I was going to say.  Necros are gods, mage pets are disgustingly powerful at high level, and bst is the most group friendly of the bunch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If he's just starting out, then I belive that necro is the way to go.  Beastlords require more gear then mage or necro, and mages have a harder time soloing. <br />
<br />
Fear kiting is an easy, relaxing way to start the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kaesorn said..<br />

<br />
My original character was a mage , and mana regen sucked hard compared to wizards/necros/chanters. Has something changed i missed? Near as i can tell , all a mage gets for mana regen is MoD rods and a 6mana per tick self buff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mages get Reclaim Energy (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=331&amp;source=Live) at level 1.  It kills the pet and gives the caster mana determined by the hp of the pet (it's not a straight 1:1 conversion, tho...I forget the formula).<br />
<br />
At around level 50+, the hp of the mage's pet is so high that it actually gives more mana back than it took to cast it.  So a mage can therefor just cast a pet, reclaim it and get an overall increase in mana.  This is Pet Canni, cannibalizing their pets just like shamans cannibalize their bodies.  Just repeat this several times and a oom mage can be FoM in no time, especially with 61+ pets.  Then you add in the AAs for Faster pet summoning (50% less) and componentless summoning and it just makes it even faster.  The overall downside to this is the Mage must kill their pet in order to do it, which could hurt depending on how much equipment and buffs it has.  However, if the Mage gets the Suspend Companion AA, they can just suspend their current pet and do their Pet Canni, then unsuspend it.<br />
<br />
It's been around for quite a while, since Kunark I believe, when the pets became high enough in HP to give more mana back, and there's been nothing done to nerf it, only improve it.  You have to remember that not having a pet for a mage is a huge cripple, a mage is very vulnerable while they're doing this.  That and unless they have the Suspend Companion AA, they still need to summon the pet and buff it and give any items they may have to it.  That's enough of a downside, IMO.</div></div><hr />
