<br />
anyone got more info? screenshots? cool anecdotes?<br />
<br />
Im really kinda interested in this, seeing  as the GMs blatantly gave the finger to this poor guild, im a bit curious to see some action shots of the sleeper too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guilds involved: <br />
Wudan<br />
Ascending Dawn<br />
Magus Imperialis<br />
<br />
160 people, 3 and a half hour fight, some if not most people involved died over 40 times, and the official word from SoE thus far <br />
                   --------------<br />
&quot;&quot;The last official statement as of 11pm EST was that we probably reached the end (time out)of the script which it forced him to despawn&quot;&quot;<br />
                   -------------<br />
<br />
Thats according to a Magus member that was there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daetienofrallos</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we got him to 26% and he depoped.. cry.<br />
<br />
our guildpage was updated right after we engaged and people were uploading screenshots the whole time, however, its is down right now because we have had SOOOOOOOOO many hits on it..<br />
<br />
heck it was down when kerafym was at 40% due to the page hits.<br />
<br />
it was an awesome event and i'd like to extend my thanks to the members of wudan and mim who came to wake the sleeper with us.<br />
<br />
as for why he depoped at 26%, no one is sure.. the gm's  claim they didn't depop him, and don't know why he did.  some people are arguing that it was a time thing, but what is odd is that he depoped after 3 hours and 2 minutes or so.. i.e. it was an odd %, and it was an odd amount of time for him to depop after.<br />
<br />
and to those who will say that the taiwan guild got him down to 15% or whatever:<br />
1. that is a localized version of eq.. not sure how much soe monitors it or how it really is run in relation to the normal servers.<br />
2. they were utilizing a bug with negative hp regen by the sleeper... we weren't..  (this bug hit many mobs in eq a week and a half ago or so.. remember the patch, and then the serverside patch the night after? - that's when the taiwain guild did theirs.. they day of the patch) how can i prove the difference?  it took approximately 60 of them less than an hour to get him to 15%.. it took 160+ of us  3 hours and 2 minutes to get im to 26% using time gear and weapons.. they were using velious era gear/weapons..  also, during times when he'd get pushed onto the bubble and we were unable to keep much dmg up on him he would regen a bit of hp, i watched it happen a few times<br />
<br />
<br />
also note, this isn't the same sleeper that was asleep during velious era.. he's been buffed up.. he hits for 6999 dmg  not 2k as he did during velious,  he still procs dt, and can cast dt though.<br />
<br />
i was playing a warrior named dexsta during the fight, as my main (a mage named daetien) isn't keyed..   it was a great fight and i'm glad i was a part of it... all in all i blame buggy programming on soe's part for the depop.. not a gm.. why? because the gm could have depoped it anytime starting at about 85% when he showed up.. but instead he hung around for 2 more hours and watched us..  besides, with 3/4 of the eq population online at the time cheering for us it would be mighty stupid to depop the mob and piss sooooo many  people off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even getting him to 26 percent is awsome.  Gratz!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Logically, he was never meant to be killed. He was buffed up because a mob hitting for 2k and being slowable would surely be killable these days. They just didn't buff him enough. The lore of the sleeper also wouldn't allow for him to be killed.<br />
<br />
Regardless, it's  a pretty cool idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cheers for making a &quot;real&quot; attempt on sleeper which other servers didnt really get a chance to do (due to not knowing and woke it too early, or stupid noob guilds trying to make a name for themselves.)  it's an awesome job just to get him to 26% and ultra lame for verant to depop him due to bug or intentional.  if nothing else, i think verant owes you guys another try even if it means moving your toons to test server and repop him there for the attempt (lock the zone or something so other test server people cant help as they did with the old school BotB fights.)  it's good to see someone at least got him down that far and would be interesting to see how the spin doctors in verant is going to down play this event.</div></div><hr />

All in chinesse so get the translators out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sucks they ( SoE ) used their ace to f**k you guys over. I'd whole-heartedly believe that they just wanted to wait as long as they could before interrupting the fight so &quot;you too can feel the adventure that is Everquest!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think it's more likly that he hit the 25% mark and instantly despawned before it the server regesterd it to your PC so it still looked like he was at 26% due to all the lag. that of course is assuming 1, the GM didnt despawn him and 2, there *is* some kind of fail safe on kera jic anyone ever actually got that far.</div></div><hr />
