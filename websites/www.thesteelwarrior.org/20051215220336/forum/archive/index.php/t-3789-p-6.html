<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feysboil</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible that aggro is a composite of several different things, and that we're sniffing around one tree, when we've really got raccoons treed in two or more different trees?<br />
<br />
For example, the initial tests seemed pretty convincing that hate was a fixed amount (within a small range) per swing, and that it was related to a weapon's damage/delay stats.<br />
<br />
Then, it became evident that that theory is not entirely consistent across a wide spectrum of weapons (because the theoretical model doesn't mirror what we all know from practical experience).  So there are two possibilities:<br />
<br />
1) The original theory is completely wrong, and any semblance of validity is a startling coincidence.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2) The original theory is very close, thanks to a fortuitous use of weapons that are highly representative of the model, but there is some other amount of hate coming from somewhere that is too complex to reverse-engineer.<br />
<br />
For instance... perhaps the hate IS based on the weapon as originally postulated, but there is an additional amount of hate being generated using a different formula which scales in some way that is undetectable with the small sample of weapons tested thus far?  Maybe the amount of damage being done does generate hate, but depending on some variables (like weapon damage, damage bonus or delay) has a multiplier which practically negates the effects of added hate from damage done.  Or maybe each weapon has some hate multiplier, and most weapons have a multiplier of 1.0 or very close to it.<br />
<br />
I think the best way to proceed would be to continue to conduct these tests with a vast variety of weapons, and tabulate the pertinent information: damage, delay, damage bonus, number of hits to take 1 ToT's worth of aggro, total damage dealt in that time.<br />
<br />
There's also one other factor to consider, and that's decay.  Does hate decay over time?  Perhaps the variations seen have something to do with how much time it's taking to steal aggro.  For instance, with weapon A you take aggro back with 10 attacks, but weapon B seems to consistently take 40 swings to gain aggro.  Assuming the times are different there, is it possible that  if hate decays over time, you're really not stealing 1 ToT of aggro, you're stealing (1 - (Decay Rate * time)) ToT.  For longer periods of time taken to gain aggro, the amount being overcome might be considerably less than the fixed 510 we're taking as granted.<br />
<br />
So let's say hate decays a 10 hate/second (just for sake of argument).  Furthermore, we'll assume that 10 attacks with weapon A takes 10 seconds, and 40 attacks with weapon B takes 25 seconds.<br />
<br />
Weapon A: <br />
<br />
Hate Overcome = 510 - (10 hate/sec * 10 sec) = 410 hate to overcome decaying hate<br />
<br />
Weapon B:<br />
<br />
Hate Overcome = 510 - (10 hate/sec * 25 sec) = 260 hate overcome.<br />
<br />
This kind of variation could account for differences observed as well.  I'm not aware of any studies done as yet that conclusively prove or disprove whether hate decays at all.</div></div><hr />

I have updated my weapons comparison thingy (http://loophole.morpheus.net/eq/cm.html) to reflect this information as it is understood currently. Thank you for your work.<br />

Agro decay has been shown not to exist by wizards.  You will have to search their forums though.  They also have a great thread by Istari (?) about hate from spells.  <br />
<br />
What probably led to the theory of agro decay was mobs that will typically clear their agro list after every 5-6min.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, then a lot of typing by me was wasted... but thanks for confirming what I thought may have been true anyway.<br />
<br />
What about the other points I mentioned, about secondary sources of hate or multipliers based on specific weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt go penciling anything in yet.  <br />
the data points are so bad that the little change from 12 damage to 13 damage as it was revealed  made it so with twohanders<br />
weapon_damage + damage_bonus + 1 is closer (really close) then <br />
weapon_damage + damage_bonus  + single_hand_damagebonus<br />
<br />
which is nice cause thats the same approximation that singlehand weapons are using. But they arnt dead on and +2 instead of +1 is a tad closer for the twohand weapons.  But neither is exact.<br />
<br />
<br />
This unfortunatly will have to be placed in &quot;developing&quot; until someone gets more data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question, have you tried magic and non magic weapons?  One of the SK's whos been keeping up on my thread doing basically the same thing you are mentioned that my odd (as in higher than they should be) data points were from non magic weapons.  Wondering if you've seen anything similar so far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nm that magic/non magic thing, was data which was out of place.  Back to my original theory of dmg+(bonus*mod) now which seems to hold true for weapons from 37-49 delay, There are 3 different dmg bonus formulas in the game right now it's possible theres 3 formulas for modified aggro as well.  One for extremly high delay weapons, one for normal weapons, and one for very fast weapons.  With the modifier being largest on the high delay and lowest on the fast ones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. Looks like they may be close to completly reverse engineering hate per swing based on the weapons stats (delay, damage, dbonus, etc..) and should be seen by all.</div></div><hr />
