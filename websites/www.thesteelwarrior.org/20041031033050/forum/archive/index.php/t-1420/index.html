<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It mostly looks pretty good to me, although I think you'd be better off with some gear with higher AC, instead of some low HPs.<br />
<br />
First off, the legs have to go.  I don't think you should be wearing crusty any more.  I know the SS legs are hard to get, but the steel wrapped ones aren't bad at all (although expensive still on my server).  Failing that, get at least barbed ringmail legs.  <br />
<br />
Obvious upgrade would be an electrified earring of the tempests, about 5K on my server and you won't lose HPs, iirc.<br />
<br />
I'd turn in the tattered mantle for imbued granite spaulders, because I think 8 AC and all those saves are worth more than 20 HPs.<br />
<br />
And then the face slot needs to be upgraded, although a lot of the nicer face items are no drop.  Get a group with you to go to ME and get a stone visor.<br />
<br />
You'd add a lot of HP by getting the SS gloves, the plate gloves seem to drop more commonly than anything else for us, and I think they have 90 HP on them.</div></div><hr />
