He's not been made yet and will more than likely be a dwarf or a halfling, I haven't quite decided. Anyways, I have about 100k to spend on this little booger and was wondering if any of you had suggestions on what to get him as far as getting everything goes. Thank you all in advance for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grabe</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the certain deity based armor or just a wise decision overall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say mainly for the Deity armor.  That means halfling over dwarf but thats cool cuz halflings get the nice extra xp bonus.  All suggestions so far are great imo, however on the 2hs part.  It says savage stone axe but you can't use that till lvl 51.  Also another suggestion for your back is a Clock of Pernicity or whatever it is and a Clock of the Maelstrom, that is if you don't put your haste on your back.  Another 1hs would be a Frostbringer.  Also on your chest if you chose to not get a Fungi, I'd say get an enchated dwarven bp instead of barbed ringmail because atleast on Prexus the ED bp sells for like 600-1k less.<br />
Hope this helps, Akamek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the Deity gear.<br />
<br />
As a set of armour you can get without getting raid lewts Fierce Heraldic / helanic tundra are superior to pretty much everything until you start getting ornate.<br />
<br />
As an example, I'm an agnostic warrior decked out in a mix and match of Champions (Coldain quest) and Myrmidon's (CoV quest) armours.  My guild had a human warrior transfer and he got decked out mostly in Rallos Zek cultural, got handed a barbed ringmail until we got round to ganking Vindi for him.  1 day on the server, completely kitted out in tradeable gear and some of it not the flashest either and he already had more HPs and AC than me.<br />
<br />
Unless you've already got a guild thats gonna kit you out in NToV / Ssra / VT and better gear it would be a huge mistake to anyone making a new warrior today to exclude themselves from wearing RZ / Tribunal cultural.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grabe</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you both :)  I was just skimming through Allakazam's and wasn't really paying attention.   I like the Frostbringer and would be more likely to get that than the Lammy but I also like the dmg/dly on SBoZ (not to mention the 100hp's which are nice) and the proc on the Wavecrasher is a nice addition.  It all depends on how much money I want to have left for armor.  The cultural armor sounds good and will definitely be on my list when I get a bit higher level.  Too bad only Hum/Bar/Hef can wear the Helanic Tundra stuff :(  Oh well.  Will look into all the suggestions offered so far.  And again, thank you both and also everyone else that left posts above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, get a good 2HS.  DPS is much higher with 2HS, which translates into faster kills, and faster exp.  Di'Zok Imperial Katana is reasonable, or Blackened Acrylia Greatsword, or Iceflame for piercing.  <br />
<br />
Second, no reavers, please.  The ratio is tantalizing at low levels, but the damn thing isn't magic, and there are too many mobs it won't hit.  <br />
<br />
Spend most of your money on haste and weaps, and you won't be disappointed.  Better haste is worth more than almost anything else you can buy.  A RBG goes for only 20K on my server these days, or step up to the RBB (or even a CoF, if you are truly ambitious).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reavers have been tagged magic now, so they are a very nice 2hs solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Hormadrune said.<br />
<br />
AND ... depending on how LOW a level you go, the ratio is NOT tantalizing.<br />
<br />
40/40 is worthless before level 20, due to damage cap.<br />
<br />
After level 28 it gets a tad more inviting, however, remember that dual wield is one of your most effective weapon options until your 50s where 2 hander damage bonuses start to go through the roof.</div></div><hr />

I also might drop that Bracelet of Might for the Silver Chitin Wristband.  Those extra hp's are always appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I removed the RBG because with 11/18 it won't make all that much of a difference until higher level.  I centered myself (as you can see in the profile) around mainly +hp items.  I know I lose the AC that I can get from some other items offered but 925hp unbuffed at 5 is nothing to scoff at.  I thank you all for your help and will definitely hang around here to help answer questions and even have my questions answered occasionally. :)  Take care.</div></div><hr />

EB &gt; haste &gt; hp &gt; everything else</div></div><hr />

Or the Blood Runed Girdle for Silvery Belt of Contention?  Or should I look into Lesser/Greater Guard of Haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard the Veksar Haste belt is 31 percent haste. If that's true, here's what I'd do ...<br />
<br />
1) use SCHW or FBSS until you can use the Veksar belt (it's rec level I think, since almost all the items I've gotten out of there so far are).<br />
<br />
2) Use the Veksar belt when you ding close enough to get some ok stats from it.<br />
<br />
Then never think about haste again until you're raiding or whatever.<br />
<br />
31 percent haste in this day and age is just fine due to haste caps ... and new haste spells.</div></div><hr />

Scroll Down and check out the magelo I gave the other guy.  That guy pretty much asked the same question, and I made a decent lil' magelo for what you can get with less than 100k, and still have a fair amount of plat to save afterwards.</div></div><hr />
