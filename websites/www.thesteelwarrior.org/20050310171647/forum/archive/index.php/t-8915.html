I tried 2 tasks, the first was run to SFM, find the dragon head (easy) and then kill 10 mature chromadracs and loot 4 essence of sunlight. 30 minutes later I had found and killed 2 chromadracs (once having to run for BW zone do to 3 adds) and looted 0 essence; later for that- /abandon. <br />
Next was run to HS zone (easy w/ invis bp and lev potion) and then kill 10 Gunthak Swabbies. Wtf is a gunthak swabby? I did most of my 30s in OT and never heard of them. There sure as hell weren't any anywhere near HS! The whole point of tasks was to give you something to do when you don't have much time. Hunting all over a zone the size of OT looking for mobs is NOT my idea of something to do in a short amount of time.<br />
Grats rangers, druids and bards on being able to do tasks;  /rude the devs on having a good idea and then totally fucking it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tested that quest in beta.  It took me about an hour and 15 minutes to complete.  Make sure when you read the next instruction you check the zone listed next to it - Gunthak Swabbies are in TD.  You take the boat port to TD and then swim two islands over and they are blue and light blue mixed all nicely in one spot for you.  Not sure how a warrior would pull them though - I used paci.  But it was a great task for a cleric - one of my favorites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aumerle</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta agree with the original poster here about tasks and the casual player.<br />
<br />
Mission #1:<br />
<br />
First task I tried sent me to find the dragon head in SF<br />
after dying to some yellow/red con mobs at a -different- but -identical- looking dragon head to the one I eventually found to complete that step, I got step #2 - go to the first bridge inside Veeshan's Peak.<br />
<br />
Umm.. yeah right like i have the key to VP.  Like *any* casual player has the key to VP.<br />
<br />
Left that one.<br />
<br />
Mission #2:<br />
<br />
Kill 10 Chromodracs (sp?) in SF.  Ok was thinking they'd be green to my 61 warrior so no problem.  Well, they were light blue so the fights wore me down somewhat and not only that but they dispell like crazy so I had no buffs left by the time the mob was at 50 percent.  Net result I got tired of ending up either having to run and zone without killing anything because of the large amount of adds in SF<br />
or actually finishing off a mob with me at like 15% health and having to BW/sit around forever to heal up with a lot more still to go, so I logged in my shaman and 2 boxed it.  Even cheating it took me almost 2 hours (this was a short mission btw)...  But hey at least it was easy to find the Chromodracs.<br />
<br />
Mission #3:<br />
<br />
So I'm thinking I'll give it another shot.  Never been terribly fond of SF so I run down to Dreadlands to get the mission from there thinking I can avoid SF and maybe enjoy the task more.  I get sent to talk to a guy in FM, ok np don't mind running around a bit (in fact considering how these are supposed to be soloable by any class I honestly expected more running around than anything...), then got sent to BW to scout out the giant fort.  Did that.  Then - kill 10 greater warbone skeletons.  Ok.  Talk about tracker friendly quest here, not only would it have helped to have a sow castable class for all the running around but greater warbones were not easy for me to find in there.  I spent over an hour running around and found 3.  It was getting late and I didn't feel like spending another hour+ for like a blue of xp so I left the mission at that point.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
During all of that guildies were talking about missions that sent you into droga or HS as well... You can't even zone out of HS unless you get all the way to the end, so for me with no OT hammer, guess what, I gotta blow a gate potion charge to get out of there - droga is pretty much the same situation.  And is it really reasonable for a pure melee class to be able to solo their way to the right mobs they need to kill in those zones in a reasonable amount of time.  No heals, even light blues can take a bit to go through.<br />
<br />
I don't know for sure what I was expecting but honestly the missions seemed to me like they would be more appropriate for groups since different skills like tracking, sow, ports are kind of useful (oh wait maybe just druids tested em.. hehe).  Anyway I think I'll just grind xp in PoV instead.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">popped in to ding 66 and do a quick task tonight.<br />
<br />
started by KC in dreadlands:<br />
<br />
1. run across zone to area with druid ring and hail another npc.<br />
2. kill 10 skyfire drakes in SFM.<br />
3. kill 10 wurms in SFM.<br />
4. loot 4 wurm meat from the wurms you kill.<br />
5. turn in wurm meat to an npc in SFM.<br />
**no time limit**<br />
<br />
115pp and 2% lvl66 xp.<br />
<br />
it would not be a problem for me to solo all of this. however without a friend of mine tracking the skyfire drakes for me and healing me it would have taken over four hours by my estimation. just the added time of finding roaming mobs and running instead of gating makes this particular task a VERY bad return on time invested imo. with FOUR hours to kill i'd be in a group grinding 70.<br />
<br />
there are many other types of tasks, some seemingly designed to be VERY quick. this one in particular had the tag &quot;medium&quot;. i'm guessing for medium amount of time to complete. i'm looking forward to reading more on other people's experiences with the task system, and knocking out a few more myself.<br />
<br />
with how many tasks they are said to have made, i'm certain there are a few &quot;1 hour or less&quot; ones out there, and if they net the same reward it would be a nice timekiller when my time is limited or i'm stuck waiting for something or can't get a group together. it beats the hell outta /gems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it would not be a problem for me to solo all of this. however without a friend of mine tracking the skyfire drakes for me and healing me it would have taken over four hours by my estimation. <br />
<br />
Agree with this, got this as the first task I tried, had found 7 skyfire drakes after about an hour and a half, then after I didn't see another one for half an hour, I went and got a different task to do some scouting, kill 10 matures chromodracs and get 4 chromodrac wings.  Finished the second task in about 1h 45m, during the time i killed all the chromodracs for the second task I still saw only 2 skyfire drakes for the first task.  Seemed to me that what was hapenning was everyone was killing the skyfire drakes and mainly skyash and skycinder drakes were repopping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalem</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only level 26 here so my tasks had me going to lower level zones.<br />
<br />
The first task I selected was a medium and it had me heading out to Misty Thicket.  From misty I was suppose to go to the bottom floor of Runney Eye. OK, I'm thinking that won't be too much of a problem since only a few of the goblin types scowl at me.<br />
<br />
After making my way to the bottom I get a message that I've completed a step, now the objective changes to killing 10 of the goblins in there.  But not just an goblin.  I have to look out for the head choppers (something to that effect).  Now I'm fairly twinked...actually really twinked up the wazzu.  I can take on multiple dark blues to a point.  I was able to single out two of those goblins the others were grouped with too many others.   I ended up collecting a ball of goblins around me, little green fists pounding me, and goblins casting.  Even with twink gear, and Temperance I had to zone out.<br />
<br />
There's just no way a casual player can do that one within a reasonable amount of time solo.  Let alone a non twink.  I ended up abandoning that task.<br />
<br />
My second task was a short one.  It had me running from East Commons to West Commons, then Kithicor, and finaly East Karana.  Quite a bit of running, but there was no combat involved with the exception of what you pick up in agro.  The only danger there would be if someone wasn't aware of the undead presence in Kithicor during the night.<br />
<br />
I see tasks as a great way to get people to explore zones they may otherwise not be aware of (thinking of newer players here).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can invis out of droga.  Would be pretty rough getting out of HS without an OT hammer tho.  These do give people who can track a huge advantage.  Don't like that at all.  Of course if I wanted to do them I could just drag a ranger or druid bot around, but they shouldn't require you to 2-box a solo quest or take forever running randomly around Skyfire trying to find some rare mob.  The dungeon ones are probably more friendly to non-tracker types.  Skyfire sux.<br />
<br />
Once people are level 70 it should be very easy to form up a pickup raid on the shade and get VP keyed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, and the classes that can solo already can still do so with better reward than the task system.<br />
<br />
I was looking at the Dreadlands task bastard last night.  Kill 10 krup shaman and collect 4 flowers in Sebilis.  Sure I could do that solo on my warrior, but no way that I could do this during my lunch hour at work for example.  The point of these were to be for when you only had a short amount of time online to whip something out solo.  Quarter of my lunch period will just be getting to the place from the task master.  There certainly won't be a nice even 10 krup shaman spawned and ready for me when I'm killing through, and it's what?... a 20 to 30 minute respawn in that place?  As a warrior I can only fight so far in before the mobs will get too big to handle without a healer.  Figure in downtime sitting on my butt waiting for HPs, and this is a joke for the 1% exp 56pp the dude is gonna give me for it.<br />
<br />
As a hybrid, it will be a lot easier, no downtime at all in this particular task I was given at level 66.  The mobs hit weak, so lifetaps or self heals will keep them at 100% health the entire time, regening the mana faster than they use it while fighting these easy.  But they still could get bottle necked by the spawn times and random type of mob spawning instead of the krup shaman they need, to get this done in a timely manner as well.<br />
<br />
My SK friend can solo non-stop like above in tier1 and 2 PoP zones against actual dark blue, exp giving mobs, getting far more exp than the task gives him in a lot less time... so why would he bother doing this task for 1% exp and 56 plat?<br />
<br />
They're time consuming with a laughable reward for us pure melee, and a complete waste of time and a joke to hybrid/casters who could be doing something far better with their time.</div></div><hr />

They're just quests without the reward /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stommper</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just noticed this post from a Sony Developer back during beta...<br />
<br />
There are currently no tasks that originate in or send you to the Plane of Fire or any other Planes of Power zones (except for Knowledge and Tranquility).<br />
<br />
The rest of the tasks that exist are well suited for anyone to solo. The way we've set them up allows a Warrior or a Rogue just as much chance to complete a task as a Wizard or a Bard, including those tasks where you're forced to kill NPCs.<br />
<br />
We will continue to look at and adjust those tasks that prove more difficult than we have intended them to be, and as always if there are issues with a task, you can send a /feedback or a /bug on the task.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your patience in working with this. We've created over 3,000 tasks that allow players a chance to spend an hour or two and still gain meaningful progress, while some may take as little as 30 minutes to complete. Whether you're a casual gamer who only has a couple hours a night to play, or someone who just wants something to do while you're waiting for a raid, we're confident that you'll find the task system fits your play style. <br />
<br />
It will be an on-going effort to ensure that off-beat tasks are fixed or changed to be more in line with their intended difficulty.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Jason<br />
<br />
Umm, right. Still got lots of work to do guys before these can be solo'd by warriors and rangers, in my opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya know, I had originally thought that the people complaining here about SOE being out of touch with the players were just disgruntled.  However, with the release of OoW, I have to say that those &quot;disgruntled&quot; people have a point.<br />
<br />
I was really looking forward to the task system, because living in Korea, it's very difficult for me to get a decent XP group between 4am and 9am EST (which is 5pm-10pm in my time zone).<br />
<br />
What a disappointment.  Being level 58, I have to go to OT or DL to get a task.  No problem, right?  So I headed to OT to get a task, and voila, the first taskmaster is located in the enclave just west of the PoK book.  I'm KoS to pretty much everything in there.  No problem, I'll throw up invis and stroll on in.  BAD IDEA.  Not only would the task master not give me a task, but I got raped by all the mobs which aggroed me when I tried to request one.  Short run to the PoK book and still didn't even make it.<br />
<br />
That put a bad taste in my mouth right from the start.  So I head to DL to try and get a task from a taskmaster out there.  Run run run run for what seems like an eternity, only to find the path to the task master suddenly plummeted into the ground.  I thought maybe it's just going through the hill, so I ran around the hill...where does the path lead me?  Back around the hill again, and right into the damn ground.  Take a deep breath.  All right, let's try a different task master.  Run run run run, SAME FUCKING THING.  Sorry for the language, but can we say frustrating?<br />
<br />
I've pretty much written off the task system and I didn't even get to START one.  To hell with it.  Maybe I will look into WoW when it comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what it sounds like the task system is exactly what I thought it would be.  Too time consuming or difficult for pure melees for the reward and a total waste of time for solo classes.<br />
<br />
I can get about 2 AAs per hour in an average group.  It takes me 0-30 minutes to find an average group or I just log off.  For a solo task system to be worth bothering with I would expect at least 25% of the reward I could get for grouping.  That means 1 AA every 2 hours and at worst a net cost of zero plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benlin</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hopeful that the Task system would link in with LDON, in that you would get a small amount of LDON points.<br />
<br />
I think that would add more interest, than the rather bland rewards available now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got a chance to try out the task system as a 65.  OMG IT SUCKS.  <br />
<br />
I go to dreadlands and pick up a task.  The one I picked sends me to nurga.  I think, &quot;Oh, not a problem! I've got clicky invis BP!&quot;  I get there and then I'm informed that I need to kill 10 death callers... Ok, HOW THE HECK am I supposed to get a single from his buddies surrounding him.  After running for my life to droga a couple times, I abandon the task. <br />
<br />
Did I learn my lesson? Noooo.  I went BACK to dreadlands (I LOVE my selo horse, as frivolous a purchase as he was) and decide to pick out another task.  The one I draw?  Swabbing the deck.  I run/swim myself out to the appropriate island in TimDeep and proceed to carefully pick out and pull swabbies.  I find myself with 9 killed yet still needing 3 blades.  Time taken to do that?  Over an hour.  I got disgusted after having zone for my life (again).  Abandoned that task.<br />
<br />
Still wanting to see what these tasks were like, I head to Overthere...  I pick a mission having to go to skyfire and kill 10 chomodracs.  Well, after 30 minutes and ONE crhomo killed, I got disgusted of running around looking for them and abandoned the task.  My druid could have easily completed these tasks and not had nearly as much frustration in the process.  However, I get better exp for time spent charming crap in plane of Nightmare. =/<br />
<br />
I don't see HOW these tasks are SOLOABLE for NON elemental pure melees classes!  Whoever designed them either decided only casters were going to do these tasks or that all the melee were bringing a 2nd box healer with them.  If I want to 2 box, I'll head off into my spot in PoJustice or Veksar, OKAY?  When I wanna solo, that means ONE CHARACTER!  The time taken to even get close to finished on these tasks is rediculous.  In the time I was running around on the stupid errands, I could have formed a group and gotten much better exp or plat for my troubles.  These tasks are a slap in the face to melee classes, as far as I am concerned!!  <br />
<br />
I am one very PISSED OFF customer, at the moment.  They need to retune these and retune them NOW.  Oh, and hide the crackpipe from the person doing retuning, PLEASE??  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benlin</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I might join you in your &quot;Pissed off customer&quot; status...<br />
<br />
I decided to do a Task from E.C with my 51 Druid, with 65 warrior helping.  I got the Task called the &quot;Silver wings&quot; (I think thats close to the name).<br />
<br />
I had to go to lavastorm and talk to an NPC, who told me to kill 10 Imp Guardians, thats a slightly hard task for a 51 Druid imo ...  Anyways the text that went with the request made no sense at all, I need to copy it down and post it.  Its just super dumb.<br />
<br />
After completing the Task, and the other steps (one of which was kill 10 sonic bats, who were holding important information or something !!!!!), I went to the same NPC to get another all he would give me was the same named Task.<br />
<br />
So I tried another NPC Task Master in E.C, when I hailed her she told me to piss off because she hates Druids.  Then when I entered the keyword Task, she still offered me a Task ????  And it was the same damn one !!!!!<br />
<br />
From this one experience, there seems to be little if ANY real thought put into these Tasks.  They don't make sense, and I am not asking for some super slick RPG storyline to each Task, but at the same time I don't want a storyline thats the complete opposite i.e something that just makes no sense at all.</div></div><hr />

Did the same task with my 44 ranger. Camped the 2 bloodgills at the Veksar entrance. Couldn't have done it without enduring breath, though. Got 2 gold bubs about and the same coin.<br />

Second one was from EC. Had to 'explore' a room with a well in it  in Sol A. had no idea where it was. Camo'd and went a lookin. Never found it and camo dropped, figured I better high tale it outta there. Zoned out with 7% health left.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

So during the intermittant playtime I have completed two tasks at 65.<br />
<br />
First task was in OT and involved some running around in OT and then TD and then finally killing 10 Gunthak Swabbies and looting 4 fine steel rapiers which then had to be turned in on the opposite side of TD.  The swabbies are lt blue cons at 65 and the ones around the outside of the Island are pretty easily single pullable.  I did have a couple of double pulls trying pull from the middle of the island.   It took about 12 swabbies plus a few extra of the non swabbie types to get the 4 piercers.<br />
<br />
The second one was off a DL taskmaster and involved running to Nugra and Killing 10 death callers.  As all of the mobs that spawn in that area are lt blue and do not assist against a level 65.   I used a gnome vanishing device to get down to the Droga ZO and on the way I noticed that the 3 mobs up in the tunnel were all death callers, so I pulled them to the bend just before the two spawn guarding the ZO.  (no they didn't agro) Then having created a base of opperation I pulled death calllers from the surrounding branches.   I never once had an add even when pulling past other npc's.  I was stuck using Incite as I forgot to make more arrows before I left, so somebody with a decent range bow would probably have an easier time pulling then I did.   I got all 10 within 3 or 4 spawn cycles.   <br />

While I don't see them as the total waste others have posted in this thread.  Lt blue solo exp is pretty sucktastic.  When you factor in a 4% normal exp kicker upon completion each task was worth about 6% normal exp and I figure break even (after invis and gate cost) or a slight loss of plat.   Both of these quests could easily have been done in a few hours of 10-15 minute increments by a warror in fact I didn't do either in a single session.  They are definately not worth the time when a decent group is available.  The most annoying/frustrating part was running around in out of the way zones far from port books.<br />

For one, you have the non elemental, mostly ornate geared warriors and then you have the potime, GoD equipped warriors wanting to try them them too.<br />
<br />
If you make it easy enough on the ornate geared warrior (for a decent reward), then the time/GoD warrior is going to fly through them. But if you make them a challenge for the time/GoD warrior you're going to screw the ornate geared warrior out.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I didn't expect too much considering the circumstances. If they could determine what missions you get based on flags, or current HP/AC or something (and the rewards be a good 5% exp) then it could definitly be a good thing, and a good alternative to grouping when you only have an hour.<br />
<br />
This system had a lot of potential, and I hope that it doesn't get put on a back burner and something get's done to tune it.  Some little miniscule fix might be all that's between this and sitting on your ass for an hour and then logging off.</div></div><hr />

They could stand to redefine short at the very least.</div></div><hr />

I played a Warrior in the recent stress test, and I can tell you one thing ... Warriors fucking ROCK.  I also played a Warlock, which is supposed to be one of the most gimp classes currently, and it was still hella fun.<br />
<br />
SoE just needs to bite the bullet and retune the pure melee's and make them a viable solo class ... massively improve mitigation and avoidance, and drastically improve HP regen while not in combat.<br />
<br />
Edit:  And drastically decreash the refresh timer on our discs.  I tell ya, after seeing the WoW Warrior it's damn frustrating to come back to the gimp-ass EQ version.</div></div><hr />

Got one from DL taskmaster that had me go scout the giant fort in BW. Was next sent to skyfire to kill 10 elder wyvern, and collect 4 lava off them. Was only myself and someone duoing looking for cleric epic shards there. In an hour and 20 minutes I only found 2 of the Wyverns i needed and no lavas. Started to kill random things hoping to spawn some wyverns, but no luck. Also, was getting negative Ring of Scale faction hits for killing there so I bailed.<br />
<br />
This is not something I will try again unless it is changed significantly. Was just kinda depressing, as I had high hopes for this being a fun way to kill short amounts of EQ time and stilll get some experience/benefit. As it stands now I can't see it being productive to many people.</div></div><hr />
