<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is about to start raiding in VT (/happily waves goodbye to Ssra) and I'm trying to get a plan together for equipment upgrades, rather than trying to decide on the spot when something drops.<br />
<br />
I could use a little advice... I'm looking at probably only picking up one or two drops as VT is highly contested on my server (and I want to spend my dkp wisely).  So, I'm looking for what will give me the biggest benefit from VT, and won't be quickly superceded by PoP drops (to give you an idea where we're at there - we'll kill Agnarr on our next attempt... Mith Marr will probably die to us very soon... we kill terris thule, tallon and vallon easily, etc...)<br />
<br />
These are a couple of the things I was considering from VT... but would love to hear some thoughts from the board as well.  My magelo is in my signature file and is up to date.<br />
<br />
Boots of Kylthorn.  The 100 HP is a big upgrade for me, and +8% riposte seems like a pretty hefty boost defensively.  The manaskin clicky would probably come in handy occasionally, but wouldn't sell me on the boots.<br />
<br />
Cloak of Destruction.  My current cloak is a joke.  This has nice AC and HPs, and extra attack from vengeance would be nice.<br />
<br />
Umbracite Bracer or Cloudy Mark (whichever came available first) to replace my (don't laugh) silver chitin wristband.<br />
<br />
Are there other drops in VT that fill in holes in my gear better?  Are there comparable drops in pre-elemental pop that I could substitute for some of these?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">bah. i'm in elementals and i still wear warlords bracer / silver chitin.<br />
<br />
my recommendations for VT stuff:<br />
<br />
-legs: leggings of fiery might (best there is till elemental greaves), fairly common drop<br />
<br />
-back: cloak of icy shadows, or cloak of the black wind (if you want cloak haste).<br />
<br />
-arms: cerulan sleeves OR umbral vambraces. i'd get whatever drops first, 35hp loss but 25ac gain on umbral. cerulan are very rare, umbral are not.<br />
<br />
-head: helmet of shadow. or if your luck is down or you think your guild is about to leave VT soon, get the first circlet of disguise that drops.<br />
<br />
-wrists: umbracite bracer(sp) the 38ac 75hp one, or cloudy mark as you said, and bracer of darkness. 100hp on the latter, but has a focus effect. since you're DKP, screw the casters, not like they're lacking focus items from VT.<br />
<br />
-shoulder: shroud of vigor. this is extremely rare, and if you don't want to wait for it, get the spiked shoulderpads.<br />
<br />
-rings: ring of the crimson bull, not sure about the second ring (RotCB isn't lore though ;))<br />
<br />
-belt: belt of mastery. quite rare, but basically the only useful belt from VT iirc.<br />
<br />
-face: crimson runed mask from aten (probably high DKP), or cloudy steel mask which is less rare and probably less DKP.<br />
<br />
-range: orb of satisfaction, or orb of evasion. i'm pretty sure the first isn't that rare combared to the evasion one. or you could take an eye of darkness if you're desperate. but since you're about to kill agnarr, i would personally (and I did) wait for longbow of the stormcaller.<br />
<br />
-neck: gorget of superiority.<br />
<br />
-ears: earring of eradication and earring of battle ;) or earring of vigor as it's probably much less DKP.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't really say what will give you the most &quot;bang for the buck&quot; looking at your current gear, but you already got good helmet, ear, gauntlets, belt and BP. so basically get rid of everything else first is my advice.<br />
<br />
if you're not going to stay in VT long, it's just a matter of getting the stuff that gives you the most HP/AC upgrade each drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Silver steel cloak off aten blobs is probably best ac backwise you gonna touch in a long long time, and aten mask for the AC again will last you a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Silver steel cloak is... just about the rarest item from VT. either they removed the drop and replaced it with cloak of the black wind, or it's intended to be that rare. out of 35+ aten blob kills, we have gotten zero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Any AHR loot is going to last you a long time. I would go for AHR loot in this order:<br />
<br />
Talisman of Vah Kerrath<br />
Gloves of the Crimson Sigil<br />
Earring of Eradication<br />
Crimson Runed Mask<br />
Great Shadow Platemail<br />
<br />
Good legs are also a pain to get so Leggings of Fiery Might are pretty nice to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In 25 clearings we never saw a silver steel cloak, so I wouldn't bet on that one. <br />
<br />
AHR loot lasts forever, I'd suggest picking up any of her melee stuff you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Silver Steel Cloack was removed from the game when VT was revamped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your mileage may vary, but for me, spiked shoulderpads &gt; shroud of vigor.<br />
<br />
Sure it has 35 less hp but it has 10 more AC, Vengeance 3 over invigor (cool effect) and 10 on all resists over 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">BP of Speed will last a very long time and free up other slots that may be needed for haste.  The legs of firey might will last a long time as well since PoP offers minimal leg slot upgrades (umbracite legs are good ac as well though a bit less hps).  Belt of mastery owns too, that should get long mileage unless you plan on a PoE belt from Peregrin.  Other than that, any jewlery you can pick up will have good long lasting utility as well.  My personal favorite however is the gloves of the crimson sigel, the extra aggro from a 65dd/stun is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for all the responses!<br />
<br />
Hope to take advantage of your suggestions soon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">my advice, at least, what im doing.  buy jewelry slot items, and perhaps, wait for a BP.  <br />
<br />
Save all your other slots for Raex's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sshaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for posting this, I was thinking of this exact same situation, as the guild I'm in has cleared VT once, and are going back soon. (We're on a rotation with a couple of other guilds).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I too am in the same situation, we just killed Emperor last night and I am looking to spend my DKP wisely as well.  Here is a link of my Magelo, it is current and up to date.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">weve been emp keyed 6 months now and havent seen but one Aten which was pickup 4am raid with 25 peeps boxed (((( id love to spend some DKP on aten mask, ear and other jewelry in VT. All depends on your server, we have our spanish guilds and german ones who have VT clean 2 hours after server up *(which btw are EP flagged and still come to VT ).we have maybe gotten 15-20 named as a guild in there in past 6 months</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Anyone have some advice on some gear I should watch out for in Vex Thal, on DKP system atm.  Not sure how long were gonna hang out there so I wanna make the right decisions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Solanthious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you're a bit hp heavy. 8900ish I personally wouldnt lose the 20 / 30 ac for the hp on cerulean sleaves or leggings of Firey Might, but thats just my opinon. <br />
<br />
GSP, Talisman, Mask maybe one or 2 of the earrings around. Wait for Raex, let the other classes get some of the lower ac gear.</div></div><hr />
