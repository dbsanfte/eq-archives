<br />
I play a wood elf warrior.  It's not exactly a common combination, but it's not as rare as it used to be.  Back when you could do /who all counts, we were slightly more common than gnomes, who were the absolute rarest warriors around.<br />
<br />
I'm never anon or role.  This is OK, nobody ever bugs me for buffs.<br />
<br />
That's the important bits.  Now on to the rant.<br />
<br />
I log in and put /lfg up.  10 minutes later, I get a tell to come to PoV.  This is fine by me,  I'm not picky - especially getting a group that quickly.<br />
<br />
I get to the group, there's an Ele+ warrior already in the group, and I quickly discover than he's got 1400 HP on me.  I decide that I'll just play at being DPS, and spent the next couple of hours beating on the backs of things and occasionally offtanking when we get doubles.<br />
<br />
He leaves.  People get nervous.  I'm not sure why.  Some &quot;hey, are we still going to be able to do this?&quot; kinds of things go through groupsay.<br />
<br />
Druid in the group says &quot;It's OK, I have a 65 war inc&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Now, I'm all for two warriors in a group, but the way she says it makes me ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, not to be rude but what class did you all think I was?&quot;<br />
<br />
there's a bit of a pause.<br />
<br />
Then the apologies start.<br />
<br />
Apparently, most of this group has decided that I'm:<br />
<br />
a) a ranger.<br />
<br />
b) a BAD ranger, since I've been meleeing instead of using my bow and I haven't buffed the group even ONCE in two hours.<br />
<br />
Some days you just can't win.</div></div><hr />

I play a vah shir Warrior. I get the So who is the Main tank questions all the time even when I had my epics equiped. <br />
<br />
Ive been asked ( after grouping with this same person for an hour plus and tanking) &quot; Why the hell dont you use your pet?&quot;<br />
<br />
And when i get asked for BST crack I just emote<br />
<br />
Cateire bends over and shows you the crack of his WARRIOR ass<br />

I get the Wow you tank pretty good for a bst complements which always brighten up my day</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stangely enough, they have pretty much stopped since I got class title.<br />
<br />
This was after I had 175 + AAs though, so I feel your pain.<br />
<br />
I was once MT in a group in HoH temple type place and the druid healer started CH's on me at 90 % health... after a few I asked why and he said having a ranger MT made him nervous. <br />

I've been forced to wear far too much &quot;leather&quot; recently, due to dru/mnk/bst armor graphic &quot;issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I do understand where some of you are coming from. But let me clarify this:<br />
<br />
1- NO I will not SoW you.<br />
<br />
2- NO I will not Port you.<br />
<br />
3- NO I will not Po9 you.<br />
<br />
4- NO I will not heal you.<br />
<br />
I WILL HOWEVER, Feign Death and let that train KILL YOU.<br />

Being Iksar, I of course have the ability to FD.  It is a natural thing that all Iksar have, not just monks, or so people think.  What gets me is people ask me to split mobs while I am dual wielding two swords and have Veteran AA title.  So, I go up to split, bring back multiple mobs, and I FD.  Few minutes later I see my group mates standing next to me at my bind point and they ask why I didn't FD.  That generally gets their attention rather quick and finally realize what class I am.  If only they would take the time to do a /whotarget and people could avoid a death.</div></div><hr />

I was in a LDoN group the other day, zoned out for split and individual saw me wielding a Windblade of all things and they asked me to Virtue them.  Trust me, the amount of people who either:<br />
<br />
A) Purchase their toon online and have no knowledge of the game<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
B) Don't take the time to verify which class you are<br />
<br />
Is utterly amazing.<br />

BTW:  Cateire /smack XBen for me next time you see him.</div></div><hr />

I am the only dual weilding Shadow Knight in the game.  Or ... I am a Dark Elf Warrior.  What do y'all suppose most people think?<br />
<br />
This one time, at adventure camp, after the unsnared mob got away ... and the fellow asked in group &quot;Do we have any snarers?&quot;, I suggested that the druid may indeed have the spell.  The druid was silent, but I was asked if I couldn't snare.  I linked my silken whip (the one that says WAR and RNG on it ...).  I was the group snarer for the rest of the night.  The druid focussed on DoT'ing mezzes and generally ruining the name of every good druid out there.  It took a day to realize that it was probably assumed that I had that clinging darkness spell, and that none of them will group with &quot;that idiot SK&quot; again :p.<br />
<br />
I have also been asked why I don't summon my pet ... and even - often - for a SoW (that one blows my mind).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, people are just stupid.  I'm a dwarf warrior.  I never go /role or /anon.  I've been asked for TLs, ports, rez's, and SoW (all have happened at one point while duel wielding and in full plate armor).  Though, sometimes I do equip a spiny hammer (looks like cleric summoned hammer), and a shield, just out of boredom.</div></div><hr />

Ooo carp on a stick, I never tried that, and I wouldn't need the mask :p.  On top of which, judging by the number of bards I've tripped over who would *twist* one song ... I coulda pulled it off!</div></div><hr />

Well brother warr all I can say is that that was the moment when you should have said in group &quot;WTF I AM a warrior...why are you getting another one?&quot;.  Sure its rude but the bottom line is that if you don't draw the line folks will walk on over it.  You don't half to be uber to tank PoV and you should have had that job.<br />

Oh yeah I'm a half-elf for about 4 years now....very tired of the SoW requests when on CRs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like Kilaara said, I don't necessarily think that it has everything to do with your racial choice ( though some get it worse than others ) its just the countless morons that play this game :p.</div></div><hr />

I owe this to a warrior that was in my guild.  It is priceless to use.

Not anon or any of that. Guess lots just associate certain races and classes. I like putting up my shield that looks like the caster one from Tactics and then a CHoS and just playing along sometimes. It usually throws everyone off once I keep aggro for 3 or 4 rounds. Usually they get it after that. For the ones that are real clueless though I will keep up the act as long as they still don't get it. The longest I have went is an hour with a group thinking I was a bard with no songs but somehow getting aggro non stop, using /shield, and defensive. As an SK I have went for hours at a time before being figured out.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's my black &amp; red armor. Maybe it's the lifetap proc on the sword of the cryptkeeper that I use for DPS sometimes. Once (pre-Incite) someone made a comment about how they love having a shadowknight in the group (me) for the aggro control. Part of me wanted to say, &quot;OMG STFU I'm a warrior and don't you ever mistake me for a shadowknight!&quot; and another part of me was thinking, &quot;yeah i r teh l33t aggro machine.&quot; I just kept my mouth shut though and chuckled to myself.<br />
<br />
 Having someone compliment you on your aggro. $$<br />
 Letting them believe it for half an hour. $$$$<br />
 The look on their face when you /disc defensive on a bad pull. Priceless</div></div><hr />

Nine time out of then when you run into a wood elf, its a Ranger or Druid. Nine times out of ten when you run into a Barbarian, its a warrior. Nine times out of ten the Ogre is a Warrior, and WAY too many Iksar are monks. I play an Iksar warrior myself and I run into people all the time that dont even realize Iksar CAN be warriors.<br />
<br />
On the other hand this can work to your advantage, I raid a lot, and I often get left out of the tank rotation, when I /who the warriors in the MTO, sure enough 3 barbs and an ogre. Easy ride for me, I whip out the axe and DPS.<br />

And yes I often get mistaken for a monk or even a shaman.</div></div><hr />

Heh, pretty funny for sure - Though I can see how a n00b could be confused by all the acronyms in EQ.<br />

Step one is to get around to finishing the gnollslayer quest (final gnollslayer has two charges of shaman pet). Then I'm going to equip 2H blunt, grab a mushroom, some potions and a couple o' cheap clicky items, go /anon, get a group as a shaman. Once in the group I'm going to insist that I'm a battleshaman (&quot;It's a new AA. See? I'm wearing plate&quot;) and that the chanter should slow while I tank.<br />
Give the people what they want, I say. Why should I continue to insist on this absurd fantasy that all I am is a warrior, when it's so obvious that I'm really a plate-wearing shaman?</div></div><hr />

Thanks ... it crossed my mind driving to IKEA the other day (it's a dull trip) that that might be it - I'd been racking my brain trying to figger out what buff I had forgotten to harass my clerics for :D.  I'm too used to seeing *x% extended* instead of *EE4*.  I've never, ever seen the acronym used in the game (nor anything similar for the other foci effects).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, most clerics only use that rez under dire emergencies.<br />
<br />
Only time I have seen it used, was in a LDoN, chanter died, time was close, so the cleric did a 100% rez on her, since it doesnt cause rez effects or you to lose your mana.  She zoned in, mezzed two adds and slowed them then looted.<br />
<br />
However, using that rez on some random idiot beggar isnt going to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, last night, on my IKSAR shaman....wearing a combo of PLATE and CHAIN I was asked for KEI...so I cast Acumen and Primal Essence, then sent a tell back to the moe-ron, and told him thats as close to KEI as he was going to get from a SHAMAN...he said &quot;Thx bro&quot; then gave me 15p....which I declined of course...I figured maybe he could use it to buy himself a clue.<br />
<br />
This from a level 51 wizzie with what looked like 'average' gear....ie, he had other character(s) higher than 51.</div></div><hr />
