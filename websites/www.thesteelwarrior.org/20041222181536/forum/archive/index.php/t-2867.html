<br />
Riposte damage = (137 * .517) * 450.5 =  31908.5<br />
...<br />
 <br />
<br />
You swung 2816 times, of which 137 (4.9%) were riposted by the NPC.   Also, of those 2816 swings, you hit 1455 times (51.7%).  <br />
<br />
But just because YOU hit 51.7% of the time doesn't mean the NPCs have the same hit ratio.  So you can't multiply 137*51.7% to estimate how many of the NPC's ripostes connected.  In fact, you didn't include how many swings the NPC missed in your numbers, so there's no way to tell exactly what percentage of the NPC's swings hit.  <br />
<br />
All we know is that the NPC damaged you 243 times.  But I can't see how to tell from your numbers how many of those were straight swings and how many were ripostes, nor can I tell the hit/miss ratio for the NPCs.   <br />
<br />
For example, you swung 2800 times, so for all I know the monster also swung 2800 times including ripostes and only hit 243 of them.  If that were the case the NPCs were only connecting 9% of their swings, which means only 12 ripostes would have connected and the remaining 231 hits were from normal swings.  That would mean only about 5% of the damage you took would be from ripostes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What would be helpful here is if you actually can parse out from the data how many of the 243 hits you took were directly from ripostes.  It would also be nice if you could say how many times the NPCs missed you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, you're right.  I'll take another look at the parse tonight.  I threw this together while in Tier 5, so I was half paying attention between deaths to RZ and Inny.<br />
<br />
I also messed up the total # of swings that I took by not adding Riposte/Dodge/Parry/Block #'s to the # of swings.  This has been adjusted.  I'll have to get the NPC hit% etc later tonight when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I fixed the NPC Hit% and added the NPC misses on me, plus my parries, dodges, ripostes.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The missing information is how much of the time you were actually tanking. You say that 100% of the time you were tanking or in front of the mob, but there is a huge difference between the 2. When you are in front of the mob, but not tanking, 100% of the damage is riposte damage. Any time that you spent not tanking, but in front of the mob is going to artificially increase the % of the DPS from riposte.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cool stuff, thanks.  I'm not too surprised at the results, since I'm assuming the monsters were significantly Slowed.  You got about eight swings for every swing they had.  That alone massively increases the proportion of riposte hits to normal hits.  If you assume they were 75% slowed, for instance, then unslowed they'd have gotten four times as many hits, and so would only account for about 9% of the damage you took.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting post, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also posted this same parse in the &quot;ambidex thread&quot; currently on the front page here, but my results were similar with a very high percentage of my damage taken being riposte damage.<br />
<br />
(For this parse I was in BoT upper CY fighting the Stormrider bees and I was tanking the whole time)<br />
<br />
Gartuff Level 65 Warrior all defensive AAs maxed<br />
Number of Fights: 37<br />
Total damage Taken: 165,714<br />
Average Stormrider hit (not kick or bash) damage: 293.65<br />
Number of slash attacks made by me: 6047<br />
Number of kicking attacks made by me: 245<br />
Number of times my attacks were riposted: 424<br />
Mob hit rate on me: 50.19%<br />
Average mob dps against me: 47.48 dps<br />
Max mob hit: 555<br />
Min mob hit: 162<br />
<br />
So Using this we can derive the following<br />
<br />
Times I was hit by a riposte: 213 (424 * 50.19%)<br />
Total damage I took from ripostes: 62,547 (213 * 293.65)<br />
Percent of damage I took that was from ripostes: 37.7% (62,547 / 165,741)<br />
DPS I took from ripostes: 18.01 dps (47.78 dps * 37.7%)<br />
Mob riposte rate: 6.7% (424 ripostes / (6047 slashes + 245 kicks))<br />
<br />
So in conclusion against a mob with a max hit of 555 I took 37.7% of my damage from the mob riposting my attacks. This seems impressive, but when you convert this number to dps, my ripostes were only helping the mob do an additional 18 dps to me</div></div><hr />

<br />
normally on a mob like mithaniel marr, if you are trying to live out of defensive, the critical point of course is when he flurries you. if he gets in a flurry + riposte + decent proc dmg = dead tank without some super healing. <br />
<br />
2h just means you are less likely to have an extra riposte hit for 2k+ dmg when he flurries so odds of living are higher. depends on numbers of course, if you got several tanks to plow through its not a big deal, next one can pop defensive and take over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
These parses are the beginning of figuring this out.  Right now myself and others are putting up some good parses of dual wield against different xp mobs in PoP.  The 2nd step is to put up some parses of using two handers against xp mobs and compare the difference in damage taken from ripostes between the two.  Frankly I think these parses are pretty damn interesting.  Before I actually parsed it out I never knew that I took 30-40% of my damage in BoT from mobs riposting my attacks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok lets see :<br />
<br />
 Riposte RATES <br />
<br />
Assuming a bash/slam can be riposted.<br />
A hostile action is an action which can lead to a mob riposting.<br />
<br />
If i understood correctly you made 893 hostile actions<br />
(Hit + Miss + Riposte + Bash)<br />
Those 893 hostile actions had as a result 21 ripostes<br />
21/8.93 =2.35%  So PoT Tier 1 Trash has a 2-3% riposte rate<br />
<br />
If i understood correctly the mobs made 459 hostile actions<br />
(Hit + Miss + Riposte + Bash)<br />
Those 459 hostile actions had as a result 51 ripostes<br />
51/4.59 = 11.1  So  Splaktar has a 11.1% riposte rate.<br />
<br />
11% riposte rate !! holy shit !! And thats without double riposte ??<br />
<br />
Either i got something wrong, or you got very lucky, or the parse if erronous.<br />
11% riposte rate seems unreal to me.<br />
<br />
 Riposte DMG <br />
<br />
Total DMG taken (including ripostes) : 95016<br />
So 244 hits + 21 ripostes (so 265 hits) = 95016 dmg<br />
<br />
So DMG Without ripostes = 95016 * 244 /  265 = 87486<br />
DMG by ripostes = 95016 * 21 / 265 = 7530<br />
<br />
So out of the 95016 dmg you took :<br />
- 87486 originated from normal swings<br />
-7530 originated from ripostes<br />
<br />
7530/95016 = 0.0792 Thus ripostes = 7.9 % of the DMG you took<br />
<br />
Another important thing is riposte dmg increase :<br />
DMG taken in a ZERO riposte world = 87486<br />
DMG taken in the REAL world = 95016<br />
95016/87486=1.086 = 8.6%<br />
<br />
Going from a ZERO riposte world to a REAL world will increase<br />
the DPS you take by 8.6%<br />
<br />
 Conclusion <br />
<br />
First i do not trust Splaktars own ripost numbers (11% is way too high)<br />
Secondly if i didnt make comprehention errors on his posts we can conclude<br />
<br />
- PoT Tier 1 mobs riposte rate is at 2.5%<br />
<br />
- Only 7.9% of the DMG taken by Splaktar was due to ripostes<br />
<br />
- Going from a ZERO riposte to a 2.5% riposte rate <br />
   world only increased the DPS taken by 8.6%<br />
<br />
- The most you can hope to achieve by going 2H vs Fast Dual<br />
(like BoW/Sews  vs  SoD/HG is a 2-6% decrease in parsed DPS)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps : Dont forget ...<br />
Going from 80 to 100 = 25% increase &amp; Going from 100 to 80 = 20% decrease<br />
So increases/decreases cant be dealt in the same manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bash, slam, and kick can all be riposted.<br />
<br />
You didn't understand my post I guess...<br />
<br />
Let me try this with the right numbers...<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok lets see :<br />
<br />
Riposte RATES<br />
<br />
A hostile action is an action which can lead to a mob riposting.  This includes ALL swings (attacks) at a NPC: those which missed, hit, were riposted, were parried, were dodged, or were blocked.<br />
<br />
In the 2h parse I made 992 hostile actions.<br />
(Hit + Miss + Riposte + Bash + Parry + Dodge)<br />
Those 992 hostile actions had as a result 51 ripostes<br />
51/992 = 5.1% So PoT Tier 1 Trash has a ~5% riposte rate<br />
<br />
In the 2h parse the mobs made 510 hostile actions<br />
(Hit + Miss + Riposte + Bash + Dodge + Parry)<br />
Those 510 hostile actions had as a result 21 ripostes<br />
21/510 =  4.1% So Gurgel has a 4.1% riposte rate.<br />
<br />
4.1% riposte rate !! about normal...<br />
<br />
<br />
Riposte DMG<br />
<br />
Total DMG taken from hits (including ripostes, not including bashes, slams, or kicks) : 95016<br />
<br />
So 244 hits = 95016 dmg<br />
<br />
So DMG Without ripostes = 95016 - 10247 = 84769<br />
<br />
Riposte damage = (51 * .516) * 389.4 = 10247<br />
<br />
So out of the 95016 dmg you took :<br />
- 84769 originated from normal swings<br />
- 10247 originated from ripostes<br />
<br />
If you want a % of total damage taken that was from ripostes then you need: Riposte Damage / Total Damage = % of Total Damage taken from Ripostes.<br />
<br />
10247/95016 = 0.0108 Thus ripostes = 10.8 % of the DMG you took<br />
<br />
Another important thing is riposte dmg increase :<br />
DMG taken in a ZERO riposte world = 84769<br />
DMG taken in the REAL world = 95016<br />
<br />
Not sure that this forumla is really valid: (Total Damage taken / Damage taken w/o Ripostes) - 1 = % Damage increase from ripostes<br />
<br />
95016/84769=1.12 = 12%<br />
<br />
Going from a ZERO riposte world to a REAL world will increase the DPS you take by 12%<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
I'll let you make your own conclusions at this point.  You would need to compare these numbers against the 1h numbers to be able to make any sort of conclusions.</div></div><hr />

You don't need to count the times that you riposte a mob attack, because those extra swings are already included in your &quot;swings with weapons&quot; in the total number of hostile actions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.) Duel welding increase riposte damage taken by about 10%?<br />
2.) 2 Handed Weapons decrease riposte damage taken by 10%?<br />
3.)  This theory only holds true on Tier 1/Tier 2 zone mobs or mobs that hit for under 2k?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Summary:<br />
<br />
Number of ripostes scales with the number of swings.<br />
<br />
If you swing twice as fast (38 delay versus 18) you get riposted twice as much.<br />
<br />
If you swing 2 weapons you get riposted twice as much (well, not exactly since DW check is not always successful).<br />
<br />
Getting hit for 2k 4 times as often (2 weapons, twice as fast) hurts a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khashik</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the riposte rate of a PoP mob is 5% (which is consistant with my observations in PoE), then comparing a Blade of War with a BF + BoC you would get the following number of riposte over a 10 min period:<br />
<br />
Assume: 100 percent haste and no Ambi, Ferocity, or Punishing Blade AAs. Double Attack = 60%, Dual Wield = 51.3% (these may be a little off)<br />
<br />
Blade of War 48 dam 32 delay<br />
600 swings<br />
30 Riposte<br />
<br />
BF 16 dam 20 delay, BoC 15 dam 20 delay<br />
1452 swings<br />
72 Riposte<br />
<br />
<br />
So with a dual wield set up similar to the above, you will take roughly 125% MORE damage from riposte when dual wielding vs BoW. So if a mob does 100 dps from ripostes when using a BoW, it wil do 225dps from riposte with the above dual wield setup.<br />
<br />
Can someone check my math and assumptions?<br />

Can someone check my math and assumptions? Your math is correct, but for the example you give of a mob doing 100dps from riposte only, the mob would have to be cranking out around 1000dps. A normal exp mob is only going to be doing around 150 TOTAL dps so riposte damage will scale from 15 DPS to 33.75 DPS, making your total taken DPS 168.75. Riposte damage is only significant on heavy hitters with huge DPS output.</div></div><hr />

In reality, an exp mob in Earth hits for an average of about 300-350, leading to about 8-10 dps from riposte with a 2 hander and 18-20 dps when dual weilding.<br />

<br />
Looks to me like riposte damage is still pretty significant, and still represents a pretty heavy burden to dual-weilders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajsy</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why don't they make ripostes work like procces, that is to be independant of the delay on the weapon. That would make dual wield so much more worthwhile to use.<br />
<br />
In practice that would mean that the lower the delay on your weapon the less chance for a mob to riposte. I think that is a very logical thing to make because it is harder(in reality) to parry(and riposte) someone that hits fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm I just thought of something here.  I think that SOME of our parsing is a bit inaccurate due to tactical mastery.   As we all know with tactical mastery trained up you still recieve extra hits from mobs due to ripostes, but you don't actually get the riposte message in your log.  This would cause us to under report the number of ripostes that we are recieving when doing these sort of parses.</div></div><hr />

The rate I parsed was 5% of all attacks riposte, regardless of using 1 hand or 2 handed weapons.<br />

The rate I parsed was 5% of all attacks riposte, regardless of using 1 hand or 2 handed weapons. The rate at which a mob (or player for that matter) will stay the same regarless of the speed of the attacks being used against it. But, even though the RATE stays the some, the # of ripostes goes up due to the # of attacks being significantly higher.</div></div><hr />
