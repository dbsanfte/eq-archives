If a plate class BP offers HP/MANA/AC/STR/STA/WIS/INT, the mana/wis/int does nothing for warriors.  Would something like this help warriors to regain a more solid HP/AC advantage?<br />

AA for Warriors, Monks and Rogues<br />
Turns 10, 25 and 50% of mana from gear into hitpoints.  Trainable at 62, 63 and 64.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">putting in more AA would be a bandaid at best.  AA are never going to fix the warrior vs pal/sk imbalance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're nuts if you wouldn't want an aa to convert +Manna to +Hps.  I'd kill for that.  Technically I guess I would have to huh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">An idea, but not a horribly good one. True, Furor has 1800+ mana on him, but AAs aren't going to fix the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why do Rogues and Monks need more HP?  The proliferation of HP to classes that aren't supposed to tank is one of the reasons why tanking is so screwed up today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldn't mind mana/wis/int on items to be changed into ac/hps/stam/str what have you. But I am against haveing to spend hard earned exp to get to do it when other classes do not have to do so to get the benifit of those stats right away or the benifit from ac/stam/hps.<br />
<br />
AA's are nice, but they can't be a replacement of actuall fixes to warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">then all warrior only items will become crap,<br />
<br />
everyone will want items with mana and int etc...<br />
<br />
theyll have to put mana on every item..<br />
<br />
etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealdidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AA would be a bandaid <br />
<br />
You're absolutely right, (along with everyone else who's making similar comments) but I have dreadful news.  For Sony, EQ = Money; AAs that are necessary = more /played time = more money.  Expect any meaningful, nonnerf fix that comes from Sony to be an AA or a quest.<br />
<br />
Why do Rogues and Monks need more HP? The proliferation of HP to classes that aren't supposed to tank is one of the reasons why tanking is so screwed up today.<br />
<br />
Monks and rogues need hp for survival purposes.  Though in retrospect, &quot;Smart mitigation&quot; (which seemed like a good idea because it gives less to hybrids / casters) should probably be warrior or warrior+knight only.  Nontank classes get plenty of AC from mudflated gear.<br />
<br />
then all warrior only items will become crap<br />
I'm sorry, I thought the consensus was that Time items already did that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe but I don't find their (as in Monks and Rogues) comfort level a really compelling issue.  Although it is my opinion, I see too many Rogues and Monks with 7K HP.  I really don't understand why they need more.<br />
<br />
With that said, I don't mind Warriors having something like this to convert more &quot;useless&quot; stats to something meaningful.  Although I wonder, how much more HP/AC will it take to be &quot;useful&quot;?  Monster mitigation isn't the bonus it once was....</div></div><hr />
