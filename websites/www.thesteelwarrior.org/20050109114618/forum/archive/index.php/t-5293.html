<br />
Now, it looks like they're giving some of the last unique abilities that warriors have to berserkers, namely crippling blows, and evasive.<br />

Evasive:<br />

Saddened to see Sony still sees fit to take what used to be unique to the warrior class and keep giving them to other classes, time after time.</div></div><hr />

It seems the actual warrior is the Guardian. See, we have extended shield AAs and tons of bandaging stuff !<br />
<br />
Lets wait for GoD when NDA will no longer apply... until then we can't say if and how berserkers will walk on our own toes.</div></div><hr />

Pallys have been able to crip via a disc for a while now.  And while I really hope berserkers don't get evasive, we don't know if they actually will.  SOE often just copies things at first, then tweaks them later on.  Though they do seem to like giving our skills away.  I'm more discouraged by the fact that monks are getting versions of flurry and rampage, yet we are getting no new known aa skills.<br />
<br />
Another thing, wtf is with them and shamans.  Bsts, clerics, and druids already have an aa group heal, shamans don't.  Clerics, druids, paladins, and even rangers are getting direct heal upgrades, yet shamans aren't.  Instead, they get a worthless slow!  Seriously, shamans could use some lovin too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For 5 minutes, its a toy.  Who cares about uniqueness when its a crap skill that makes little difference in DPS?  Complaints about &quot;uniqueness&quot; are weird.  Is it because crippling hits are so precious to Warriors?  Or is it because crippling hits really are a crappy passive skill?  You would have a much better arguement complaining that crippling blows are ineffective instead of complaining that others have it.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't blink if they removed crippling hits from Holyforge.  They did nothing anyway.  The real reason anyone used it was because it altered the critical rate.  The fact that crippling hits showed up is an anachronistic effect of the Kunark era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's only versus one specific mob type, which is fairly rare. That does'nt really count in my book, I can't remember the last time I saw a paladin get cripples since leaving Ssra...<br />
<br />
Again, it's not JUST the cripples, it's also evasive. And it's also the track record of things that have been unique to warriors, given to the other classes.</div></div><hr />

Hrmmm...I guess it would matter what the mitiagtion lvl they have as a class/AA makeup underneath that.  Spike damage could still be fairly significant if they have really poor inherent mitigation...I'd envision that it would still be a tough case to advocate a Bers over a Warr in a MT role.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most other disciplines are not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Notice that Charge is also the same as Deadeye for Rogues.<br />
Furious is the same as Counteract for Rogues, and Whirlwind for Monks.<br />
Fortitude is the same as Nimble for Rogues, and Voiddance for Monks.<br />
etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Most discs are close to everyone elses.  Only a few are actually unique.  So since they are a pure melee I believe, it was always very likely they would get most.<br />
<br />
As far as uniqueness, every class should have the couple things that make them special imo, even the things that aren't that big of a deal.  It's what makes a class.  If all skills are given to everyone, even at varying levels, then to me the class gets boring.  Some skills of course should be shared, but there should be uniqueness for each class, to make it remain interesting.</div></div><hr />

They MUST outdamage us, they wear chain, lets see other classes that fill kinda that roll:<br />
<br />
Ranger-they will out-damage them handily, chain also&lt;OBSOLETE<br />
Monk-better armor, more damage than warrior (when monks bitch it is already to close)&lt;WAY OBSOLETE<br />
Rogue-they won't be able to keep up with a good rogue in damage&lt;STILL OKAY<br />
Knights-better armored than Berserkers&lt;OKAY<br />
<br />
Sony, try balancing the Classes you have, there is ZERO need for another class. That being said, I am playing an Ogre Berserker right off, and gonna rub it in the Rangers and Monks face I outdps/tank them!</div></div><hr />
