Fire mobs are my personal favorite though, set up shop in or near either castle and pull the soldiers and its real good real fast exp. The mephits in fire are pretty good too, they die really fast and you dont need too specific a group make up to rake the exp off them. I hate PoWater with a passion too intense to describe, I wont exp there period.</div></div><hr />

Only 2% per mob, but they die fast and there are more than enough mobs to support 2 or 3 groups easily. The 2nd castle mobs yield more exp per mob like PoE mobs do, but they hit harder and have more HP so you can't keep up the kill rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go deep down near Hydrotha and Offossa and pull the Regrua's or Hraquis. They give about 6% exp per kill, for a full group. The named give about 9-10%...<br />
<br />
You will need a strong group, though.<br />
<br />
My typical group down there is:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Bard<br />
Cleric<br />
Druid<br />
Shaman<br />
Rogue/Wizard<br />
<br />
Exp flies in.... AA every 40 or so minutes for a 6 man group isn't bad at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not really a group of 6 now is it? 2nd castle is better exp per mob, but in order to make the experience worthwhile you have to have additional DPS and a good slower.  The same can be said for PoW and PoE. The mobs are more exp each, but it takes a lot more to kill them. At these camps, to get the kind of exp you are talking about a slower is required and you have to have a lot of DPS to keep up a good kill rate. This means the group make up has to be very specific.<br />
<br />
If you have a less than optimal group, you can't beat the exp at fort 1. If you have a group that will do well in the harder camps, you can obiterate fort 1. Getting an AA in 40 min at a hard camp with a significantly higher possibilty of death does not compare to an easier camp with little chance of death that yeilds the same amount of net experience for less effort.</div></div><hr />

1 AA per 25-30, with the bst slowing &amp; tanking during 2 mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fire fist castle is probably the best xp if u have a kickass group.<br />
And the entire fort is yours. Just get a pull/addtank &amp; DPS<br />

The exp rate is slower and to optimize exp you need an 8 man group. How is that superior? Don't get me wrong, with the right group I like to exp in the 2nd castle as well - as a matter of fact, I get the best exp soloing there, but for any less than optimal group the 1st castle blows everything away. The haste cloaks you got have nothing to do with the camp you are at, any group with a tracker can watch for the named to pop and get haste cloaks and those 100hp range items.</div></div><hr />

Bang for the buck, you can't beat fort 1. Easiest mobs with the least amount of HP net you the biggest exp gain in a set time period. If I only have 90 min to grind out some AA, I am not going to crawl to Coirnav's chamber for the challenge, I am going to park myself where there a ton of fast dying mobs with little risk of death.</div></div><hr />

They only pop if youre killing the PHs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the obsidian battle sword comes from the mephit island, not castle.  He was saying castle 1 blows the mephits out of the water exp wise, this is very true.  Im still trying to convince a group to help me on the mephit islands for that damn sword at the sacrafice of a little exp, lol.  But I will agree with the others here, PoF is great exp, I usualy hunt at castle 1.  If fire is full, then I usually do earth, mobs are harder but you have the chance of collecting components for nice tradeskill items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonehammer</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mephit island exp isn't bad with a group really, the mobs lack HPs.  The motivation of a possible named spawn will keep you going.<br />
<br />
Overall I prefer pit2 in Fire, the yellow cons give 14-15% solo aa exp in testing vs. Castle1's 10-11%.  They do hit a bit harder however.<br />
<br />
Where is a safe point in Earth to exp?  Zone in is usually camped up.</div></div><hr />

The unresistable snare proc on the trees suck, though, and RC doesn't always cure it in one cast.<br />
<br />
PoF castle 1 usually yields the best exp per hour rate.  They hit mid 700s and have a little more hp than the earth mobs but they're easy to pull.  Plus it's fun to smack around your charmed guildmate ;)<br />
<br />
PoF castle 2 mobs are hitting 9xx and give more exp but more hp and sometimes you have downtime to let the cleric med if slow lands a bit late.  Exp is good but exp per hour usually falls behind castle 1.<br />
<br />
Deeper PoW mobs give similar exp as PoF castle 2 but they hit just as hard.  It's a nice zone but water rarely is melee friendly.. too many &quot;too far away&quot; &quot;cannot see target&quot; messages.<br />
<br />
PoA is a joke.. IZ is way too laggy for most people and sticking the splitter mobs on the first island pretty much prevents people from exping there, plus the 3-4 walker mobs in the halls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's true it was far easier, my cleric could nook instead of heal, most times on a slowed on incoming it was one heal every other pull.<br />
<br />
We were probably pulling to the wrong spot so this complaint is somewhat ignorable, pulls were a bit long cutting into overall xp.<br />
<br />
However, the part that makes this place suck beyond all belief was getting bugged 80% of the time after being charmed and needing to camp in order to fight again.  Does this happen to other people?  Is it fixable?  The issue was if a Diviner would charm me, MORE OFTEN THEN NOT, I couldn't use any skill or melee until I camped and came back in.  This combined with the fact tha the Diviner had two members of the group dictated simutaniously at one point makes Castle2 far better where you can ignore the charmers for the other mobs.  At Castle1 we were running out of things to kill if we didn't kill the charmers.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something on this?  How is dealing with charmers better then not?  I talked to some people on serverwide.thesteelwarrior, they didn't seem to be having the same charm bug that I was having.  Anyone thoguhts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Were you mesing your group members who got charmed? The only time this hits me is when our enc decides to mez me instead of letting charm break.<br />
<br />
The place I always pull in castle 1 is to the left of the steps. Coming from the zone in, you go down (assuming you lev to the top..) and once you get to the bottom stairs, there's 4 seperate huts, and a little Gazebo to your left. Go down the steps to the left, and along that back wall between the first and second pillars, directly behind that hut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, that was it :) I was mezzing myself.  Hmm guess will need to try root next time.  One time I didn't mez myself, I killed a guildmate duoing in another part of the field and didn't want to repeat that again :)<br />
<br />
I'll give it a try again but even when we didn't have charm issues the xp 'felt' slower but that's hardly scientific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I group in castle1 it is in the same spot Raaj descibed. You would be hard pressed to run out of mobs at that spot. You can quickly and easily pull all 4 huts, the mobs next to the stairs on obth sides of the castle, and all of the mobs up on the platform to the left of the camp spot. Over 30 mobs to pull just in that area, pulling 1 mob a minute would be an AA in 50min and the mobs would be repopping about the time you killed the 30th one.</div></div><hr />
