<br />
What does the Mirror1,2,3....etc.. proc do???<br />
<br />
People are telling me it completely bounces back the next few spells onto the caster...<br />
which... I doubt. It would be way too overpowered.<br />
<br />
So anyone mind explaining what the proc does please?<br />
Some sort of DS for spells or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorokFV</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">judging by what it says on lucy, it appears the spell line gives a chance to reflect any incoming spell back onto the caster. mirror I to IV seem to be 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent, respectively. Bounce and Reflect, the castable versions, are 40% and 50%. the castable versions are 2 tick duration whereas the procs are 3 ticks, probably to balance out the higher chance of reflecting a spell. so the upside is it is probably possible to reflect just about any spell, however the spell is very short duration so it would need to be casted constantly in order to reflect a lot of spells back. this is all speculation... a SK in my guild has a weapon with mirror I on it but i haven't heard much about it yet. however it does seem a pretty logical and balanced way for it to work. if anyone has any better information or tests, please post :)<br />
<br />
there is also this spell:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4124&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
which is (100/60/100) and lasts 30 minutes, but has a similar casting message and is the same &quot;unknown #&quot;. so that is certainly interesting :p maybe a nasty mob ability? :D</div></div><hr />
