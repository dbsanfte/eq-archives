Are they using it ?<br />
If not then it means there are combo out there<br />
that will bring either more agro (i see only Darkblade/EoE) or<br />
far better stats (thats not hard).<br />
<br />
Have you gone back to dual wielding in Time ? While having a BoW <br />
If yes, what is the main reason for this change ?<br />
And what setup do you use ?<br />

<br />
With the even further nerf of an already horrid ratio item, nobody's biting and the single one we got went to the lowest playtime / points guy in the guild.  Im sorry but im not gonna mainhand a weapon thats slower then my fucking 2 hander.  <br />
<br />
I can hold aggro just fine with my 2 hander and im sure not gonna blow tons of points to get a situational 1 hander, which is what the Darkblade of the Warlord is.  Any other combo including a Blade of War or a similiar 2 hander will beat the pants off it in exp groups or as the assist on raids.  While the Darkblade probably is a great weapon when your actually tanking a god, i do fine with my Blade of War and dont really see a reason to spend points on this thing.<br />
<br />
If i had to dual wield in time, id probably go for an Edge of Eternity and im really unsure atm as far as an offhander would go.  I havent really thought about it too much.<br />
<br />
As to the Symbol of the Planemasters, its like the Aten gloves only slightly better.  Helps tons on aggro the warriors in my guild report, its something you should save for if your on points or ask for if your merit or whatever.  It will definitely help you big time.<br />
<br />
Oh, and a Blade of War is not only uncommon on the majority of warriors in time, its dumb to assume that every time guilded warrior has one.  The thing barely freaking drops, most time enabled warriors dont have one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding 1h weapons I would like to make a point.  Strikethrough is supposed to &quot;strike through your opponent's defenses&quot;  which would include riposte.  The only problem is that with the items available we can currently only get up to 20% strikethough(unless i missed one).  Haven't seen too much information regarding the effectivness of strikethough in avoiding ripostes.  <br />

Symbol is too long to click while tanking aren't they?<br />
<br />
As for DW/BoW, I've already passed up looting a Darkblade once pre-nerf, and I have very little interest in looting one in the future. Ripostes vs. added stats are a factor, but my main concern is agro during the first 30 seconds. This is the time when mobs are most likely to draw agrio from the healers or debuffers. If the BoW doesn't proc, at least you have the DPS agro to work with, as well as prox etc. The Darkblade doesn't have enough DPS on it's own, so you have to couple it with an EoE. Ignoring for a minute that means 2 top end loots for minimal benefit, I'm still concerned about the additional ripostes, though minimal, from offhanding a failry fast weapon. When not MTing, the Darkblade is bagged. When exping, the Darkblade is bagged. The only area I think the Darkblade would shine is on slowing mobs, due to the fact you still get the same average of procs per minute irrespective of haste/slow. Since that happens once in a blue moon, it's not really worth it.<br />
<br />
I'm sticking to using a BoW, or maybe picking up a Vanzir (sp?) until they either fix DW to make it competetive with PoP 2hander dps. I realise we're not a pure DPS class, but DPS generates safer agro during the first 30 seconds than praying for a proc.</div></div><hr />

That click proc buff would be a death sentence for a monk/rog- stun + DD is a good taunt, and one round of stolen aggro on 2k+ hitters (esp. a double/triple/quad and maybe a proc) = dead melee.  Orb of the sky (VT) call of sky click proc buff just got updated to stun as well, and even with only 35DD it still seems to be a nice aggro boost.<br />
<br />
For planes, whenever I'm not MT I dual wield whatever the best low-aggro stat/resist weapons I have at the moment; can't keep up with &quot;real&quot; melee types (or wizards... or mage pets... etc.) but does help to up the dps, and better resists typically as well.  For nasty AE/DoT fights, even an old scimmy of lifestealing occasionally gets equipped. ;)<br />

<br />
Im more inclined to use 2handers for dmg, but I would definitely not go for the Darkblade at all. That weapon has to do dmg and have a short delay, and add the RZ graphic into the mix  LOL. Those devs need to buy a clue into what other things a warrior does with it besides raid encounters to understand why that sword is a pos in its current state. I would definitely go for a Vanazir. Looks nice too :)</div></div><hr />

There's an event or two where I put aside the BoW and take out BF/BoC due to the mobs memblurring themselves so often, I'd rather try for the more procs / minute then the higher DPS to get the attention...</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Do you ever Dual Wield anymore? Or does the BoW make that pretty useless while Main tanking?<br />
<br />
Just adding in, I have Aten gloves for the click aggro proc effect, and my 1h combo is Hategiver/Great Blade of Storms. (meaning I gain no HP from DWing, but maybe gain procs/aggro). I also have PB 1, and Ferocity 2, all defensive and HP AA's are maxed.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can link my magelo here also...not sure if it makes much differance though.<br />

You will not outdamage BoW DWing so the only reason to not use BoW is if you don't want the aggro.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a parser, but it &quot;seems&quot; like dual wielding, I get many more call of fire procs (65 dd, stun) which while not uber aggro, sure add up and help alot.<br />
<br />
I'm just looking for people's first hand experience and opinion. I know I'll never out DPS a BoW with the current state of 1h weapons. I love it to death, and don't really want to even switch it out for a 1h combo....but if thats more effeciant, I'll sure do it.</div></div><hr />

You will not outdamage BoW DWing so the only reason to not use BoW is if you don't want the aggro.  <br />
<br />
That is incorrect. Two-handers are not supposed to proc 'about the same' as 2 one-handers. Two one-handers will proc on average of 1.5 times more than a two-hander. There are also a few (very few) DW combos that will beat out a BoW DPS wise. Aggro wise? Iffy...<br />
<br />
Consider that with about 1650 ATK and max haste you'll be doing about 150 dps ON AVERAGE to experience mobs with a BoW while tanking. Use that as the baseline. A SEWs will put out a bit more DPS. A Vanazir a little more than a SEWS and a good chunk more when MTing fast hitting ubers (assuming your riposte AA are all maxed).<br />
<br />
And btw your proc rate is directly tied to your dexterity and has nothing to do with the number of swings you take (easy to test, get slowed, parse; use no haste, parse; haste, parse). Two weapons = more chances to proc over time, naturally. When someone tells you that a certain weapon procs like crazy or another weapon procs like shit, it is because the weapon itself has a mod that figures into the proc formula either negatively or positively, i.e. a Howling Orb might be telling the server to check -200 versus dex per swing (which would explain its asstastic proc rate).<br />
<br />
With all that crap said, assume that on average a warrior with 0 CE will proc a BoW 100 times per hour on average (this number is actually fairly accurate). With 15% CE, expect to proc 15 more times over the course of an hour, i.e. 115.</div></div><hr />

In your example, your weapons proc obviously don't have stacking issues, and it seem the illusion stack symbol of the plane master.<br />
<br />
But you can't make call of sky stack with the symbol of the planemaster, or you can't make any ranger proc buff to stack with itself, same with sk, etc.<br />

 so accourding to your buff bar you see the 2 icons there but if u read all your proc messages you will only see the lifetap from the scarecrow.<br />

Anytime I was using it, I had the feeling it was stealing the proc opportunities from my other weapons ... it was just like I was still procing the same amount of time, but 50% was orb procs, 50% were BoC procs. Applying this to BoW and Symbol of the planemasters, that would mean that I would proc 1 EB per minute and 1 pesti shock per minute, instead of 2 EB per minute.<br />
So, I am not very interested in looting symbol of planemasters for the proc part.<br />
