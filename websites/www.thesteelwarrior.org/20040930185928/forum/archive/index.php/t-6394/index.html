Enchanter Code v0.2 <br />
<br />
-= Instructions =- <br />
<br />
The Enchanter Code consists of several categories. Each category is labeled with a letter and some qualifiers. Go through each category and determine which set of qualifiers best describes you in that category. By stringing all of these 'codes' together, you are able to construct your overall enchanter code. It is this single line of code that will inform other enchanters the world over of what a great enchanter you actually are. <br />
<br />
Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with you exactly. It is impossible to cover all possibilities in each category. Simply choose that qualifier that most closely matches you. <br />
<br />
After you have determined each of your qualifiers, you need to the construct your ENCHANTER CODE BLOCK. Instructions are provided on how to do this towards the end of this file. <br />
<br />
Also, pay particular attention to case-sensitivity, there can be a big difference between a 'w' and a 'W'. <br />
<br />
-= Variables =- <br />
<br />
Enchanters can seldom be strictly quantified. To facilitate the fact that within any one category the enchanter may not be able to determine a specific rating, variables have been designed to allow this range to be included. <br />
<br />
@ <br />
for this variable, said trait is not very rigid, may change with time or with individual interaction. <br />
<br />
() <br />
for indicating &quot;cross-overs&quot; or ranges. <br />
<br />
&gt; <br />
for 'wannabe' ratings. Indicating that while the enchanter is currently at one rating, they are striving to reach another. <br />
<br />
$ <br />
Indicates that this particular category is done for plat. <br />
<br />
? <br />
Unless stated otherwise within the specific category, the ? is placed after the category identifier and indicates that the enchanter has no specific knowledge about that specific category. <br />
<br />
! <br />
Placed BEFORE the category. Unless stated otherwise, indicates that the person does not participate in this category. This is unlike the ? variable as the ? indicates lack of knowledge, while the ! indicates lack of participation. <br />
<br />

b+++ :Willing to run from GFay to Qeynos to buff a lvl2 noob anytime (think pre PoP/Luclin travelling here). <br />
<br />
CHARMING (non-Dire Charm of course...sort of a mix of how often and how well you do it) <br />
!c    That's crazy stuff, kid stuff...I've never charmed before, and I'm not about to start now. <br />
c---  To me, &quot;charming&quot; is code for &quot;wiping my group real quick&quot;. <br />
c--   When I charm, the only death I cause is my own...but it's like clockwork. <br />
c-    I'm addicted to charming and keep doing it, even though it's not paying off for me. <br />
c+    As long as a get a rez each time I die, charming...well, it beats selling KEI. <br />
c++   My minions serve me well, for fun and profit.  The deaths are a small price to pay. <br />
c+++  I go days without dying while charming mobs near my level, and I do it a lot. <br />
c++++ I am perhaps the ultimate charming macheen! <br />
<br />
TOLERANCE FOR WRIST PAIN <br />
!t    I'll not ruin my wrists for such menial futility, good day sir! <br />
t---  Avg. tradeskill 0-50 <br />

t-    Avg. tradeskill 100-150 <br />
t+    Avg. tradeskill 150-175 <br />
t++   Avg. tradeskill 175-200 <br />
t+++  Avg. tradeskill 200-225 <br />
t++++ Avg. tradeskill 225-250, I am a tradeskill fiend! <br />
t!    My tradeskills are all at 250, and I split steel bracelets by flexing my wrists. <br />
<br />
DRAMA FACTOR <br />
D--- :What is drama pls? <br />
D--  :Everything's been cool for as long as you can remember, even the KSing of your group was shrugged off. <br />
D-  :No drama to speak of in a long long time. <br />
D   :Once in a blue moon I end up in a fight or my guild has a kneejerk fit of anger. <br />
D+  :A few Squabbles with other people, usually nothing serious with no feelings permanently hurt. <br />
D++  :Me or my guild have quite a lot of high drama but usually fizzles out quick. <br />
D+++ :You could best describe it as 'As &lt;your charname or guild name&gt; Turns' ie. would make a nice TV show. <br />
<br />
CYBORZ SKILLS <br />
!X    &quot;Fresh!&quot; /slap <br />
X---- Find yourself saying, &quot;I'll buff you if you type like you're humping me.&quot; as a pickup line. <br />
X--   My god, all this naughty language is just too much! Yuck! <br />
X-    My guild is raunchy and perverted but I don't participate in it. Nor does it bother me at all. <br />
X     My guild is baaaad, and I go with the flow usually. <br />
X+    Flirting, like Marilyn Monroe in that movie. <br />
X++   I get it on! But only with someone I know so don't ask. <br />
<br />

-= How to Display Your Code =- <br />
<br />
Now that you have your ratings for each of the above categories, it's time to assemble your code for displaying to the world. Take each category you determined and list them all together with one space between each one. If you run out space on one line, continue it on the next. When completed, it will look something like the following: <br />
<br />
E65.125/L h- 2.45khp 5.54km ft11 G++&gt;+++&lt;3 e+++@ o- T+++ L(+++)++ H++(--)@ f++ g++ b- c++++@ t+ !D X@ <br />
<br />
If you are going to place your Enchanter Code into your .signature or .plan file (highly recommended), it is also recommended that you include a link to the version of Enchanter Code you're using. Here are a couple examples of acceptable bbcode (see how it they look at the bottom of this post): <br />
