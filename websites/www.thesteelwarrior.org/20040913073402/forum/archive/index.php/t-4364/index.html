 -1) Although we haven't talked very much about it, the team has been working very hard on the Melee changes. Expect something in mid-December (we'll announce it and discuss it in the upcoming chat) that far exceeds what people are expecting. The bottom line is our major goal was to completely revise the way melee combat is done in EQ. You can look forward to the Melee types becoming much more interactive and able to do a whole lot more cool things during combat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Of course, Sony's view of &quot;melee types&quot; includes everyone that swings a weapon in combat. So any changes they make are likely to benefit hybrids every bit as much as pure melee. Had they meant to exclude hybrids, they would have used the term &quot;pure melee&quot; as they have in the past.</div></div><hr />
