<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When military fighting men find themselves in hot and sweaty conditions, .e.g. combat, road marches, etc., it's common for many of them to not wear underwear.  Wearing underwear in these situation can lead to an extremely bad case of rash and chafing on the inside part of the thighs.  This chafing makes it extremel painful to walk.  By not wearing underwear, the rash and chafing can be drastically reduced or even elminated.  The practice of not wearing underwear was probably first made famous by some group of Commandos somewhere, hence the term &quot;going commando.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I learned this in Basic Training, in fact. One of my Drill Sargeants commented on wearing the military issue drawers (Tighty Whitey's, but green... ) on Road Marches, etc.<br />
<br />
I didn't listen to him the first few road marches, and those were like 2 milers, stuff to get people warmed up etc. I quickly learned he was smart.<br />
<br />
also good in the field, even if you aren't walking, when you are going long periods in the hot and the sweat without a shower. Crotch Rot is bad. :-(</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I guess that depends alot on what sort of combat gear you are wearing(and what kind of weather conditions you are in, cold or warm climate). The combat pants we had back when I was in the army was of a pretty &quot;rough&quot; material, I am not sure it would have been nice to &quot;go commando&quot; in those at all(although I admit I never tried :p). <br />
<br />
After a few months I found out that by far the best underwear for wearing on training missions/marches/excerises at least for me was simply a pair of bicycle thights. Very comfortable and keeps you nice and dry, especially when it rains which it did alot during my recruit days hehe. Thights make it alot more bearable to wear clothes on top that are soaking wet, by rain or sweat. Not to mention they also keep you warm, and are alot lighter than the other alternatives we were issued for when it was cold.<br />
<br />
But then again, this was in a nordic climate(cold and wet). For warmer conditions &quot;going commando&quot; might be better, I dunno :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Good ole jock strap always worked for me on those 25Ks. My main problem was the crappy material they make those duty belts and pack harnesses out of. Never failed my hips would be rub raw from a good march. Of course, it didn't help that the Marines wouldn't let you use the waist strap to move that weight off your shoulders and hips....ah, memories...<br />
<br />
Hopefully those new packs will get finished and in supply. Those old ALICEs are getting old. Last replacement packs I saw, ended up being recalled because the frame broke too easy...I mean stupidly easy. Makes me wonder who they get to design these things, surely not someone actually using them. Thank god for helicopters though, it made our boys lives much easier than it used to be.</div></div><hr />
