<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kerpaple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am pretty much my guilds permenant SA. We are a guild that is pretty much doing mid-level Luclin at the moment (Grieg, Serv, Doomshade, RC, Vindi, IV). When I am in my SA roll, I usually start the fight with my SoD/Copper Hammer combo, then after anarchy lands a time or two, I switch back to my Axe of the Kromzek Kings and thump away on the mob. If our MA goes down, the mob invariable pops onto me, and I throw the SoD/CH back in and away I go.<br />
<br />
So, as a SA that combo seems ok the way it is currently, but for exp groups it just sucks. Now I know that as a warrior I suffer from not having a good method of gaining instant agro, but I am wondering if it is worth throwing Anger 3 in both of those blades so that I would be a bit more of a procfest?<br />
<br />
Also, if there is just a better solution please let me know. Thanks.<br />

Boggle.  I am SoD x2, and recently added anger 3 to my primary.<br />
I would say I am grouping at the same level as you.  BoT, LDoN, velious boss tanking. <br />
Before I added anger 3, people were happy with my agro.  Now that I have added anger 3, regulars who group with me constantly push the agro envelope to extremes.  Im not sure that the CHoS is that much less agro than the SoD, but i could be mistaken.<br />
Anyways, add anger 3 to your primary sod, you wont be disappointed.</div></div><hr />

Well, you're never going to have &quot;instant&quot; aggro, no matter what you do.  The best you can hope for is to put as many hate/DD-stun procs on your weapons as you can fit.  There are still going to be times when you're going 30-40 seconds without a proc, but they should be far less rare.<br />
<br />
If you truly don't think that an SoD/Copper Hammer combo is suffiient aggro for you, then yeah, you might wanna augment that if you don't see yourself getting a Bloodfrenzy/Blade of War any time soon.</div></div><hr />
