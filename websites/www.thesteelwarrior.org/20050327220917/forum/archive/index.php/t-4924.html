Right Now I have<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Enchanter<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
Should i take shaman? Dps? what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Griglon</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myself personally would love a shaman and a bard.  Not sure of others opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd say bard for resists and additional haste/mana and maybe pulling, rogue for DPS and dragging in case it should happen, and a beastlord for DPS and fill in the missing buffs. <br />
<br />
DPS however might not be a huge problem with all the new weapons out and armor out considering the respawn in ToV is 72 mins, which should be plenty of time. adds might be a problem, but a decent BL and probably tank an add while everyone else assists the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would add a Beastlord, Monk and a Rogue to what you have. If you all are geared well enough to 1 group ToV you should have decent resists already, plus with Shaman resist buffs and Ferocity from the BL (he/she should be able to keep 3 people in Ferocity) for the ATK and +65 to all resists.. you should be fine. FD puller comes in extra handy. You could sub the Monk for a Bard with Fading Memories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No offense man, but if your magelo is correct and the people you're taking are at the same gear level, you're seriously walking into the slaughterhouse with a single group there.  Things are going to be red to you and raping you for high 300's, and your 5k buffed isn't going to last very long against unslowed mobs.<br />
<br />
I'd definitely suggest 2 groups until you gain some levels or improve your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Haass said.  <br />
If you do go there with one group, make sure you have a necro or sk availiable with coffins to summon your bodies.<br />
<br />
I think you might be better off going to LDoN adventures in North Ro to get some decent armor and some more levels and AA before you attempt ToV with one group.  General rule of thumb is that if you can one group there, its a waste of your time because your gear would be far better than what you could hope to get there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buffs, damage shield, backup heals, dps, evac.... yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dunno if you could do it or not, but go with all your buff classes<br />
<br />
paladin - 65 brells<br />
shaman - 65 focus and malos, mobs are almost impossible to slow with just tash, you must have a mage or shaman to reliably slow.<br />
druid - pot9 and spot heals till you got the mob slowed.<br />
<br />
things will go MUCH faster with a <br />
<br />
bard for mana song<br />
few dps classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
other than the gloves, there is really no reason to be doing HoT though other than just for the experience of having done it. gloves are common at least though. legs and bp are nice, just really rare.<br />
<br />
take 2 groups if possible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which is a really good reason to not snare them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best 3 to add to those 3:<br />
<br />
Bard.  ~75DPS melee, +30% more DPS for other classes.<br />
Druid.  Spot heals, Circle of Seasons, Nukes, Evac.<br />
Shaman.  Malo, Slow (chanter slow sucks) debuffs, dots, heals.<br />
<br />
At least get those 3.  Hell, you can do without the cleric and chanter for that matter, but at least have those 3.  I have trio'd HoT with a shaman, bard, and druid, so add a real tank and healer and you are rocking.  I would personally ditch the chanter, as they will be completely useless there with a bard, druid and shaman (bard will cover haste better, shaman has better slow).<br />
<br />
With one group, your kills will be slow, so gaters will nuke you till they are oom anyways, and the bard has a plenty good mana drain song at 60 to cover the last bit after they stop nuking.<br />
<br />
I would pick the following if I had to choose the best group:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Shaman<br />
Druid<br />
Bard<br />
DPS class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id go with a bard, but i dont think any bard heading into ToV will have 75 dps. Most average playing bards ive parsed put out about 30-40 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't think I would try single grouped HoT with anything less than a solid core of 65s (and I would add bard, bst and rogue..I think).<br />
<br />
The really scary thought is adds. Maybe a necro instead of bst, still get pet DPS, mana for healers when needed adn corpse summon when something goes wrong (and it will).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brohm</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to do ToV with a single group back before SoL came out and we were all lvl 60. Hell I watched a shaman solo in there. You defentaly don't need to be all lvl 65. However, we were  geared up and did not need the armor for ourselves. It was for twinks. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the group I used was Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, Monk, Rogue, Druid. <br />
<br />
Brohm Bones<br />
65 Warlord of Vallon Zek</div></div><hr />

id go with a bard, but i dont think any bard heading into ToV will have 75 dps. Most average playing bards ive parsed put out about 30-40 dps.  <br />
<br />
It depends a lot on AA skills, as Ambidex and the double attack AA add a LOT to bard melee dps, and bards have access to lots of easy to get, great ratio melee weapons.<br />
<br />
Two bards, with the same gear, one with those AA and one without will have a good 20-30DPS difference.<br />
<br />
15% more offhand hits, and a 40% double attack rate add a lot to dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can certainly 1 group ToV, but as Brohm and Bonequest pointed out, if you can 1 group ToV, then you don't need any of the gear that drops there. Get a couple group before you go in, that is your best bet. If you have a hard time with 1 mob, then you will likely get smoked by any adds, and you will get adds sooner or later.</div></div><hr />
