<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
My gang of friends and I have recently returned to EQ.  One of the things we need to get out of the way is helping our Rogue finish his epic.  Ive read up on the General in kith and we are going to try him with 1 group this weekend:<br />
<br />
65 Warrior (ME)<br />
65 Druid <br />
65 Enchanter<br />
65 Shammy<br />
65 Paladin<br />
64 Rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
We understand how to single pull all the DE's.  We have practiced this using the Rogue to target, Enchanter pacify and pull.  <br />
<br />
My question is about the General himself.  Ive never tanked him before but this was my current plan:<br />
<br />
1) Incite<br />
2) Furious (with GSoT most likely)<br />
3) Switch to BoC/CHoS for duration of fight and use Stonewall disc.  Incite when possible<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully the Shammy/Ench will be able to get him slowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  Are we crazy?  Do we need more?</div></div><hr />

Usually single pulling him is the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use Harmony of Nature. You will get him single.<br />
<br />
Druid will have a hard time healing you if you are not disc'd and he is dual wielding.<br />
<br />
So use discs and stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much does he hit for? I remember killing him once a long time ago, but I wasn't there for tankage, I was just lending my DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use Evasive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, use Evasive after Furious.<br />
<br />
Don't even bother slowing him, seriously, he's really resistant and it's a waste of time. Have your slower either heal or Rune, because the general isn't gonna be a pushover with just a druid healing.  Be ready for the ass kicking, cuz he's got the ability to drop you VERY fast after Furious.<br />
<br />
You'll get him this time Gaylon.  I remember you asking about him some time ago, with less levels.  My group single grouped his arse shortly after I hit 65 and I realized we had a chance at it.  Don't get discouraged if you fail..just redo the rogue epic and give it a go again.  Rogue epic takes all of about 6 hours to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">P.S. Drop a Shaman Quiescence (sp?) On your self right before pull. That will help with the DPS.<br />
<br />
Haass is right about not bothering to slow.<br />
<br />
You will get him don't worry.<br />
<br />
P.S. If general wipes the hell out of you, you can always Train the Ranger Guildleader (Morin Shadowbane) to the General and die.<br />
<br />
By the time you come back, the General will be dead and Morin will be walking away.<br />
<br />
Loot your box and volia.<br />

He should go a long way towards butchering himself on your ripostes.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I wouldnt risk it and would enlist the help of a cleric at least.  It will take less time to find a cleric to help heal then it will to redo the rogue epic imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, high damage weapon with Furious will knock him down pretty good, considering he quads fast.  DSs would be great also.  I agree with Evasive (because of procs).  If you go without a cleric, have the shaman keep Quiescence on you, and patch heal when possible.  He can actually drop you fast, but sometimes doesn't.  Your fight might be longer than normal due to lack of damage though.  Getting a cleric's help would be great though, would make things a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That group you listed is overkill.  The paladin and druid could duo him, or the shaman - as long as you don't get feared.<br />
<br />
My last parse on General V'Ghera from last year showed max hit 285 // bash for 89, 138.24 dps on a ~ 1700 ac warrior, 31,487 total melee damage done on him (32,000hp).<br />
<br />
Depending on how quickly you pull him and which mob you leave will depend on how you treat the fight.  If you leave the Coercer up, she will haste / ds the General so you will want to dispell or use a disease slow.  Old world epics aren't that difficult anymore.<br />
<br />
When pulling the house, just remember they are all buffed by each other so they'll be hasted, damage shielded, runed, and buffed by cleric (I forget which hp buff she casts).  They will try and HT, snare, fear, tash, nuke, mez - so the puller will want 200+ in all resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Derrict, you seem to have lost some view of the real world here.  Gaylon is no 1700 ac warrior, nor does he have the HP to correspond with that.  The fight is going to be just a little harder than a duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regardless of his hp/ac, the General is a gimp fight with the lvl 65 spells the casters have available to them (buffs, heals, yada yada yada).  I gave the data for reference.  With his gear and such, the General still wouldn't break 300 dps on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He hasn't lost view of anything.<br />
<br />
Level 61 war/sk/bard/wiz/sham<br />
Level 62 cleric<br />
Level 60 chanter/druid<br />
Level 55 rogue<br />
<br />
I was two boxing the war and wiz, friend of mine was two boxing the sk and cleric.<br />
<br />
The shaman was able to slow him with Cloud of Grummus (40% desease slow) the first try.<br />
<br />
I went defensive instead of evasive, oh well... small mistake.<br />
<br />
Enchanter cast rune on me 7 times, and I was healed a total of 7 times for 1522, 2551, 165, 4984, 2145,  2419, and 200.  2 of which really don't count as heals, since one hit while I was already full health, and the other was the SK group buff spell.<br />
<br />
Battle lasted 3 minutes and 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
This was when I was 61, probably had only 1300ish AC and 7k hps fully buffed at the time.<br />
<br />
The General was cake, and we were stunned and suprised that he was cake.  Enchanter was the only person that died (about half way through the battle from the rune castings).  General was going down so well, that I had completely forgotten about my wizard for a good portion of the battle, and only ended up nuking like 8 times.  Cleric was 70% mana at the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
Here's the full, unedited section from my log:<br />
http://www.geocities.com/dannglenn/general.txt<br />
<br />
Damn, I should really start over on this log some time.  Nothing like have a 91MB text file constantly growing in my EQ directory since Dec 2003.<br />
<br />
At level 65, he'll be even more of a pushover.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to take him seriously, don't think of him as a pushover as casters can drop like flies if he gets out of control.  Then suprise yourself when he goes down easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He hasn't lost view of anything. <br />
<br />
Oh really?  Doesn't look like you duoed him either.  In case you forgot, here's what I called bullshit on.<br />
<br />
That group you listed is overkill. The paladin and druid could duo him, or the shaman  <br />
<br />
Second of all, I've tried the general a few times.  I've NEVER seen slow land on him, Grummus, or Turgurs.  And trust me, bringing a 4k mana shammy with SCM3 + MP4 with a Conj Spec down to OOM with JUST grummus takes awhile.  if you got a slow to land, bravo, good job.  Don't expect it to happen again.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to take him seriously, don't think of him as a pushover as casters can drop like flies if he gets out of control. Then suprise yourself when he goes down easy. <br />
<br />
And just in case you didn't read the whole thread, my first post basically says this.  I'm not saying it's gonna be some goddamned grand battle where the druid is going to run OOM just as the general dies, but I am saying that it's gonna be just a little bit more than a fucking duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember fighting him when I just dinged 65 his dps wasnt a joke. Ofcourse that was over a year, but my equipment then was probably on par with yours ~5k hp and ~50ish AA. He is not hard fight, but he is definatley not push over. Also since this is your first time doing it I'd recomend geting a few more people for safety. I'd go for another DPS instead of cleric, since you already got pal,sham,druid.<br />
<br />
Haas defiantley has the right idea of this fight. Dont let the others lead you to belive he is going to be cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lochr</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I did the General for my twink, we had:<br />
<br />
65 cleric/54 rogue   &lt;- both me<br />
65 warrior<br />
59 enc<br />
60 ranger<br />
61 paladin<br />
<br />
Warrior had around 80 AAs or so, in ToV level equipment. It wasn't a trivial fight by any means, but we won.<br />
<br />
Brigadier G'Tav was dual wielding, and did an incredible amount of damage. After I parsed the fights, I found that the Brigadier did almost as much damage as the General. So, I suggest trying to pull the Brigadier first, or relatively early, and see how you do against it. If you wipe real fast, try to draft a few more people before risking your rogue's Sealed Box.<br />
<br />
I know the enchanter wasn't able to slow the General. I don't remember if he got the Brigadier, but based on how my cleric's mana plummeted, I'll assume he wasn't slowed either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just look at the parse from Alisdahre's post.  The last time I killed him was while doing the high elf mask quest where he didn't despawn like he normally does - war rog rgr cler, so the General was never slowed like he was in this above parse.  Once slowed, his DPS is even weaker.  94 dps, 13k total damage for a 2 minute fight - for those saying the fight was difficult, they're probably fighting a hasted General and didn't bother to dispell or have a shaman there for disease slow.  I'll still stand by my original statement, he's a joke nowadays.  It's like fighting a mob in PoV.</div></div><hr />

Btw, I /bug'd it like 2 years ago since it's a sploit, maybe they fixed it.<br />

<br />
You know that the Coercer can only haste the general if you leave her up to spawn the general right?<br />
<br />
We never leave that bitch alive.  You wanna know why he had such shitty DPS?  He procced soul devour 3 times in 2 minutes.  I've had that bastard proc it 3 times in A ROUND on me.  The fight is just a little bit different when he's proc happy and able to crush off about 2500hp in less than a second.</div></div><hr />

 fight - for those saying the fight was difficult, they're probably fighting a hasted General and didn't bother to dispell or have a shaman there for disease slow.  I'll still stand by my original statement, he's a joke nowadays.  It's like fighting a mob in PoV.  <br />
<br />
<br />
My General fight was just a couple months ago, in January. Since I was both the puller and did the turn-in, I'm sure the General was not hasted.<br />
<br />
We killed all the dark elves except the Priestess. A lot of write-ups suggest leaving the Brigadier up to spawn the General, for some reason we couldn't do that. So the Priestess was the last one up, she got the box, and the General spawned.<br />
<br />
The priestess can't haste. The General's a SK, and can't haste himself.<br />
<br />
Let's see, PoV golems/spiders proc a 375 point resistable DD, General's got a near unresistable 500 point LIFETAP. General's got 32K hitpoints, PoV mobs have 10-15K. General quads. Quads for a bit less per hit then a PoV mob, but still quads.<br />
<br />
General &gt; PoV mob. The General may be a joke to a tank in the server's uberguild. Looking at Gaylon's magelo, he's probably not in it. It's going to be a tough fight for him, especially without a cleric. His druid's going to pretty much have to chain cast Karana's Renewal, and hope the rogue and his disc do enough damage before the druid goes OOM.<br />
<br />
The General's not as tough as an unslowed BoT wing boss like Laef. If you can handle Laef (without a charmed pet), you can handle the General. <br />
<br />
I still recommend testing your group against the Brigadier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I commented on the part about about him saying the group they're going to use is overkill.  Cause it is.  They'll easily waste the mob.<br />
<br />
A simple correction saying you were talking soley about the dou comment would have been nice, but instead you were a complete jack ass about it towards me, so fuck you.</div></div><hr />

Most leave the coercer up since she's the easiest one for the turn in.  If the cleric is left up, of course the General is unhasted.<br />

<br />
Parse an unslowed golem/spider vs an unslowed General, the golem should do 270-300 dps with his gear, which is greater than the General's.  The lifetap isn't unresistable but w/o a bard, it'll land every time.  Mobs in PoV hit 5xx, twice that of the General.<br />
<br />
Basically he'll need to /log on and prove us all wrong when he does the rogue epic fight.</div></div><hr />
