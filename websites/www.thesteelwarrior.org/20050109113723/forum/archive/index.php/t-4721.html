<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcticBlade</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been reading these boards for a long time now and I enjoy reading other peoples thoughts and views about things. So here is my two cents on the matter of Warrior and Argo lock.<br />
<br />
Warrior will never have Argo Lock. Its that simple. The game doesnt work that way. IMO the point of a Warrior and I dont have an SK.. nor a Pally. All I have is a 55 Shaman and a 55 Warrior. The Orginal Concept of a Warrior is to have a better or the Best Tank. The game is full of choises. You can either pick a Warrior and have a Tank that is less mana intencive for the cleric/healer because of the higher AC and HPs means less overall heals BUT other people in the group need to watch there argo or you can have a Knight. Slightly less HPs and slightly less AC more mana for the cleric to dump on them but the group can do what it wants not watching there argo.<br />
<br />
Its all about Choise. Know your class and know how to control your argo = Warrior. Do what you want and throw all the rules into the wind = Knight.<br />
<br />
Warrior Pros: More HPs/AC less heals<br />
Warrior Cons: Watch your Argo<br />
<br />
Knight Pros: Faster kills. No Argo Worries<br />
Knights Cons: More heals, Less mana for healers sometimes leading to OOM and Med Breaks.<br />
<br />
Now that was the Orginal Idea.. Whats happened?<br />
<br />
I believe that overtime things changed. You had itemization and all that Jazz that you guys already know about but lets look at something else. How the other classes effected not only the Knights but Warriors as well.<br />
<br />
For example C3, C4 and C5... Plus Kitty Crack and all the other spells that regen mana and that are all stackable. Meaning more mana for the cleric/healer. More mana they have... the less of a Choise it really becomes in the end. So in the end its not only Knights that have become overpowered... I think its all small parts of a puzzle. 1 part alone doesnt really over balance anything. Put put all the parts together and Warriors get screwed. <br />
<br />
I also believe that a Pally using a spell that he got an upgread to is an explot. I dont know anything about pallyes but from I read on this board. If a Pally is using a spell thats for example level 9 and that Pally is level 55.. there are upgrades to that spell and the only reason the Pally is using the level 9 spell is because of its low mana cost and if even resisted the Pally gains argo. Thats an explot.<br />
<br />
I do apologize for the misspelling... and thats just my thoughts on that subject :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem currently is that knights do not need more healing than a warrior.  It makes you point moot.</div></div><hr />

Is that anything like A-G-R-O?<br />
And on a more positive note, thank you for the well-informed comprehensive post full of revolutionary ideas we've never heard before one thousand times :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, aggro, which is short of aggression.<br />
<br />
As for the original post :<br />
Knight Pros: Faster kills. No Argo Worries<br />
Knights Cons: More heals, Less mana for healers sometimes leading to OOM and Med Breaks.<br />
Wrong on the Cons part.<br />
Any self respecting Knight will have enough aggro in incoming, that the MOB will be slowed right of the bat, which means much less healing in the first half of the fight.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but most Paladins will throw that 200 mana DOt heal they have (heals 1200 HP I think) and most shadowknight will probably use a Lifetap or two along the way.<br />
<br />
Thus they require frewer heals AND heal themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no cons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcticBlade</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flame away if you want... It doesnt bother me. I'm here to learn the ins and outs of a class that I fell in love with and that I enjoy playing AND that I wish to play to its full abilities... and not half ass like so many others. If I am wrong.. then show me how I am wrong. Apperently my train of thought was wrong LOL.<br />
<br />
Anker steadfast makes a good point with Pallies get a 1200 point Dot heal and the SKs Lifetaps... I didnt think about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You ain't thought about much. Particularly paladins as a complete package.<br />
<br />
Mitigation wise lets add that on stunnable mobs a Pally can stop a couple of attacks pretty easy - good bye hp advantage.<br />
<br />
Lets also not forget its not just aggro on a single mob that pallies also add. They have additional abilities to pull singles, root park without damaging, break mez without any aggro issues, actively boost group survivability, gain unassailable aggro on multiple targets at one time etc etc. (none of which is always used in every circumstance, sure, but unlike some argue all of which does have value) and all this is supposed to be balanced against a few more hp's and relatively minor mitigation advantages, heh.<br />
<br />
Its all about Choise. Know your class and know how to control your argo = Warrior. Do what you want and throw all the rules into the wind = Knight.<br />
<br />
Choice wether to bother being gimped in your ability to apply your abilities (according to some wizards/necro's) versus having free reign to do what you will doesn't seem like a choice not to play well to me, it sounds like a commonsense approach to group mechanics, similarly if you have the tools to gain aggro and it is advantageous to you to use a low level spell that does nothing else  (and many pallies use their high level stuns with no mana worries, anyway) then that's just common sense use of the tools at your disposal. It's not somehow dishonest. :p<br />
<br />
Whilst the design of the game (and the designers) allow these 'cheap' methods why shouldn't the players make use of them - even if it shafts warriors? It's not their responsibility to make my game fun - I should have the tools to compete on a fair footing and not even the oh so uberly knowledgeable players like yourself *cough* even come close at this time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domack</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a flame, but you mentioned the original idea. Were knights supposed to have agrolock in the original idea? To me thats some 4 years ago and I don't think they were, at that time, designed for that.<br />
<br />
Move on a few years to just before the advent of PoP and they have these skills but agro was not such a big issue. They got these skills from a balancing effort of the developers in reaction to knights being much less attractive in groups and raids than the classes fulfilling the same jobs. A situation that has mirrored the last 10 months for warriors to an extent.<br />
<br />
As for less mana used with a warrior tank unfortunately thats not the case alot of the time as has been so often mentioned. The wait to slow and ping-pong damage on most of the other players will drain the mana of a cleric far faster. <br />
<br />
With a group watching its agro and a slower waiting till agro is established will again often mean more mana used as the costly fast heals hit your mana pool for more than an extra CH ever will when the RNG is being stingy on those all important procs. Not always the case but certainly not uncommon.<br />
 <br />
Itemisation is certainly an issue and I am glad to see the developers make an effort to address warriors both low and high lvl. As a cleric, when I have a war tank inc that I do not know, the first thing I look for is what agro weap/weaps he has so to get an idea of how much extra healing I will be doing.<br />
<br />
I am hoping to see the players and developers reactions over the next month to see a resolution to the problems we have in the game at the moment. Hopefully the lines of communication will stay open and not the closed door with a suggestion box pinned to it thats been the case for so long now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm....did I miss something on itemization?  I know we have GSoT and anger augs, but is there anything else?  All of the LDoN armor is for all plate classes.  It still seems to me that itemization is a big problem (and I'm including stuff released with LDoN.)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, GSoT was a great addition for us non-uber types, but it still seems to me that Sony is missing the boat (or being lazy) on itemization by making armor for all plate classes that has a lot of int/wis/mana - all of which are useless to warriors but very helpful for knights.</div></div><hr />

Warrior tanking and the ping-ponging mobs= Warriors gets healed less. =P</div></div><hr />

You left out the fact that an equally equiped/buffed/AA  pally/sk has same midigation(pre dec 16 anyway) and ac and hp are a bit lower but not a significant ammount.(dont forget pally's get a 300ish hp self only buff that stacks with everything)</div></div><hr />
