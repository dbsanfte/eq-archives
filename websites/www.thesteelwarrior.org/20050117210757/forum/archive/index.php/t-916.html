<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChrisDaTank</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious on how Im doing for my level.  Im looking for a neck upgrade and a 2HS.  I havent found any neck gear that I can afford, and it seems all the good 2HS are 20K+.  Oh well, just looking for some opinions, suggestions.    Heres my Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=440202)  and thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wide bladed greatsword.  It runs about 7-8k on Tunare.  Nice 35/35 with ac 25 weapon.  <br />
<br />
Try to MQ Champs gear, it might be cheap on ure server.  Also Earring of the Soles should be a nice upgrade, runs about 5-6k and u can buy all the stuff at the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I dunno if u can afford them, but Vallorium Galllantry Rings are really nice, and they arent way too expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on what your money situation is I suppose but anyway Stonebladed Axe of Dismay(44/44 +75hp war only) is a good choice and its cheap, got mine for like 3kpp I think on Lanys.  Clattering Bone necklace(8AC +6str +6sta +30hp) 5kpp-6kpp.  I'd sell the vah shir claw earring and save to do the solstice earring quest.  Also I'd work up your CoV, if its not up already from Kael Arena raids and such and work on questing draconic pauldrons(15AC +12str +12sta +6svf +6svc) and then the bracer of benevolence quests(AC: 17 STR: +8  STA: +8  HP: +30  SV FIRE: +5 SV COLD: +12  SV MAGIC: +12  )  , two of those would add a good amount of hp to your total and nice resists on them.  Both quests are fairly easy doable with a group of 55+ probably.  SS Mq's also go for fairly cheap on lanys, think I saw SS plate gloves MQ going for 3kpp in the merchant section, which would be real nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempur</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">reaver is another good choice for a 2hs.  its a good ratio and has solid resists.  i don't know if it would depend on it for aggro but it should be a decent DPS weapon.  the only problem is that the price has been going back up on em since they were made magic.</div></div><hr />
