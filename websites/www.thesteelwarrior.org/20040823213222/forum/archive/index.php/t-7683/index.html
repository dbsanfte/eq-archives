<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is actually my 2nd oldest, but the oldest isn't interesting.  Level 25 or so in Cazic Thule.  The only thing that keeps me from claiming to be old school are the loaner kunark weapons :).  SSB/bronze/banded = uber.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, I used to have a picture of Haass that looked very similar, only I couldn't afford the Defiance and had a wurmslayer paired with that cane of the tranquil instead :)<br />
<br />
Edit : Actually..wtf is that mainhand...Defiance didn't come around until Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dated 3/4/00 but has to be MUCH older. I can even tell you the patch message...as it was from when shrink was added and the finally fixed helm colors (and it was something I posted or petitioned). <br />
<br />
It didn't bother me when my bronze hat looked like steel, but once I had crafted I wanted the world to know.<br />
<br />
EDIT to add: I would guess that is a Sarnak Skull Splitter.<br />
<br />
And the reason I know this pic is even older is from the same day I have pics from a Naggy raid.<br />
<br />
Have to laugh at the hot key I have for Train. Good old old CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, that's a sarnak skull splitter and a cane of the tranquil.  Friend gave them to me to upgrade my Langseaxs and turned me into a major twink :).  I wore that bronze breastplate until almost level 40.  Did all the other crafted quests but never got the BP.<br />
<br />
Love the train key Kailyn :)</div></div><hr />

ROFL! ... i love your hotkey number 6 ... back in the day i think most people had a them ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I still think I have a train key--though its one of the pages of buttons that I don't use.<br />
<br />
And it says (if you are old enough you know what zone this is from) &quot;Train from the undead side, get off the tracks!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess Guk, Kailyn!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have some old ones, very similar, with me dual wielding the then-uber 1hs Langseax x2, wearing mostly bronze (large! ack!) with some banded.<br />
<br />
Wow.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I wasn't the only Killer Orange of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ahhh the days of orange, grey, and blue.  I miss them so much.  I miss them so much in fact, that I'm still all orange.  Except now it's by choice =).<br />
<br />
&quot;Some call me Orangey, Pumkin' Warrior, and then those who really know me... they call me Danger Cone.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh the memories :D<br />
<br />
I remember using bronze till my early 40s, with a Lammy and a Sarnak Skullsplitter hehe, (Lammy was a hand down from a friend, and was great :D ),  when I bought my first pieces of FS was great too, and questing some of the Crafted armor (along with the Gem Inlaid Gaunts on Splitpaw), the blue with the silver looked neat :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>walkka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Crafted BP was a real pain, I remember camping the WW in MM with some poor guild mates in my early 40's and finally getting after a number of wipes.<br />
<br />
I think some of the best souvenirs I got in EQ are from questing the crafted armor, and the various camps involved, making friends on the way...<br />
<br />
Of course winning a SSOY the first time I went to LGuk was a thrill too, what a nice upgrade from the langseax!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mistmoore was my favourite zone.  I did the Electrum bladed wakizashi quest from there too.  I still think that sword graphic is one of my favourites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Back then you were either guk or solb person :) You either hung out in one or the other.<br />
<br />
I remember camping my exe axe and having awfull luck with rolls. Also anyone remember when there were no frogs to be found in dead/live guk cause there were 100+ ppl in the zone :)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Anyone remember the waiting lists for groups in Highkeep? :)<br />
<br />
I may still have a screenshot of me at level 25 in full visible bronze armor and wielding a Langseax of Wolves.  (Talk about Old School) Took the shot right after I finished the quest.  I may have to dig around for it and see if it' still there when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i still remember the last day of the old CT where a few old school friends of mine and myself camped the gumball for AoF...and than for nostalgia we trained him to the zone.<br />
<br />
but yeah; highkeep lists for WR/RR were things of fame...teling your friends you were in RR or WR groups got respect !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think my oldest screen shot was when I was just kinda pushing buttons trying to figure out some controls and I ended up taking a screenshot of the Freeport guards (where I spawned)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i joined after kunark and b4 velious. I actually got lucky in EC and got a dusty bp (practically the same as crafted) and full crafted armor. Before i had any of that stuff i got a BBK 10/35 that a high level put on a snake and i was leet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did the Electrum bladed wakizashi quest from there too. I still think that sword graphic is one of my favourites. <br />
<br />
Agree EBW &gt; SSoY hheh<br />
<br />
I have a picture in full bronze around somewhere...I was so proud the day I got my bronze BP.  For medium sizes it was a pain to find the BP, the guard guy in Najena only dropped the large size one (think I had to persuade friends to risk a journey to Permafrost to get mine).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jamylah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You know what is sad, I know people with a &quot;Train to zone&quot; button that still use it... BoT is pure evil =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was all twinked out with my Enameled BP and Green Jade broadsword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oh, yeah! I wore a black (blackened?) enameld BP for what seemed like forever. A massive massive 25 AC, as I recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Black.<br />
<br />
I had one from about 35 to 51 I think. Upgraded that to Indilocite (definatly in the top two for most excited I have been about a loot--not sure if I was more excited about epic or Indo...). That to champions and then Sky. Sky is likely to be upgraded to Sands.</div></div><hr />

Skull Splitter in offhand, can't tell what in main, Crafted BP, Mith Legs, Crafted boots and arms I think.  Ahhh the good ole Ragefire camps!<br />

Nice :)  The hero bracer look was definitely cool for warriors, I remember swapping bracers all the time so it would show up instead of the crafted one on my other arm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I lost my best old SS, I was level 5, in full tattered leather with a rusty halberd!  I was uber =)<br />
<br />
I remember the first time I grouped in LGuk(keep in mind that when I was leveling up, it was the LOIO/FM/OT/DL/KC progression), I was so freaking scared.  I had friends who told me about how horrible and evil everything was, plus the zone design was uber creepy.  A very classicly good zone.  On my way out of there, in upper guk, I got lost from my group as we were leaving, and tried to run out on my own (no freaking clue where I was going).  I had a train of probably 100 frogs (all green at the time), who were hitting me for like 5 when they hit.  They had me trapped on a big ladder where I died.  I was so pissed about that he he =)  Somone in the zone commented that was one of the largest collections of frogs they had ever seen =)<br />
<br />
I miss the old days of Cyclops island =)  And how cool Howling Stones used to be!  I remember the first time I broke into the first hall way there and about crapped my pants when I got HTed by like 4 mobs!  Those were the days =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I deleted all my SS 6 month ago, was a great memory to find the fisrt one. it was from a bug involving the raft in halas. it was movig in loop from the docks to the wall the the city name and then warping back. I remember it was quite uneasy to get to the bank cause if you touched the raft at the intersection, you were imediatly port back on the dock with it. was a great time seeing all the noob (including me at that time) trying to avoid that. it was also my first met with GMs (one of them was the first troll I've seen!).<br />
definitively my best experience was my noobish time, when I was amised by everything , incuding hunts in WC (argh the three zone line long  corpe recovery without counting the cross by the bank to pick up a sword and a torch to find my way inside BB tunels, lol that was impressive at that time).</div></div><hr />
