Want to slap some procs on these but am having a tough time deciding.  I usually play maintank, so aggro and armor are important, but don't want to lose out on the damage dealing.   <br />
<br />
What would you recomend?<br />
<br />
Should I be looking for a DD?  Lifetap?  Guard of some sort?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help in advance.<br />

<br />
Anyway.. to answer your question:<br />
<br />
Pure aggro: Anger augment<br />
Pure DPS: 150 DD (anything) augment<br />
Aggro / DPS: Ykesha augment<br />
<br />
In your case maybe an Anger augment on one weapon, and an Ykesha augment on the other will be fun for you. <br />
<br />
Lifetap procs have neligble aggro, Mirror and Guard augments are,.. well.. lets just say I haven't seen the use of them yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're concerned about damage as well as aggro, I'd go with the ykesha procs.  <br />
<br />
But groups don't invite warriors for damage.. they invite us to get and maintain aggro (and to survive the subsequent beatdown).<br />
<br />
Probably the best compromise is the one already stated... ykesha proc on one weapon, and anger on the other.  Between the two you should get oodles of aggro, and the yak proc will add a few dps for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the real question you should ask yourself?<br />
<br />
Do you want to put hundreds (or thousands) of adventure points worth of augments on what, in my opinion, are less than optimal choices of weapons? That's a serious question for a level 51, who's getting less than 30 AP (possibly under 20 AP) per dungeon.<br />
<br />
For example, putting a 510 point Yak proc on your Horn makes it a mini CHoS in terms of agro and DPS.  13/20 + 100dd/0.0 stun vs. 13/20 +179dd/0.0 stun.  If you had a CHoS, you could take that same augment and make it into a double-proc'ing weapon, an option you don't have with the Horn.  Personally, I feel the AC lost is more than made up by the additional agro.  <br />
<br />
But anyway, if you want to augment those weapons, I'd go the cheapest augment route, since down the road you'll probably get a better agro weapon in your hands, and having the points to augment that with a higher agro proc would be invaluable.  Which one on which?  Probably no real difference there - the Ykesha is rumored to be a little more agro than Anger II, so I'd put that on the VP weapon first, since you're more likely to keep that one around longer (due to the double proc action).  <br />
<br />
One more thing to consider - in 4 levels you'll have a GSoT to use, which would outagro your current weapons, and if augmented, would likely outagro any possible augment combo you could come up with for your current weapons.  Pretty sure it'll out-DPS your weapons too.<br />
<br />
Just something to consider...</div></div><hr />

The Cutlass proc does almost as much dmg and the stun lasts 4 secs with a knockback?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can just walk into the bazaar and buy one off any 5-10 traders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howling Cutlass is 10 / 19 with 4 cha and 4 int.  Proc is 120dd + 4 second stun up to 55.<br />
SotBS is 12 / 19 with 8 sta 4 dex 4 agi 55 hps.  Proc is 75 dd + 0 second stun up to 65.<br />
CHoS is 13 / 20 with 8 str 4 dex 4 agi 65 hps.  Proc is 179 dd + 0 second stun up to 55.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both droga swords have a better ratio than Howling cutlass.  They also have better hps on them.  As for the proc, all proc the same rate, the dd number doesn't matter, and aggro from stun is the same regardless of how long it lasts iirc.  Basically, they have better ratios and stats than howling cutlass with similar proc aggro, and have an aggro proc without augs which rank them higher than the HoH.  Also you can probably sell the HoH for more than the two droga weapons cost =p.  So personally, I would go with droga over your current set up due to reasons listed, though cutlass off with a droga main works pretty good also.</div></div><hr />

Its CRAZY agro.  I have to bag em or it pulls agro off pallies.</div></div><hr />
