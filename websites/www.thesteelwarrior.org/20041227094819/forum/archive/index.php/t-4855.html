<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brachius Butterknife</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having a problem that some others are having, and that some seem to be free of. Don't know why it is random, but maybe someone is working on it? <br />
<br />
My scenario: <br />
<br />
I log into EQ. Check my disciplines and they are all correct, right refresh times and all. I can go anywhere and zone hither and yon. I zone, check discs, everything is fine. as long as I have not USED a disc yet. <br />
<br />
I go to a zone and fight, and USE a disc such as Berate, which has a 30 second refresh. It works great...30 seconds back up. I use Defensive, works great, refresh timer shows 7 minutes or whatever for refresh, after alloted time, its back up. Can't use others discs on that timer of course until then, but that is correct. Works all the way through while you are still in the same zone. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER --- <br />
<br />
As soon as I zone out of a zone after I have used a disc, the refresh timer resets to 6 hours on ANY disc that I have used. Any Disc that has been used previously in that EQ session resets to 6 hours after zoning or porting out of the zone it was initially used in. Has been this way since the new system was implemented. <br />
<br />
I may have it lucky though, it seems that from some of the boards that others are having refresh timers reset to the thousands of hours, heh.  I just have to wait a few hours to use em again, others have to wait for years to tank another big fight  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I have bugged, petitioned, feedback, etc. every day. No response of course. I have looked at the boards and have seen other folks in this same situation asking for help or at least an acknowledgement that the &quot;fixers&quot; were aware of the situation and might be working on it. They seem to have it on ignore :confused:  There has been no response and no solution as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Just wondering how many others are having similar problems and if anyone knows if anything is being done about it or if the Devs are even aware of it? Maybe since it only affects half of us here, it is not seen as a major thing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the forum to express, heh :)<br />

mine gets set at 12hours grrr /rude soe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mine is 8 hours. had i known the bug occured after zoning i would have avoided using any disciplines until i got to my main spot.<br />
<br />
now the servers are down for a patch. they had BETTER be fixing this. i wouldnt mind a little humility in their patch message such as &quot;we use child labor to do our programming thats why it stinks so much and we are sorry and we are getting real programmers to fix all this junk and we will never release a patch without testing it again&quot;. but i doubt we will hear that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the GM's on the chat server acknowledged that the bugged timers is a known problem and is going to be addressed in the tuesday patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">woot ) .. tuesday ) ... well thats not as good as sunday but hey .. they are fixing it :)<br />
<br />
let me add more observations on a workaround. a very crummy workaround yes but it might help someone.<br />
<br />
seems whether i use a discipline or not when i zone the buttons all go down. i think ...well obviously i can only do one experiment per 8 hours.<br />
<br />
but it seems if you log out in THE ZONE YOU PLAN TO FIGHT IN THE NEXT DAY  then when you log in you can have the disciplines work normally until you zone or die. whereas if you change zones after you log on youve just blown it. obviously ldon is out. but some exp zones might be doable.<br />
<br />
in any case i think im playing either my druid or my enchanter on monday and taking tomorrow off (to do my christmas shoppingg.. bah humbugg! no eq!). then ill deal with it when they fail to fix it on tuesday.<br />
<br />
hang in there fellow sufferers you are not alone :)</div></div><hr />
