<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So about halfway into level 57 I said &quot;you know... screw this, let me try to change up my talents slightly.&quot;<br />
<br />
What I did was juggled my 31 arms points a bit and configured it to have 5% 2h damage and 5% polearm crit at the sacrifice of Anger Management and 2 points of Tactical Mastery and 1 point in charge. These points moved to polearm crit.<br />
<br />
Wow...<br />
<br />
+5% crit has totally changed my gameplay for some reason. I was doing approx 110ish dps with my previous polearm on level 51 ogres and had a hard time effeciently soloing evens (would have to bandage/eat far too often). With crit talents and switching my golem (high ac +defense) helm to my old ornate mithril helm when soloing for a total net change of +6 crit %, I brought my avg dps up to 180ish (not incredible I know but...) on level 51s and more amazingly: 110ish dps on +0 mobs!<br />
<br />
I have no clue why this should happen with such a slight tweak but it literally changed my solo play. I immediately finished my felwood quests, finished my ungoro quests in record time (thanks to my much higher dps on low cons) and then moved on to Winterspring and really plowed through most of those quests in one night solo.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this was two nights ago and now I'm level 58 and I just hit a HUGE HUGE power uptick with the ability to finally equip my BRS gear. Going from some lame polearm (Smoldering Claw) to Blackhand Doomsaw alone was like a gift from god (and the new HP/ac doesn't hurt either).<br />
<br />
Basically, this reinforces gear makes and breaks warriors solo. However, I learned a dramatic NEW lesson that is more valuable I believe for those unable to plow through instances and raids frequently:<br />
<br />
Spend the gold and respec to get a higher crit rate if you can. Try swapping out some +STR for +AGI if you got some items available. Experiment with dropping *some* HP/AC for +crit% gear.<br />
<br />
Give it a shot and see how you do, I know it made a huge diff in my overall DPS (much much more than I would expect). I went from a little over 10% crit (base crit + slight agility boost) to close to 17% crit when I noticed the huge difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did protection first, then arms second, up to Deep wounds, and just recently started working on Cruelty, and there's already a very noticable difference in my solo rate 3 ranks into it.<br />
<br />
If you have the right talents, crits add a lot more DPS than it looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say reguardless of talents, crits add a lot more DPS.<br />
<br />
Around 25% of my dmg dealt comes from crits.  Thats around a 10 or 11 % crit rate.  Cant say what weapon type that is on cause I constatly switch between 2h, DW, and 1h+s.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, the bigger the hit the more rage you get for that particular hit.  So more crits, bigger hits, faster rage building.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went straight for crits when I first made Kailynn. Been a crit builder since I payed Fallout. Though thanks to reading this thread I am going to tweek my build a bit and get the +crits in axes (since I seem to have forgoten these lessons I knew).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Btw, I really cranked up my xp even before my crit spec by duoing quests and sticking around after the quests were done to grind on overcon mobs for a bit (usually ogres and stuff).<br />
<br />
Burning Steppes Ogres (level 50-53 mobs so stop around 56) are gimp as well as the ones in Deadwind Pass (level 55-57 mobs).<br />
<br />
Quest xp is golden but travel time can really kill you. I would &quot;plan&quot; quest execution order and my grind time before a night of gameplay with a friend of mine and we really kicked ass.<br />
<br />
If you want to duo from 55-60 an excellent location is Blackrock Stronghold. I hear you can effeciently solo here at later levels also (mind the rough pulls in some spots).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That 25% number is misleading though, because it also counts the damage you would have done without the crit.  If you halve that, you get a more realistic 12.5% damage added from crits, which is about what the math works out to.<br />
<br />
Crits have their benefits, especially when you have talents that utilitze crits to function (DW, etc), just saying that seeing 25% damage from crits doesn't mean that 25% is all from crits.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went Axe Crit and Cruelty... didn't notice that polearm spec gave crit...  but yes High Crit percentage is incredible for soloers or anyone who wants to generate alot of rage. I crit as often or more often then I miss Dual wielding... and my big axe hits often crit for 500-900 dmg. Saved my butt PvP with a lvl 48 rogue at lunch. I was almost done like 20% left on my life. MS popped I switched got two back to back crits and execute off.... 45% of the rogue health gone in just a few seconds... lol he was like &quot;!!! OMG what the hell happened&quot; I have like 75 hp left at then end of the duel. Almost dropped a 58 Mage when I charged and got a lucky series of crits back to back.... note im only lvl 46 atm. Crits probably count for 60-70% of my dmg output right now so Im obviously a big advocate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are the pulls here?  Been looking for a decent place with 55-57 mobs to parse some stuff.  I assume what makes them gimp is the standard Ogre low-armor?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like ogres because<br />
<br />
 They don't run away<br />
 If you aren't stupid you will get single pulls almost all the time (even by &quot;charge pull&quot; in most cases)<br />
 They don't seem to have high armor<br />
 Lots of ogre mages that really seem to enjoy meleeing so one pummel/bash is usually enough<br />
 They drop runecloth and cash to sustain my bandage and potions needs :)<br />
 They don't poison, disease, curse, snare, or otherwise make my chain soloing life miserable<br />
 They were my favorite unit in warcraft 2!<br />
 <br />
<br />
Depending on your level you can usually kill 2-4 ogres in a row before bandaging.<br />
<br />
My attack sequence:<br />
<br />
- charge<br />
- battle shout<br />
- if ogre mage, switch to zerk stance to pummel first cast (usually all I need) and switch back to battle<br />
- demoralize if I feel like it (I didn't usually as I leveled up)<br />
- wait till 30 rage to mortal strike and repeat until execute to finish off<br />
<br />
That simple :p Thankfully, I prefer to quest but when I need to xp grind or replenish runecloth/cash the firegut ogre clan is there to please.<br />
<br />
One more thing, I tested out the &quot;cheesy weapon swap&quot; technique on low cons last night and it worked extremely well. <br />
<br />
As a 57 warrior versus level 51 ogres, they hardly did any damage to me so I could kill 4-5 in a row. I thought, hey they are -6 mobs I bet dual wield would hardly miss on them so I set up my stance sets to look like this on battle stance:<br />
<br />
- thrashblade/random 35 dps sword with stamina<br />
- 3.8s delay 45dps blue level 45 axe (forgot the name sorry)<br />
<br />
Charge, attack till overpower or MS lit up, hit switch with my mouse and press the overpower/ms key on keyboard a split second apart and then after I hear the &quot;woosh/splat&quot; hit the switch button again back to DW.<br />
<br />
Brought my dps up about 30-50% (they will undoubtedly fix weapon swapping sometime soon). Luckily I hit 58 shortly afterwards, equipped my new polearm, and now I just sit on my polearm and don't bother to DW ever.<br />
<br />
As for deadwind ogres, yeah easy to single pull or even &quot;single charge.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good to see my advice didnt totally get ignored, even if only for a short while.... It's a tactic I intend to use until the devs decide to fix it. 30-50% increase in dps seems fairly accurate and with high crits the switch is particularly invaluable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never doubted that it works that way for Overpower/MS, but I highly doubt you're getting an actual swing on top of the ability in between the dual wield delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can get an additional swing you wouldn't even need to wait for overpower/MS.  You can just repeatedly swap between a slow 2hander (~4s) and 2 fast daggers (1.5s or less) and then you'll end up doing double DPS for just being able to swing the 2H at the speed of the daggers.<br />
<br />
Ogres are nice to kill because even when you get stuff that are undercons they still just hit harder instead of doing stuff that'd cripple your ability to do anything for the next 5 or 30 minutes.  When I was fighting in Ungoro Crater if I fail to interrupt one of the insect's special abilities that increases physical damage by 42% for 5 minutes I usually just afk 5 minutes and come back after because it makes soloing too risky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok here is how my hits normally go. dual wield first charge... 50 160 75 90 170 switch for MS 455/270 switch back to dual wield 80 125 95 165 75 dodge 170 switch 425/275/625 (with Overpower/regular hit then a MS) You can add a few misses in when I'm dual wielding but my dual wield set up is 1.5 speed so misses come back to back with hits so I really don't notice them much. so instead of getting a 200ish dmg MS when dual wielding I get a much bigger MS from the 2hander and one additonal swing from my 2h then I switch back immediately. Din should be able to confirm this as well if he did it for any amount of time like he says. I don't get off work for more then 30 minutes in between jobs until Saturday morning, but I'll post a combatlog as soon as I get the opportunity.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT- The 2hander still seems to operate at 3.8 speed so the quickest I can switch back and get a hit with it is 3.8-4 seconds after it hits in conjunction with my MS. Which works perfectly because MS has a 6 Second refresh. I can't switch hit switch to dual wield and back immediately because the 2handers refresh timer is still running while I dual wield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not what you made it sound like in the other thread.<br />
<br />
You're only getting the extra weapon damage from the MS then, since if your 2h is the same DPS roughly as your DW combo, you wouldn't be gaining anything from leaving it equipped for a hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DPS and Raw dmg are two different things.... Flurry Axes dps is 35.3 because its speed is so fast at 1.5 but its raw dmg is 37-69 + what ever my attack power adds meaning my MS only hits for 170-225 (Non-crit) usually. Now the 2h axe I use Executioner Cleaver is 41.5 dps becuase the speed is 3.8, but it's raw dmg hits for 127-191 dmg (about 30 more raw dmg then the standard Truesilver Champion) + what my attack power adds meaning MS hits for 275-425 non-crit... and its regular hits are 170-300 dmg non-crit. So when I switch I double my MS dmgvs what my dual wield combo could have done and get an additional MS dmg equivalent hit from the 2hander. Then instead of waiting for a slow refresh to hit again I can continue with dual wielding. So I get roughly 6-8 MS quality hits (in comparison to the 200 x 2 dmg my dual wielding could have done with two MS hits) every 6 or 7 seconds on top of my normal dual wield dps which does generates alot more rage since I crit roughly every 3-4 hits and my hits come faster dual wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're confusing yourself.<br />

<br />
Seperate ideas here.  What you're doing for Mortal strike is one thing, but letting the axe swing again is not on top of your normal DPS, it's INSTEAD of.<br />
<br />
Swapping in for the mortal strike/overpower is increasing your DPS, but leaving a 41 dps axe equipped for a hit after that when you could be dual wielding 35.3 dps axes is actually probably reducing your DPS, since i'm pretty sure your offhand can come up with 6 dps.<br />
<br />
Yes, raw damage and DPS are 2 different ideas, and you sound like you're getting them confused.  Getting a 200 hit because you left in a 2h for 4 seconds doesn't mean that you're getting an extra 50 dps on top of your dual wield DPS because you're not dual wielding during that time.<br />
<br />
I'll make the point again to make sure you understand.  Swapping in a weapon for Mortal strike DOES increase your dps, leaving it in for an extra hit isn't doing anything for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one hit lands at the same time as the MS since MS acts independantly of weapon swing... ie. 355/275 vs my normal dual wield hit for 200 without a break in attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dude, no.<br />
<br />
The mortal strike lands when you hit the button.  You can swap in the axe, MS and it will land immediately.<br />
<br />
The axe swings when the delay is up.  The only way it swings at the same time as Mortal strike is if you leave the axe there for 4 seconds and then hit Mortal strike. <br />
<br />
Mortal strike being independant of the weapon swing means that they DON'T need to land at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hit comes immediately as long as its been more then 3.8 seconds since that weapon was last used, if its attack refresher is up so it hits immediately. Then I return to dual wielding no break in attacks no waiting four seconds for my 2hander to hit again. It literally lands like a double MS usually doing 3-6 times the amount of dmg my Flurry axe could have hit doing MS. Seems like the only way your gonna understand is when I post a combatlog or may Din can do it tonight to show you. Since I dont get off work til Saturday morning.... two full time jobs = sucks when your a game addict.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then I return to dual wielding no break in attacks no waiting four seconds for my 2hander to hit again. <br />
<br />
You're confused.<br />
<br />
You're dual wielding.<br />
You switch to 2h.<br />
You wait 4 seconds.    &lt;---- HERE IS THE PAUSE WHERE YOU ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING AND THERE IS A BREAK IN YOUR ATTACKS.<br />
You mortal strike<br />
Your regular attack lands.<br />
You switch back to dual wielding.<br />
<br />
It is not ON TOP of your DPS, it is INSTEAD OF.<br />
<br />
Not sure how I can explain it any clearer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly Haass you don't switch do the Mortal Strike and wait four seconds for the weapon to swing.... it hits at the same time as the Mortal Strike. I don't know how to state it any clearer. As long as its been 3.8 seconds since the last time i switched from 2h weapon to dual wield the weapon will hit immediately once its equipped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great, post a log.<br />
<br />
If that's the case, it's a bug, because like Phantron said, all you'd have to do is swap in your 2h every time the delay comes up and you could dual wield and use a 2h at the same time.<br />
<br />
Lets get er fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">clearer ? I dunno. But once more can't do wrong:<br />
the delay (of a weapon) is apply before the land (it takes time to swing the weapons before actually touching the mob) and not after. So what you experience is:<br />
1. you DW. You landed a hit on the mob., and start waiting the delay to hit the mob again.<br />
2. you switch to 2Her, cutting in the process your delay of the DW (you stop swinging the DW in the middle of the movement) and start the delay of your 2Her (you start swinging your 2Her).<br />
3. you activate MS during the delayy of your 2Her and it the mob with MS (instant cast, bonus swing).<br />
4. the delay of your 2Her is finish and your normal swing land on the mob.<br />
5. a new swing begin ( the 2Her is in process).<br />
6. you switch back to DW, cutting in the process your 2Her delay (you stop swinging your 2Her) and beginning the delay of your DW.<br />
7. the delay of your DW finish, you landed your hits on the mob and a new delay is in the process.<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Got it ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume the 27 was dual wield and the 196 and MS was with the 2h.<br />
<br />
This is a bug then, this is not game mechanics.  The 2h delay should start when your last dual wield swing ends.  For some reason it's not.  I can promise that this is now what is intended and it's gonna be fixed soon.</div></div><hr />

This is more common then the first MS notice I sundered multiple times instead of popping MS a second time. I usually solo on the Same ogres you did your combatlog on, just didn't have enough time to run out to them... just found the first lvl 46 I could find. I don't think it's as much a bug as you make it out to be since the 2hander operates on it's own timer independant of my dual wield attacks, and can only be used every 4-6 seconds. Devs have allowed this to work this way since Beta obviously they have more important matters to work out then worry if a few warriors find a way to increase their dps. Still doesn't mean we are anywhere near being as overpowered as pallies.... still have trouble killing them even tho I drop their health bar 4 or 5 times.... rogues usually end up really surprised when I fight like this with them. And as of now I haven't met a single warrior who uses weapon switch on the Dalaran server so its not a rampant issue in game.<br />
<br />
EDIT- 2444 dmg in 17 seconds, only popped MS once and Overpower once 143 dps...</div></div><hr />

<br />
On low con mobs, your hit/crit rate is significantly higher so it mitigates much of the DW penalty and you really start closing in on a much higher dps from dual wielding in addition to a higher rage gen.<br />
<br />
So my suspicion is unless you have a *sick* dual wield setup:<br />
<br />
- just use your twohander even when not mortal striking<br />
<br />
On low cons:<br />
<br />
- parse it out, sometimes dual wielding might be higher raw &quot;auto attack&quot; non-MS/overpower dps than your raw two handed dps. Typically your dual wielded rage gen is going to be higher so there is a point of overlap where your rage gen from dual wielding allows you to fuel your mortal strike rage sink faster than simply swinging your two hander.</div></div><hr />

In 17 Seconds he did on average 700-1100 dmg vs an even con. <br />
I usally quick grind exp on the lvl 44 hyena's in tanaris if I'm stocked up good with bandages and I'm not looking for mageweave/silk drops from the ogres. at -2 they drop unbelievably fast and I don't need to waste rage on sunders so I do that much more dmg because MS has more rage to work with. I rarely get to use 3 MS's. 2h does most of my dmg and dual wield generates alot of rage its a good system. And yes the faster you dual wield set up the better. A 2.1 speed average dual wield speed won't make it too much more useful to MS Switch. Maybe thats why I haven't seen alot of warriors doing this since alot have a hard time saving up for one set of weapons.... and thats prolly why the devs dont see this as a problem since its expensive or time consuming to get two good sets of weapons.</div></div><hr />

I assume the first hit is DW, second hit is 2H.  Like I have been saying, you end up doing roughly double DPS for just switching to a 2H weapon in a setup like this. <br />
<br />
So it's not horribly surprising you have a much easier time soloing when you can do double DPS.</div></div><hr />

Looks like the 2h delay kicks in after the swap, just not for the mortal strike.<br />
<br />
That is,<br />
<br />
17.890 Last of DW swinging on DW timers<br />
17.890 ---------------- 30 rage available<br />
18:160 Swap weapons &amp; Mortal strike (instant)<br />
21.900 First combat hit after MS<br />
<br />
That is a 21.9 - 18.16 = 3.74s delay between his mortal strike and his normal swing schedule kicking in again.<br />
<br />
Also it is a 18.16 - 17.89 = 0.27 delay on his last dual wield swing and his MS -- that's basically instantaneous so it seems that while the MS ability after the weapon swap is still Instant (thank god), swapping weapons did adversely affect his total combat stream.<br />
<br />
Looks like there *is* a weapon swap delay, it is the delay of the weapon you swapped out of and that is probably as intended.<br />
<br />
Again, this &quot;cheesy swapping&quot; for overpowers and mortal strikes is only effecient when your dual wielding setup's normal dps and rage gen rate powering your swapped weapon's MS exceeds your normal setup. Seems to me that this isn't as common of a scenario as one might expect. I also don't think this is an exploit in any way since weapon swapping was clearly enabled in combat for a reason -- probably not for this one but it is not overpowering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was seeing great dps because my polearm was 2.9s and when I experimented with the &quot;swap and MS&quot; technique I used two mid 50s grade swords and swapped in a 3.8s weapon for the MS. Finally, I was using this on mobs 6 levels lower so my DW damage was even higher comparatively than it would be on even mobs.<br />
<br />
It would be nice for people to post their own setups and DPS increases they see by doing this. I am sure it is not 40-60% increase on even level mobs on average.</div></div><hr />

works damn good when you're tanking too.  And I highly doubt you'll win much at PvP w/o weapon swapping the way things are right now.  Its definatly not an exploit when they put a programming language (http://www.lua.org/) in the UI macro's for just this sort of thing.<br />
<br />
dunno bout yall but my overpower button looks like this (i use Cosmos btw):<br />
/equip Whirlwind Axe<br />
/cast Overpower (Rank 3)<br />
<br />
its nothing to be tanking away in def, see the mob dodge, pop into battle (the - key on my numpad) and hit the above macro for some reaaaally good dmg.  I have hotkeys set up F10 - DW  F11 - 1h+s  F12 - 2h, so after that i hit F10 then the + key on my numpad (def stance) and i'm back in business.  However, I dont start swinging till the end of my current 2h swing. I'll just stand there looking simply fabulous.<br />
<br />
For just doing it with Overpower, TM1 is all you need.<br />
<br />
replace /cast Overpower with /cast Mortal Strike (or even /cast Concussion Blow : ) and get the same thing coming outta DW or 1h+s.  Neither require a stance change.</div></div><hr />

to work? Telling the UI to equip an item in my experience simply que's that action and anything in a macro after that doesnt parse. <br />

For instance I used to have a sword based combat build (I use daggers these days until seal fate is fixed) and tried to make a macro to hotswap in a dagger and then do ambush and it would never work.</div></div><hr />

It won't autmatically equip your 2hander and then overpower, but I find it pretty simple to just hit &quot;v&quot; with my thumb (my weapon swtich key), overpower, then &quot;v&quot; again.</div></div><hr />
