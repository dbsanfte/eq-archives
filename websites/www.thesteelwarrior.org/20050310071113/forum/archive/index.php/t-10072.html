One liner and lock the thread?  What happened?  Seems like there's enough stuff on the float to warrant one...</div></div><hr />

It won't go anywhere, but if you guys would like me to reopen it for 6 months of discussion that's fine. I just didn't want  to derail all the good ideas in it with speculations of why it would be postponed.</div></div><hr />

Those of us on Veeshan (and serverwide based on the GUComics post) were pissed this happened. Best GM we ever had.</div></div><hr />

Yeah sorry, didn't mean to imply it was your fault or anything... was just curious if there was any more info to be had.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope no info at all. At first I had assumed it was because of Tom being fired, but apparently they're trying to have it go along with the next fan faire, which is supposed to happen in june. Both the summit and the fan faire will take a hit without him though.</div></div><hr />
