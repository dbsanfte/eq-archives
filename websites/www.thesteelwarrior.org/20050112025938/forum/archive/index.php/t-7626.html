Scimitar's proc takes up a buff slot. At that stage of the game, that alone makes it suck. Serpent's Bite has about the least aggro you can get from any proc in all of EQ (that isn't a direct hate reduction proc, i.e. Confusing Whisper or Khalshazar's Deceit).  I think both would be wasted DKP for a warrior, for the most part.</div></div><hr />

very good points there..but what about dps..?</div></div><hr />

Come one the day DPS becomes the factor in weapon selection is the day you need to reroll as rogue.<br />
<br />
26/21 is surely better, but no way any warrior in his right mind will bother with a<br />
nuisance as an extra buff proc for &quot;some DPS&quot;.</div></div><hr />

lol Well tell me Emilia..when you are in a group, are the only weapons you ever use DBOTW and EOE? I personally have tons of weapons that I use in all sorts of situations. Not to mention after the procs, the dmg/dly becomes a factor in taunt too. Personally, I think DBOTW + Demerix wouldn't be a bad combo if both augged with anger 3. Gain more HP/AC..dps...loose a small bit of proc aggro. I mean you tell me Emilia, between EOE/CBS/Demerix, you would prefer EOE just because of the proc? If EOE had anger or Rage on it I could understand but its just time snap.  Plus a lifetap is always a ++ imo..even though the taunt isn't so great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use DBOTW+Painsipper in offhand. I previously used DBOTW+Anger3 augged EoE. The loss of stun proc+anger3 in the offhand have been surprisingly unnoticeable(although i gained 15 combat effects around the same time, so might have offset the proc loss slightly). <br />
<br />
Once they make augs removable so I can move my EoE's anger3 proc to the demerix I will be a very happy camper.<br />
<br />
As for painsipper versus CBS I prefer the slightly better stats on the painsipper over the cbs(HP/AC), and I think on some mobs that the buffslot you can risk losing from the scimitar might be an annoyance. I am also &quot;hoping&quot; that 26 delay will mean slightly less ripostes compared to 21 delay.<br />
<br />
Agro wise the scimitar probably have a very slight edge because of the rune like proc, but it depends if you can/want to live with fact that it might occasionally block an important in-combat buff like BoV or MGB wood/paragon/CR etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway, besides all that, the painsipper simply look badass on an ogre hehe.<br />
<br />
With 225hp primary+250hp offhander, using 2-handers is beginning to look alot less attractive. I used to switch to my vanazir after disc run out, but now the stat loss is so big I usually just stick with the dbotw+painsipper setup through all fights.<br />
<br />
When I'm not MTing and want to be sure not to get agro, I bag the DBOTW, mainhand the painsipper and offhand the EoE. Then I can lean back and just pop fellstrike and not worry too much about agro. Nice for afternoon clearings of the Qvic Minis and stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the things people suggested when they asked for Oow warrior AA suggestions was an AA ability to give more buff slots.  That would absolutely own, and id pay any amount for that personally ;p<br />
<br />
If that eventually is something that does get put in, the rune from the CBS wouldnt be as big of a factor as it is now.  Just something to keep in mind for the future, although we dont know what sorta weapons will be in Tacvi, etc.  So you might not even be using the weapon come august.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got crappy weapons (Thx 2 DBlade in 27 kills). So its BoW/Sews for me.<br />
<br />
Sews is nice &amp; funny for XP, but its a pure nightmare in raids.<br />
NEVER EVER LOOT A WEAPON WITH A BUFF.<br />
<br />
Having to keep 3 spell slots open for DI / Rune / Elixir.<br />
Then 2 more spell slots open for debuffs. And maximising your buffs &amp; clickys.<br />
Is a problem, i dont want the extra rune fucking things up.<br />
<br />
I would trade EoE for Demerix without any second thought (or JoS).<br />
For the stats mainly, not for the DPS or for the Agro.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet everyone with DBoW would use a 20/30 50ac 350hp procless offhander if they could.<br />
Just for the stats.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;non tanking DPS&quot; i agree its a necessity, to maximise our utility.<br />
Still CBS just say no ! <br />
Demerix/JoS or JoS/Demerix if you are lazy is a nice solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cm66</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well the CBS wouldnt be bad for group situations imo, worth an aye as well if your guild doesn't charge a lot for it and no more rogues/rangers want hehe. I don't know how common a drop it is, but it does drop off a mob that respawns in 6 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it does drop off a mob that respawns in 6 hours.<br />
<br />
Iqthinxa drops it, correct?  That's not a 6 hour respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a lot more than 6h (more like 3 4 days i think) and its not a 3 group kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah sorry about that, wasn't sure..was just going on a guess on the respawn :P Is the crynosure 3-4days as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes both on the same spawntime cycle. and btw CBS looks ugly  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think its the black blade of rain graphic? (pally 1hs scimitar from BoT boss)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no it looks like pally 1h scmitar drop from BoT tower boss(chaos). a little different tho its red tribal engraved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cm66</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A guildie just got one last night. I think they look kinda cool, but thats just my opinion hehe. It does not look like the VZ weapon, its a small scimitar that is black with red marks all over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it looks like a black EoE with red runes.</div></div><hr />

I have considered a Fleshbiter as one my fellow warriors in the guild got the first and says good things about it, also I have read here it is quality and on par with dbotwl.<br />
<br />
Our first 2 CBS have gone to warriors also,  I personaly am a little reluctant to rune procs, as I am normaly close to full buffs and clicking some off by the time we are about to do something important. <br />
<br />
Also with CBS when it procs wouldn't the rune effect almost immediantly be used if you tanking(never used a weapon with the effect runic or rune1,2,3)?<br />
<br />
I'm rather confident that demerix +  anger 3, will be sufficient agro until a more reliable mainhand comes along(db if we do time again, FB, or w/e Brutish Blades is around).</div></div><hr />
