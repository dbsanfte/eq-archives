We are often a bit slow killing the 3 minis, because we aren't executing rooting very well.  Ususally when we get them dead we have about 3 minutes left to kill Coirnav.  But then the 4th waave of babies just kicks our ass.  We've tried using 1 or 2 people to train them away, but they died fast.  We've tried AE mez/stun on them, but the instant they get loose they wipe the chanters then the healers then the rest of the raid.  We've tried simply ignoring them and zerging Coirnav.  The best we've done is get him down to 34%, in 7 attempts.  What technique will give us the highest chance of success?</div></div><hr />

We had a lot of spare time to screw around, but I sorta didn't realize it in the heat of battle, so after 3 Pally DA's failed to get the mobs away, we eventually just went in and blew Coirnav up. It was a close thing, the trash was definitely a problem.<br />
<br />
I dunno when we'll need to do him again, but our strategy will probably depend a lot on timing. If you have enough time to handle the  Coirnav adds as a 4th wave, then you'll probably be home free.<br />
<br />
As far as the 3 named go, we typically just pull and tank them all simultaneously.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you have the execution right.  Coirnav is all about applying massive amounts of reckless dps.  Wizards burn, Trueshot, you name it is to be applied.  The moment Coirnav dies, the 4th wave of adds instantly depop.  Think of it that way. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
When did the last-wave adds get teathered?  Used to have DA folks (bards typically) aggro em and train up the tunnels till dead or at the zone in...<br />
