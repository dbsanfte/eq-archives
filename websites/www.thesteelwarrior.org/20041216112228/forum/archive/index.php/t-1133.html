<br />
My Guild went up there this weekend, and got whiped on the Spiroc Island where the Puller somehow pulled the whole Island.  Lucky after the Whipe we did get a Bridge set up to the Spiroc Island so going back is gonna be easy next week.  So just wondering if anybody has any knowledge on this area on where tthe puller should pull from, any certain tricks needed.<br />
<br />
Thanks This is the last Piece I need for my Epic, and would like to get it completed.</div></div><hr />

Then just pic one and pull. If ya get lucky you will get 2 sets, 2 Vanq's and their associated mobs. If ya not lucky ya will get all 3 Vanqs. If ya get real unlucky ya will spread aggro to the Lord and get Death Touched. <br />
<br />
Having a few enchanters along helps a lot, have them each target a mob ahead of time. Then have MT get on a Vanq, all assist him and have other tanks offtank the other Vanq's.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it matters but read in some guide to kill the rest in alphabetical order and that seemed to work well. Listened to a raid a couple weeks ago trying it with 8 people, as we were up ahead clearing Bees and Drakes and they had a lot of trouble. Were down to one Vang and its 2 pals but kept getting DT'd by lord every time they tried to pull. Then they finally got a good pull, killed Vanq but had its pal still keep respawning each time they killed it.<br />
<br />
Course then once they finally got it, they didnt have enough DPS for Lord, lost too many to DT and ended up wiping. But like you they got a Bridge set up to try again another day.</div></div><hr />

He needs the highest sort of pacification, but I think that stopped the chain aggro of the Lord.</div></div><hr />
