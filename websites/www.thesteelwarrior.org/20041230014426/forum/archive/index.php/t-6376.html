If it only adds 1 sta point that would be 6 hp for 1 AA I get more alot more hp when I get a regular level so I thought that couldnt be how it worked someone suggested to me that it was 6 hp times your lvl in that case I would gain 306hp ( i'm 51 ) which is alot more then a regualar level so which way does it work?</div></div><hr />

The hps you get from stamina is determined by level but I assure you it is not 6x level per stamina. <br />
<br />
Basically you get 6hps per stamina if you are level 60-65 (less if a lower level) up to 255 stamina. From 255-305 stamina you get around 4hps per stamina.</div></div><hr />

sta is somewhat easy to max with gear while dex agi chr are slightly harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you get to AA 350 or so and still don't have maxed stamina.  Worry about it then.  There are more important things to spend points on.</div></div><hr />

Improved Metabolism III would have netted me a better return when I was doing my 6 points in General (whups!), as I'm always forgetting to eat my fish cakes to stay full.  I'm lazy. :p  The bonus is you get to keep changing yer payoff - max yer STA, and switch to DEX food, or swap out for some Resist food when yer up against an AE encounter.  And with stat food, you can get more STA then from the Innate Stamina alone.<br />
<br />
If yer looking to finish the 6 in General, I suggest Run III and Improved Metabolism III.</div></div><hr />

Agree.  Sta is not a good bang for your buck if your sta isn't maxed, and someday your sta will be maxed from gear, making it completely useless.  Get everything except +int first.</div></div><hr />
