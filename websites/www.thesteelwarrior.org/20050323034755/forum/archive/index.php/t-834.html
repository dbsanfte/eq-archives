<br />
Are there any camps in Cazic Thule that a 60 Warrior, 60 Druid(about 3800mana), 60 Ranger, 60 Paladin and 56 Rogue do?  Not having any CC worries me :(<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you remember this was THE place to xp pre pop so this group will do fine.<br />
<br />
Sewers I wouldn't recomend they not so ez to single pull with ranjar/druid and druid wont be able to keep up with heals on 2 uslowed sewer mobs.<br />
<br />
can do any maze camps can do that tunel where aligator used to be. Just let ranjar/druid harmony pull.<br />
<br />
Althought at some point you most likeley will die so having no cleric in uderpopulated zone can be problematic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sewer? Yes it can be done. At one point, you will get 2 mobs in 1 pull no wonder what (Can't harmony pull coz mobs are in the water). If you can handle 2 mobs, you are golden. <br />
<br />
Sewer is most of the time an easy camp IF you do not do funny things. Work out what mobs to get pulled in 1 20-minute cycle. Stick with those mobs.<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, there was a See-invis named Lizard guarding right outside the door leading to sewer. Needless to say, my grp got wiped out clean. CR was painful too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you look at group make up and levels I wound NOT sugest sewers with druid(probably not FT15 druid) as only healer no haste. no CC and mobs hitting ~200 fast on warrior with few AAs IIRC. Plus they havent hunted in zone much as you can tell from post. Sewer is not the place to be witht his group.<br />
<br />
DO:<br />
Zone In - there is a chance for a named here too<br />
Maze - perfect for you group. I'd setup at wiz spire (dont talk to gnome) or just in tunell to the right of entrance door.<br />
Down The wall past pirnhas - in that hallwaay where ritualist spawns - should be ez to pull with harmony<br />
<br />
DONT DO:<br />
Piranhas<br />
Sewer<br />
4 conners / Pyra - you wont be able to handle those nameds some are hasted and hit 400 and flury<br />
<br />
Thats all the camps there are really in this zone. Its not that big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cervesa</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maze is probably your best bet, but if you're there for specific loot, you should be fine anywhere besides pyramid area.<br />
<br />
Get a KEI first<br />
<br />
If ranger has earthcaller MOBs will be MUCH easier.  With your ToD and his earthcaller you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
60 Pally rez is just fine, there's not even a 1% xp differance between his and a 60 clerics, MOBs are really easy to park if your group knows what it's doing moving around is NP.<br />
<br />
You'll have more downtime than you would with a chanter or shammy, but you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Add a shaman and you can do fine anywhere.  Crowd control is nice, but not necessary if each mob is slowed and you've got enough tanks.<br />
<br />
I'd be real wary without a shaman or a chanter tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd try the zone in for a bit, to get a feel for the place.  Most mobs can be pacified very easily, I assume that harmony works as well.  The courtyard just past the entrance is a good place to get your feet wet.  Every mob can be single pulled with the proper use of pacify and an awareness of mob line of sight aggro.<br />
<br />
The mobs that are really the most difficult are the ones that cast AE damage spells and slows.  Bane of Thule is a nasty slow/dot that many of the casters proc as well.<br />
<br />
Once you have a feel for how tough the mobs are and what you're able to deal with, I'd consider going in deeper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume that harmony works as well<br />
<br />
Harmony works quite nicely.  Spent much time at zone in pulling CY farming blood for a smith friend.  Me(60 to 62 war at the time), 60 shammie and 61 druid could pull almost the whole CY before respawn.  I am hoping that if the exp change that is on test now goes live to all servers, that CT will be a great place to exp.  It is  so  much more fun than most PoP zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gartogg</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a ToD you can do sewers with that group with no problems, actually I think you'd be ok without it as well, I've done sewers with myself, 61 druid, 59 rogue, and 55 pally.  The first pull of 2 is a bit rough but after that its not a problem, and the druid could easily keep up with heals, and if the ToD proced it was even better.  I might let the pally tank and you be slower since he has a self only haste spell and will be able to hold aggro very easily while you using a ToD won't do so well till it procs.<br />
<br />
I think sewers is one of the easiest camps as you dont' have to deal with the nasty shaman lizard mobs that you do upstairs, their AoE are pretty nasty on a group with 1 healer.<br />
<br />
My normal exp group almost never has any CC other than the druid for rooting (no good in CT druid root will get mobs to summoning health fairly quickly) and now a beastlord who can offtank and we can do some pretty crazy stuff that most ppl won't try without an enchanter.</div></div><hr />
