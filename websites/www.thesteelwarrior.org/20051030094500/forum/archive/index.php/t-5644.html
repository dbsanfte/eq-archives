<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the new information about proc rates, here is the new and improved all inclusive warrior usable weapon listing. This is for all known weapons through the end of LDoN, this DOES NOT include any GoD weapons as of yet. We can update that list when we get that information.<br />
<br />
ALL warrior useable weapons NOT on the list:<br />
If you do not find the weapon you are inquiring about on the list below, then you can expect a proc rate similar to this:<br />
<br />
For mainhand weapons:<br />
305 DEX - 2.0 ppm<br />
205 DEX - 1.5 ppm<br />
105 DEX - 1.0 ppm<br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as we can tell, all proc augments and spell procs follow the above rule for proc rates. Augment proc and spell proc rates DO STACK with a weapons innate proc rate. If you have a standard weapon, augment it and cast a spell proc on it, you will get approximately 6.0 ppm. When adding procs to weapons with innate procs, each successive proc will have an insignificantly smaller proc rate due to the way weapon procs work. Each time a weapon swing, it starts by checking for an innate proc. If the innate proc does not go off, then it checks for an augment proc. If the augment does not go off, then it checks for a spell proc. Since a weapon can only proc once per swing, as soon as 1 proc does go off, the remaining procs will not even be checked.<br />
<br />
Non-standard proc rate weapons - warrior usable:<br />
<br />
Ethereal Destroyer		1.7 ppm<br />
Snowchipper			1.8 ppm<br />
Spiked Velium Mallet		1.8 ppm<br />
Pebble Crusher			2.02 ppm<br />
Bloody Stone Dagger		2.04 ppm<br />
Tarantella			2.04 ppm<br />
Ishinaear Xiall			2.06 ppm<br />
Acrylia Handled Broadsword	2.06 ppm<br />
Partisan of Stampede		2.08 ppm<br />
The Sword of Ssraeshza		2.1 ppm<br />
Fiercewind			2.1 ppm<br />
Ivory Hilted Cleaver		2.1 ppm<br />
Obsidian Scimitar of War	2.5 ppm<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord	2.6 ppm<br />
Greatstaff of the Four Winds	2.6 ppm<br />
Bloodfrenzy			3.1 ppm<br />
Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled	3.3 ppm<br />
Barbed Fishing Net		4.0 ppm<br />
<br />
It should be noted that all weapons with an increased proc rate of less than 10% will have such a small increase in procs that it is virtually impossible to tell a difference without parsing many hours of combat. The difference is also small enough that it could mistakenly be attributed to standard deviation or a 'streaky RNG'. For all intents and purposes, the exception list for warriors is basically Obsidian Scimitar of War, Darkblade of the Warlord, Greatstaff of the Four Winds, Bloodfrenzy, and Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled. The Barbed Fishing Net is a throwing weapon, it cannot really be included. The remaining weapons do not have an increase large enough to be noticed.<br />
<br />
P.S. -  Fancy words confuse me =((((</div></div><hr />

While innate proc buffs do indeed follow the 2 proc per minute rule, early parsing by the Paladins seems to show that the Weapons Affinity AA, while causing the weapon's proc rate and augmented proc rate to rise, it does not affect proc buffs directly. In fact, due to the exclusive nature of procs, it causes more overlapped procs, thus fewer innate procs. While only warriors with the Vex Thal and Time clickies will care, it is important to note.</div></div><hr />

Hi. I have been trying to find a way to determine relative proc rates of weapons using the data collected by item collectors. Lucy doesn't show most of the information that it doesn't know the purpose of, but eqemu's database has everything. I have downloaded it, and by looking at cleric weapons and other things, I have found a field that seems to be related to proc rate.<br />
<br />
The field is called unknown070 by the eqemu database. It does not appear to be collected by Lucy/Alla. There are only 38 items in the game that have a non-zero value for this field. Here is what I found...<br />

I am pretty firmly of the mindset that this *is* the field that determines unusual proc rates. Note that each of the cleric summoned hammers (Judgment, Divinity, Souls, Damantion) has a progressively higher value, and the Vallon Zek and Saryn hammers have the same value as the best summoned hammer. Also, the Cudgel you guys are talking about has the lowest value.<br />
<br />
I have no parses though, so I don't know how this value translates into acutal units of time.<br />
<br />
Can you perhaps use this information along with your parses to get some understanding of this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, cant know how to handle the table aspect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well,<br />
<br />
Call me silly, but it appears the numbers are pretty easy to calculate.<br />
<br />
Lets look at some key items from the shadowknight table and compare them to Wandor's numbers:<br />
<br />
| 8899 | Snowchipper | -10 | 255 |<br />
Snowchipper has -10 to its proc mod.  What if it is -10%?  The default proc rate being 2ppm * 0.90 = 1.8ppm<br />
<br />
| 28855 | Bloodfrenzy | 55 | 0 |<br />
Bloodfrenzy has +55 to its proc mod.  So, 2ppm * 1.55 = 3.1ppm<br />
<br />
| 3820 | Barbed Fishing Net | 100 | 0 |<br />
Barbed fishing net 100, so 2ppm * 2.00 = 4ppm.<br />
<br />
| 22907 | Furious Hammer of Zek | 530 | 0 |<br />
The zek hammer would be 2ppm * 6.30 = 12.6ppm<br />
<br />
Seems to make sense.  I assume Wandor calculated his numbers in the fashion?  or were they from parsing?<br />
<br />
NOTE:  Keep in mind that percentages equate to % / 100.  So 100% = 100/100 = 1.  90% = 90/100 = 0.90, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These numbers are all calculated using the unknown070 field that is now being called procrate mob on Lucy. Most people have an easier time relating to PPM than 15% more procs. The standard baseline weapon proc rate comes from parses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For mainhand weapons:<br />
305 DEX - 2.0 ppm<br />
205 DEX - 1.5 ppm<br />
105 DEX - 1.0 ppm<br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
<br />
why would this be true?  Dual wield fires something like 80% of the time at L65, so wouldn't you expect the proc rate to be a similar percentage of the number of primary hand procs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would expect so.  But it's not, I don't know why but Wandor's numbers come from much parsing by many different people.</div></div><hr />
