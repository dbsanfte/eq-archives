<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so it might be a whee little bit unbalancing, but...well its a good one:<br />
<br />
My ability to hold aggro should be second to none. I should be able to build up such monumental amounts of aggro that the Lord Jesus Christ himself could not turn the mob off of me. I won't play second fiddle to Paladins or Knights. I don't give a fuck. <br />
<br />
When I want aggro, I want to take it, and never give it up. As a matter of fact, I want the aggro so intense that when Im ressed and if the mob we're fighting is still alive, I want it to jump right back the fuck on me, butt ass naked while I'm still looting my corpse.<br />
<br />
I wan't to hold aggro so dominantly that minions of the mob I killed put hit squads out to take out my family, my friends, and some of my coworkers.<br />
<br />
I want aggro so powerful that my aggro, it has aggro of its own. Like my 'taunt button' has its own aggro. My Taunt button should have a small migrant worker built inside that is dual wielding 2 eb weapons and a suitcase nuke full of hate. <br />
<br />
Though no sure this should be here or the outhouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: Hah! /em looks up.</div></div><hr />

You have to love that thought!</div></div><hr />

Haha, good comparison.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thumbs up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And judging from that excerpt, I'd say Furor might actually be Dennis Leary. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Furor is my hero now....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Now that is how you rant.<br />
<br />
&lt;takes notes&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As much as I like to pass Furor's views off as the backlash of a traumatized childhood, he has made o so many valid arguments..and is usually first to do so. Coupling that with his methods of succesfully getting what he wants (to a certain extent) from SOE, he earns the status as number one hard ass (I'm not talking bikini model hard ass either) in my book. And it takes a hard ass to get the best results from anything in life sometimes..<br />
<br />
Rampage on Furor, I'm kinda suprised SOE hasn't given you two giant freaking cajones to weild in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Furor is the man, not everyone likes him, but most respest what he says when he speaks.<br />
<br />
I kind of miss the old ranting and raving he used to to on the FoH webpage.  Always made me laugh!<br />
<br />
/salute Furor, for the countless hours he's put into this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Furor is a bit cynical at times, but he has good points.<br />
<br />
Better than Thottbot's garbage, I guess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SnapricotOrange</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">heh that was pretty funny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">normally hes anoying but this is pretty good =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Konjunktion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If only all warriors could taunt and goad like Furor. I'm sure there'd be no aggro problems.<br />
<br />
-Junk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Too bad that rage can't carry over into the game mechanics :( <br />
<br />
Still, a very nice rant, made me crack up several times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i like the part about how you should still have aggro even when you just got rezzed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">That part could backfire though;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">fuggin funny... <br />
<br />
/e flips a cig butt at SoE at end of rant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shmashed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">yeah, the being rezzed and getting aggro bit was by far funniest.  Im glad we all found different parts of it to be better than others because it just goes to show the whole post is a very solid one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kodi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Classic!  Will have to use some of that in my signature...lol</div></div><hr />
