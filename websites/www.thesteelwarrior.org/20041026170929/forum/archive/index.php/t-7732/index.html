<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dibdab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged 52, and PoJ has started to get pretty slow exp wise and every time I go to PoI i either can't find a group or my group gets whiped. If anyone has any sugestions on where i could get decent exp and find a group fast i'd love to hear it. I'd be even better if the place had pretty good loot.</div></div><hr />

I was lucky and made friends with a few people and was able to grind pretty well through the mid-50's.  I always preferred Nightmare, not sure why just liked the setting and stuff I suppose.</div></div><hr />
