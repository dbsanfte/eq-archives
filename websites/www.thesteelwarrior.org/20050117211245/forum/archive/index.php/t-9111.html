I would agree with that. The mobs seem to be omens-style vxed or tipt level. I parsed 200-300 dps taken against 1700 ac on some of the level 68 or 69 entrance mobs.  It's a more linear zone than WoS so it's a bit safer to pull, etc. Apparently the trials there are pretty cool, too, although I haven't had the chance to do them yet.<br />
<br />
Edit: changed god-style to omens-style</div></div><hr />

They're also easier than Vxed and Tipt mobs, although not by as large of a margin as KT.  I think you'd do fine.</div></div><hr />

I was the puller, as well, and got singles about 99% of the time.<br />

Watch for the random wanderers that see invis, and be sure to respect the 600+ proc that the damn kyvs like to hit you with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saniri</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its one of those places where You'd want to have a Chanter or Shaman for slows again. Untill I guess the Beastlords i usualy group with level up they have a real hard time landing slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doobi Doobidoo</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it for awhile with a below average group and Bst slowing with no croud control. Didn't get the needed help from the ranger with adds, so ended up leaving. Tanking and healing weren't issues tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not bad at all. Those lightning dudes can pack quite a punch when they flurry though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stemcell</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">MPG isn't that tough, just need a healer that isn't sleeping. The mobs are nice and spread out which makes for easy pulling. All mobs are less than level 70 until you get around RSS which then turn to be 70s (except for the named which are red). Root CC is what we used whenever we had adds and havn't had much problems yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">talking about slows, ive played an ench and sham in mgp as bots and almost all the mobs cept for the yellow dog ones mitigate a lot.  one day we lost our ench so rangers and i whipped out our slow sticks. the cleric said he actually found things easier as our slows were landing a bit faster and there wast much difference in dps output.<br />
<br />
its a bit esaier to sustain a camp here as the pulls tend to be quite spaced out, so clericss have a chance to maintain mana.  and yea those lightning dudes can put out some dps when they flurry..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lauralei</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My regular group is all non raiders with no gear other than can be obtained with one group  (I wouldn't say casual, we play a decent amount) and we didn't find MPG too tough.  Pulling was a little tough in some places since we have no way to split, but root parking is fine for CC.  Our tank is 9700 hp with all defensive aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like I need to go there... <br />
<br />
It's a pain but I can tank Kod'Taz and in a pinch tank Vxed as long as we have a good cleric.  In oow i'm just having trouble getting groups with the right mix of classes AND people willing to try something besides sitting by the south CY in wos.  I can't even get most groups to pull in the north CY, let alone go to PG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its challenging.  Can mostly invis deeper into zone and its a very very big place. Mobs get considerably harder in the North end (ya those flurry guys really suck).  If you have a lighter weight group just have them start a heal over time on you before each pull.  Overall one of the best zones I have seen since Howling Stones back in its hey-day.</div></div><hr />
