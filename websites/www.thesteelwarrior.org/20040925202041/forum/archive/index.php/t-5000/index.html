<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sarsippius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i found myself with some time and decided to get into adding more features to my UI.   After coming up with the best design ever for my Combat Abilities window (http://members.cox.net/sarsworld/image/CA_Window.jpg), I started tinkering a bit with the Target Indicator.  I came up with a pretty sweet concept and made a 16 frame animation for this attempt.  <br />

You can add it to any UI by simply downloading it here (http://members.cox.net/sarsippius/SarsTarget1.zip) and placing all of the files into your UI folder....thats all!  Next time you load up EQ it will be working!<br />
<br />
I like it a lot and had a blast making it (graphics are much more fun than code) but I know that I can do even better.  I want to make a special target indicator for the warrior, but I couldnt decide what it would entail.  Think about it and post back if you get any ideas....i want to make a sweet one for all of my fellow meatshields here at TSW.  There are a few limitations but the sky is the limit for the most part!   Cheers and Happy New Year!<br />

<br />
Well done and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, both of those are very nice looking :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very nice looking still wish I could use your UI :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats pretty nice, sars!<br />
<br />
Too bad my fek video card isn't capatible with the target rings =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's a cool targetting ring, does it make you lag anymore than usual tho?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Binn, are you still having problems with the targetting rings?  Did you have ATI?  Sony fixed the ATI incompatibility but I actually had to go and reinstall my drivers in order to see the rings as everyone else could (before they cut off midway out). <br />
<br />
I love the combat abilities window. Must. Download!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Goddamn Vigdis..that chanter coming along mighty nice...puts about half of the warriors on this board to shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sarsippius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The targeting ring doesnt appear to lag at all wheather you use a static or an animated one, however i  notice that as you lag so does the speed of the animation.  Basicly it is less of a strain than a timer or a class animation is, so if you experience lag from those I would stay away from it or get a new system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i'd like to see one that starts at the mob and pulses out like an atomic blast...<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
well, anything that looked like an atomic blast would win in my book</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Vigi, that sig... FUCKING OWNS <br />
<br />
If you made it, mad props, if you didn't make it, tell the person that did it, MAD PROPS $<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and my video card is a 32mb Nvidia TNT2 M64, so unfortunetly, I don't think they fixed it. I guess I'll go try and reinstall the drivers anyways... It can't hurt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Redid my drivers real quick, and no targetting ring. I think I remember reading somewhere the targeting ring wasn't compatable with TNT cards /sigh. Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i have an ati card (9600 pro) and brand new drivers (they released a new set about 4 days ago) and still no ring :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ohh my head, i was following that glowing ball with my eyes @_@</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">thats what stuff in the game looks like now o.O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Holy...that combat abilities window is the best I've ever seen.  Small and simple, but polished.  I think several nice looking swords spinning around the center (all pointing in) would be good...just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Any way to get that combat abilities window(CAW) seperate from the rest of Sars UI?  I have a mix and match UI, and Sars CAW looks the best that ive seen so far!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nice Combat Abilities window. Where is that downloaded at ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The UI of own just got better.<br />
<br />
Sars dude, double thumbs up for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>sarsippius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Due to popular request....As of 1/6/04 you can download the combat ability window as a separate download.   I am in the process of redoing my entire UI so that many of the favorite features can be used in conjunction with any other UI and also so that the non-favorite features can be turned into favorite features, thus eliminating the need for the first part of this sentence =)  The combat ability window is available for warriors and hybrids at the moment, with a rogue and monk version coming soon as I get access to a 6 rogue and monk to fiddle with it on.  You can get the window from my site http://sars.has.it  or from http://www.eqinterface.com in the combat ability section of the downloads.<br />
