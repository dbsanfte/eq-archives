She is my main and I really enjoy the playing the tank. I seem to lose agro too often though and I'm looking for suggestions on weapons and armor. I have been in the boards quite a bit but you guys are on a whole other level than me ;) If you got a min help a lady warrior out I'd appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Also still working out skills and such on Magelo so dont be misled, the gear is accurate though.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Face : crystal spider eyes<br />
head: skull shaped Barsomething ( ssb) / Velius quest<br />
rings: Velium Fire or RoG<br />
bracer: Velious quest / Silver Chit x 2<br />
arms : Velious quest or keep cobalt until you upgrade to that<br />
hands: Sky shire quest guants<br />
shoulders: Heavy dragonwing shoulders<br />
legs: Velious quest / barbed rubicite<br />
boots: velious quest<br />
<br />
weapons:<br />
/shrug <br />
many ways you can go here.  Maybe get a faster 1hs like a lammy or something but I am sure there are better for your level out how. Maybe try finding a solid 2hander instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most tradeable upgrades will be several k plat.<br />
<br />
fine hearldic would be something to look for, if you dont have yet a 2h blunt and slash. consider upgradeing the wurmslayer for a faster main hand. frosty is good worth keeping a while. look for tattered mantle, or other shoulders with hp or stamina if you have ally cov think about draconic. hat look for more ac. face more hp maby grob hide. neck some hp. 6/65 rings. slowly move from cobalt to velious/hearld armor. i would sugest moktor's but i hink its more or less same lvl as cobalt less ac but stats.<br />

weapons cheepy way sormwood batlestaff, weighty polearm, <br />

not much of my gear has changed since 51 just 1-2 things and some nice drops. magelos in sig</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">new helm and new rings are big. get either a) 8/9 dain ring or velium fire<br />
helm:Skull shaped barbute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weapons:  Ditch wurmy.  Even a Centi SSwould be an upgrade.  Look for something fast 10/18, 9/19, 9/18, whatever.  Just get something fast for primairy.  Keep frosty in off hand, it's great there.<br />
<br />
I can almost guarntee that will solve most of your agro problems.<br />
<br />
Other gear:  <br />
-rings:  ditch jagged bands and get 6/65's<br />
-bracer:  Ditch crystal chitin bracers and get anything else.  <br />
CCwristband, bracer of defense, anything!  <br />
-helm:  SSB, Circlet of Valon/Talon, Raldukan Helm<br />
-shoulders: tattered mantle or crested spaulders<br />
-ears:  Ele Black Sapphire earrings, or if you have cash:  any of the CT earrings<br />
<br />
If you are in a guild who can do Kael arena or plate cycle, gear up there.  Or if you have beaucop cash, Fine Heraldic would be nice.  Look around the bazaar.  You could swing some blood runed gauntlets and greave in the bazaar fairly well I imagine.<br />
<br />
Basicly, if you have cash, check the bazaar out and find a deal.  If you don't have a lot of cash, check out the bazaar!  If you can, gear up as much as possible in the plate cycle in the Kael manor house (tons of info out there).<br />
<br />
You have some really good slots, you just have to maximize the rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep Wurmy for when you're not MT or whatever, and you're sure you don't want aggro.<br />
<br />
But teaming up a Frostbringer and a Silken Whip of Ensnaring would go a long way towards helping you maintain aggro better over the Wurmy/Frosty setup.<br />
<br />
There's other options, weapons-wise, but I think the whip's a great, CHEAP place to start.</div></div><hr />
