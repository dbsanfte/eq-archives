<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To start off here is my magelo: Kahlaik (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=906518) <br />
<br />
I was hoping for some comments thoughts suggestions on some additional possible upgrades.  I am in a guild that is working on progressing to the elemental planes, we are getting ready to try and kill bertoxx and MM.  I am not the MT put I am trying to be as effective a warrior as possible.<br />
<br />
My point is I am at the point were normal LDONS are very easy for me to tank in, and besides for saving up points, there are no real upgrades to be had.  I have never tried any Hard LDONS, but I do not think I have the AA's to tank there very successfully.<br />
<br />
The Same goes for the Sewers or GOD Stuff.  I am an active raider, and will probably see some upgrades there, but what I am looking for is some areas that I could get some good upgrades and get over the hump to being an effective tank in some of the more challenging content.<br />
<br />
OR is all that is required is more exp and get my AA's before I can handle hard ldons and sewer trials?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is going to take some serious gear upgrades for you to tank effectively in the sewers (well, Sewer 1 at least). I have not done the sewers since the GoD retune so they may have gotten easier. If you cannot easily tank in a hard ldon, then you will not survive Sewer 1.<br />
<br />
You need to grind out the AA's and get upgrades via raiding. Ornate would be a big step up for you for nearly every slot. You may want to look at that next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get AA's, if you don't have the cash for ornate get Royal Attendant (it's better anyway) from north ro adventures. Get thos hp aa's first is my recommendation (save sturdiness for last after you get other defensive aa's).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your at the MM/Bert point progression wise as a guild, you should be Sol Ro flagged relatively soonish. I'd concentrate on AA exp until you have Sol Ro access, then do Sol Ro for not only great exp (till you get EP access) but ornate, which will be great gear upgrades for you.<br />
<br />
Once you have a solid core of AA's (70-80, and most of your defensive-HP ones) and have all the ornate you need (minus a BP) start doing hard LDoN's. The exp is not bad, and the random drops are usually pretty nice upgrades at that point in your progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hate to be a groupie .. but get the aa's. max defensive + the hp aa's would be huge for you.  as is, hard ldons would tear through you pretty quickly, and GoD Sewers are really out of the question.  80 aa's may change all of that though.  i would shoot for 6k unbuffed standard for tanking a hard ldon pretty well (all defensive aa's) and perhaps more for GoD beginner trials.<br />
<br />
<br />
i havent done any trials since they &quot;fixed&quot; GoD, but last time i was there it was a step up from hard ldon.</div></div><hr />
