<br />
Is this worth getting for me? I'm in an elemental guild, we just broke into the elemental and are farming rings/mini's now.<br />
<br />
Are the elemental bracers common enough to not bother with this? Is the extra haste worth giving up the AC of Raex if they are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not worth it imo.  AC is just too low on it and ele bracers aren't too hard to get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe so, but 1700AC is terribly weak for an 8kHP unbuffed tank. My AC is only like 1680AC and I'm at 7750HP...mine is the same way. I cannot stand the fact that I'm a 10k tank, but I don't even have 1800AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea but the point is that's entirely non-raid gear...lemme go get the link one sec, just so you can see it's not an entirely horrendous option. One sec</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the full Ikkiniz setup.<br />
<br />
So really, for a 46% haste item that's one groupable and has decent stats, it's really not that bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for lookin at this with me, now to commence the farmage. Anyone know the mobs spawn location inside the trial?</div></div><hr />

Aug it with a Slot8 20ac aug out of KT and get a Raex Gauntlet of Destruction to replace the GoDS.  Then add a Slot7 15ac aug out of Ferubi to the Raex Gaunts and you're golden.  <br />
<br />
-45ac 160hp 45% haste wrist (Way more useful and better than a standard Raex bracer imho)<br />
-70ac 155hp gaunts (last ya till Vadd's easily)<br />
<br />
Remember when choosing your haste item, however, that you will *always* have to make a tradeoff somewhere, as the stats on haste items generally aren't nearly as good as a non-haste item would be.</div></div><hr />

The HP aren't as good as some elemental stuff, but I really don't see me replacing it until time...50Agility is nummy.<br />
<br />
With that said though, I still think the wristband will be a good piece for me to get. Thanks for the help on this. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the Crafted Wristband,  just got it a few days ago. Still need a 20ac aug, so I put one of the 35hp augs on it. However, it actually upgraded my Valiant Belt of Fallen Heros, so it was a 10ac/35hp upgrade before augs were considered. <br />
<br />
8273hp/1866ac unbuffed.  Our guild hasn't had much luck with ele bracers, so this was, for me a very viable option. With a 20ac aug on it eventually, it will easily beat elemental.  Not to mention, it's free, so you can spend your points/value/ratio on better upgrades. <br />
<br />
My 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and spawn info:<br />
<br />
Zone into Ikkinz Tri-Fates: Kill in and just follow the hall first left all the way to the end and if he is up he will be right there as you turn. Large model Kyv with 2 Kyv guards.  If you have done Singular Might and Twin Struggles, I will presume you know how to kill a named kyv in ikkinz (=<br />
<br />
No clue on how common it is, but I've killed him twice and gotten 2 bracers. However I think luck was on our side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You won't upgrade your cord of midnight till time really due to elemental belts ac lacking quite a bit(I still haven't upgraded my belt of the destroyer)  However for free loot it is quite nice but I'd say Jhiru's wrist is better(lose 25hp for 17ac gain) and at the same time you could work people through tipt heh.  As for ele wrists you have mobs like Kriiz or Vine ring in earth where their loot table is either just wrists or just wrists + 1/2 unique drops, overall the type mold you'll be seeing the most in the eles.  Bracer&gt;Gaunts&gt;Arms&gt;Boots&gt;Helms in my experience as for drop rates(not including greaves eh)<br />
<br />
Although farming both of those groupable wrists would be a nice way to save some dkp.  The thing is with your gear you're only looking at upgrading your visible slots pretty much other than maybe puresteel mantle for shoulders just due to the poor ac on ele non visible slots so you'll have a decent amount of dkp to go around I'm guessing.  Can't argue with free loot though especially if your the person getting all 3 ikkinz trials done so you guys can start raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience, the drop rate on the wrist is about 50/50. However, I don't know if it is the same for all the trials now, but the named archer almost never spawns anymore it seems. My group still needs one more of these bracers and we haven't had him spawn in over 10 instances. <br />
<br />
For me, along with the tipt bracer, it is clearly the best bracer I can get. For you, I'd say it is another type 8 slot you can put all those KT augs in before you get to Time :) There are a lot of really nice augs you can get in KT/Ikkinz (2 x 20ac, 2 shielding, 50 hp, 35hp for off slots) which, imo, make it more attractive. Couple that with the fact that it is free, I think it wouldn't be a bad grab.</div></div><hr />

I'm my guilds raid leader/guildleader and main tank.  Been saving dkp for ele arms or a better neck, before getting this bracer replaced...Its not too bad, ac is a tad low, but hey, you live with it. <br />

I dont think my hp/ac is low for a non-time guild.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I passed it up because of the Low AC, but  I have access to gear you don't right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I really don't understand why you would want to put the 20 AC aug on this.  46 percent haste is nice, but I would rather have two elem bracers, put 20 more AC on one of them, and have more AC all around and have 41 percent haste.  Imo, 5 percent haste is not worth 20 AC. especially since you will be at the haste cap with 41 percent haste.<br />

<br />
The 50 HP Aug from DD is not lore and fits in 4 slots (neck, face, shoulders, back) it's rare as hell though. He usualy drops his caster Bracer for us.<br />
<br />
and finaly there are 3 AC20 Augs:<br />
Ashen Claystone of Aegis (KT)<br />
Opaque Sapphire of Bulwark (KT)<br />
Scarred Token of Resistance (Yxtta)<br />
<br />
The Crafted Wristband of Strife is a nice Haste Item imho just for the fact that it is a non-dkp item, i would not have upgradet an Earth Haste Bracer with it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see what the big deal is, is it an upgrade?  Yes or No.<br />
<br />
Are you going to have to make a trade off at some point for a haste item?  Probably.<br />
<br />
Is a 5percent increase in haste or the &quot;loss&quot; of 20some ac on an item you don't have important?  No.<br />
<br />
The blessed shard from primals is 30ac..<br />
<br />
Personally, using a Silver Bracelet of Speed, I'd like to get this bracer as an upgrade.  25ac 195 hp or 45/55ac and 160hp for no ELP is pretty damn awesome.  Think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muurlat McKrom</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at the time that i got this bracer, i had 2 crystallized acid bracers. i already had an augment the 20 ac augment in hand, so i jumped on the bracer when it dropped. we didnt raid much in the elemental planes anymore, so my choice to take it at the time was a good one. my only real options at tht time for a possible bracers were the tipt one, blood-glazed, quarm (HAHA yeah right), and this one. thankfully a few nights later we decided to slum in earth and i got a raex. so with what options i had i made the right choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokonut Pye</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Augging a low AC item with AC does not make it high or even normal AC. You can put the AC aug in a high AC item as well as a low one. There is no restriction saying that a high AC item cannot be augged with AC, so the aug does not compensate for the low AC on this bracer.<br />
<br />
I realize that Raex is type 7 and the aug is type 8, but there is plenty of GoD type 8 loot for elemental level people that the 20ac augs will fit into.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't recommend this bracer...the haste is not really that big of a deal, and the AC is just way too low. I'd get a Jihru bracer and either Raex or Mud Ring bracer (if you need haste), then upgrade that to Quarm or Vadd's later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you forgetting that this bracer is FREE?  Please see my previous post!</div></div><hr />

I'll hold onto it until I have a time haste item and a better type 8 bracer. Which means I'll be using this bracer for a long time I'm sure...considering we just got SolRo and don't have arbitor yet. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm glad to hear it. Lots of naysayers here, which I'm surprised to see. In the end, when all the dust clears, grab an ac augment, put it on there, and be happy with your choice. Is it the best? No. Is it damn good? Fuck yes. Will it last you a while? For sure it will.<br />
<br />
With GoD, for the first time in a long time, if you are undergeared and going into an uber guild, you have very decent items dropping that you can make even better that will compliment things that you will need to get with merit/dkp that are even more important than the slot you used GoD to upgrade. Don't even look back; now worry about other slots that you will be asking for : )</div></div><hr />
