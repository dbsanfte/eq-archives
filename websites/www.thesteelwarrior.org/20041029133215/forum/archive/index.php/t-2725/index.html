<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 61 druid I can use to PL my dirty 23 war twink.  I'm getting about 1/3 of a yellow per kill at Plaguebones in DL, but it still takes an hour and a half to get a level.  Anyone know any better spots for PLing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haarz,<br />
<br />
Having pleveled quite a few of my own characters, I'll give you my progression...<br />
<br />
I have a 65 cleric/enc/druid for the plevel group, the enchanter isn't necessary but helps on the mana regen side is all, plus haste.<br />
<br />
levels 1 - 3 (or 5 if feeling generous) west commons - because there is a druid port there and lots of red mobs nearby<br />
<br />
levels 3/5 - 10/15 - east karana - another druid port spot, with the snakes/spiders being awesome exp on the low end and as you get higher the wolves/crags are excellent.<br />
<br />
levels 10/15 - 20/25 - unrest - keep everyone in wolfform so you get no aggro.  Initially at level 10/15 I don't wolfform the twink and run him around the outside area grabbing all the skels/beetles/etc and hitting them all once with DS plowing them down.  After 1 or 2 levels (depending on how fast it goes) I go inside to the circular room with 2 spawns in it and 1 roamer.  I then pull mobs down, single, with the druid either snare pulling or low level DD.  Once I'm closer to 20, I have the twink run around and pull 3 or so mobs per pull.  If you're good enough you can pull trains.  Respect others and don't do that if they're in the areas, you'll kill them and take spawns.  I always share spawns even if a 40's something is in the tower, there are plenty of spawns for ya to pull, hit the basement with druid pulling should there be a few people here.  Normally, on my server, late at night, there are 2 other ppl tops and they're outside of the building.<br />
<br />
levels 20/25 - 30/32 - mistmoore castle - not my most favorite choice here, it is fairly painful, but doable.  I find myself leaving a lot once I hit level 28/29.  I used to do cazic thule 22-30 by pulling massive trains at the inner temple area, but that won't work anymore ;(  You may want to think of an alternative spot, though mistmoore rarely has anyone in there and you can pull tons of mobs from inside out to the ledge.  I normally fight in the tunnel, just pass the graveyard.  There is only 1 roamer and depending on your puller you can harmony/single cuz of level from the whole valley area, plus backtrack to graveyard or even pull from inside down there.  My favorite alternate place for these levels is Tower of Frozen Shadow (I have all the keys, a must).  The best level is 2nd (library) and have my 65 war single pull, beat the mob down, snare/mem wipe (they all run) then twink kills.  This is the BEST level for exp... period.. end of discussion.  Levels 3/4 mobs have much more hp or are casters for the SAME amount of exp.  Level 5 is a close second.  Pulling the wedding party zombies (all green at 65, but actually semi-high with very low hp) is great exp at these levels!!  I fight right in front of the wedding room and you'll not aggro anything there.  Conversely, you could do runnyeye.  Pulling the fungus mobs from below or some of the goblins works fairly well.  I found the fungus are the easier to kill.  I fight at the top of the first down ramp to the lower areas.  There are 1 or 2 statics mobs there, but they're super low level.<br />
<br />
levels 30/32 - 40 - I used to do old temple of droga due to the exp bonus, that's kind of key to pleveling efficiently is seeking out dungeons with an exp bonus.  I haven't done a character since droga changed (though you could hit the new 'old droga' outside in frontier mountains, I'd expect it to be similar, but I dunno if there are enough mobs there....), though I did do 30-39 in the new droga using a 65 war to mow the mobs down then mem wipe and have twink finish it.  The best spot, I have always liked, is the area after the large room with all the tunnels off of it, hit the far right most tunnel and go down until you come down a small ramp with a torch and 1 roaming spawn.  This area is before the bridge cavern with plenty of mobs to pull.  The key is snaring mobs (as they'll run) then mem wiping.  I wouldn't recommend a 30+ war tanking in droga.. unless you're crazed.  <br />
<br />
levels 30/32 - 40 alternate - tower of frozen shadow - at this point, the library isn't so hot, so I move to level 6A.   This has the drolvargs/spectres.  Having a high tank is key here, he pulls then beat down/snare/mem wipe.  Drolvargs are the best to pull.  Pull them all to the point you TP in at on 6A, which is totally safe.  Level 7 where Tserinna is, is a total waste, mobs have same hps and are equal/lower level with not as many to pull from.  Hitting 40 here is a tad slow, but it keeps moving.<br />
<br />
Now that you're 40, you really should have a level 60 char to group with, then simply hit whatever zone you can plow mobs down in, preferrably mobs that are green to the level 60 and you'll do great.<br />
<br />
If all you have is the 61 druid and the 23 war to work with... things are a bit harder, definately slower.  I'd have to guess the following may work for you:<br />
<br />
23 - high 20's - unrest - perfect for druid only, might hit low 30's, but it will be slow<br />
<br />
30ish - 40ish - old droga in frontier mountains - might be good, I can't say.  Another alternate would be the overthere.  Mobs hit semi hard, but it is doable.  Exp isn't too too hot, but you could fear the chickens (I think they're animals) and minimize your damage.  I'd fight in the valley before the frontier mountains zone, or by the skyfire zone entrance.  Plants are the easiest kills, followed by chickens, rhinos, tigers (though some tigers are very low and on par with plants)<br />
<br />
40's - 50's - timorous deep - you could quad kite with your druid at the spiroc treehouse.  I did 49-54 there with my druid.  Nearing 54 I found that I could kite 8/9 mobs and suck all my mana (not the best equipped wizzie, plus pre-AAs and all that jazz, velious had just come out).  This may yield decent exp, I cannot say, been a long time and I know things slowed down a lot around 54.  Exp at 49 was decent, for the time.  You could also hit lower guk and do the lord/eye/arch magus.  If that's too much for you, you could hit the sage/executioner/cavalier camp, though they're a few levels lower.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 46 you could also charm ravens in plane of nightmare and kill stuff that way, exp might be very good.  The warrior would be sitting on his butting sucking exp though, I doubt you'd want him and pet to fight, but that's up to you.<br />
<br />
Once you break your 50's you could do Karnor's Castle, if you like pain.  You could also hit old sebilis as mobs don't have that many HPs and I think you can single pull with your druid, but I can't really remember.<br />
<br />
You're on your own at that point, as I used to have to fight in lower guk at those levels and it was fairly painful.  I then hit old sebilis for my lower 50's.  It wasn't until 56 that PoP came out and I've exp'd there ever since.  I enjoyed the docks in plane of nightmare as you can pull tons of netling wraiths with a warrior and get singles if you pay attention.  I also enjoy plane of storms in the desert (take a left once you enter the desert and setup in that corner after the rock).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the suggestions Alcho, I'll give unrest a try next time.  I have a 61 enc I can use too, and I completely forgot about memblur lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">and I completely forgot about memblur lol.<br />
Ironically level limits on buffs (cough DS cough) have arguably made enchanters the best PL'ers.. Get the animation affinity and/or Dire Charm AAs for your PL'ing enchanter so that they have a commandable pet. Mez the mob at the end (10 pct) and cast mem blur. Sleep and Bliss have built in mem blurs (30 and 40% effectiveness, respectively) but since no mem blur is 100% effective, I would suggest casting 2 regular mem flux/blurs as well before letting the twink knock off the last 10 pct. Since it's already mem blurred, they can 'pull' the mezzed mob at their leisure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">kaesora is nice from like 28 to 40. The undeads in the xagloz area dont run. Made 31 - 36 with my pally in about 3h with a 65cler pulling with MoR.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kaesora is hands down the place from 30-40. Start in the Library, move to Church when you get to 35-36ish. With a druid there you should be able to porcupine 4-5 mobs at a time for incredible exp. At 40, CoM is good, start at stable and move to the temple when things get too easy.<br />
<br />
The most important thing about using a druid to PL at lower levels is to fight multiples with a damage shield, find mobs that don't run (to make max use of the damage shield), or, failing that, to try to make sure that they are social, so that they won't run if there are others nearby. This saves a lot of pain caused by runners.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for a mellee character its easy i would not use a chanter only because its a pain to get yer skill up later on by usin the mem blur method ofcourse they will lvl faster.<br />
<br />
1-4 Shar Vahl takes about 20 min<br />
4-20 Paludal takes at the most 4 hrs<br />
20-30 dawnshroud<br />
30-38 beach in gunthak<br />
38- 54 dulak's harbor possibly better place in the 50's but ya can get good loot and farm stuff whil yer pling at the same time.<br />
<br />
with this method i can get a character to 50+ in under 12 days playtime with good skills if ya wanna pl a caster just have a mellee friend join em takes a lil longer but is better in the long run the players get to actually use thier skills toss in a shammy or a chanter and its even better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turgin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My main is a 63 warrior and I hydra a 55 druid.  Since pickup groups are hard to come by and usually terrible when they do I decided to PL a cleric and make my own group.  My cleric just made 34 last night.  Here is how I got there and where I plan to go next.  This is my first character to PL so I may not be as fast at it as others.  I started the cleric about 4 or 5 days ago and probably work on leveling a couple hours a night.<br />
<br />
I did newbie zone till 9.  Damage shield, Skin Like Nature, regen, etc from druid.  I stayed till level 9 because clerics get their first AoE DD at 9.   Took about a hour I think mostly because I was seeking out the higher level sutff.  May have went faster if I had simply killed anything I could find.<br />
<br />
Moved to Unrest at 9.  Druid would pull with a level 1 nuke that did 5 points of damage.  Pull as much yard trash as I could find and let them beat themselves down on the damage shield.  Step the cleric up and AoE them.  Pick one and melee it with the cleric while the rest killed themselves on the damage shield.  I continually tried to cast the nuke to work on channeling.  Moved on to higher level mobs from inside.  Did this until about 25 .  This stage took me about 2 nights of playing I think.<br />
<br />
MIstmoore was up next.  I started using my warrior at this point.  Used druid damage shield + 8th Coldain ring and he would run around the courtyard area back to the graveyard aggroing everything he could and bring it all back to zone in.  Duck so I don't riposte and let them get down to about 80%.  Step cleric in and AoE nuke.  Nuke again at about 50% or so.  Usually had some aggro on the cleric by this time so I continued to melee and try to get off some nukes.  Moved on to the deeper stuff once yard trash XP got slow.  Did this till level 34 (Atone!) last night.  Another 2 play sessions or so spent here.<br />
<br />
Tonight, I plan to move to Frozen Shadow as suggested in an earlier post.  Warrior beat down, druid snare when it turns, cleric atones twice and kills.  We'll see how that goes.  Thinking of hitting Sebilis at 39 (complete heal!) and following the same beat down, snare, atone, kill strategy.  Also thought of going to Skyfire at about level 50 to farm shards while XP would still be ok and it wouldn't be completely boring then back to Sebilis when I get four of them.  Xalgoz area in Kaesora is also good for low 50's I think.  That, and get the fang for the HS key.  I like the options for high 40s - low 50's.  Mix it up a little.  Cleric's skills, other than 1hb, defense, evocation, and meditation, are lacking right now of course, but I think I can work on them while my main is camping Stormfeather.  Give me something else to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I PL'd my monk to 38 before I got bored with him. I used a level 60 druid for heals and buffage. He has all of his skills except ID maxed with a grand total of around 12 hours /played. I did it when you could still get high level group buffs on twinks, but you should still be able to get pretty good results.<br />
<br />
First of all, you want to get a temperance for the warrior - there is no level limit on temperance and will give you plenty of HP to work with. If you can pick up some lower level shammy/ranger/paladin buffs, all the better. You will also want to get Shield of Thorns (24pt damage shield) and Chloroplast (10 hp/tick regen) from the druid. It would not be a bad idea to get some shammy DS potions as well since the DS is going most of the work.<br />
<br />
Head over to Paludal Caverns. Get a SoW on the warrior before you go in and pull an assload of mobs. I would try for 8-12 mobs at a time. Make sure that you hit every mob at least once. If the DS does 100% of the damage you wont get the exp. Once you have whacked as many as you can kill them one at a time. They are social so they won't run at low health. If the last one runs, its no problem, auto-pull is a good thing. If you don't want him to run, just have the druid snare the last mob. You can get to the late 20s in Paludal, your pulls can get bigger as you level, I would stay there until the mobs start turning light blue.<br />
<br />
Next move to Dawnshroud. I always fought at the entrance to Seru since there are less people over there. Get a wolf form so the zelnithaks will become KOS to you. I avoided pulling crawlers because they blind and that just slows you down. In wolf form the dogs won't agro, this is good because they have a lot more HP than the cows. Pull these in mass as well. I was doing 6-8 at a time pretty confortably with my monk in moderate twink gear (Fungi + mostly acrylia studded/reinforced armor). This should get you to 40 pretty easily.<br />
<br />
At around 40ish, head for SolB. Start at the zone in and make your way toward the CPK camp as you level up. Once those mobs start getting too low, head toward the bugs camp on the way to Naggy's lair. You should be able to get into the 50s here. You should also be able to get better buffs and bigger DSes once you get to 40 so don't forget to upgrade buffs as you progress.<br />
<br />
Once you can tank PoP mobs - head to PoN. If you can get in a full group, you will make better exp, but you should still do well duoing. I haven't been back since the revamp, but the Hole entrance might also be a good choice if they didn't totally fuck that zone up.<br />
<br />
In all cases up until the warrior gets to around level 45ish, the druid should have no problem tanking any heal agro he gets keeping the warrior up. Find a nice wall to back up to, this will help with interupts. I put a DS on the druid as well and just made it a point to switch to the mobs attacking the druid so the monk would get all the exp.</div></div><hr />

Copper Hammer procs were just devastating lol.  I went to Kaesora last night and got 2 levels in about 2.5-3 hours.  Was decent and I picked up a Xalgoz fang for my HS key, but I'm gonna check LGuk next (trains be damned hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mytemo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Here is where I am lvl'ing my warrior with the help of a lvl 65 druid friend:<br />
<br />
Kurns to lvl 20<br />
<br />
Sol A 20 to 30ish<br />
<br />
Kaesora 30 to 40<br />
<br />
Sol B 40 to 47<br />
at 47 I could clear allmost all mobs up to the giant castle before respawns started again.<br />
<br />
The Hole 47 to ?<br />
I went from 47 no color to 49 almost 50 in just under 3 hours last night.  there is a 25% exp bonus in this zone.   And I'm getting a half blue bub per kill at these lvls.  Kills are extremely fast and I never run out of mobs.  This zone just gets better and better for me.<br />
<br />
The trick is to kill alot very fast.  you can get more xp killing 4 blues in same time it takes to kill 1 red mob. Using DS and having multiples beat themselves down on you works great for this.</div></div><hr />

Well, at level 34 your cleric gets atone, which is a memory wipe (which isnt perfect, but would work).  Until then, I'd just go with dmg shield potions and paludal/sola.  You can at least do half dmg  and have the warrior finish the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">the way to pl a caster is with monk.<br />
beat the fucker down FD nuke with cleric beats any other means of pling caster.<br />
<br />
That or load down AE spells pull a train DS AE once tata.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Last night I was doing the half dmg thing where I would beat the mob down to about 45% and then have my war finish it off, but then my cleric didn't get xp for the kill.<br />
<br />
This was in Crushbone and I'm wondering that if I hit the mob and did overkill dmg if that's why? What I mean is lets say an orc centurion has 100 hp and my cleric melees/nukes it down to 45 hp. Then I turn my warrior around and slash it for 56 pts of dmg. I've done 1 more point of dmg than my cleric. Now that mob dies and the cleric doesn't get xp because the warrior did more dmg overall? Or am I missing something here?<br />
<br />
And yeah I can't wait for Atone. :)<br />
<br />
Managed to get my cleric from level 4 to 10 last night just by turning in crushbone belts and lego pads to dwarves in kaladim. Took about an hour to collect enough ;) So if anyone is wondering: that is the fastest way to level 10, because after that they give crap xp :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I used my warrior to powerlevel a mage once and it worked pretty well.  I just stand the warrior next to the pet, pet keeps aggro but the mob hits the warrior because he's in melee range.  Mage damage shields the warrior and nukes.  Pet beats on the mobs back.  This was crazy with KEI but you can't put that on newbies anymore hehe.  You can do a little damage with the warrior as well, but you have to be careful not to outdamage the mage+pet.  Waiting for 50% isn't necessarily enough because of the damage shield.  <br />
<br />
You're warrior won't be a lot of use to your cleric until they are high enough to group (43) but after 43 the warrior will be great because of the huge amount of hps with the cleric already having complete heal.  About the best thing you can do at lower levels is camp a zone-line, beat the mob down to low health with the warrior, zone, and finish it off with the cleric.  <br />

Your shaman DS potions won't be worth the money on the cleric because the DS scales with level.  What might be worth trying is using the DS on the warrior and pulling a train, letting them beat themselves down on the DS, and then using the cleric to finish them off with melee/nukes.  Keeping aggro will be hard without doing any damage, but with incite you may be able to get enough aggro to let the cleric help out a little.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">as I said monk with FD is best way to go. I was raking up really good xp for my mage that way who was way undertwinked. Was working towards CoH bot. My monk is only 55 so CoM was great spot since some mobs there are still light blue to him and his gear is uber for a kunark character meaning just bareley ok by todays standards.<br />

I think I did about 30-34 in an hour and a half.</div></div><hr />

For levels 30-35, do the same thing in oasis, on spectres.  Bind the druid on spectre island.  Put the warrior at the south zone to south ro.  Pull the spectre to zone, nuke it nearly dead, and zone, finish it off with the warrior, while the druid gates back to the island.  You can kill deep reds easily this way, and do a level every hour or 2.  Spectres are really fragile, they only have about 1600 hp.  There are 8 spectres on a 15 minute respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Payn- the reason your method wasn't working is that the damage done by the DS potion counts as 'neutral' IE if your cleric attacked a mob, and the mob was attacking back, getting hit my DS potion, your cleric only actually meleed the mob for like 10-20% damage, and the DS potion did 30-40%... so when your warrior killed the mob once it was under half health, he had done more melee damage than the cleric, so warrior gets credit for the kill.</div></div><hr />
