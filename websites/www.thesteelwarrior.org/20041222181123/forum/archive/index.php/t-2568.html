<br />

<br />
Thanks by advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
We went up not too long ago, took about 2 hours but we had to wait for a GM to summon a azarack on the second island that had fallen off the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damrod</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK thanks a lot only 2 hours? this is fast? you already have the keys? or not?<br />
If it is only 2 hours raid it is not hard .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">only 2 hours? <br />
<br />
An Azarak was stuck on isle 3 for us as well.  Took 30 minutes for GM to get too us and free him.  BTW, is there an easy way to de spawn Sir Lunatic after turning in for keys on each isle?<br />
<br />
And yes, 2 hours max for us (we waited for Sir Lunatic to despawn and GM intervention). <br />
<br />
If we didnt have to wait for An Azarak or GM intervention or Sir Luantic despawning then Id say like 30-40 minutes to get to isle 5.  Two groups, one camp out cleric (so 13 people) 63-65.  The named on 3rd drops 4 key pieces so you dont have to kill the eye balls for animal figures.  <br />
<br />
Just make sure people follow your Atk, mez adds or off tank, and keep the party moving together and fast.... then prepare for your DT's :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 hours seems way to quick to get to Isle 5. Especially if your not experienced with Sky and how to do stuff there. With an experienced raid leader I would plan on 4 hours from port in. But the more 60 plus folks you have, and the fewer keys needed the faster you can move. The Pegasus Isle alone last I knew took 80 minutes from the time you kill the first mob, before the boss mob spawns. Then you have another 80 minutes to kill him before he despawns.<br />
<br />
However you do it you want 24 people or less, unless you want to do a lot of corpse summoning. And even 24 on Azaracks ya may need to summon a few as you get a random amount of key parts from each mob there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What takes a long time in sky is coffining and people not knowing how things work, people falling off the edge, etc.  If you had a solid group of decently equipped 60+ type and less than 4 groups so you don't have to mess with coffins you can move reasonably fast.  Make sure that everyone coming with you is there for the long hall because people having to leave and be replaced can cost you hours.  <br />
<br />
You also need a raid leader who understands how sky works and knows all the tricks.  Those guys are getting more and more rare these days, and a lot of us that knew how it worked 2 or 3 years ago have forgotten a lot of it by now (I know I couldn't remember how things worked last time I went up there to do KoS.  We ported up to the aviak island and promptly wiped because our pullers didn't  know how it worked and trained hte whole isle on us.  And this was a guild that was farming ssra/seru at the  time.<br />
<br />
Point is, do your homework, and bring as many people as you can find that have experience in sky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The key to quick sky raid is most certainly a knowledgable raid leader. Raiding sky like that is like getting to the quest people in SkyShrine maze without a map, takes a long time and lots of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackulle</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Used to take us about 6 hours to clear sky pre - velious, with about 24-30 lvl 57-60.  I'd say to get to isle 5 with a few groups of 65's shouldnt take more than an hour or two if at least a few people are sky experianced.  With a buncha first timers it may take a while longer as it can be kinda complex at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's not forget the fact that the Keeper of Souls (Island 4) will NOT spawn until one hour has passed since the death of his PH trigger bird (or horse - Cant Remember)<br />
<br />
So add that to the time it takes to get through 1-3. Minimum time spent on island 4 alone is one hour (if you can kill PH first and immediately)<br />

<br />
I still have my keys from that trip, they did not disapear like they used to, so your first trip might take a bit, but you will jsut need a port up and an invis to run to the Aziracks after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, you now can do it in several trips and get keys done one day, and the next week just go up to the last island you visited, no need to camp up there or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afmo</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we did this yesterday with about 15 peeps, took about 4 hours to get to isle 5 including waiting for the keeper of souls to spawn.  Isle 5 took us about 10 minutes to clear and the Lord dropped in about 45 seconds.<br />
13 lvl 65's and 2 55s on the raid.</div></div><hr />
