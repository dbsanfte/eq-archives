I see pages and pages of insults and smack talk. Whats the deal? In my guild  we have two major tanks for raids a pally and war. I play the paladin and we make a great team. I assist  him and chain stun the mobs to reduce the dam he takes and grp heal and add some dps as well as interupting the casting mobs. I could tank but I dont choose to as he is the warrior it is his job to do the tanking when he is there and I do when he is not. We are a team and there is no bitterness. Even if I did get a defensive or something similar he would still be the tank because paladins are only part war anything the war gets will be better in the tanking department. If warriors got another +5% innate mitigation i would be happy for him. I wouldnt go to the paladin board and write up a 1000word complaint about it.<br />
<br />
I reallize that a paladin wasnt made to be the superior tank in Norrath and I accept that but as the mobs get tougher and our skills become less usefull it is time to upgrade just like everyone else. How they do that matters not to me as long as it works. <br />
<br />
<br />
My first and favorite char is a war and I still play him, I do not feel that Paladins and Shadowknights are taking our territory because we are and always we be superior to them as tanks.</div></div><hr />

If your chain stunning a mob and your warrior is holding aggro have him send me a tell, I'd love to know his secret.<br />

<br />
Well, it's sort of a long-standing issue. For years now, there has been some heat between the two class boards. It pretty much came to a head during Planes of Power, when warriors were having a really hard time finding XP groups because planar XP groups preferred the very fast aggro capabilities of knights to the slower aggro capabilities of warriors.<br />
<br />
There was quite a high volume of &quot;debate&quot; as well as all out towering infernos during those heady days.<br />
<br />
Then came December, 2003. INCITE went live. Things calmed down a bit.<br />
<br />
Now the shoe's on the other foot ... so the debate has picked back up again. Warriors are still stinging from their ineffectiveness in PoP. Paladins are still stinging from their Kunark days. And everyone's got a bone to pick with everyone else.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much the long and short of it.</div></div><hr />

But it is still hard to top Akilae that functions both as snap aggro and damage mitigation, especially against the incoming slow.<br />
<br />
Now if you can hold aggro against both Akilae and the 10 second Quellious stun, that'd take an impressive amount of aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
When you only have one job, and only one class defining ability, of course you're gonna fight hard to keep it.  Hell no I'm not going to share main tanking raid mobs.  You chose the spell book over the extra tanking.  We aren't &quot;on top&quot;, we just have our one job actually belong to us now.  Why should we share main tanking exactly?  You aren't happy that you offtank, have snap aggro, can patch heal, can root, can stun, and can rez?  I hardly think that it is greediness of warriors that we want to keep our one job, while you, a hybrid class, have these other jobs available.  To want to be similar tanks would be greediness of knights.<br />
<br />
To the original poster: this is why there is such bitterness.  Many people of both classes wish to play in god mode and ignore class balance.  To ask for equality in the one field warriors do well is simply insane.  Likewise, a warrior suggesting pallys shouldn't be fixed so they can do those other jobs would also be wrong.<br />
<br />
why is it ok for you guys to get your much needed upgrades and its not ok for us <br />
<br />
Because you are no where near as broken as we were for one.  Knights were superior tanks in almost all situations, including a large number of raid mobs.  That leaves warriors with zero job at all.  Here, you are having issues with add tanking in a few zones, and main tanking some single group stuff.  It's not as huge of a disparity.  You should get upgrades allowing you to do a good job at the jobs a pally does, not take our job.  I've seen a cleric with pally back up be able to keep up a sub elemental warrior on Ikkinz 1 named.  He mainly healed and didn't attack the mob, but he was able to take over the shamans job fine.  He actually had a job available to him.  It's not his normal or favorite job, but he can actually do good on a different job.  You do deserve your fixes as soon as possible, but that doesn't mean this is equal to the balance issues of before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracuul</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is exactly what i'm talking about. I wanted a warrior and I created one. Since there were already plenty of warriors in my guild I chose to put most of my time into the paladin. I have never asked for defensive or any other warrior class defining abilities. I am satisfied with being a half warrior/half cleric and I accept the fact that they (warriors) will be better tanks than me. I don't see why people dont put more effort in having their classes improved instead of dragging down everyone else. I was glad when the warriors got improved agro and and the innate mitigation boost it was needed.<br />
<br />
My whole point and I say this the same on pally board not just here is that we need to put all this brain power in to something constructive instead of all the bickering.<br />
<br />
As far as these named mobs in GoD and such, a paladin or shadowknight should be able to tank them. It should be such a nail biting experience that any sane group would choose a warrior instead if one is available but it shouldnt be impossible for guilds to push their hybrids through or for the hybrids to tank them when no warriors are available or interested in doing them again.<br />
Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hussar practically nailed it.<br />
<br />
While Warriors did get the Phase 1 Melee Updates, it's worth noting that the debate process was punctuated by Paladins that insisted:<br />
<br />
1. The innate Warrior HP advantage after AoTC is substantially greater than ~386HP's. It's 800-1200's minimum.<br />
<br />
2. Even if it was ~386HP's, Knights are entitled to tank like Warriors in experiance groups and have spellbooks making them superior tanks. After all, Warriors get to MT everything on raids.<br />
<br />
3. Ranged snap aggro isn't an advantage.<br />
<br />
4. Being able to MT all of PoTime is meaningless.<br />
<br />
5. There should be 3 equal tanks, 2 with spellbooks and one with unspecified AA driven utilities.<br />
<br />
After the Phase 1 Melee Update but well before GoD Paladins posted:<br />
1. OK, Warriors got aggro, we want Defensive.<br />
<br />
2. Knights have lost their group and add tanking role through out the game.<br />
<br />
3. Nerf Defensive.<br />
<br />
4. &quot;-1 DI&quot; is too much, the Provoke line is too much.<br />
<br />
5. There should be 3 equal tanks, 2 with spellbooks and one with unspecified AA driven utilities.<br />
<br />
Many Warriors believe that after the Phase 1 Melee Update things were exactly where they should be. Warriors MT the hardest mobs in the game, Knights add tank, and all 3 classes equally acceptable in groups.<br />
<br />
SoE of course had to mess this up horribly despite an explicit statement on PoN - Knights will not loose their add tank role if and only if SoE does not create high DI adds.<br />
<br />
SoE not only created some high DI adds, but it put high DI boss mobs in trials.<br />
<br />
OK, there was a huge amount of exageration posted on PoN. Knights can't experiance group tank in GoD, Knights can't get through the Sewers, Knights can't get through Vxed and Tipt, etc.<br />
<br />
This was accompianed by &quot;Gimmie Defensive&quot; and &quot;Nerf Defensive&quot; and a phony call to fix the content. And most of the posters weren't even at the point of the game where they were affected.<br />
<br />
SoE called the Knight bluff at Fan Fair. We'll make versions of the trials doable by Knights. They can get flagged and farm loot.<br />
<br />
That's not what Knights wanted. They wanted to close the MTing gap between a Warrior under Defensive and a Knight.<br />
<br />
Most adds are blue. They can be tanked by any Tank. There are yellow mobs. Con one. See the warning? This mob might kill you. In an add tank group unsupported by others or in an experiance group some yellow mobs did exactly what their /con message said they could do. Some red mobs definately could plant some tombstones.<br />
<br />
But Warriors could tank these mobs. Sure, Warriors might use Defensive. But the issue wasn't that /con messages mean something. The issue was that Warriors are better tanks vs. unstunable high DI mobs. Well, we can't have that, can we?<br />
<br />
&quot;Gimmie Defensive.&quot; &quot;Nerf Defensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
From the viewpoint of many Warriors, Defensive was doing exactly what it was supposed to do and what it has done for four years.<br />
<br />
Got a problem doing what you think is your job Knights? Take it up with SoE. BTW, leave Defensive out of your feedback. That's a Warrior defining ability that has nothing at all to do with your class.<br />
<br />
Hence the bitterness. Many Knights really did want Defensive. Fixing the trials wasn't acceptable. Fixing spellboooks - a Vie-like buff and Combat heals, adding &quot;-1 DI&quot; and WS, not acceptable. Nothing was acceptable unless it was Defensive.<br />
<br />
For me, there was no bitterness. But I was pretty determined that whatever the fix was it would preserve class differences and if possible increase them. I didn't roll a Paladin and I am reminded of this everytime I buy buffs in PoK, run from place to place instead of riding, loot without a res, die from a DoT, and solo - I solo a lot. I've right clicked my spare BP so much it's got a worn spot.<br />
<br />
Knights didn't roll a Warrior. I'm expecting a good portion of them to know this everytime they attack a yellow or red mob while in a group or an unsupported add tank group. See the /con guys? It suggests you might see your bind spot. Even vs. a yellow you likely will fail - the /con says so. You surely will not succeed without using a big chunk of mana.<br />
<br />
It's up to SoE how many yellow and red mobs there are in the game and where they are located. Warrior survivability advantages should allow Warriors at their own risk to ignore such warnings and tank a mob that /cons Death. That's what we do. Oh sure, late in the expansion I expect Knights to go back and solo yellows in Kod'Taz for kicks. I truely hope that Knights will start to appear in the MT list. But not now, later in the expansion when we've looted some of the expansion's armor.<br />

And we're far beyond that age.

There comes a point where adequate aggro is adequate. Mind you, I like Bellow of Mastrug.<br />
<br />
For me the issue is are there mobs worth fighting where a Warrior's superior survivability is needed. If not, then I'm not needed. I don't log in only on raid day.<br />

'Tis another problem with GoD so far. Compared with 4-5 hours spent in PoTime there is barely any loot. Already it's a Darkglint rot-a-thon.<br />
<br />
Other than a Glyphed Prayer Ring and some augs I don't see a lot yet a Warrior would drool over.<br />

I'll have to check Afterlife's webpage and see if they've encountered anything deeper in it.<br />

Nice gear btw. I realize VDD is probably your weapon of choice. But I really like Hopebringer. It almost delivers on what Jeldorin hinted at earlier. I got my Paladin a Fabled Ghoulbane because of nostalgia. I would have tried for a Fabled Mithril 2H, but I had a hunch I might not win solo 8).<br />

Warriors like to pick on Paladins but fail to realize that there are Rangers and Rogues running around being just as adequate.  I really don't blame any of them for their short sighted view of the game.  I just wish they would look farther than Paladins and SKs and see how wearing plate doesn't mean a whole lot in many situations before Discord.  If some thought Warriors sucked because a Paladin could tank something, I wonder how they feel when a Ranger is tanking in Earth?<br />
<br />
Warriors have never sucked at being tanks.  Ever.  There has never been a problem of survivablity for Warriors (except maybe in the early early early days).  I wish more would realize that before chasing other crusades.<br />
<br />
As for agro, I don't see there being a problem at this point.  How much more agro do you need?  The only deficiency is I see at this point is if you need to play Tug-of-War with someone else trying out taunt you.  I'm wondering what problems Warriors currently have with their agro since now like SKs and Paladins they have enough on demand tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors pick on Paladins for a number of reasons.  One reason is because Paladins were one of the most vocal opponents (not all Paladins but those that were, were also very vocal) to Warriors receiving any aggro control enhancements because there was a deep seated fear that if Warriors could actually hold the attention of the mobs no one would ever use a Paladin again.  That seems to have been a highly overblown fear.  And the second reason is a reoccuring theme with Paladins that they must have every tool Warriors have as a tank, because Paladins are also tanks and must therefore tank as well as a Warrior under any and all circumstances because their spells are meaningless.  Not a very convincing arguement to people who have actually leveled up the hard way completley without spell support of their own.<br />
<br />
I think most Warriors know that the pure casting classes have huge advantages over the pure melee classes.  And by extension we believe that the hybrid classes have more advantages than they're willing to admit because in this game mana is &quot;the&quot; power.  Much more is accomplished by the use of mana than was or is accomplished by the use of hit points alone.  So Rogues and Rangers might be adequate, but we don't see them as real competition since few people will take a Rogue or a Ranger as tank when a Warrior is available if the Warrior is anywhere near as well geared.  While people can and do take Paladins and SKs over Warriors.  And I know that Knights feel that the chain classes tank far too similarly to Knights, but Warriors don't feel the pinch from that direction much and feel much more threatened by Knights who are not only direct competition for group slots but also continuely appear to want to acquire every item of worth in the very small Warrior bag of tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It also seems people forget when they say plate that a cleric also wears plate. Being a half cleric and half warrior you would think that would mean being somewhere in the middle ground between the 2 classes. As it is now it would seem more like 80% warrior and 20% cleric. All defensive would do is further that gap. <br />
At the high end I can see where warriors might not have a problem at all keeping aggro but prior to getting to that stage we have enough to get by but still the aggro is not as guaranteed as what a knight has. We never wanted a button that you hit once and it instantly gives you full aggro. The button we got is exactly that, not guaranteed aggro like a stun but just enough to get you past the hump of your cleric or slower dieing before you even have a chance to get aggro. Atleast it seems that way to me for the pre-elemental or non twinks. Most Paly's post I have seen like to say incite is an instant aggro button that never fails and is just as instant as a stun but that is just not the truth. A monk using throwing weapons on pulls usually will keep aggro over incite even with the use of arrows until they FD. That is unless taunt actually does work on that attempt. Bards pulling with a non damage it's a different story. One arrow and incite and as long as no one cast it will come straight for you. That might not be true for the high end but I think most would see that in pre-elemental. <br />
Maybe it's because I have never visited PoN that I know of but I do not remember ever seeing a warrior posting much about Pally's at all until we started working on what needed to be done for aggro. And then it wasn't us running to PoN and saying anything it was Paly's coming here and saying we should not have aggro control at all. Now it looks like someone is trying to say it was us being bitter when it actually to most I think was exactly the opposite.</div></div><hr />

Great DPS compare to other tanks, reasonable tanking, and incredible snap aggro (snare + AA snare).  <br />
<br />
There's a reasonable amount of loot in GoD.  Aside from Uqua and maybe the Grand Summoner Ring I don't feel any areas are particularly bad at RvR.  Uqua could really use some kind of save point... like after beating a Tqiv or something...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the way I think it should be, or something similar.  Warriors should get cool abilities that are not spells and are different from Knight spells, and Knights should be equivalent tanks.  A Paladin is not conceptually supposed to hide in the background healing and buffing some minimally religious Warrior who has no divine blessings and attacking from the flank like a Rogue...he should be at the forefront of battle.  The current way tanks work is really bizaare conceptually, and this includes aggro, who can tank what, utility etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You also forget that while the paladin has been on his knees in prayer the warrior has been fighting, therefor getting better. In the theme of your post a warrior will always be better because they just fight, they do nothing else, when your pally is prctising spells, a warrior is training.</div></div><hr />

You can cook up some kind of a justification from a roleplaying stand point for just about anything.  But EQ is a game.  With people playing it.  And as a result in order to keep people playing all the classes it's not really possible to come up with bizarre scenarios about how this righteous Paladin can call on his god to smite his foe destroying him on the spot and so forth.  It's not going to happen, and it's not a basis on which to design balance.  Balance is required so that every class has enough going for it that people still want to play it in reasonable numbers.  No one class should be completely dominate in all situations. And that's pretty much what we have right now among the three plate tanks.  Except that where Knights shine, in single groups or in support roles on raids, isn't where they want to shine.  So they think that they'll try for the whole enchalada.  Well, they're not getting the whole enchalada.  And their protestations that they're poor starving third world children in desperate need of the whole enchalada just doesn't fly.</div></div><hr />
