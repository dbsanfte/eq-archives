<br />
Headlines! <br />
------------------- <br />
Veeshan's Peak has been re-worked. Enjoy the new challenge. <br />
A new Adventure Zone appears on Stormhammer. <br />
You can now remove augments without losing them. <br />
<br />
Veeshan's Peak! <br />
------------------- <br />
With this revamp we have Updated the level and NPC list for the zone: Please note that this zone is now an elemental level zone! The entry quest to Veeshan’’s Peak has been changed. The original key quest has not been modified. However, the new entry quest uses the old key and offers an alternate quest to do instead of the original key quest. <br />
<br />
- Items in the zone are now of elemental planes quality. <br />
- Faction now matters: Dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now speak to players if you have the correct faction and can understand them. <br />
- New quests and lore: The dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now give players the option to acquire items through questing for them. <br />
- The zone is now an exp zone as well: Hunting in the areas before the dragons yields experience and loot. <br />
<br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone for Stormhammer <br />
------------------- <br />
Stormhammer gains a new adventure zone. This is a 2 group adventure zone for characters of level 65. <br />
<br />
Can you help the Eldritch Collective find and rescue Professor Bartleby Beckelbracker? Search the Desert of Ro for the whereabouts of Bartleby and his assistant Bomo and try to save them from the steel clutches of their enemies. <br />
<br />
<br />
Augment Removal * <br />
------------------- <br />
- You can now purchase special &quot;distillers&quot; that will remove augmentations without destroying them. These distillers are sold by a merchant in Butcherblock. The item inspect window for an augmentation will tell you which distiller is required to remove it. <br />
<br />
- The existing solvents can still be used to destroy an augmentation if you don't want to keep it. You no longer need a different solvent for each augmentation slot. The interface will allow you to select which augmentation you wish to delete. <br />
<br />
- For those with custom UI's, you will need to update your EQ_Container.xml file in order to use the new augment window. <br />
<br />
<br />
Pets * <br />
------------------- <br />
- Zoning pets are in. Persistent pet data includes: Items, Spell Effects, hit points, mana, name, height, and mana cost to summon them. All PC summoned pets should zone with you in all instances except for when you die. Pets will also follow the same rules as no rent items if you log with a pet. <br />
<br />
- Pets can be shrunk again. Please wash them in only Cold water to prevent inadvertently reducing their size. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tribute Changes * <br />
------------------- <br />
- Some items have had their favor value lowered. <br />
<br />
- Players will now &quot;Pre-pay&quot; for tribute benefits. When benefits are activated, the player will immediately be charged for those benefits from their Favor pool. After that, the player will be charged every 10 minutes for the next 10 minutes of benefit. If benefits are deactivated before the timer is depleted, no refund is given for the time remaining. <br />
<br />
- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits they've selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his benefits, he will be &quot;Pre-pay&quot; (see above). The ability to change selected benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed. <br />
<br />
- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player's benefits will deactivate. Players may re-organize their selected benefit load, but will not be able to &quot;preview&quot; the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when the benefit is selected). Benefit descriptions should give the player a good indication of what the benefit will do when activated. <br />
<br />
- The EQ Label that shows the Tribute Benefit Timer will now show green when benefits are active and gray when they are not. <br />
<br />
<br />
Item Changes <br />
------------------- <br />
- Manastones will no longer work in Forgotten Halls. It was not intended for the item to be used there and some naughty folks were taking advantage of the zone. <br />
<br />
- Malcohm Thimbleton, in the Plane of Knowledge will now swap out some Robe Graphic items for Tunic Graphics. * <br />
<br />
- The Staff of Revealed Secrets now has a 2hb weapon model instead of the little stick it had before. Enjoy your bigger stick. <br />
<br />
<br />
UI Changes <br />
------------------- <br />
- It is now possible to display your mana as a numeric value on your inventory screen. * <br />
- By mousing over your buff icons, you will now be able to see the buffs remaining duration. * <br />
<br />
Berserkers <br />
------------------- <br />
- Berserkers now have innate crits beginning at level 12. <br />
- Tainted Axe of Hatred now comes in stacks of 20. <br />
<br />
<br />
Additional Notes <br />
------------------- <br />
- You now have the ability to sell back LDoN items and augments to the adventure merchants for a percentage of their original cost. * <br />
<br />
- We have increased the number of NPC debuff slots from 30 to 50. Necromancers rejoice. * <br />
<br />
- The Doppleganger AA's re-use timer has been reduced to 30 minutes. * <br />
<br />
- Sprint and Planeswalk have had their movement rate increased. * <br />
<br />
- Beware! Many named mobs in Gates will now summon. <br />
<br />
- The Hide all traders option, for the Bazaar, will no longer need to be reset each time you enter the zone. * <br />
<br />
- /stopspellcast will no longer give spells recast delays. <br />
<br />
- Leadership: Group/Raid mark npc should now update for people that are added to the group or raid. <br />
<br />
- Main assist will no longer clear if the main assist zones. <br />
<br />
- Bards should once again play the stringed instrument animation when playing a stringed instrument song. <br />
<br />
- Hynid fleshrippers, tide feasters, and shore stonemites in Natimbi no longer hit so hard. <br />

<br />
I think I'm probably having a blond moment, but what is the purpose of this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL not sure...but there is a raft of other nice changes there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I'm probably having a blond moment, but what is the purpose of this?Zones aka dies. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lets see, only 3 items really help casual people out of all these changes.<br />
<br />
Augments, Pets and buff timers, everthing else is more geared to raiders and power gamers, even the tribute stuff as I dont know many people that bother with it.<br />
<br />
I guess I will find a reason to bitch about anything :D<br />
<br />
I hope the next patch is more bug fixes and the one after that is adressing class issues</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinmari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The main assist function has a special targeting ring.  When the main assist zoned/died, etc...the ring would no longer work unless you removed the main assist and then reassigned it.  It's a good fix :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Tin.<br />
I'm going to get some more coffee now so Perhaps I'll be capable of thinking.<br />
&quot;Zone&quot; indeed. Bah!<br />
Knowing the duration left on buffs = teh win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm HotT not mentioned, no changes to Call of Time according to lucy, let's see if there was any change to SwarmPet811 ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mmmmm augment removal and buff timers alone are a pretty big deal to me.<br />
<br />
Time remaining to refresh Discipline timers would be sweet too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">only 3 items really help casual people out of all these changes<br />
<br />
These also help raiders and power gamers also.  Us casuals just got a trickle effect.<br />
.. O, we did get lesser hitting mobs in Natambi .. woopeee :P<br />
<br />
Yeah, I gotta bitch too.  Is the sell back 70% LDON in there?  How about choosing the LDON mission? or more points based on lesser used LDONs? or all the gabizzilions of changes to the casual expasion, LDON.<br />
<br />
Is nice to see a LDON raid for 2 groups.... on Stormhammer...  I'd LOVE to see 2/3 group LDON raids desighned for pre Elemental guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think casual players will find VP much easier to get into than the elemental planes, and very worthwhile for them once they get in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">only 3 items really help casual people out of all these changes<br />
<br />
This is the kind of bean counting that's going to keep the gap between &quot;casual&quot; players and &quot;Raiders&quot; from ever growing smaller. Bug fixes help everyone, hell any fix helps everyone. You may not be on a raid with a bugged MA ring now, but someday you might and you'll be happy that it was fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And I think you are wrong about the tribute change. That helps causals more than the raiders--we have less dispoable income so being able to turn tribute buffs on and off is a major + for us. I mean how many of the drops from LDoN normals do you really use? Those are all triubute loots for my groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think casual players will find VP much easier to get into than the elemental planes, and very worthwhile for them once they get in.<br />
<br />
Really? I want to fight dragons again =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ozox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Time remaining to refresh Discipline timers would be sweet too <br />
<br />
Being able to hold your mouse cursor over a disc and see the time remaining would be great.  Its real easy to lose track of the last time you hit fort/furious or any disc with a long refresh time.  I dont like having to click on the disc to get the refresh time, you risk blowing your disc at a very bad time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah well Raaj think of it this way: how many times a month will a casual player want to remove augs and sell back previously undropable LDoN stuff? What, twice a month? Once a week?<br />
Yet I've long argued that if my kilt makes my ass look big I shouldn't be stunnable from behind--and I could be stunned from behind at any second! Dozens nay hundreds of times a day!<br />
I say it again and again using short Anglo-Saxon words that are easy to get: my ass is big what do I get for that huh? <br />
But do I see a change addressing my concern in this patch message? Noooooooo. It's as if SOE is just laughing at me!<br />
The only thing saving me from an aneurysm even as I type is the chance that the patch includes a ninja change in this regard. <br />
If it does, fine.<br />
If not, then of course my wrath will be the wrath of the righteous.<br />
I pay SONY essentially $13/month. I'll withhold my essence from them! They'll see! And they'll be sorry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Manastones will no longer work in Forgotten Halls. It was not intended for the item to be used there and some naughty folks were taking advantage of the zone. <br />
<br />
Oh right, players are naughty now because your coders don't know what the fuck they're doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heheh, thanks for a chuckle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oh right, players are naughty now because your coders don't know what the fuck they're doing.<br />
<br />
of course we are naughtie. we are expected to comb the developers boards while we are at work and search and search for lists developed by the eq staff explaining in the grandest detail what their 'intentions&quot; are for all the features they put in the game and then to voluntarily reject the use of any strategy that doesnt follow their intentions. you havent found the links yet? neither have i but then im naughtie because i do work when im at work rather than researching the boards.</div></div><hr />
