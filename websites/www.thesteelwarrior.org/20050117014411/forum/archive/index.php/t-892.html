<br />
THis is my first post here. I've been lurking a couple weeks and must say that this is the best board for info i`ve ever found.<br />
<br />
Just thought i would post and see if peeps can give me so things to look for as upgrades to my equipment. I think i`ve done a fairly good job with it thus far but i`m always looking to improve (aren't we all? =p)<br />
<br />
As far as cash on hand I could spend about 50k on upgrades atm.<br />
<br />
I`m purchasing a GSoT tonight so I think i`m ok in the weapons department for the time being.<br />
<br />
All suggestions are welcome =)<br />
<br />
P.S. My hp is off on my magelo for some reason ...in game i`ve got a little over 3700hp unbuffed<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

-A CT earring and a bloodmetal earring of engagement would be upgrades<br />
-Vindi BP would be a good one if that's possible given your guild.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it depends on where your guild is going, NToV?  Ssra?  PoP?<br />
<br />
There's a ton of stuff there which could upgrade you, but it would be nice to know where you're guild is headed.<br />
<br />
GsoT rocks =)</div></div><hr />

Maybe  Horn Spiked Shouldars as well. Also from the hedge maze there are some higher HP arms but the name escapes me atm. Other than that you gear looks good.</div></div><hr />

As far as the guild ...I just formed a very small family type guild. I`m the highest lvl with the rest being in the low to mid 50's.<br />
<br />
Right now we're only 18 members strong and only about 1/2 that play regularly (4 - 5 times per week)<br />
<br />
We're gunna be going to HoT in the next month or so but thats about as big as we figure we will be able to handle for a while.<br />
<br />
So any upgrades I get for a while will have to be bought unfortunately. Thats a good thing though cause then the drops can go to other members instead of me =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the replies =)</div></div><hr />
