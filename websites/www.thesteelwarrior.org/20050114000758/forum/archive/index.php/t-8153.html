<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelor Silverblade</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a 64 Agnostic Barbarian warrior (30%) away from 65. I am posting my magelo in hopes of some constructive threads on what to do for equipment next. As you can see my HP's are fairly anemic although raid buffed I can hit almost 7K. I am not the MT but am secondary tank. I am guilded and our guild/alliance is not elemental planes capable (yet) but we are doing targets such as Aerin dar and Grummus. I would like to be able to MT although depending on what you guys think, that may not be an option. <br />
<br />
Here is my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=562351<br />
<br />
Any thoughts? <br />
<br />
Also as soon as I hit 65 I am working on the following AA's since my hps' are so anemic so any thoughts on that would be appreciated also: <br />
<br />
I have RUN3 already<br />

Thanks in advance for all replies. <br />

If the mob cannot kill you in a single round (as with Grummus for example), then it doesn't really matter how many hit points you have.  What matters is how much damage you can mitigate and avoid.  Bottom line: it is more efficient to take 10% less damage than it is to have 10% more hit points.</div></div><hr />

These aren't the best pieces availble, but they are decent upgrades on what you have, and almost all are purchasabled in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sass is absolutely correct in regards to aa's. I'd even suggest getting WA1 in there as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for gear, my suggestions are getting around to replacing the Champion armor.<br />
<br />
Things i'd suggest when looking for replacement gear:<br />
<br />
Hps / sta - more is better of course<br />
Dex - More procs for more aggro<br />
Resists - Think of it as spell mitigation</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelor Silverblade</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok thanks for the replies. I appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking HP, but some of you suggested mitagation/avoidance...</div></div><hr />

... after you have all your basic avoidance/mitigation aa's ... then continue on with hps.<br />

If youre having problems with aggro, invest aa's in a few levels of weapon affinity early on.  In my humble opinion, the avoidance/mitigation aa's will help you be a better tank far more than the raw hp aa's.  Until you start raiding tier2-3 bosses 7k hps is enough to get the job done.<br />
<br />
Make babysteps on the gear and aa and you'll be surprised how quickly your tankability goes up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now to start working on those AA's!!! <br />
<br />
One thing, I am also wanting to work EF LDONS to get up points for anger augs. Do the EF LDONS give good AA XP? That way I could kill 2 birds with one stone so to speak, or should I focus on areas that give good AA XP? <br />
<br />
Thanks again to all TSW'ers for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN are all the same exp wise... the more ya kill, the more exp ya get.<br />
<br />
iirc, i get about 40% AAexp per ldon. I just dont bother watching the meter that closely because it just isnt fast enough anyway :/<br />
<br />
It aint bad, but if you wanna focus on aa's, better off grinding them in BoT, HoH, Tactics, etc.</div></div><hr />
