<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know if you put a 2nd proc on a weapon if the 2nd proc causes the original proc to happen less?  It seems like most weapons proc about once every 30 seconds, so if you have a weapon with Enraging Blow on it and you augment it with Anger III, does the EB proc happen once every 60 seconds now and the Anger III happens once every 60 seconds or Does EB still fire once every 30 seconds, and also you get Anger III about once every 30 seconds?<br />
<br />
This could be important to know before people start double stacking procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been thinking for a while now that the people saying &quot;Wow i can stack procs for double the proc rate&quot; were probably wrong in their assumption. <br />
<br />
My guess would be that a second proc will act the same as the ranger and paladin proc adding spells work now, i.e.  the proc rate remains the same but the effect given is randomised between the weapon's and the spell gifted procs.  If that is indeed the case then upgrading a proccing weapon with a lesser hate proc would actually decrease the aggro potential of said weapon....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Except thats not how it works Valeris... weapon procs and imbue procs (Call of Sky, etc) are independant of each other.  So if both have a 5% proc rate, you in effect have a 10% chance to proc on a swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That true? My mistake then, obviously my information (gained from here, lol) was wrong :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine coding had to change somewhat to allow for them to stick that extra proc on there (since as far as I know there's never been a weapon b4 with more than 1 proc normally).  So who knows what they did,  I'm sure we'd all like it to not affect the original proc rate, but I can see how it could easily happen (even unintentionally).<br />
<br />
Anyhow worth figuring out I think.  (I'd do it myself but atm I'm not playing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically we just need somebody to check the proc rate before augmenting and after augmenting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i guess i would depend on if the aug added to the orignal proc, or created a seperate proc.<br />
<br />
edit: saw in other thread their seperate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baam</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gryzx. yes, SOE actually did change the code. If you read the discussings and chats with Devs and other from soe you will find out that they have rewritten a lot of codes to make they new features in Ldon possible.<br />
<br />
Valeris. Yeah, it was discussed on another thread.. I of course forgot the name and don't really care now.<br />
The discussing was about something else, but ended up about numbers of stackable procs...!!!<br />
<br />
Yes, you can proc, weapon enraging blow proc, Call of fire and the Night's Dark Terror illusion with a small lifetap proc. They all stack and yes, you can crit them all with the appropriate aa abilities. You cannot crit proc Enraging blow of course.<br />
<br />
The procs always seemed for me to be independent of each other, so they are in my opinion definetly worth getting.<br />
<br />
Proof?? no, I won't post any proof. This is all from my experience and judgement. <br />
<br />
Trust me at your own will !!<br />
<br />
Yes, I edited a bit. Was in a hurry when I wrote it first.<br />

 I ran a 20 minute parse today with my zek hammer. 200 dex, no yaulping or anything. Not a single 'Your target is too far away!' or 'You cannot see your target.' (tho there were 3-4 self heals). This was against the kromrif recruiter in kael. (banker in katta is way too spammy for me) <br />
<br />
20 mins 200 dex: 196 procs of Hand of the Gods <br />
<br />
I added a cheap (20 point blast of frost) proc augment to my zek hammer and went back to do another 20 minutes. <br />
<br />
20 mins 200 dex: 203 procs of Hand of the Gods, 19 procs of Blast of Frost <br />
<br />
The sample size is really small. Probably a few more runs would give a more reliable result. The frequency of the proc is amazingly low when you're used to hand of the gods hehe<br />

<br />
I've never seen proc rates like that before. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some summoned cleric hammer procs that.  Hand of God is the name of the proc, as the quote says.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the cleric hammer, summoned hammer.  Surprised you can add an augment too it and they didnt change that like the mage, warrior summoned epics... wow, surprised clerics havent gone batty.<br />
<br />
But , its the summoned cleric hammer, its proof that weapons are given inate proc rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilcure</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He didn't add it to the summoned hammer he added it to the Furious Hammer of Zek, the one that drops from VZ.  It's also possible to add procs to the Coral Headed Mace that drops from Plane of water with the same proc on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a BoW and Call of Fire from my aten gloves almost 100% of the time.  I have had back to back EB and CoF procs, I'm pretty positive they don't effect each other.  I'm kind of curious to see what the aggro is like on the BoW with EB, Anger 3, and call of fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice, that cleric test is really interesting because it says that the proc added will have it's own proc rate and not tied at all to the proc rate that the weapon already had.  I wonder if all proc augments will be in the 1 a minute rate or if they'll have different rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And for lower/mid levels not able to get BoC/Hategiver/ etc it may be decent enough to place ange3 on Blue epic for increased dex/atk and the proc. That and CHSD might be good combo then since both procs are unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">more parses, that sample size is way to small for me to risk reducing EB proc rate.  anyone parse this yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This enough for you?  Parses from another ranger to support my findings post to the Glade:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Went and did some parses myself for the whole Imbue procs Vs. Natural procs thing like Ladas.<br />
<br />
Did 2 half-hour parses on a mob, one without CoT up, one with CoT up. Using Ivory Hilted Cleaver in mainhand, Grandmaster Fletcher's Knife in offhand so the offhand wouldn't swing. 305 dex, 41% haste from shoulders, no spell haste.<br />
<br />
First parse:<br />
2182 swings<br />
52 Wrath of Ice - 2.38%<br />
52 Cry of Thunder - 2.38%<br />
<br />
Second parse:<br />
2186 swings<br />
56 Wrath of Ice - 2.56%<br />
<br />
Like Ladas said, looks to me like Imbue procs do not effect natural weapon proc rates at all.<br />

Valeris asked if the post I made about Imbue procs and Innate procs was true... I was giving him more information on the subject.</div></div><hr />
