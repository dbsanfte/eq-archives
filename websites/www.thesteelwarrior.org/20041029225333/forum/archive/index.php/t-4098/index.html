<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>XCrovax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, me twink is coming up in the world and its time I stopped calling him a twink.  I have commited to grinding xp to get Morgg up to a level that he can function as a MT/OT in a world of 65's.  Not an easy task but one that I expect I will be quite proud of once accomplished.  I am looking for any help I can get from my warrior peers so here goes.  My Magelo is fairly accurate to date.  Some of the skills may be off 'cause I was working from memory but they close enuff.  <br />
<br />
My intention is to hold off on AA until I hit 65, although the temptation to get AE taunt is high.  Is it safe to assume that AE Taunt is the first AA a warrior should buy after the initial 6 in general?<br />
<br />
As for gear, he has some very nice pieces, quite a few functional pieces that may carry him to 65, and a few god awful pieces that must go.  Over the next 30 days I expect I will be able to invest approx 60k into his growth, this is assuming about 30k every 2 weeks.  My current plan is to start out with some ornate gloves which go for about 30k on me server.  Is that a good plan or should I first invest in losing the weaker pieces in my inventory, such as his ears, helm, and bow?  I figure for the same 30k I spend on ornate hands I can fill those 4 slots rather nicely.  I would also be interested in another item for my off hand for those rare occasions where I go with my dual wield.  Please note that the only farming I intend to do with this toon is in the bazaar.  No lengthy quests, camps, or adventures.<br />
<br />
While on the topic of ornate gear, I have heard conflicting stories about when Bor Warhammer wil speak to me.  Some say level 55, others say 60, still others say 62.  Can anyone confirm any of this?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need 6 in General and 12 in Archetype before you can get AE Taunt in Class. Thus, you must spend 23 points to get it.<br />
<br />
Bor will give you the medallion and the forge for the Ornate armor at level 55, all you need is the rest of the stuff. Also, the forge and medallion are one-shot deals. You have to hand him 500pp for each piece you get. But, since the forge is Lore, hand in, get the items, combine (the forge poofs), hand in again for another medallion and forge...repeat as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lvl 55, confirmed.<br />
<br />
Also, remember not to be tempted by the easy fix. Upgrade something for the long term, don't spread the wealth out on several slots that are mediocre, because you will find yourself just having to upgrade them again, and loose money reselling the outdated equipment.<br />
<br />
Ornate is a solid choice post 55. Until LDoN I would have said Ornate would be my last armor ever own, and it stil may be in some slots. One thing I would hold off on the Ornate helm, as it would be close to Helm of Rallos Zek, which I hope to save for one day.</div></div><hr />
