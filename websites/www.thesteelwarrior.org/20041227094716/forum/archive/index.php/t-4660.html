Just as an FYI, I'm Ryan Barker, one of the Dev's working on the new Melee system.  Those of you that have been in recent Betas know me as Rytan.<br />
<br />
As I'm sure you've all noticed, we're still making lots of changes to the system before it goes live.  Based on the testing and great feedback we've gotten from a number of people we're looking at making the Provoke line up look something like this:<br />
<br />
Provoke - Level 20, 100Hate, 40Hate/Tick, 500 Total Hate<br />
Bellow - Level 45, 200 Hate, 50Hate/Tick, 700 Total Hate <br />
Berate - Level 56, 300 Hate, 60Hate/Tick, 900 Total Hate<br />
Belittle - Level 63, 400 Hate, 70 Hate/Tick, 1100 Total Hate<br />
<br />
I'm hesitant to post endurance cost numbers at this point because we're still monkeying with the formula quite a bit, and it will likely change a lot before it goes live.  It should work out to being available once per NPC depending on the speed at which you pull.<br />
<br />
In regards to the range, I don't plan on increasing the range past 100.  This is not designed as a pulling tool, but rather an ability that gives warriors a way to pull immediate aggro when a mob enters camp.  It's not going to let everyone cast their biggest spells with impunity, but it should shorten the window that casters will still pull aggro with an early debuff or nuke.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in you feedback on this, or any other aspect of the melee system you have a chance to test.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good to me. Personally I wouldn't mind giving up a bit of hate to gain 125 or 150 range instead(so I could retire my bow hehe), but I fully understand that this is probably not what the majority  of warriors need. <br />
<br />
Nice to see that this line of skill doesnt stop at the lvl 20 Provoke version :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow this sounds very promising. This was mentioned by someone in another thread, but I wish there was a way to play my current character on test to actually see how this would work in my current play style... /testbuff is a start but, you know. But again, it certainly looks good on paper!<br />
And btw, thank you Rytan for posting this for us. I think I speak for the community when I say it does mean a lot to us when someone from SoE takes the time to let us know what's going on and what you guys are thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fafnir</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that concerns me with having in the &quot;just enough&quot; category for range is: what happens when you try to provoke a mob but it is out of range?   No effect?  Can provoke immediately when it enters range or do you need to wait for recycle time?<br />
<br />
It would seem gratuitus to put each provoke &quot;spell&quot; on seperate timers, wouldn't it?  Alas, that would make us like paladins/sks.  Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having provoke line, and taunt for that matter, not gray out when OOR would be a big help! My only questions would be stacking and availabilty. Can you berate as soon as in range and then provoke right before calling assist?  And will berate be available from a vendor? It seems like this will be a difference maker between an effective and ineffective character and as should be available to a_bazaar_warrior01 as it is to a_time_warrior01.<br />

Thanks for stopping by and keeping us informed!</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot Ryan. Sounds MUCH better. We've been testing last few hours and hopefully we'll be able to get our hands on belittle to give it a run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw you spelled &quot;Provoke&quot; wrong in the heading of your thread, Rytan ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks MUCH better.  The hate on the lvl 63 version seems pretty solid.  Will definitely have to play with it when I can get one of you to delete some of the 30 skills on my char to make room.  Would like to see how it performs in a real group situation.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming the dot portion won't stack with itself if you hit on refresh so we won't be getting 140 hate/tick if we just mash.  Best use anyway would probably be initial aggro then save refresh for a failed taunt when mob turns.<br />
<br />
Would the hate dot effect block Provoke from another War though?  i.e. MT provokes on chain then dies, but 2nd MT can't land Provoke because first MT's hasn't worn off?  Or would it be overwritten?<br />
<br />
I can probably deal with it not being a pulling tool, though I think you're wrong not letting it be one.  Having to swap out a non-bow range slot to pull is still gonna be a pain in the ass.  VZ globe, Saryrn symbol, Quarm stone are pretty much the top choices for endgame Wars these days - not many get VZ bow over rangers.  Don't really see how making this 150 range would make it overpowered.  We're not going to replace escape/fd/lull classes as pullers if it's 150 range.  It would just alleviate the headache of the swap when we pull for ldon and xp groups, which I, and I'm sure others, do often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and yeah, MUST MUST MUST MUST give it the /rude emote.  That's key.<br />
<br />
And 'Belittle' is kind of an awkward name for it.  Maybe Finger of Rallos/Zek (jk), Challenge of Rallos/Zek, Challenge, Insult, Incite, Heckle, Affront, Mock, Ridicule, Goad, Contempt, Tease, or Slander?</div></div><hr />

This looks very very promising.<br />

I hope you consider keeping the re-use on these abilities relatively low.  These alone already sound like they'll be making my playing experience less harrowing in terms of aggro. <br />

It was good of you to stop by the boards.</div></div><hr />

This ability should, imo, address ALOT of the concerns that Warriors are currently experiencing.<br />
<br />
I can't wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's good news :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well lets see...the biggest problem overall with warriors is lack of agro control overall (We're not talking Knights have just better agro...they actually have commandable agro, whereas warriors had &quot;perhaps&quot; agro).  The second largest problem is that warriors essentially had 1 disc, because using anything else screwed them if they needed it.  Third largest problem is warriors have no other abilities other than attack, kick, and use the above.<br />
<br />
Now, warriors are getting a (theoretically, at least, need input on how effective it is) much better command of agro with this Provoke line.<br />
<br />
Also, disciplines have been separated into 4 different timers, allowing warriors to take advantage of their DPS increasing and emergency discs while still allowing them to have Defensive/Evasive available when needed.  Also, although this remains to be seen how effective they will be, new disciplines being added at 61/63/65.<br />
<br />
Somehow, I find these two things much more important than the opening system...which I do think needs some work, or possibly needs to be scrapped in favor of plain abilities...or at least something needs to happen there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, these are effected by other hate increasing effects (ie: Voice of Thule, Echo of Anger, Spirit of Rage discipline). With these 3 stacked you can throw out ~708 raw hate initially and another ~508 every 30seconds.<br />
<br />
Using it just before breaking mez almost always results in you having initial agro as well. This line is a fantastic addition to the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xahulz</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know if provoke line can be resisted, by anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zhakran</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming the refresh time on these is still 30sec, this is actually extremely useful, and about the best thing I've seen EQ wise in about...well...forever. <br />
<br />
Seeing as your average LDoN normal mob goes down in 30sec or less, that seems like a very reasonable refresh. If you lose aggro after using the level 63 ability, it's almost certain that someone fucked up :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumb</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My one question that comes off the top of my head is..<br />
<br />
Will there be a chance for the skill to FAIL?  I would see it as a slap in the face if so, as knights &quot;agro lock&quot; without worry of failure(even on a resist, they snag agro).  Also, given the &quot;taunt&quot; fails...<br />
<br />
Anyway, that is my one concern that I thought of immediatly.  Otherwise this looks great!  Appreciate the hard work on the melee fixes!</div></div><hr />

I just woke up, it's my birthday... and to be honest I am blinking in surprise at this.<br />

I'm really looking forward to trying the provoke line out when it goes live! <br />
<br />
It is just so great to see melee issues finally being addressed, and it may even be time to change my sig!<br />
<br />
On a side note, I'm wondering if in a link to melee tomes we will perhaps see a description of what they do, like spells have now?<br />

Like if say, a knight were tanking?<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for the game to be trivialized. And don't get me wrong the changes do look promising and I'm excited to test out the final version. But as long as knights remain unchanged I'm fearing that the initial problem is not solved. <br />
<br />
A 5% mitigation boost and small boosts that last for a tick or 2 are nice. But is it going to change the fact that a knight is still a more efficient choice as a tank.<br />

Is there any plan to modify knights in any way?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not a warrior, so take this with a grain of salt, but it seems to be that the progression of the ability is a bit off-time, especially compared to caster progression. <br />
<br />
In general, casters experience major upswings in the low-50s, and at 61, due to the nature of the expansions that granted these levels. I would thus suggest that major aggro upgrades for warriors should come at the same time, making the level progression 20-39-51-61-(65:Rune Level Drop). <br />

This way Warriors are forced to choose their ability set for the encounters.  Maybe not give them a spellbook, per se, just let them use the right-click assignments that all the other casters have (right click on empty 'ability gem', 'taunt' line, provoke).<br />
<br />
It would also be nice to allow the Warriors to chain them, maybe give the warrior a 6 second 'reuse' timer for all abilities after using one.  So if a Warrior wants to use the first (level 20) one, then the next higher, then then next one, then the next one, he can, it will just take him 18 seconds to get all 4 off.  It wouldn't make a huge difference for grouping (though it would be nice to hit the 56 one at first then if someone steals aggro, take a big boost with the 63rd level ability after that), but it would make a huge difference on raids, where the casters commonly have to wait until a mob is engaged for 30-90 seconds before startging to nuke/dot/whatever.  Currently the best way for a warrior to get good aggro on pull is to stand next to the slower and get a boost off him/her.  Of course, this is why my BST pulls with slow... take a few hits, but the Warrior gets a nice aggro boost.  If he takes aggro right off then I will actually stick another debuff on the mob so that the warrior gets that much more of an aggro boost.</div></div><hr />

I think what most warriors were looking for is a skill like this that we could use 1 time per mob to build some initial aggro.  Is the endurance cost going to be set with this expectation in mind?  I would hate to see it set high enough that using this ability once per mob pretty much keeps our endurance bar empty because that would make most of our other abilities unavailable.<br />

I would think under most circumstances that people would be using this skill about once every 30-60 seconds with constant pulls coming in.</div></div><hr />

Basically you just need to be using the weapon that does slightly less aggro than the MT.  No one else will come close to your aggro other than some random overnuking caster but they'll probably die anyway.  Sometimes I wish I can somehow lose my aggro before I have to tank because it's utterly impossible to do any kind of damage without going instant-splat when MT dies and while a lot of the time it doesn't matter, there are times it does too.  For heavy melee situations losing 5 non clerics is a lot better than losing even one more Warrior because there's only so many Warriors you can use.  Even if you use Knights, it's still the same story.  You can only lose so many of them before you can't salvage it anymore.<br />
<br />
Besides, AE Taunt more than covers any kind of snap aggro you need on a once per encounter level.</div></div><hr />

I doubt you will be able to use it every 30 seconds on the dot for long periods of time.  I bet the stamina refresh will be slightly longer but if you need to use it every 30 seconds you will be able to do so for a couple minutes before having to slow down.  I like how this looks so far though.  Should solve a lot of problems.</div></div><hr />

This is kinda funny.  Reminds me of a man in a desert being offered a glass of water (albeit an awfully useful one) and being greatful for the kind gift, while everyone else has been partying out by the lake.  <br />

WHile this line is adequate as presented by Ryan, it is still just a small part of what knights have at their disposal for agroing.  Of course they only need a fraction of that ablity in nearly all situations.</div></div><hr />

One question i do have is will you be able to use these abilities while stunned?  If so these could make time vz and encounters like him more of a joke than they already are.  Being stunned for 4 mins and having to do nothing but spam hotkeys really takes the strategy out of the fight.  One thing i would like to see is the stun abilities be either unresistable or lure.  I know you could care less about pvp ect but wars need a ton of help on the spell interupt side, and kick bash ect isnt the answer, esp since with time level focus most heal refresh is half the time as kick/bash refresh.</div></div><hr />

folks, with a 30 second reuse timer.....<br />
<br />
let me put it this way, you can burn yourself out in a 5k run by going all out at the start, sure you look flawless to start with, but you will be dragging ass at the end.<br />
<br />
the smart player would pace themselves, the only place where this could be abused is short raid encounters, and i am sure that there will be some mob's flagged agenst this where agro is what breaks or makes the raid (practice mobs like vindi and AoW)<br />
<br />
trust me if you hit it every time its up(2 or 3 times on a mob) then your endurance will drop like a stone<br />
<br />
he did say if people overused it the endurance cost would go up, FORCING people to play smart to get the most effective use out of it, because you will find yourself out of go juice if not<br />
<br />
from what ive heard this does just the right amount just where its needed, good hate on incoming to stop the dead slowers, and hate over time to keep the necro or shaman's from getting agro</div></div><hr />

Been there, tried that - As it is now, you taunt and a second later back it goes to the other person. The DOT hate will help no that account, though it will be no failsafe by far.<br />

You state this as if it were not the current situation.<br />
<br />
Currently there are 2 states of gameplay:<br />

1) Get a warrior, be careful and balance your aggro generation.<br />

2) Get a knight, nuke and heal as you need to because the game is BROKEN ALREADY with them.<br />

Now before you jump on me, I'm not saying that that this is the way it should be.  If someone casts a spell on something that's immune, then it should just ignore the spell completely.  SOE's programmers are dumbasses and haven't (won't?) shift their SQL code out of the game executable.  How do I know this?  Because they have to have a &quot;patch day&quot; to adjust any of the simple equation items that should be in script files... or at least they are in any application developed by a competent programmer.  But you can probably blame the people who originally designed the server application for that original problem.  Of course, this doesn't excuse SOE for not fixing it since then.  These types of things are the same reason why there is still duping and has been since the game started.<br />
<br />
Just think of it like this:  How much is Solusek Ro (or better yet, Fennin Ro) going to hate you for hitting him with a fire based spell?  Probably none, since if anything that is their native environment.  That would be like blowing air at me... so what?  Is it going to provoke me?  Probably not.  If it does, it will be 1/10th of what it would be if I wasn't immune to it.  Hate should be tied to actual effect, not the fact that the spell was cast.  And a level 9 spell shouldn't be sending a mob into a freakish frenzy, they need to fix the amount of hate that the level 9 spell generates.  It should be more in line with what the level 20 provoke does, 100... not 800 (guess).<br />
<br />
To sum up:  The current system is horribly broken.  The only ways to fix warriors is to either fix Pally stuns (BTW, I'm not a warrior and I want this, a broken game isn't fun to me), or give warriors something that is equivalent, breaking the game for a group with a Warrior in it, but balancing groups for warriors against the knights who give up NOTHING for their spells.</div></div><hr />

Seems like an easier answer would have been to adjust spell aggro instead of giving warriors &quot;hate dots&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mobs should care more about someone dropping 3k nuke bombs on them, or someone cranking out quad-300's melee. They shouldn't really give much of a damn about lvl 20 snares + stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since this already puts a buff on the mobs and thereby prevents it from being used (or could be) both by another Warrior or the original &quot;caster&quot;, could you consider decreasing the refresh time?<br />
<br />
Multi-mob environments are a big challange for Warriors. Lacking the rapid-fire aggro production of fast stuns at range and root for crowd control, our only methods of dealing with multiple mobs is AE Taunt (assuming they are near each other and we can get there), the taunt button, and multi-mob tanking.<br />
<br />
Using Provoke on the mob you are tanking and having a mezz break and the mob charge a caster some distance from you is pretty dismaying.<br />

Sony has stated that this wont be going into the game at this time, as they don't want melee to be more dependent on casters than they are now.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I have a serious problem with this. This game is all about class interdependence. Its far to late in the game to change your swing regarding this. Who cares if Class X gets a endurance regen spell. Great that means we will want to group with them.../shrug<br />
<br />
Another thing I would like to point out, is that unless these spells(skills) are avabile with realtive ease, then this wont affect balanace at all.<br />
<br />
I don't really care if they want to add skills like this as drops in the future, but right now, NOW, we need these improvements, not 6 or seven months of re-gearing up, or collecting skill runes.</div></div><hr />

Fear and stuns are BROKEN. You don't fix that by breaking something else.Whether or not they are going to tweak stun and spell aggro, that would affect a lot of our proccing weapons as well - and we're going to want a working solution for ourselves in place in that case.  And those tweaks may yet come.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping there are no endurance buffs, and that innate regen is sufficient.  I don't wanna bitch about a shaman in the group, when an enchanter can regen my endurance faster, or vice versa.  I'm too buff dependent as it is, and this would take us back to elite classes which as many of us know first-hand, inhibits interdependence.<br />
<br />
Unless of course, one of the monk anytime abilities is &quot;Channel Ki:  Enhance groups endurance regeneration by 20%&quot; :p.  Tho I'm kidding, it could be a nifty melee stacking ability ... warriors could have a parallel &quot;Flog the Sluggards&quot; ability, on the same timer as Provoke. Rogues could get ... hrm .. a &quot;Ride Coattails&quot; ability, where they look busy but do nothing while their endurance regens.<br />
<br />
Automatic opening responses AA, ack and no thanks (but my give me an &quot;Extend Opportunity&quot; AA ...). I know why it's desirable, I just don't want it. What I have seen on test makes me feel that the openings are a little shorter than they should be and that the UI needs some tweaking, but an auto-reflex game is what I already have.  I haven't touched my &quot;Parry&quot; button yet. <br />

If you gave warriors better agro on boss mobs, or rather infinite agro at will, about the only classes you would get more dps out of would be mages, druids, and shaman.  And wizards to a small extent, though I am approaching the point where I can SoS and click pants repeatedly without getting agro.</div></div><hr />

Heh, the Dot aggro thing is 70 hate per tick .. in other words 70 hate per 6 seconds, making it 11 hate persecond .... seriously, I doubt the Dot patr will make a big difference, but will be nice if you and someone else in the group are generating almost the same amount of hate trough your weapons.<br />
<br />
Been there, tried that - As it is now, you taunt and a second later back it goes to the other person. The DOT hate will help no that account, though it will be no failsafe by far.<br />

I mean, we are talking about 11 hate per second ... I'm quite sure you guys can pull that off with kick alone. :p <br />

its by no means a wonder(the over time agro) if you break it down, but in total that is 600 hate, plus the 400 straight for a total of 1000 hate, and using these do not stop you from kicking. disarming, and swinging, as well as using openings and procs.<br />

and the 30 sec reuse wont make us hold aggro on more then 2 mobs at once i guess ..but this is for sure a good improvment over what it was ...tash will still drag aggro initially im sure ..but with a warrior and provoke on same mob it should do ok.Not as good as pallys but ok <br />
<br />
(but taunt skill needs a improvment too ..seems to work 75 % less in ldon to me today i was hardly able to taunt a mob off something in there, my usual cheat was going as close as possible to the mob since thats where taunt seems to work best but only 1 out of 5 taunts seemed to draw the mobs attention every caster would have died 10 times in this adventure if the beastlord didn slow them all and drag them on himself from wich i couldn get aggro back even after 5 taunts and messages you taunt blabla)<br />
<br />
now ..start adding usefull effects to openings 2 3 4 5k DAMAGE  meele crits make them rarer or add another :) Special attack energy pool who fills over time and then you Start a devastating attack ? ...50 additional damage all 30 sec (a guess of openings aviable in average) wont fit it and makes no sense to even use them / risk headache to it since we got a dps of 100 wich makes 3000 per 30secs and thoose 50 over 3000 is just 3050 / balance this between war rog monk or add some other usefull effects who last a good while  ...give us some perma increase damage effects Rally Cry 6 secs ??? that doesnt seem much compared to a rangers Call of Predator and Tunares Str who do add more damage per second then this skill ever would do, and this over endless hours (permanent)  ...make it like 30 seconds at least and usable at will for a good endurance cost ..try look at  beastlords how long can he have his Ferocity on himself and the group ? i know the mana cost is high but he still manages to cast it on half the group and slow at times ...while it adds tons of % damage for meeles ..dont forget the nukes they get ..<br />
<br />
Warrior will NEED something to add to a group ...something spectacular ...something a group will like and ask for ...like alot classes already have.....<br />
thoose mini super short crap just doesnt make a difference at all ...if it isnt a buff it should be a ability who makes him different enough to be a addition.like perma 50% damage taking ? :)<br />
<br />
EQ is a game who suggests you to have diversity in a group every class has his benefits some more some less some balance it with dps ...the ones with group buffs are the best ones to have in a group since each adds to the entire groups Survilability and DPS<br />
<br />
My look at classes for xps groups <br />
<br />
Ranger attack buffs dam output DO well Bow damage is superb group buffs add alot of meele dps<br />
<br />
Mage pet summon stuff dam output (beastlord is superiour for xps reasons) Mages could be upgraded if you ask me<br />
<br />
Enchanter Clarity crowd control slows buffs CHARM. alot reasons to choose Enchanter even if i prefer a Beastlord since i got a chanter to buff my group aviable always. <br />
<br />
Shaman Slows buffs DOTS ..pet (Beastlord is Superiour for xp reasons) this class should recieve some sort of upgrade well i guess dots can make a ton of damage ...<br />
<br />
Wizzy hard nukes Ports dps ...said to be most dpsing class in game no uograde for this class ? :) well without clarity wizzy do no really good in xps groups <br />
<br />
Cleric no 1 healer Buffer for hps ac Rezzes and dps with hammer Always needed class noone wants to go without rezzes into Ldon .. far best fast groupheals buffs <br />
<br />
Druid no 2 healer Buffer ds Utility ports nukes dps Pot9&lt; reason to choose druid <br />
<br />
Rogue / Backstabs ...for alot damage good dps but no group buffs has to get some upgrade since he seems to fall more and more behind his Ranger counterpart ...in therms of usefullnes<br />
<br />
Monk / cant pull anymore dps &lt; Ranger wheres group buffs ?<br />
has to get a big upgrade <br />
<br />
Warrior / can tank but no aggro control no group utility ok dps but not enough to call it balanced because of it .has to get a upgrade <br />
<br />
Paladin / self heals group heals additional buffs rezzes utility<br />
can tank very well hold aggro has less ripostes due to 2handed weps ...selfbuffs who make him stronger undead dps with a druid healer Rezzes ...if needed <br />
<br />
Sk / tanks well group heals mana ? attack taps and so on ..dps has less ripostes due to 2handed weps can feign ...selfbuffs who make him stronger <br />
<br />
Beastlord / all of the above group buffs clarity like buff haste slows hp buffs utility pet attack buff <br />
<br />
there times i think SoE has no clue from theyre own game i play since beta 4 ..sure there different types of views but some things just become clear if you use them / play them.<br />
<br />
so im done for today ..i hope my english writing skill isnt that bad ...(i still hope the meele changes gonna add to diversity and usefullnes) PRAY for it .I wont restart another class having my warrior now at 174 aa and starting to collect VT / way on ele gear .</div></div><hr />

At least on the high end raids, getting yourself killed after the MT dies is completely trivial.  Basically you just need to be using the weapon that does slightly less aggro than the MT.  No one else will come close to your aggro other than some random overnuking caster but they'll probably die anyway.  Sometimes I wish I can somehow lose my aggro before I have to tank because it's utterly impossible to do any kind of damage without going instant-splat when MT dies and while a lot of the time it doesn't matter, there are times it does too.  For heavy melee situations losing 5 non clerics is a lot better than losing even one more Warrior because there's only so many Warriors you can use.  Even if you use Knights, it's still the same story.  You can only lose so many of them before you can't salvage it anymore.<br />
<br />
Besides, AE Taunt more than covers any kind of snap aggro you need on a once per encounter level.  <br />

So what if you only produce 1 hate / second if the initial effect is enough to give you aggro combined with your ordinary abilities like attack/kick/etc.<br />
<br />
You cannot seperate out the ability and then add it all together and divide by some random time. The ability in itself isn't supposed to give you any kind of superaggro deluxe.<br />
<br />
The ability + ordinary means is what need to be evaluated and that is what some people have done here (they have actualy been useing it) and most seems to be pleased with the results in general.<br />

Besides, it makes for more reliable aggro, which is quite welcome.<br />
Even if the main issue was aggro in the first 10 seconds of a fight.<br />

<br />
So yea in this situation, I have no problem with the monk pulling agro.<br />

Though admittedly i seem to be in the minority on this issue.  Most people seem to believe a warrior should grab aggro on inc with provoke, and only lose it if they die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously, the only part of the provoke line I dont fully understand the reasoning behind is the 1 min duration on the DoT. If the goal is to help a warrior with agro on incoming mobs, then 2-4 ticks should suffice(could make those ticks 100 agro instead of 70 then). <br />
<br />
For Example lets look a max hate you can produce in 1 min(assuming endurance costs would allow you - unknown at this time):<br />
<br />
Current proposal:<br />
Incite at 0 sec, 30 sec and 60 sec mark would produce a total of 1900 agro(3*400+10ticks of 70hate).<br />
<br />
If Incite was changed to a 400 hate, 100hate/tick, 3 tick duration skill, then:<br />
<br />
Alternate proposal:<br />
Incite at 0 sec, 30 sec and 60 sec mark would produce a total of 1800 agro(3*400+6 ticks of 100 hate).<br />
<br />
Also one thing that seems to be left out of the discussion is how much endurance all our skills actually take. <br />
<br />
Like, if we use provoke every time it pops, how would that affect our endurance on say, a 4min boss mob encounter in time?<br />
<br />
It could very well be that we are limited in this respect, and we might have to make a choice between chain provoking(and running out of endurance) or keeping defensive up. Most would probably chose defensive hehe.</div></div><hr />

My take on it so far, is that they want to AVOID a scenario where we can lock down aggro on a mob before it hit's camp.  Forget about the DoT, the initial aggro is gonna be a lot better than my arrow.  Especially since I'm to cheap to fletch a magical arrow ;).  I mean ... my finger procs Anger II on command!  RaR!<br />
<br />
It is is, as you say, meant to help with aggro and not guarantee it.  I am certain that the reasoning is that casters and such should be paying attention to their aggro generation for at least the first half of an engagement.<br />
<br />
To paraphrase what I've read here:  You don't amend a broken system (aggro lock on knights) by adding a broken system (aggro lock on warriors).  While I still think they should repair the broken system on knights, it never bothered me much and the provoke line looks like a working system to me.</div></div><hr />

I have a question about my Ring of the Crimson Bull.  Is the effect just going to be useless now or are they replacing it with a usefull effect?  I understand that endurance regen on demand w/ 1 sec cast time would make playing a warrior a lot more fun :) but probably isn't in the &quot;vision&quot;.<br />
<br />
p.s.  If the ring does give me instant endurance regen then I'll be verrry verrrry quiet about it!! :)  <br />
<br />
Effect on the ring is now serpent sight, right click, 1 sec casting time.<br />
<br />
Yea, it's useless, but so was invigor, both before and after the endurance change.  After the endurance change the invigor spell did nothing, so clicking it was pointless.  At least you can use serpent sight for a junk buff sometimes.</div></div><hr />

...if theres a monk out there that doesnt know how to control their aggro with frequent feign deaths?  The problem is not other classes being able to control their agro (unless you are grouped with an idiot). The problem is that with a knight, there is no NEED to control your agro. In all cases, control agro = less DPS, which by default makes a warrior a worse tank since the group overall does less damage. This is going to address that problem, rather handily I think.<br />
<br />
From a wizard standpoint, I really like these changes. It will allow me to nuke bigger early in the fight. As it stands, in exp situations, I am totally gimped by a warrior tank. I have to nuke easy early in the fight, or in some cases not nuke at all. This not only drops the amount of damage I am able to contibute, but it kills any mana efficiency advantage I would get from using a better nuke.</div></div><hr />

He wrote &quot;bigger early&quot;, opposing it to &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot;.  And he said why - that with a warrior tank the balance is shifted so far away from the extreme of your misquote that he cannot ride &quot;that wave of aggro&quot;, he just avoids nuking or pisses mana away on crap nukes.  He's not riding a wave, he's standing on the beach, for cry-i.  Iono about the higher levels, but Provoke isn't aggro lock for my little /testbuff, it's an aggro gain.  It can be jumped by a heal or two, as of about 10 minutes ago.Originally posted by Itzlegend <br />

You state that not needing to control your agro with a knight is 'a problem', yet you argue to increase that problem to warriors as well.  Like Doggabone has already pointed out, you are completely misquoting me. I don't want warriors to have agro lock, I want warriors to have a chance to keep agro off me. Right now, I can't do my job when a warrior is tanking for an exp group. Sure if he gets some lucky procs early then I can do some hurting, but if he doesn't, I am hosed and at best an exp leech, but more often a liability because I am using healer mana that would be better spent healing the tank. Believe me, it's not like I don't have the tools to work with, it's a matter of game mechanics. When I am having to click 3 or 4 concussions to get a mob off me after a single nuke, there is something wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any situation where you get more than one mob in camp and/or a need to change emphasis during the fight - when you've already been compelled to use provoke on the first one just to 'break even' - leaves that warrior back at square one. <br />
<br />
By all means prevent me from 'stacking' provokes on the same mob, but in combat I'm gonna 'need' there to be flexibility in how/when I  can/must use it or it's going to remain a noticeably inferior solution to just taking a knight tank. :confused:</div></div><hr />

I personally think that total aggro lock (endlessly) is a bad thing TM.<br />
<br />
People should learn to control their pace, they should not be able to chain nuke until they are blue in their face. This is bad for gameplay.<br />
<br />
I know that Knights can do this to some extent today and I think that is wrong also. The key phrase however is endlessly here. <br />
If a Knight needed to use level appropriate spells to achieve this &quot;near&quot; aggro lock and then might have problems with mana if he/she was useing it on all mobs, then I would say it would be ok.<br />
<br />
The thing is that what we need and what we want to keep a game of this kind fun is many time two different things. <br />
Trivial and endless aggro lock might be what many want for their &quot;boring&quot; grinds, but I believe what we need is the opposite. <br />
<br />
To be clear, this is not saying I think Knights need a total nerf of aggro generation via spells. What I think is that the low level spells need a revamp of the aggro they produce so that Knights need to use there best (highest level) spells to generate the aggro they have today.<br />
I also believe that you have to study the effects of the provoke line and tune it to make sure that warriors doesn't get &quot;too&quot; good aggro generation through it.</div></div><hr />

THEY didnt need it, they can get agro just fine! fug all the other little warriors that arnt equiped as well(about 90% of the game that isnt qquiped as well) and that they should spend their time on better things, like what you ask? more raiding content for their selfish ass<br />
<br />
the other whine I hear is that it is overpowered, that is absolute bull, dont like the changes? go to test server and feedback, just warning you ahead of time, feedback is linked to your account so dont make 50 level 1 gnomes to try and make it seem as if a army of people is agenst it, as it will show up as a feedback from your account name, not the gnomes you make(like warriorRsuxxors,warriorsgivebadcybor)</div></div><hr />

I dont know Itz, maybe its because the rest of us abide by the &quot;dont look a gifthorse in the mouth&quot; saying :p<br />
<br />
But seriously, the only part of the provoke line I dont fully understand the reasoning behind is the 1 min duration on the DoT. If the goal is to help a warrior with agro on incoming mobs, then 2-4 ticks should suffice(could make those ticks 100 agro instead of 70 then). <br />
<br />
For Example lets look a max hate you can produce in 1 min(assuming endurance costs would allow you - unknown at this time):<br />
<br />
Current proposal:<br />
Incite at 0 sec, 30 sec and 60 sec mark would produce a total of 1900 agro(3*400+10ticks of 70hate).<br />
<br />
If Incite was changed to a 400 hate, 100hate/tick, 3 tick duration skill, then:<br />
<br />
Alternate proposal:<br />
Incite at 0 sec, 30 sec and 60 sec mark would produce a total of 1800 agro(3*400+6 ticks of 100 hate).<br />
<br />
Also one thing that seems to be left out of the discussion is how much endurance all our skills actually take. <br />
<br />
Like, if we use provoke every time it pops, how would that affect our endurance on say, a 4min boss mob encounter in time?<br />
<br />
It could very well be that we are limited in this respect, and we might have to make a choice between chain provoking(and running out of endurance) or keeping defensive up. Most would probably chose defensive hehe.  <br />
<br />
aggro over time is to combat the stupid casters that poison DoT, fire DoT etc on incoming (mainly shamans and necros) its to keep the warrior putting out enough hate to prevent that DoT from biting the caster in the ass, and i personally think its a good idea, a group isnt gona hold back for the tanks abilitys, thats why there is a problem in the first place<br />

Wandor is obviously talking about the former. There is a sliding scale here, and warriors are too far down one end. I personally agree that warriors shouldn't only be brought up, but knights need to be moved down, to leave space for aggro loss in combat. But if knights aren't moved down, leaving warriors where they were was crippling.</div></div><hr />

If you nuke right when the pull comes in, I don't care if you're using a knight or a warrior or, heck, a rogue for a tank, you're going to get smacked.<br />
<br />
Now, wait for Darkness, Heat Blood, Lifetap over time, poison bolt, and disease cloud (or their upgrades) to do some damage, and you have what this is supposed to replace.<br />

<br />
I disagree.  I think agro should be virtually guaranteed.  Perhaps in the day of one mob encounters you may have had a valid point.  But far more interesting things can be designed if you assume that once a tank gets on a mob they can guarantee agro lock.  I think this opens up more interesting possibilities than having to worry about agro.<br />
<br />
Get a tank on the mob keep him alive and get debuffers more involved.  We don't even mez most mobs because they are resistant and if an enchanter gets agro they are dead.  So they become little more than buff bots, or you make it so that mobs are easily mezzed and it becomes trivial.<br />
<br />
Also, only a few damage classes are effected by warrior agro.  As a monk, I can keep agro on anyone.  A rogue can do pretty much the same thing.  Wizards are fine on boss mobs.  I am at the point of chain SoSing on many of the bosses we do, but have trouble on trash mobs.  Mages are hurt the worse.  Why penalize certain dps classes for having to control their agro, where as many others don't need to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, I really do not want to see &quot;the opening system&quot; go live. I think this would complicate play, and developer troubleshooting/resolution and coding.<br />
<br />
I would prefer to keep it simple....easy for me to say as a non developer:<br />
<br />
1.) Instead of an opening system, I believe the proposed disciplines changes AND greatly reducing the timers would be easier to work with from a developer standpoint, and preferred from this Warrior's viewpoint.<br />
<br />
2.) Again with the keep it simple, I like the idea of the proposals:<br />
Provoke - Level 20, 100Hate, 40Hate/Tick, 500 Total Hate<br />
Bellow - Level 45, 200 Hate, 50Hate/Tick, 700 Total Hate<br />
Berate - Level 56, 300 Hate, 60Hate/Tick, 900 Total Hate<br />
Belittle - Level 63, 400 Hate, 70 Hate/Tick, 1100 Total Hate<br />
<br />
However it is unclear to me at this point if and how taunt will work. Not knowing the details behind the coding and the complexities involved, I would prefer the taunt random number generator to be recoded to work A LOT more often with this hate built in.<br />
<br />
Is there a post by SOE Developers somewhere with in depth details on the proposed changes, thought process behind the proposals as to why it is best for a Warrior class they created and or the role they want Warriors to be in ?</div></div><hr />

Just to add my 2cp....  I have a difficult time playing my warrior in LDON.  I am unable to do the Hard missions so doing the Normal.  Mobs die in 40-50 seconds and there are normally 3 mobs in camp always.  I use my enchanter to bring them and root them near me with a dmg shield on me.   If a root breaks the mobs never stay on me AND i can never bring them back to my attention without root.<br />
<br />
This provoke line does nothing for me in LDON.  Maybe fighting in BOT on a 180-240 second fight ... <br />
<br />
Im disapointed.  I want a taunt that works when I push it not over time and only useable every minute.<br />

I also believe that you have to study the effects of the provoke line and tune it to make sure that warriors doesn't get &quot;too&quot; good aggro generation through it.First of all, lets get a few things straight. I also agree that agro lock is bad for the game and I don't think warriors should get agro lock. However, knights already have it. People keep bringing up that the use of low level stuns is what allows them to get agro lock. I have news for you, a decent knight is using the much better high level spells for agro. Particularly in the case of paladins, they will certainly use their higher level stuns to keep the damage down on 55+ mobs. In an exp group, 95% of the time the mobs are going to be level 55-65 so only the higher level stuns will work in the first place. I have NEVER, NOT EVEN ONCE had a group that had to slow pulling down because the knight was low on mana. When a knight tanks, I can nuke the minute the mob is in camp. Any decent knight will already have 1-2 spells on the mob by the time it is in camp. That will give them enough of a head start that I can't pull agro off them even chaining Strike of Solusek.<br />
<br />
Again, I am not saying that warriors should get agro lock, but that already exists in the game. Unless warriors get something to make them more appealing to a group, you would have to be retarded to chose a warrior over a knight for your exp group. In the current situation, a warrior is a last resort. Even a much less equiped knight is preferable to a warrior for exp groups.<br />

No problem, the pally casts his 1 sec group heal and everything near him is locked on him, leaving the rest of the group to slow/debuff/beat down all of the mobs. My RL best friend plays a cleric in my guild. He melees and nukes all he wants in exp groups because we usually have a knight tanking. He never runs low on mana unless we have to settle for a warrior tank.<br />

If you nuke right when the pull comes in, I don't care if you're using a knight or a warrior or, heck, a rogue for a tank, you're going to get smacked.<br />

Now, wait for Darkness, Heat Blood, Lifetap over time, poison bolt, and disease cloud (or their upgrades) to do some damage, and you have what this is supposed to replace.<br />
<br />
Not to mention trying to cast those with no interrupt! I mean, I'm talking pulling with Darkness then poison bolt, then no chance of casting whatsoever!You where raised believing wrong. Pallys use stuns and SKs use snare for agro. Also, I am sure this is just semantics, but DoT = Damag over time, there is no way to have a DoT with no dmg. If you believe that you can't nuke on incoming with a knight tanking, then more power to you, go ahead and keep believing that. With a knight tanking, I can nuke before the mob gets in to camp with little fear that it will even look at me. Even if it does, it won't be on me for long because the knight will just cast again and get agro back instantly. Once it is on him, he'll have agro lock. I am also not sure where you came up with them not being able to cast while tanking. I watch knights tank all sorts of mobs while getting beat on and have no problem casting. How do you thing knights are tanking the Rathe Councilmen at 1% without killing them? That's right, they stand there and cast agro spells without meleeing. I have never seen a knight have a problem keeping agro because they couldn't cast while getting beat on. Knight agro spells tend to be very fast casting and easy to channel.<br />

Discounting the the HoT (Hate over Time) portion of the provoke line, this skill is effectively taking the RNG out of the equation, you will ALWAYS have a hate proc right at the start of the fight, which is where warriors have the most trouble, during debuffing and slowing before they have had a chance to get some agro on the mob. Provoke will also have the biggest effect on lower level tanks. Look at it this way, consider Provoke as a proc that is guaranteed to go off once per minute. If a warrior is relying on a single procing weapon for agro, they will get an increase equal to getting 50% more procs/min. On a high end warrior with 2 procs per weapon and a clicky proc item (5 procs total) they will get roughly a 16% increase in procs per minute. I think that scales well. Lower end warriors certainly need more help than the warrior with 2x Anger 3, Anger, and Time Snap on his weapons.<br />
<br />
Don't kid yourselves, unless they way knight agro spells work is changed (nerfed) then knights will STILL have superior agro after these changes go live. However, with the added utility of openings, better mitigation, and considerably better agro, groups will not be as likely to take a 4k pally over a 6k warrior.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I have the luxury of also being able to see the warrior side of the mob because I have a warrior with 2x taunt weapons. I can see first hand the problems warriors are having keeping mobs on them. When my BoC goes off early, I can keep agro as well as any knight, but and unlucky streak of bad taunts and no procs and my wizard is doing the tanking. Lucky for me, I tend to group with high end people so it really doesn't matter who is doing the tanking, everyone has plenty of HP and AAs to tank exp mobs with little trouble, however for the other 95% of the people who play this is a real problem. When you have your typical 2khp caster or 3khp melee they can't take too much of a beating for long so keeping agro is of supreme importance to these people, it is literally a matter of life or death for the casual player. While I don't think that anyone - including knights - should be able to get agro lock, I do think that tanks, warriors in particular, need to have a method of reliable agro and some form of utility. So far, these changes are addressing all but the knight agro lock problem and I think they are certainly for the better.</div></div><hr />

Actually with only 2 difficulties to choose from I think they set them pretty well.  Normal is easy enough that anyone can do them.  Hard is hard enough to be somewhat of a challenge for most people while still being doable without any raid loot.  Personally, I'd like to see 3 settings.  Leave normal the way it is.  Make the current hard missions slightly easier and worth slightly less points.  Add a third level that's considerably harder than the current hard missions aimed at EP/Time geared players.<br />
<br />
To be honest, with well geared players and a good class mix LDON hard is not very hard.  They should add a level that makes anyone with less than 2k AC and 10k HPs turn into a grease spot when they get hit.  I've tanked the current hard missions with a beastlord as healer.</div></div><hr />

Like I said, the high risk advents are not by any means easy for us, and our experience mostly lies in Tak, since pulling there seems to be the easiest to master.<br />

We use pretty much the same 8-10 characters to form the groups for right now until we feel comfortable, but I know we will be beating them with different mixes soon. Especially when we get all outfitted in LDoN hard gear =)<br />
<br />
Dont be afraid to use some tricks here. Using a knight to generate agro then steal it, have MOBs pre-targeted by mezzers and rooters... whatever it takes. Once you start beating a few, they get easier, and the loot is hard to beat for us. My left earring for example.<br />

<br />
Ginto has always been a perilous fight for us until now, he memblurs a couple of times per fight, and if you really lose him he has this nasty habit of AE ramping all the casters into spoo.  <br />
<br />
Tonight I hit him with Incite as he was incoming, and hit him with it as it refreshed through the whole fight.  I didn't come anywhere close to running out of endurance, and I lost aggro on Ginto once, for roughly one second, which ended as I hit incite again.  We had no deaths, no loss of control.

It does exactly what it's supposed to do, which is give you a headstart on everyone else in the crucial time when you could lose aggro the most.  No one loses aggro at the end of a fight, just use it when you start the mob and you're fine.  As far as being a stamina hog, you can use it once a fight and never go below 90% stamina easily, unless you guys somehow have a smaller stamina pool than me.  Incite uses 10% and it regens before XP mobs are dead.  It's a great tool.  I can incite every mob and use a disc from each timer and never have stamina issues at all.<br />
<br />
And as for using it at range, I find it working quite well at range.  I've pulled shit back to me off my shaman a couple of times with it tonite.  The problem might come from +hate seeming to be more effective when you're doing actual melee damage to the mob as well.  As long as you start meleeing quickly after an Incite, all is well in the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incite uses 8 % of my endurance pool. As I posted in another thread, using it only once on most mobs but not all, I ended Ldon normal adventures at roughly 20-40 % endurance. These were 45 minute or so adventures and I never popped any disc's, just used Incite to get a head start on aggro if I didn't proc right away in a fight. Which isn't that often since I use an anger3 aug'd BoW I tend to proc a lot. :p<br />
<br />
On a side note, in Ldon I also noted that Incite often was not up before the next mob was being engaged... then again we had a lot of dps so it's probably not a problem for an average group.<br />
<br />
I still think it's great, but it definitely uses up a lot of endurance when I use it.</div></div><hr />

It even has a 30 sec refresh to prevent it. During a 1 minute fight you will regen that 10% easily. There is nothing that says you have to use it either, it is simply a tool in the box we didn't have before. I am very happy to have it. <br />
<br />
For example: Tonight I tanked Rumblecrush and Doomshade. My first encounter with RC ever ( 4 months ago ) the shaman died as he cast Slow on INC and the clerics ate it 3 different times do to chain CH aggro, I felt like utter shit and we called it quits. Now tonight we come back, puller drops it, I arrow and RT does as well. RC stops at RT ( who was out ahead /bog) I snap an /Incite, then /disc defensive and I walked RC back to the corner and had a fun ride. Same thing happened with Doomshade pretty much. <br />
<br />
Again, don't use it if you don't want to. Don't use it every mob if you think you can't sustain the END cost, because obviously you are killing things in under 45 seconds consistently and the mobs are tirvial anyhow. Use /Incite with you think it matters, and when END allows.<br />
<br />
Oh, one mroe thing, I LOVE being able to Incite, then disc defensive, and when it drops i hit disc Furious to buy healers time to speed up the healing. I ended after a 6 minute fight ( low dps ) with about 40% END left and I could have popped Defensive as soon as it repopped. $$</div></div><hr />

8% is probably a little less than what is for me, I was figuring 10%, and I seriously have no issues throwing fellstrike in every half hour, and one of the other bogus discs just for shits and giggles, and I can STILL use Incite every mob.  Maybe i'm killing slower or something, but I just don't see this skill as being a &quot;hog&quot; especially when fellstrike eats 60% of your endurance.<br />

Maybe we have different definitions of &quot;Uses a lot of endurance&quot;  If there's enough endurance in the bar to use Incite, then there's plenty in my book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd agree that in most situations it's perhaps not the wisest move to &quot;chain&quot; Incite. On a boss mob, especially one that mem blurs, any time it does is &quot;a cruial time you could lose aggro&quot; and warrants an Incite, in my opinion at least.<br />

Hmm, well in the one adv where I ended with 20% ish endurance, I didn't use anything but Incite... defensive for me uses 40-50 % of my endurance pool approx so basically I think I wouldn't have been able to use it had I needed it. <br />
<br />
Which I find disturbing. <br />
<br />
I don't like the thought of having to &quot;med&quot; as a warrior. <br />
<br />
Sure, when I play my cleric, or my enchanter medding is a normal thing but can you picture having to tell your group they need to hold pulls because you're out of endurance -- just from Incites?<br />
<br />
I just hope they are adding + end stats to items and whatnot to help fill in that bar a bit so we can get more use out of it and not have to worry so much that we won't have enough for basic disc's having somehow burned it all on 1 Incite per mob.</div></div><hr />

I think the Endurance bar is simply SOE's method of putting a limit on which disciplines can be used within a certain amount of time.<br />
<br />
You could probably say the same about mana, but there you also have to deal with 2 second recast times (mostly, if not a bit longer) and cast times, and can have mana regen buffs to speed up the mana regain.  On the other hand, melee don't lose Endurance to do damage by melee'ing (unlike casters who require mana to do damage...not counting the three pet classes), the disciplines are instant, and the re-use timers are still there, so it seems to me that the Endurance pool is merely there to not only prevent chaining Incites (allowing it to be a nice chunk of hate instead of worthless due to running out of Endurance), but also preventing Spirit of Rage, Stonewall, Furious, and Aggressive to be used back to back with 0 time inbetween (Yes I know SoR would be hard to use if Defensive is required).<br />
<br />
At least I don't think you can chain those with current Endurance pools, been hearing Defensive taking 40%, Aggressive taking around 50%...might be wrong.</div></div><hr />

58 warrior here - I was using berate last night - sometimes twice a mob, simply because it didn't put that much of a dent in my end bar and the endurance got regenned quickly.  My stats were no where near maxed - maybe 200ish for most of them.  <br />

<br />
As to Agro lock, I think 100% agro lock that is sustainable over time is a bad thing. It eliminates skill from the equation and dumbs down game play. In the past this wasn't so much of an issue because PL/SK required enough additional healing that eventually the group would have to take a break as the healer went OOM. Thus the Knights were self regulating and warriors were a viable alternative because even tho the group needed to use caution they could constant pull and get similar exp over time. With the additions to mana regen and healing, not to mention boost in hybrid tanking abilities and buffs over the last several expansions, this is no longer the case. Healers can keep up, and so PL/SK can go 100% agro lock indefinitely. <br />
REGARDLESS of the latest additions to warriors, this still means PL/SK will be the favored exp tank (and possibly raid tank). There may be a short respite for us warriors but sooner or later ppl will figure out it is easier and more reliable to use a PL/SK.  The warrior just doesn't bring as much to the group as an PL/SK, yet ironicly is even more dependant on grouping.<br />
<br />
While I'm on the topic of group utility. I would like to see warriors get some kind of 'grapple' or 'trip' ability that functioned like a short duration snare. Even if it only worked on fleeing mobs that would be something.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the new stuff isn't good, it is! It's frikin' great! And long overdue. It just isn't enough to balance us out against the Knights in group desirability.  We need more or they need some controls put back on them (yeah, would be easier to say nerf).<br />

It helped me immensely last night.  I am kind of concerned about the endurance cost though.  I kept it up okay and still used defensive once and a couple other disciplines at various times.  But with quick pulls, you'll use most or all of your endurance regen rate to use incite once per mob.  You'll want to skip some mobs if you use other disciplines.  I can deal with that right now.  But what about once they add the openings skills?  Those use endurance, too.  So it seems like I won't have enough endurance to use Incite effectively, be able to use another disc once in awhile, AND use the new openings system at all.</div></div><hr />

I could use incite every time it popped along with an occasional defensive or fellstrike &amp; never had a problem with endurance.

Ok, so why the heck did Bellow get upped to level, what is it, 52?<br />
<br />
So there's no upgrade from 20 to 52?  What was wrong with it being at level 45?  Sucks that a level 40 or 50 warrior has the same ability as a level 20, that's like capping taunt at level 20 and not having the skill increase again until level 52.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When AoW was inc, I tagged, he still was going straight for someone else.  Popped incite, /bang, ran straight for me from range.  Lucky enough to get 2 aggro procs in 5s or so (GBoS/anger2, CHSD/anger3), called engage.<br />
I used defensive to the max, and incite at every opportunity.  (Did this on Idol, after 8 min, using incite every time it popped, after defensive, finally ran out of End)<br />
The amount of aggro it generated was slightly scary.  I don't think I have ever had a mob THAT mad at me.  At one point I had to move him, in the past, this might been an issue, now ? nope, taunt success, /incite, back up, summon, back up, bee line for me, was simply amazing.<br />
<br />
This I think is the side effect that no one is really referring to.  In the past, no matter how many procs you got, your hate wasn't enough for you to back away (at least in my guild, bloody overcasting wizards) and guarantee the mob is coming with you.  Now?  AWESOME, truly awe inspiring.<br />
<br />
xp groups, incite then move the mob wherever you want.<br />
For me ? I really REALLY like.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">honestly i'd like to see incite get alittle more hate (equal to a anger3 proc) would help on the inc mobs, but it works well as it is.  I didn;t have a big problem, but end did seem to regen fairly slow; I switched to using below on each mob and sometimes not at all.  I also tried it using non aggro DPS weapon (war mar blade) and with my aggro weapon (GSoT loaded with anger2).  If i really used up my bar then i just used the GSoT and used incite only if the mob tried to get away.  <br />
<br />
I couldn;t drag the mob to me on pull with incite, but as soon as i hit the mob he was mine.  I also found i could use incite on the next mob while beating on the current one . . . really made it nice ;-)<br />
<br />
Overall I am very happy with the changes.  I think if we get opening abilities we are going to need either +end items (notice there were none with this patch), or some way of regening faster.</div></div><hr />

It take me 42sec to regen the endurance of 1 incite, it regens before the 1min is up but the mob is dead well before then also, so if you kill faster than a mob every 42sec which is almost always the case in xp groups then incite is a constant endurance drain using it once per mob for initial agro. If youre taking longer than 42sec to kill a mob then thats why youre having no problems with regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did make it to PoS to assist a guildy with the monk fight there.  After 2 full bellow cycles the mob would not leave me alone for anything.  I was using my Defiance and DLB to avoid any proccing from interfering with the test.  This probably doesn't sound that great until you consider my warrior is only 53 and I pulled aggro from a 62 monk, a 65 monk, and a 60 ranger.  I am very happy with the results of that test.<br />
<br />
I also had no endurance problems whatsoever.  I do wonder if they have regen rates set up by race and maybe that is one of the differences here.  If that is part of the reason they probably need to look at the differences in regen.  It seems a bit drastic for folks to have such differing opinions on regen rates.</div></div><hr />

Nope, that's not the problem at all.   Here's the deal right here.   It's a picture of me using Incite on a Nexus guard and then hitting 100% endurance before Incite wears off.  You guys aren't regenning as fast as I am.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also looked up incite again and saw that it's duration is 1 min, for some reason it felt like 30 seconds.  Either way, I can use this all the time and never have any issues at all because I regen the 8% before I need to use incite again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incite wears off after 1min, so what is the point? Most people kill faster than 1 mob every 42sec, especially in LDoN, which is the time it takes to regen the endurance from 1 incite. Not really sure what point youre trying to prove with a 1 minute comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2, I would wager that &quot;MOST&quot; People DO NOT kill a mob every 42 seconds.  If you do, well then I guess that's a problem, but when I look at my friends who do pickup groups, I can safely say that there is no &quot;MOST&quot; about it.  You do not kill 85 mobs per hour in your average joe blow XP group.</div></div><hr />

We were only 5, so kills weren't terribly fast. The only time I ran out of endurance was when the cleric died to a train from some rare-hoppers. I hit incite on the add and got aggro, popped fortitude, add got mezzed, popped defensive while we finished off our mob and the pally took over heals, incited the mezzed add again, waited a moment, engaged and killed it (add was a wussy fire elemental). I was like, &quot;=-o.&quot;<br />
But for the most part, I didn't have any endurance problems at all. Regen rate seemed fair to me, even with using incite pretty often and a /disc every now and then.<br />
Just as a side note, someone in the TSW channel said something about stealing aggro from a pally without even trying - right around the same time I did. In fact, when I first joined the group the pally continued to tank for a while but somehow I kept stealing aggro intermittently.<br />
Anyone else notice that war aggro &gt; all now?<br />

I was using Provoke to pull in LDoN and didn't have any aggro issues. Then used Incite on mezzed or offtanked mobs to gain aggro and I didn't have any issues here as well.</div></div><hr />

Well, unless all these Plane of Time geared warriors are killing in LDoN normal or fuckin plane of justice, than I fail to see what the problem is.   If you guys are averaging 85 mobs an hour, you might wanna find something a little tougher to kill that might challenge the fact that you have more HP unbuffed than I do on my best days.  I guess i might have some problems if I tried to Incite every mob in Blackburrow too......</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, even if (I) pull, and cast incite and pluck<br />
10 arrows into the mob on inc before anyone else touches it...<br />
think about this....<br />
<br />
If a pally wants to load up stuns' and start chain casting, the mob will turn to him, thats life, its one of the benefits of being a pally.<br />
<br />
If we keep up our bragging pretty soon all the Knights will be <br />
angry with us and start calling us to be nerfed even though &quot;we&quot; <br />
(being all melee classes lets not forget ) got our 1st bone tossed at us in 5 years, i hear alot of them complaining we got upgrades while they got nerfed so, lets keep it quiet.<br />
<br />
It's going to take some getting used to by said classes to realize<br />
we were not meant to be backup 3rd choice tanks.<br />
Just as it will take some bards to get used to the fact that they  were never meant to be primary pullers.  MOVING ON...<br />
<br />
I dont want to own any class.... I just want to be able to do my job without begging everyone to slow down because im a gimpy warrior who cant hold his own.  I'm sick of the jokes from all sides.<br />
I see enchanters with messages like &quot; casting slow.. rez please...&quot;<br />
It makes me sick.  Now they gave us the tools to prove ourselfs, and that I will. One group at a time.<br />
<br />
As far as endurance costs are concerned, as it is now im happy,<br />
but after the new opening skills come into play it will become a serious factor.  What I am hoping is that they will add + endurance items to EXISTING items to curve the problem.  Just as existing items have PLUS HP and PLUS mana, they need to add PLUS ENDURACE.  That is the fair way to do it, if you add regen in there your gonna make more problems.  As someone said earlier these skills should not be able to be chain cast without cost, just as pallies or sk's should not be able to chain cast for (virual) zero mana cost with C5 and FT items.<br />
<br />
One last consideration, lower the cost of skills like healing will, defensive, fellstrike, spirit rage.</div></div><hr />

Well if you were referring to my magelo and my group, some of the rest of the group was ele/time capable, don't know about equipped. Our cleric was hydra and I did a few normal Ldon runs with them. <br />
<br />
I was lfg for nearly 2 hours then got an invite. I'm not about to turn that group down because they want to do Ldon on normal setting and not &quot;something a little tougher to kill&quot;. <br />
<br />
I still think there is an issue if I am running through my endurance pool in a normal Ldon using Incite *only* and not even on every mob. We weren't even pulling as fast as most of my guild groups either...<br />
<br />
I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but speak from my own point of view and experiences, just as you speak from your own. <br />
<br />
Just because I'm Time geared does not make my concerns with the changes irrelevant. I know they are still working on this stuff, and we will likely be seeing +end on items (I hope?) in the future. It seems to me that a Time equipped warrior should perhaps have a larger endurance pool to make up for the fact that their groups can and do go through mobs faster, generally.<br />
<br />
Overall I think they are great and I am pleased to see things going in the right direction!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to say, I think if I can get a group and the exp bar goes in the right direction at a reasonable pace, then I am happy. I group in BoT, PoV and yes even PoJ! I'm not going to turn my nose down at a group just because it's not a 2 AA/hour fast paced grind. I don't need the AA anyways, I just enjoy grouping and meeting new people.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I have yet to try out Incite etc since the patch in said zones. I hope to soon but it all depends on the tell I get to come join a group. If it's Ldon normal so be it and I don't think it's too much to ask to be able to use Incite once per mob in that setting and still have enough endurance left over to use a disc or two.<br />
<br />
Things are still being worked on though, and I'm sure there will be changes with some of it one way or another in the coming weeks/months, and I have no problem with waiting and seeing how things unfold.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's very nice though to tell someone their opinion isn't vaild just because of gear and the fact that it may not mesh with yours.<br />

<br />
My &quot;attitude&quot; isnt on were you can / should hunt.  Its that &quot;one&quot; doesnt need invoke every 30 seconds if they kill a mob in less then 40 seconds.  My &quot;attitude&quot; was about fighting in a place with mobs equal to the gear.  If I fight in Seb, I don't even hit the taunt key and I use dps weapons not taunt weapons cause the group I hunt with can easily kill a mob in less then 40 seconds there.<br />
<br />
The &quot;attitude&quot; was that some people with very high end equipment stated in this thread earlier that they couldnt hit invoke on every mob when they were killing mobs faster then 40 seconds.<br />
<br />
I was simply stating that normally people dont need to taunt (or use the new invoke endurance) when they can kill a mob in 40 seconds or less cause most mobs can't deal dmg if they can be killed that fast.<br />
<br />
I don't care were you get exp, I just think that things should be kept in focus.  Normal exp mobs were a taunt / invoke is needed do not die in less then 42 seconds.  They don't.  And if people are fighting mobs and killing them in less then 40 seconds IMHO they are fighting mobs below there ability and if that's the case then use a lesser invoke ability.<br />

However, it was my first time using it -- ever-- and I simply made an observation. <br />

There's no need to act as though just because someone is at a certain level of gear their opinion/observation means nothing. <br />

I was in a hard level LDoN adventure just like I said, the point of incite is for initial agro, so yes I was hitting it for initial agro on every mob I could. My weapons dont proc any faster than yours and my taunt key doesnt work any more than yours does so the gear argument has no point at all in this thread. I dont really feel the need to go xp in phase1 or something that would be considered hard enough for me in your opinion. Thats like me saying why dont you try something a little easier if its taking you longer to kill, how asinine is that? We all have reasons for &quot;xp'ing&quot; where we do.</div></div><hr />

Incite is fine.  Endurance seems fine at the moment.  You can use both in a lot of new combinations that you couldn't before.

<br />
I have run out of endurence once using just incite, during a high DPS LDoN with no shaman buffs.  It can be done.  I don't have the best gear(by far), but better than many, so if I can do it, others can as well.<br />
<br />
That said, I have no problem with the cost of incite, or the rate of endurance regen.  Having to tank the old fashioned way for a few mobs is not thast big a deal in those rare occasions when endurance runs out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alright, to be fair, since Haass and Cagna are always grouped, I always have Ferine Avatar, so I guess I have a stat advantage on a lot of people.  Still, lets be serious here for a minute.  You lived for how long without Incite?  You don't need to use it every mob.  It's a tool, not a crutch.  If you're using it every mob, then I think you're just wasting it.  Use it when you need it, not just because it's up.</div></div><hr />

I tested out using fury into defensive with incite and I had no issues with sta. left me at 50% end after the fight. Thats with a few incites thrown in.<br />
<br />
but it seems ok.. if i went all out with incite i would have probably ran out of sta and defensive would have dropped. oh and -end spells suck much ass. Rags 1 and 2 now have a 100 end per tic dot.  not like they have any dps but it was a nice little suprise.<br />
<br />
This might suck if a mob with any dps has the same effect. Nothing like defensive running out 1 min after you hit the button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said earlier:<br />
<br />
Incite uses 8 % of my endurance pool. As I posted in another thread, using it only once on most mobs but not all, I ended Ldon normal adventures at roughly 20-40 % endurance. <br />
<br />

<br />
Again, I said earlier:<br />
<br />
I still think there is an issue if I am running through my endurance pool in a normal Ldon using Incite *only* and not even on every mob. <br />
<br />
I guess I have a stat advantage on a lot of people. <br />
<br />
My only melee stat below 305 unbuffed is agility. But, I have primal, and a 65 Shaman I can carry around if I want buffs.  ;)<br />
<br />
I'm thinking the issue here really is Ldon and high dps groups. In PoP so far I have not had as much of a drain on endurance. I did go ooe once so far in PoP on a really bad pull. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had the same experience with chain pulling bards in ldon, ended up with avg 40-60 %left, at one point zero untill i clicked off defensive seeing how it was eating my pool up or i would have been fooked.<br />
<br />
Although  this is one of those annoying bards who likes to tank...so yes I was trying to use incite on almost every mob.<br />
<br />
Personally I can maybe see spirit rage taking mana but, or healing will but since incite came out I find myself not even wanting to touch defensive due to the endurance cost, nor fellstrike.<br />
<br />
1 full defensive- 1 fellstrike and thats it im basicly spent-<br />
no room for incite.. well maybe one then then im TOTALLY spent.<br />
Thats not gonna work for me in a busy group that has crazy ping pong agro.<br />
<br />
Pulls are not gonna slow down for me, its my experience chain pulls are getting to be the norm.<br />
<br />
I dont think our old set of disc's should be sharing our endurance pool.  <br />

That means if I use 1 discipline then I'm at around 50% endurance perpetually.  If I use another then I'm out and I'm going to stay out.  Endurance cost for Incite needs to be slightly reduced.</div></div><hr />

You do know you don't have to incite every mob, yes? <br />
<br />
The point is that this is meant as our initial aggro fix.  Paladins stun every mob for aggro as many times as they need to at virtually zero mana cost.  Incite can only be used once per mob and is less aggro than multiple stuns.  We SHOULD be able to use it on every single mob without much of an endurance drain.</div></div><hr />

Mine is 305 unbuffed, acually it's more like 350 or so, don't know if any sta over 305 counts or not.<br />

<br />
Yes, but you know what, this thread is starting to sound like a bunch of noob casters who are constantly OOM and want a med break.  Ration your endurance.  If you're using too much, lay off the abilities.  I'm sure you proc once within the first few seconds of a fight every now and then right?  Great, don't need to incite that mob, now you've got 40 seconds or however long it takes you to kill it to regen the endurance for an extra one.<br />
<br />
Incite doesn't need to be used constantly because before this patch we didn't have CONSTANT aggro problems.  Everyone will agree to that.  They tanked fine some of the time, and could hold aggro for a few mobs, but there was always a couple an hour that just wouldn't stay on you.  That is what incite is for.  If you're using it before you even turn on autoattack, then I don't think you're managing your endurance properly, and probably deserve to be out of it.<br />
<br />
Tool, not crutch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No really, he's right though. Don't put your aggro weapons away just yet and start using incite on inc. I think it's there to help fill the holes in your aggro generation, not as a means for solid, unshakeable aggro on every mob.<br />
<br />
I use it each mob only on raids where I MA, at least so far. <br />
<br />
It's fun and new though and we're still learning how to use it. :D</div></div><hr />

angry with us and start calling us to be nerfed even though &quot;we&quot; <br />
(being all melee classes lets not forget ) got our 1st bone tossed at us in 5 years, i hear alot of them complaining we got upgrades while they got nerfed so, lets keep it quiet.<br />
<br />
A paladin (who is a friend of mine) said to me yesterday that ever since they nerfed taunt, he's had to chain-stun to keep aggro. Another paladin chimed in, agreeing that it was pretty messed up that they nerfed taunt to fail all the time. I think I adequately explained that the taunt failure message was a boon, not a nerf; and that taunt has always failed all the time - it's just that now we know when it does so we can take the appropriate action. It was like a mini-epiphany - I didn't realize people really thought that taunt always worked and if you couldn't keep aggro you weren't taunting or you sucked at playing your class or something.<br />
<br />
I agree with Haass in that Incite is a great tool for us. I've found it's perfect for filling in the holes in my aggro. It feels like this is how it should be. I've found several effective ways to use Incite for various different circumstances. Example: Ranger pulls with snare, and pulls the mob right on top of me. I taunt, slam, and turn attack on. Slower slows, I taunt, Incite, and that mob is mine. It's sooo cool actually being able to move a mob wherever I want.<br />
<br />
Oh, getting back to what dude was saying about knights complaining... It's utterly ridiculous and unfounded. They can still out-aggro me, but it's a much more level playing field now. We finally have the tools to do our job well, and I am not going to &quot;keep it quiet.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Everytime someone gets upgraded, someone else is going to complain... we do it, paladins do it, mages do it, etc.<br />
I think part of the reason i think the provoke line is so great, is because it seems balanced to me. Paladins can /bug and /feedback all day for all I care, but we aren't overbalanced, and they weren't nerfed. They had clearly superior aggro control before, and now they only have moderately superior aggro control. Boo hoo.<br />

   I then ooc'd &quot;yeah, if you call losing your xp penalty, having your mana pool increased to the same as your parent caster class, having your spell lines revamped so that you get some of the more beneficial spells earlier, having casting not reset your weapon swing timer, plate class hybrids having the same mitigation table as warriors, and all hybrids having either their offensive or defensive skillcaps made the same as pure melees &quot;getting shafted&quot;, then yeah, you guys got reamed pretty hard.<br />

Someone posted that it took them 42 seconds to regen the endurance spent by using 1 Incite.  Assuming that's true, if you're using Incite once per mob and averaging more than 42 seconds per kill then you won't see a problem.  If you're using it once per mob and averaging more than 1 kill every 42 seconds then your endurance bar will get drained by just Incite.  The speed it gets drained will depend on how much faster than 42 seconds you're killing.  <br />
<br />
Most groups I'm in have a kill rate of between 30-60 seconds per mob.  Average is probably around 45 seconds.  That means in an average group I won't have any issues.  But in a fast pulling, high DPS group, I can and do run out of endurance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the new timers in place and the new endurance system I can't use disciplines as frequently as I used to be able to either due to endurance cost (evasive) or recycle timer (aggressive).  It's fine that the system works differently than it used to but this was intended as an upgrade to us.  Incite is a very nice upgrade and I love it.  But the changes to our disciiplines seems like a nerf to me unless endurance cost is reduced or regen is increased.  The whole point of unlinking the discipline timers was to allow us to use them more often.  From what I've seen so far, I use them LESS often now.</div></div><hr />

Thats exactly the problem I have with it, if endurance was just for incite and other special abilities besides disc's I couldnt care less if I run out of endurance and cant incite a few mobs, but when I have to pick between using incite or saving the endurance for discs it just doesnt seem right to me. Incite was a balancing skill plain and simple, and its uses to much damn endurance to be what it was meant to be. <br />

I'm not going to argue with someone that I kill to fast or I'm lying or that I should be killing harder stuff, that doesnt change the fact the skill is pretty useless in 90% of the 'xp' groups I'm in.<br />

I dont think I really need to explain the fundamentals of initial agro management do I? My weapons dont proc any more than yours and my taunt doesnt work any more either, like I said, several times.. Incite is for initial agro management so why wouldnt I use it every mob possible to do exactly what it was meant to do? Thats what its for is to get us to that first proc, after that I dont have issues with agro. Its useless in the fact it drains to much endurance if youre in a fast killing group only, the skill is very nice, again, like I said several times..<br />
<br />
If youre not having issues thats great I'm happy for you, but anyone thats killing mobs in &lt;42sec is having major issues (and it will affect you eventually). Its pretty simple, I dont see whats hard to understand about it. I cant tell casters to not nuke so much because were killing to fast, and I cant tell melee to put away their best weapons and use something else so we kill a little slower.</div></div><hr />

So you kill mobs in less than 42sec and honestly dont think theres an issue? You dont think Incite using 7-10% of a warriors endurance bar when a pally stun with much less restrictions and more utility (as it should be) is 1%? and mana regens almost twice as fast as endurance, thats not an issue? You dont know me you have no idea how good of a warrior I am heh, I have 300 days /played I feel I know and play my warrior very well, and its my opinion that incite uses much to much endurance for what it does considering the current regen and caps of endurance, you dont have to agree with me, really, you dont.<br />
<br />
It seems odd to me that LDoN is what really intensified the warrior agro situation since theyre such fast fights and we couldnt maintain agro before lucky procs or taunts, and now with the skill that was meant to BALANCE that very thing we have to choose discs or initial agro, and some people are backing it like its the best thing since sliced bread.<br />
<br />
If you wanna be an interweb chat forum chamipon youre gonna have to argue with someone else, because thats not one of my goals. I know exactly how the skill affects me and I dont try to speak for the rest of the warrior community, and I'm positive you telling me how to play a warrior isnt going to make it all better (very l33t skillz there though, thanks for the input buddy). I couldnt care less if youre level 1 or level 65, I dont know you and I dont want to know you. I would like to know your opinion without just bashing mine to be 'teh winner' though.

Warriors COULD theoretically hold aggro fine before this patch in certain situations (IE : Weapon procs, taunt works, etc).  The fact that you feel the need to use incite on every mob shows just how little you understand how the game works.<br />

I've said it before, apparantly people are missing it.  Incite is a tool--- not a crutch.  You do not NEED incite to do your job.  It helps you do your job when the RNG is not being cooperative.</div></div><hr />
