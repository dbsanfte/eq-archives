As far as what I have been able to read up on these, the proc's should be outstanding aggro (just under enraging blow), and IMHO these weapons are easier to obtain, and better then say a BoC ... <br />

Both have a DD proc, with the added AC lowering effect (which I understand is the main aggro component). Just looking for some seasoned aggro-getters (/poke warriors) opinions of how this setup would work, before I commit to the no drop tags. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't &quot;think&quot; they are &quot;just under enraging blow&quot;, but i consider the pair a viable dual wield setup with decent stats/hp and &quot;ok&quot; procs.<br />
<br />
but then, you're probably better off listening to the warriors, not to a retired monk ;)</div></div><hr />

Debuff= Speculated at 350ish hate<br />
<br />
That said these are 2 of the best buyable aggro weapons out there.  Only SoD and BoC are better imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They're nice.Should do fine for a lot of warriors.Both &lt; BOC tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't used either of them, but my guess would be the same as Apolyon's. And I'd think that properly aug'd, they'd be very usable indeed.<br />
The question then is, really, if these are the weapons you can loot, and they are better than what you are using, and your other option is the BoC/SoD route, how long does it take you to get the plat for the tradeable stuff? (Or, if you can raid for the others, how long will it take for you to get the forces you need for the number of attempts it will take for you to actually own them?). If you are fightiing where these drop, and your friends want to keep fighting there, I can see these weapons as being a good option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twink</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">[I use the CHoS and BoB (bloodsworn) for holding agro . Got SoD (unauged) ATM and working on BoC . The 2 i use are working ok atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zendien</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Velitorkin's femur and the midwinter sword, both a3 auged. Usually dont have a problem with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zurd</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I switched to these two from the droga combo and unaugged found them a significant upgrade for keeping agro.  Augged they present no problem at all keeping agro.  Only situation where I'm losing agro so far has been moments where it wouldn't have mattered what weapons I was using.<br />
<br />
I'd say either weapon is well worth 50K each which makes them a fraction of the price of the  BoC or SoD.  IMHO I'd pay For the upgrade to them from the Droga combo but I wouldn't pay the extra for the upgrade to the BoC.<br />
<br />
Then again I'd also consider doing a few TZ runs for instance and looting his scimitar...lots of decent options in the BBC/SoMV class that are currently no drop.  But for agro/Price point I'd say that post 65 these are definately the top.<br />
<br />
I'd include the Mace of Memories as another equal offhand option because it should be in a similar price range but I haven't seen one for sale since the second week of oow coming out so I don't actually have a clue what someone would ask for one right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">stun owns debuff for agro. i'd go with a mace of memories offhand, and the midwinters primary should be *decent* agro with anger augs. the MoM goes for about 35k on Tribunal regularly.<br />
All in all debuff agro is nice but nowhere near enraging blow.</div></div><hr />
