<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok for about 2 months (yah it was hard dealing with it... but I have been zoning extremly slow. It takes me a good minute and a half. I also lag for about 2 seconds opening a bag or clicking on an item link. The game runs fine, relatively low lag (for the crap piece my system is)...<br />
<br />
This problem started after I uninstalled a bunch of old games. They were nothing but games (counter strike, Medal of Honor, The sims etc etc). I defragged it/scan disked it , I uninstalled it and reinstalled it to a new directory, defragged some more scan disked some more and I can't figure out the problem!<br />
<br />
Anyone else had problems like this and fixed it? Anyone have any suggestions as to what I should do?<br />
<br />
Before it went all crazy, I would zone in a good 45 seconds, and bags and such were no problem. I cringe everytime I have to find a weapon or something in my bag or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks~</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I have my &quot;on access&quot; scanner running while I play, then I get a noticable lag when I grab something in a bag, before the sound plays.  Real pita when swapping weapons out :)<br />
<br />
It isn't nearly the duration that you talk about, but everyone's system is different so what hangs mine for a half second might very well hang someone else for a second or two.<br />
<br />
Would also make sense with the extra zone times, as it would check the new zone files before loading them.</div></div><hr />

I downloaded an AVG one, and took of my old one (which was just kind there really). Maybe I'll try playing with it disabled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But It just kinda happend when I uninstalled some old games and installed the AVG virus scanner. I don't really want to go without a virus scanner though, and turning it off didn't help... bleargh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">with 320mb of ram your PC is probably running a fair bit of info out of a swap file when playing and when you zone it has to dump its texture info and then load same info the the new zone.<br />
<br />
Are you using texture caching? (will increase load times as it decompresses textures into a cache on the HDD to reduce CPU load in game)<br />
<br />
How much free space do you have on your disk?</div></div><hr />

<br />
try aida32 (http://www.aida32.hu/aida-download.php?bit=32)<br />
<br />
has a bunch of test you can run for stuff. mem r/w speed, hd r/w speed, general system info, processor/mb temp if you have the sensor, and stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried updating your drivers/directX ? It's possible that installing those games (and the subsequent installing/deleting frenzy you described) could have corrupted your files.<br />
<br />
Also, what kind of internet connection are you running?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I am using texture caching, but I thought it was supposed to decrease zone times. Will try playing with it off tomarrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I went to try updating drivers once, and totally fucked everything up. I had to boot in safemode and delete the vid card and then have windows re-install it by detecting new software. I'm kinda scared to try anything with the drivers <br />
;)  (doing the drivers now, if I don't post for a week I fucked it up ~ shouldn't be too hard though, downloading a driver and will install it)<br />
<br />
<br />
Cable connection.<br />
<br />
Going to redo drivers, wish me luck!<br />
<br />
Oh and harddisk space = 19.00 gigs, used is 7.77 gigs and free is 11.2 gigs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't know what to say to help fix it =\<br />
<br />
I used to experience the 'bag lag' and slow zoning times too. Hell, any window that popped up (including the casting window) it caused a 1-25 second freezeup of EQ.<br />
<br />
I noticed a few things about when it started to become noticable, and things I did that and observed that the problem was worse.<br />
<br />
Sometime after I started dual boxing (single computer, using the built in windows mode that sony provides), it started becoming noticable. 512 MB of RAM, and about a 512 MB Swap file. Restarts fixed the slowdown for awhile, but it soon became permanent.<br />
<br />
I'm now running on a fresh install of Windows XP, extremely barebones. ANYTHING I DON'T use is no longer installed, and I'm keeping as barebones as possible.<br />
<br />
I no longer have the dreaded 'bag lag' or slow zoning. I have yet to try dual boxing since my last reformatting either.<br />
<br />
It likely doesn't help much, but since you know NOTHING about what caused the problem right now...any sort of info could help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say the slow zoning is due to memory, maybe you have too many background programs running and eating it.<br />
<br />
To test this, I unhooked a memory module and rebooted, tried zoning and it took me double the time (normally 512mb, unhooked 1 and had 256), so that much explains it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt it is memory, as I didn't have any problems with the same memory back before the problem existed. Still trying to redo the drivers, was too tired to try last night. Will try it today, and hopefully that fixes it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, installing new drivers didn't work. Redid direct x with no change... anyone have any other ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be 100% your memory is not screwed, boot up, go into the BIOS, there should be an option under the General or Advanced BIOS that is called: Quick POST (Power On Self Test). Turn it off and reboot, it will make a long memory count, it does it 3 times, if no error jumps there, your memory is fine :)<br />
<br />
I use Win98SE and never had a problem with EQ. Also, run 'msconfig' from your 'Run' button on Start, and check the Start tab, there is a list of things that get loaded on the OS startup, uncheck the ones you think should not be loaded, thats a good way to stop working troyans too fyi :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">doh i r a math wiz /bonk me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll do that when it stops de-fragging. Who knows, maybe it will solve the problem. Maybe something happened last time I defragged it (when I re-installed it like 2 months ago) :(</div></div><hr />
