<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about upgrading this boat anchor I've been running EQ/WoW on for the past 3+ years.  At first, I wanted to pretty much keep it intact, but after reviewing my mobo specs, I might as well drop the cash on a new box and forget about &quot;upgrading&quot; it with 2yr old parts.<br />
<br />
#1 - Intel or AMD processor?  I've built 3 AMD boxes in the past 5 years and would like to give Intel a shot at my cash and compare it to the AthyXP.  Are AMD chips that far ahead of Intel?  There are so many different chipset nowdays, and I can hardly tell the difference between a companies own products, eventho I'm fairly hardware literate.  What would you suggest for a processor in the $300 range?<br />
<br />
#2 - Is 1gb of DDR enough for anything in the next 2yrs or should I spring for 2gb and not worry about memory ever again?  What about DDR2?  Is it that big an improvement over the current DDR memory?<br />
<br />
#3 - AGP 8x or PCI Express 16x?  The mobos with PCI Ex seem to cost quite abit more than those with AGP 8x.  Do you think PCI Ex is here to stay for awhile or should I just stick with the budget AGP?<br />
<br />
#4 - I have my heart set on two/four Western Digital Raptor SATA drives in RAID0 config in the new box.  Any horror stories?  Are they as good as ppl say they are?<br />
<br />
#5 -  On the topic of Video Cards, which ones should I absolutely avoid.  I've heard Geforce 5200s are cheap but you get what you pay for.  Any recommendations for a card in the $150-250 range?<br />
<br />
The compy will be networked in with my other 4 boxes in the house.  It will run WoW/Diablo2/MSOffice/DvDs daily.  I have a good idea of what parts I might be ordering.  Just gotta see if they are gonna fit in the budget.<br />
<br />
<br />

Shaddup you stupid beige box!! Stop vibrating and making whining noises!!  I just cleaned you yesterday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is definitely not the time to quit AMDs :).  Athlon 64 pretty much blows Intel out of the water for price/performance atm.  A 3500+ will run you about $300 right now and stacks up very well against a $1000 3.6GHz P4EE in games.  Also, the A64 is only running at 2.2GHz so it runs much cooler than the P4. <br />
<br />
#2 - Is 1gb of DDR enough for anything in the next 2yrs or should I spring for 2gb and not worry about memory ever again?  What about DDR2?  Is it that big an improvement over the current DDR memory?<br />
<br />
I struggled with this when I built my new machine a couple months ago.  I finally went with a motherboard with 4 memory slots in it and got 2 500 MB sticks.  1Gig can pretty much handle any game out there right now, and if you buy something that needs more memory, the other two slots are there waiting so you don't have to throw out the memory you already have (assuming you can still buy the same kind).  <br />
<br />
#3 - AGP 8x or PCI Express 16x?  The mobos with PCI Ex seem to cost quite abit more than those with AGP 8x.  Do you think PCI Ex is here to stay for awhile or should I just stick with the budget AGP?<br />
<br />
PCI Express makes zero difference in game performance right now.  From a gameplay standpoint, it is a waste of money.  However, I think there are 2 reasons to consider it.<br />
<br />
1)  It is most likely here to stay, and 2 years from now you might have a hard time upgrading your video card if you don't have a PCI Express motherboard.<br />
<br />
2)  GeForce 6600 (see the video card question)<br />
<br />
#4 - I have my heart set on two/four Western Digital Raptor SATA drives in RAID0 config in the new box.  Any horror stories?  Are they as good as ppl say they are?<br />
<br />
Sorry don't know much about these specifically.  I have used WD hard drives in the past with good results though.  Hopefully someone else will have experience with them.<br />
<br />
#5 -  On the topic of Video Cards, which ones should I absolutely avoid.  I've heard Geforce 5200s are cheap but you get what you pay for.  Any recommendations for a card in the $150-250 range?<br />
<br />
The GeForce 6600 is an amazing card for the price.  It stomps all over a Radeon 9800 and costs about the same (around $150).  The only drawback to it is that this card was originally PCIexpress only.  There are AGP versions available now, but because they are rare and very desireable for upgrades, they cost about $100 more than the PCIexpress versions.  If you decide to get a GF6600 it might be worth getting a PCIexpress Motherboard just cause the difference in the mobo prices will be less than the AGP video card difference hehe.<br />
<br />
This is the computer I built 2 months ago:<br />
<br />
MB ASUS A8V DELUXE K8T800PRO<br />
CPU AMD 64 3500+ ATHLON 64 939P<br />
DDRAM 1GB TWINX1024-3200C2PT CORSAIR<br />
HD 120GB SEAGATE SATA ST3120827AS 8mb<br />
VGA PNY 6800GT 256M<br />
<br />
This thing plays EQ flawlessly.  Zero lag even with all models on and particles on high in the middle of a raid.  If I was going to do it over now, I would probably get this motherboard, which wasn't out at the time:<br />
<br />

<br />
It's expensive, but really sweet, and PCI Express as well (And SLI in case you decide to go crazy and build a super duper overkill machine) :).  Not that I am at all unhappy with the A8V.  Great motherboard.  I have heard bad things about PNY Video Cards, but I have used them in the past without problems, and I was starting to choke on the price by the time I got to the video card so I went with it and so far so good :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. On performance, they are both about the same, just get the fastest you can. From years of building different systems for home and businesses, the only difference I've seen consistantly between the two is reliability. With Intel, that extra money that you are paying is for the extra reliability that Intel provides in thier products. Keep in mind that this is an opinion, but a very experienced one that I feel strongly about. In fact, I'm writing this on my daily/gaming machine which is an AMD system, processor and chipset. I've had failed processors over the years and all of them AMD. 4 of them in the past 3 years. I haven't had a Intel processor fail on me yet. Fortunately, AMDs customer service is top notch, and I'm usually with a replacement proc with a day or two. It could be the luck of the draw with me, but regardless it does make it very hard to put Intel and AMD on the same ground by reliability standards.<br />
<br />
If money is absolutely no issue, go Intel. If it isn't, go AMD. If reliability is very important to you, go Intel. If you don't mind waiting a few days after a failed processor, then save a nice chunk of change and go with AMD.<br />
<br />
That said, I will continue using AMD products in my home systems because the savings is very significant.<br />
<br />
2. 1 GB is the sweet spot for games right now. if you were running EQ2 I might say that adding another GB would be a good idea, but since you're just running WoW then it's not really an issue. Grab a stick of name brand 1 GB DDR RAM. (I prefer Crusial *sp?*, and have for a long time.) You don't need anything fancy. If you ever need more, then just go grab another stick, and pop it in. I say 1 GB sticks because its easier to replace and troubleshoot when something goes wrong, and it makes adding more memory easy because there is no way that memory slots are an issue unless you only have 1 slot on your motherboard. (Keep in mind that some memory technologies will not be optimal unless you have a stick on each memory channel, like those Nvidia chipsets, I believe.) Make sure that the motherboard supports 1 GB sticks, and that your brand is speciicly suppported to insure that no issues insue.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about DDR2 yet, you'd just be paying a premium for new technology and the problems that they bring. I highly doubt you would notice a difference in preformance. That's strickly an opinion though.<br />
<br />
3. PCIX is the way to go here. The technology is simply superior, and is the next logical step. AGP cards won't be supported forever. more than likely, you will upgrade your video card before the rest fo the machine is outdated, so having a modern hardware interface is probably going to be a good thing. I don't think that you are going to be able to get a really good card on AGP 2-3 years from now, much like PCI cards now.<br />
<br />
4. RAID is the rave now. It's really simple though. Do you do a lot of very large file manipulations like video capturing and editing? Otherewise, I wouldn't bother with it. I infact have a raid 0 SCSI array on this system. I haven't noticed any major difference while playing games. the only time, I've ever notice a difference was when I had this box setup as a PVR. Except for phenomenaly short load times (blink and you miss it) on EQ, EQ2 and WoW that's the only difference. Average framerate has stayed the same on EQ and WoW, however while traveling I did notice slightly less loading glitches on EQ2, although I haven't seen any significant average FPS differences. If you want to waste money, go for it, but I couldn't recommend it unless you are doing something else with your computer than regular windows, internet, email, and games with the system. Again, this is highly opinionated, I have no solid measurements<br />
<br />
5. Get the fastest card you can afford. I have a ATI 9800 and no complaints. Of course it can't do everything, but I can run my games a decent clip. But really, your video card is the heart of your gaming system, collect cans, sit on street and peddle kittens, I don't know, but get a fast card, even if it hurts. Fast drives, CPUs and memory and fancy technology won't make up for a budget card. When you buy the card, make it a good one. Don't forget lots of onboard memory, 128 MB is a very bare minimum.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, but keep in mind everyone has different experiences with computer parts, so its hard to keep opinions out of recommendations. Keep in mind that your Diablo 2 is probably being run at max already, I've yet to come across an iso view game that wasn't lacking in engine performance, though I can't even begin to guess why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Always be willing to put out the extra money for good memory, a failed stick can cause so many errors and qwarks you might replace 2 or 3 good parts before you figure it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely not the time to go with Intel. You can get AMD chips for much cheaper, and net similar performance. I must admit, Intel is better at pure number crunching and productive applications, but AMD owns the gaming field. As suggested above, the AMD 64 line is great. Be sure to go with socket 939, as they are phasing out the high end 754 stuff in favor of turning 754 into a budget performance line.<br />
<br />
#2 - Is 1gb of DDR enough for anything in the next 2yrs or should I spring for 2gb and not worry about memory ever again?  What about DDR2?  Is it that big an improvement over the current DDR memory?<br />
<br />
DDR2 is really an intel only thing, and the technology is new. It hasn't matured enough to warrant using for any purpose, and its MUCH more expensive than DDR RAM, for next to no performance gains. You can't even use DDR2 with AMD chips anyways, so definitely stick with DDR. 1GB is more than enough for all games out today, but 2GB will eventually be the norm, probably in the next year or two when the next batch of big-name new engine games start coming out. As reccomended above, get a motherboard that has at least 3 memory slots, and just go with 2 512MB sticks of ram for now.<br />
<br />
#3 - AGP 8x or PCI Express 16x?  The mobos with PCI Ex seem to cost quite abit more than those with AGP 8x.  Do you think PCI Ex is here to stay for awhile or should I just stick with the budget AGP?<br />
<br />
At this time, I'd have to reccomend PCI-Express. AGP is still going to be around for awhile, but PCI-E exclusive cards are already coming out, and a year or two down the road, you'll have a hard time keeping up (performance wise) with recent tech as PCI-E WILL become the norm.<br />
<br />
#4 - I have my heart set on two/four Western Digital Raptor SATA drives in RAID0 config in the new box.  Any horror stories?  Are they as good as ppl say they are?<br />
<br />
I'd have to say that, for home use, RAID isn't worth it, no matter which kind of array you're going for. Invest in a nice big hard drive, and use DVD RWs or another hard drive to back up your personal files only.<br />
<br />
#5 -  On the topic of Video Cards, which ones should I absolutely avoid.  I've heard Geforce 5200s are cheap but you get what you pay for.  Any recommendations for a card in the $150-250 range?<br />
<br />
Avoid the entire Geforce FX line. People who bought them will try to justify their purchase, but when it comes down to it, in price:performance ratio, they're not worth it period. For the $200-250 price range, there are two cards that really can't be beat right now: The Nvidia Geforce 6600GT, and the ATI Radeon 9800PRO. The 6600GT is better, but you can get a 9800PRO for a little less.<br />
<br />
If you want assistance in picking out specific parts, I'd be more than willing to assist you. I'd only need to know what your total budget will be, and what parts you can save from your current computer (If you can re-use your current monitor and operating system, it'll significantly cut costs on a new machine)</div></div><hr />

I recently built a new a64 system.  If I could go back I would make some changes.  One thing I can definately say is PCI-E is totally worth it.

<br />
Honestly I recommend holding out a bit longer until you have more than three SLI boards to choose from. SLI is scary stuff and a great way to make sure you can upgrade later for not a lot of money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I had to choose right now, I'd go AMD again, for some reason I stopped trusting Intel. I didnt read a lot about it, but DDR2 sounds like RAMBUS, and you know where RAMBUS ended up :p<br />
<br />
About RAID, personally I dont see how a RAID 0 would be some kind of benefit besides that the I/O time will be shorter (faster reading/writing), but there's the potential lose of data if just 1 of your disks get damaged or innoperative, due to the blocks being stripped to all disks. For personal use, if you want to buy several HDs, buy 2, and use 1 as a backup, IMO.</div></div><hr />

6 months ago I would have agreed with you on this.  Right now though, I don't think that it's true anymore.  I have no doubt that Intel will come out with a new chip and wind up equal or better than AMD in the near future, but right now I think AMD owns the performance and reliability crown as well as the value title.  Tom's hardware recently did a study that showed that without special cooling techniques (aftermarket coolers, silver oxide thermal compound etc.)  the high-end P4s actually run so hot that they damage themselves (running the same benchmark over and over on the same processor yields progressively worse results).  Athlon 64 on the other hand, runs about 20 degrees cooler under stress than the P4 thanks to it's 2.2Ghz clock speed.  Performance-wise, as Renix said, the P4EE wins some number-crunching benchmarks thanks to it's extra on-chip cache, but in games it barely holds even with AMD chips that sell for less than 1/3 of it's price, and the Athlon 64 FX-55 and 4000+ are untouchable in games if you want to go top of the line.  <br />
<br />
I'll admit to being a long-time AMD fan.  I have built a dozen computers with them in the last 6 years and never had one fail, but I know others who have.  Right now today though, there's never been a better time to buy an AMD machine as a gamer.</div></div><hr />
