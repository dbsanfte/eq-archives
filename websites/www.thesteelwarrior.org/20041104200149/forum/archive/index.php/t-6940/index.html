<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok have come about a new weapon and trying to decide if it is better or not. We were fighting through Sol Ro tonight and went up left side stairs and came across Galremos and sad what the hell so we took him down. Droped the Flameforge Hammer and of coarse being the only Warrior in the group I got it and want to know what is better in offhand, Flameforge Hammer or the Cord Hilted Spike Driver. I am mainhanding BOC but what would make offhand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would go flameforge hammer for sure. alittle more HP, a stun that can disrupt casting of mobs up to level 65. But I also just hate the CSHD. Agro procs are about the same, but alittle better dps from the flameforge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Flameforge Hammer has terrible dps and a low proc rate to boot.  I'd take CHSD in a heartbeat; I passed on hammer when it dropped in favor of another warrior getting... he hates it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Flameforge hammer and CHSD both have no proc mod<br />
<br />
alla's comparitive efficiency for dps offhand 45 for hammer, 42 for CSHD.<br />
<br />
Both weapons are really on the same scale so I doubt you would see much diference between the too. But all my knowledge is from research rather than use. I doubt I will ever use either of those weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not that I am agreeing or disagreeing with you Grendonbb but I am wondering why would you say that the Flameforge Hammer has a low proc rate? Looking at post in the Library here about weapons with other than normal proc rates (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5644) it is not listed as having a none normal proc rate. Looking up the hammer on www.eqemulator.net even now shows it at unknown070 = 0 which is suppose to mean normal proc rate? I am just wondering why or what experience you have that shows it at a lower proc rate?<br />
<br />
As for DPS and this is something I have been wanting to ask here cause I have not seen SW mention anything like this before but I have recently heard from some people and my normal Enchanter in my party confirmed that according to the Enchanter boards the lowest delay on a hasted weapon is 10. Has anyone else seen this mentioned or talked about? So that would mean with 100% haste you are effectively halving the delay of your weapon. But if the lowest delay on a weapon with haste can be 10 then like GBoS (14/18) hasted is a 14/10 weapon and not a 14/9. Has anyone else ever heard of that? That would also mean that the CSHD at best is a 13/10 weapon (hasted) where the FH is a 20/13.5 (assuming that EQ does not round in a decimal haste situation)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One more quick question Omnus, what is the &quot;alla's comparitive efficiency&quot; you mentioned? is that a program or a formula you plugged numbers into? How did you calculate the DPS of the weapon like that? If it is a program can you link it here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it is just some system allakhazam uses I don't know much about it. just felt lazy today, so I guess i will show some numbers of how I would look at it<br />
<br />
damage/delay<br />
<br />
15/20 = 0.75<br />
10/20 = 0.50<br />
20/27 = 0.74<br />
13/19 = 0.68</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Will the misinformation ever die? ;) To answer Otheuym -<br />
<br />
1. Hammer has standard proc rate.<br />
2. There is no minimum delay.<br />
3. Jboots were not nerfed.</div></div><hr />
