<br />
My guild has killed RZ 3 times now and we still haven't seen a BoW... well that sucks, but I can imagine this is quite normal.<br />
<br />
But, as far as I know, no guild on Terris Thule has seen a BoW drop at all after the event has been fixed!!<br />
<br />
Anyone actually has seen a BoW drop after the event been fixed? BoW drop buffed? Or are we just very unlucky?<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />
Myrt</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah well, still hope to get one, one day, but I might have to go for a SEWS ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're working on your epic I think that and the VF you have should be fine, I have BoW but i'll probably switch over to Epic/VF when I finish mine. I already use my VF with an unauged GBoS in groups and the aggro is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrtiz</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it's the aa's but I still have aggro problems...<br />
<br />
I should be working on my epic, but simplyhate the gfx... which makes it harder to get started for me.<br />
<br />
Yea VF it a great weapon, increased my aggro (and dps) greatly... But dualwielding a 19 delay weapon and an 18 delay weapon, well... dps spikes from ripostes can be bad and if I get the slightest lack and miss the Rage message Im toast LOL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slippery Attacks (Passive) - This ability makes it more difficult for opponents to riposte your offhand attacks. Each rank increases the chance your opponent will fail to riposte by 20%.<br />
<br />
The above AA(15 total for 100% offhand riposte immunity) will eliminate the threat of massive riposte damage that was once feared by dual wielding warriors. The enrage thing, that's yer own damn fault and I'd laugh at you every time you did that(I laugh at myself when I do it too).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lmao, believe me I laughed at myself when I did that, and so did the rest of the raid  :p I'd prefer to have a tad more time to react ;)<br />
<br />
Slippery Attacks indeed sounds good, I thought it was more expensive, but 15aa sounds good!<br />
<br />
I'll try to start working on my epic 1.5 I guess... damn those gfx  ;)</div></div><hr />

I posted up a picture of the carnage (But damn was it fun!!!).  We killed him several times after...<br />
<br />
Not a single BoW.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got only 1 BoW in about  10-12 RZTW kills, but it did come after the fix.  We have had terrible luck on aggro weapons other than BoC (4 in 3 AoW kills); 1 BF, 0 HG, 0 BBoE, 1 BoW and we're probably finished with those mobs.  We are 1 for 6 on VF so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroalak</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we had one drop 11/21/04 on the guilds first RZ kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we had one drop 2 weeks ago on a backflagging run, think thats 2 BoWs out of 5 kills</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FoD's seen 3 in probably about 11 runs on the script, two from one kill, one from another. All after the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">to be technical those were all pre-patch (you know when vz/tz were coming together)<br />
<br />
But to be totally honest this is another war po'd he isn't getting his bow and thinks something is bugged when it's just how it's always been.</div></div><hr />
