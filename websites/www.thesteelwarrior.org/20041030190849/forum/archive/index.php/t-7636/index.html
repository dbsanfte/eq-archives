<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's been all the buzz on different boards as well as in game recently.  I'm excited to say the least, but can anyone give any positive feedback/information on when they plan to put this into the game??<br />
<br />
it would be nice to not have to worry about ever grinding out another anger3 augment in the future ... as well as being able to recycle some of the more rare mob-dropped augments (such as the ferubi niceties) and the more expensive 40hp augments from ldon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gawd i hope so.I want to hunt down that LDON guy and well...do not nice things. :)<br />
<br />
I'd make it quick as anger augs mitigate my LDON horror to some degree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even if it's just the purchasable stuff that's reusable and the dropped stuff still vanishes into the ether when you remove it I'd be ok with it.  Would be nicer if all aug's were reusable, but I'd settle for my anger aug's and vendor bought hp augs at this point. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heck I can agree totally. <br />
<br />
Removing the augments and then reusing them would rock even if it came to paying for a solvent to remove and then one to reattach I would pay happily for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have two thoughts on this.<br />
<br />
First, make the bought augments reusable with a vendor sold solvent. This should be a no-fail solvent. If you use it, you get the augment and the item back.<br />
<br />
Second, throw the tradeskillers a bone and provide a recipe for a solvent that works only on dropped augments. If this mechanism threatened game balance (or endangered rain forests, or whatever), then the solvent could provide a high chance of successful removal rather than a guarantee of successful removal. This would give the tradeskillers a valuable product that only they could supply, and it would give the entire player base a way of benefitting from hours previously invested in LDoN dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Possibly as soon as next patch, but dont hold it to that date, cause its unofficial, I guess the best definite thing would be soon, or in the next couple of patchs</div></div><hr />
