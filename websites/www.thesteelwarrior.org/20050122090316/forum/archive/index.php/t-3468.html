<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nagorak</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am just wondering how my equipment is for a 53 warrior I normally group with a ranger,shaman,cleric then we fill the other two slots with friends or pickups. I dont have too much trouble maintaining aggro because the ranger controls his very well. Just looking for a little insight on what I should upgrade too or try to camp. Thanks for your time<br />

<br />
Other than that, Umbral planes could net you a helm of the Raldukan.  Bits of Moktor armour would also be upgrades until you get your FH bits.<br />
<br />
Maidens eye for Vah Shir claw earring and the range slot idols that drop there - theres 2 that are both quite nice, transient idol is one, cant remember the other.<br />
<br />
Droga for a copper hammer to compliment your Sword of the Bloodsworn for the current invogue warrior weapon look.<br />
<br />
Crypt in Sebilis for a Heirophat cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, you've got 2 haste items.  Ditch the SCHW, as its not doing you much good (the belt is 31% haste, so your SCHW haste isn't being used).<br />
<br />
Next, your mask needs immediate help.  Crystal Spider Eyes should be dirt cheap, and be a big upgrade over what you have.<br />
<br />
I'd also look at upgrading your neck item.  Clattering Bone Necklace is a good item.  A Ribbon Choker would also be an upgrade, and would probably be pretty inexpensive.<br />
<br />
Since you've ditched your SCHW, you'll need new gloves. Cobalt is a cheap AC upgrade, though going with something with AC and HP is preferred.  Might look into picking up a Champion's MQ, or attending some kind of Kael Arena raid to get some corroded gauntlets for the quest.<br />
<br />
For your helm, take a look at a Helm of Raldukan or Dented Kunzar War Helm.  Either one would be a nice boost in AC, and add hp's and other stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As mentioned, Fierce Heraldric is going to be the biggest upgrades for you for many of your slots, for quite some time.  Your main focus should be collecting FH stuff.  The suggestions I made are only fillers until you can do so.  So budget accordingly - don't take a Champion's Gauntlets MQ for 3k if you can get a FH Gauntlets for 4k or 5k.  In the long run, you'll want FH anyway, so smart shopping may save you plat down the road.</div></div><hr />
