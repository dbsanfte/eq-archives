<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So now that i've got my last problem resolved and know that WoW doesn't feel oddly small like EQ2 does, i have 2 more probably dumb questions.<br />
<br />
1) Do characters turn their heads to their target, or is it fixed heads like EQ1?<br />
<br />
2) How do warriors and paladins compare in tanking and in pvp? No, not going to be a paladin! Just curious though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, characters do turn their heads before turning their whole body in a direction if you're looking around using the mouse. Character models in WoW are nicely done. They have various voice emotes and social animations, each race have some unique ones. E.G. /Dance ! You have to see it. :)<br />
<br />
As for Warrior and Pally *cough* .. Pally's are very unlike the ones in EQ. They can actually heal and be a healer (though not as powerful as a priest) but they can manage. They also have same weapon skills and defense skills as that of a warrior. Theoretically their DPS is supposed to be 20% less than a warrior. Pally's are the kings of PvP, only thwarted by rogues who can sorta chain stun them. Warriors are rare. A high percentage of the population are playing pally's (and for good reason). I think they are only like 300 hp's short of a warrior's hp and have the same AC. Their aggro control however is not as solid as that of a warrior's. Btw, dont take my word on this because i haven't played a pally myself. Warrior is the weakest PvP class atm (and debatably the worse solo class too), they need work. Warriors can win in PvP but it requires skill and timing (and some luck). On the other hand, any dumbass playing a Hunter or Pally will just push the buttons he pushes to give you a hard time. But when a warrior has a good healer in group they become an unstoppable beast, far more dangerous than pallys. In groups, warriors are always welcomed for instanced dungeon runs (where all the kewl stuff drops).</div></div><hr />

Its not really in the game. Once Battlegrounds are out we will have a better basis. I don't thknk anyone here is playing a war on a PVP server.<br />
<br />
What makes us, at least on paper, weak in PVP is a lack of ranged attacks, difficulty in closing and a lack of a get away ability. Heck sheild smash would be nice to have...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to my last comment about Warrior PvP, Yes I know it's written from a MS/Arms perspective haven't PvP'ed much with a protection spec... although I assume it involves alot of shield bashing, revenge, CB etc. I've really been working on my PvP lately trying to figure out which tactics work with this build and I think this catches most of what I do to effectively PvP.... really looking forward to battlegrounds.... although by then I'll prolly be lvl 60 and Protection Specced :-\<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parrn</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What makes a warrior a very good choice in WoW is how dedicated you are to learning the game and strategy.  I started as priest, got to 22, and realized there wasn't a damn pally or warrior that new how to hold agro.  So I made my Pally lvled to 44, and realized my group needs a warrior.  So i am now playing awarrior and love it!<br />
<br />
First off there is a large portion of the gaming population that have never played a mmorpg before.  This is important in the fact they don't comprehend group tactics.  Therefor if you are capable of learning to change stances and using abilities in those stances then you are levles above the rest of the community.  I like to comapre this to Ebayers in EQ1, you just knew the ones that didn't have a clue, same here.<br />
<br />
Paladins have very good single mob aggro control.  Thier multiple mob agro controol comes down to Consecrate, a very mana intensive AOE low damge holy spell.  If you are playing a Pally and your encharge of agro control with this spell and your other abilities you will have no mana left after tackling a group of 4-5.<br />
<br />
WoW is different that past MMORPG's because they didn't create the 1-pull 1-slaughter  game.  There is next to no mez, and if there is it's like 30 seconds on opponet with no ability to lock down and control.  They wanted to create a chaos type of game, where groups were constantly doing something to survive.  The only lockdown I have seen is Rogues on casters, when you have a good rogue, casters mana bar should never move.<br />
<br />
I say the above because that is where Warriors are needed.  They have an AOE taunt and the ability to hold 4 opponents at bay all the while doing damage.  <br />
<br />
My Pally can tank, as a retro spec 44lvl pally I can dish some pain to my opponents.  But once I have more than one, its an outlast kinda thing.  My damage output is pretty constant, so that vairable doesnt change.  A warrior on the other hand will change his damage output, so instead of stopping to attack to heal myself.  My warrior just ups the damge output.  Concidering the changes that have been made, I'm doing more now.  So my Warrior can tank too, I really personally feel it comes down to player concept of the game, and learning the tools.  <br />
<br />
For example, quick switching weaposn to gain more agro, then unloading with a big 2hander for more damage, switching to sword and board to interupt casters, swithing back to DW for rage, 2h for big damage.  Using nets, marbles and candles in my earlier days to get the advantage, and of course specing Arms/Fury for the battle warrior.  Even though some of our abilities people don't think are worth much, using them is key, battle shouts, rend, sunderarmor (this one is big help) and of course being a warrior make you very equipement dependent.<br />
<br />
So try both, stay away form the wow boards, and play to win.  there is plenty of help out there if you ask.<br />
<br />
Peace out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just FYI my last 3 duels were against a hunter, a rouge, and an arm sepc warrior and I won all of them in defensive stance. The hunter was +2 lvl and the other two were even lvl. The rouge may have just been a poor dueler (I am on a PvE server) but he seemed to be using the right tactics (stun a lot, backstab, debuf my AC ect...). In all of these battles I used shield block, revenge, bloodrage, rend, disarm, concussion blow, and both shouts. I only had to use my last stand against the rouge. My disarm and concussion blow both missed the arms spec warrior. I was lvl 32 during the hunter duel and lvl 33 during the other two. Also I am tunneling my connection through a firewall to connect to WoW and I get 1000ms pings at best. This made the rouge duel somewhat difficult due to him running all over the place. The arms spec was in my guild and we decided not to run in circles. I used no potions or bandages in these duels and saw none used by my enemies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arm's Spec warrior at lvl 32 didn't have MS and probably not any weapon specializations. If he's still an Arms spec warrior in 10 lvls it will be a more telling fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arm's Spec warrior at lvl 32 didn't have MS and probably not any weapon specializations.

<br />
He was 33 and at that level you han have:<br />
Two-Handed Weapon Specialization	Rank 5<br />
mace, axe, or sword spec at 4/5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats why I said probably not since some warrriors grab cruelty first for the added dps early on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats why I said probably not since some warrriors grab cruelty first for the added dps early on.<br />
<br />
I debated that buy after I got deep wounds.  Cruelty would really help out thru the 30s, but alas I chose to stick it out with Arms so I could buy MS @ 40 instead of 45.  That said Cruelty will be my first investment post MS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used Deep wounds up until recently, but it negates Intimidating Shout which allows a combat heal... a life saver in solo and PvP play, not so much a factor in group/raid/instances but will be very useful in Battlegrounds to have a mass fear ability. I used cruelty up to lvl 40 then respecced to MS and worked Cruelty back up immediately. 1g was worth spending to have the crit % available before MS was available.</div></div><hr />
