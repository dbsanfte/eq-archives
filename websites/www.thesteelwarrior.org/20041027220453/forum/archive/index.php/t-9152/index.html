Waza</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It stacks with everything except some time-level clickies, or so I hear. You can use the spell stacking info on lucy to know exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, it does.   I bought the cloak you're referring to for like 90k the second day of OOW, because really... right clicking 24AC when I never got a RZ ring or Quarm ring or Inny veil.... turns me on.<br />
<br />
The fact that it's droppable and doesnt' restrict me later on down the road is an additional bonus.<br />
<br />
Totally worth the 90k in my eyes, some of the best plat I ever spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed, it's the shiznit. Lucy says it's 27 AC, too. I counted 23 when I clicked it but I'm not much good at subtraction.<br />
<br />
I get to be even cooler cuz I got it as a drop and posted it first on the thread here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is also a 90hp Chalice clickie out of RSS. Form of Endurance I</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Doesn't that Screech effect prevent you from using both the Form of Defense and Form of Endurance at the same time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thats what I got out of it, but who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>waza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Does it stack with CoR and Shielding too ?<br />
<br />
Waza</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">CoR = Call of the Rathe?<br />
<br />
It's Slot 10 AC.  It stacks with all buffs a caster can put on you (Ranger, Cleric, Druid, etc).  The only thing it's not going to stack with are other item effects you could put on yourself if you had the item.<br />
<br />
Shielding (if you're talking about the Shielding mod on items) has nothing to do with the AC on this...or AC in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is 26 exactly for me, not sure why you're getting 23. And yes, it stacks with pretty much everything except for the other form of xxxxx lines due to effect slot 6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the AC doesn't stack with Form of anything else (due to screech), and doesn't stack with Eternal Ward line because the AC is on the same slot.  It stacks with every normal buff you can expect to have though.</div></div><hr />

Yes i was speaking of Call of the Rathe.<br />
Does it stack with Shield of the arcane of ornate bp ?<br />
Where does it drop ? like 8 shroud of the fallen defender to sell in our bazaar atm (ayonae ro)<br />
<br />
Waza</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm I been wondering what my next bazaar purchase should be, will have to keep an eye on these. Anyone know what and where it drops from ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes it stacks with EVERYTHING (all raid buffs, all pre-time clickies) except &quot;Form of *&quot; and &quot;Eternal Ward&quot; like phantron said.<br />
<br />
It drops off one of the named kyv's in the north half of WoS, I posted the name in the GoD gear thread.</div></div><hr />

Wow, 20k?  What server are you on, because on Drinal last night I only saw one for sale, and the seller had pie in the sky hopes of selling it for 160k.  I definately need to pick one up though, 25ish AC clicky is awesome.</div></div><hr />

The Nameless Server, there were several now for under 40k. They seem to be a more common drop. Glad I waited a little!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw a more realistic price of 50k last night, I still think I'm gonna wait a bit though.  I got my Tainted Cloak of Treachery for 20k because I waited until there were like 12 of them in the bazaar one night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Drops in Walls of Slaughter off of some noc, traded a stonewood bow for mine (stonewood worth like 25k I think). Considering I get 1-2 stalves and 2-3 bow strings per xp session in earth I considered that a good deal to not have to deal with WoS retards on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Foofee_test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Could someone post the name of the npc that drops this?  One person saying a noc, another a kyv...  thanks</div></div><hr />

Bought mine for 17k :). There was only the one for sale so maybe the guy didn't know how to price it.  Great buy though.</div></div><hr />
