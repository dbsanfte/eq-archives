<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grablok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Given that points are finite, and that royal attendant is expensive.<br />
I would like to ask your opinions on what piece of armor to get in what priority.<br />
Based not on what I need but rather difficulty in obtaining a resonable alternative.<br />
<br />
For instance.  Farming ornate bracers would probably be faster than buying royal attendant bracers. so therefore i'ld personally put bracers at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Whereas getting an ornate BP or legs is kinda tough so that would go up front.<br />
<br />
Which pieces if any do you think is worth buying? <br />
And in what order would you buy them?<br />
<br />
As an added question would you go with the mistmoore stuff at all? or just wait?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Grab</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hellslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would actually put royal bracers at the top of the list, along with the gauntlets (at least if you are comparing to ornate).  The royal bracers are 70hp versus ornate of 45hp, plus you can aug the royal bracers with +40hp (type 2 aug) giving you 110hp bracers.  Same deal with the gauntlets.  The 40hp type 7 aug (which would go on the ornate) can only be used with head, chest, legs, arms, and feet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best aug you can put in the bracer (from LDoN merchants not GoD drop) is +30hp from S Ro camp.  But still a 100 hp bracer &gt; Kizrak....I agree with your analysis.<br />
<br />
I'd personally rank the legs (the 760 EF are almost as good as is kizrak) and BP (kizrak not being that terribly inferior) as being the lowest.<br />
<br />
I'd rank helm (hasteable), bracers and boots as good buys.<br />
<br />
 As an added question would you go with the mistmoore stuff at all? or just wait? <br />
<br />
I think you mean everfrost 760 armor?  The only piece I'd take (and have) over royal attendants are the legs...I just could not justify 700 more pts for 10 hp/end, 4ac and neg sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">good bracers are hard to find.<br />
ornate bracers arent that good.<br />
ornate bps if you like raiding are pretty common.<br />
ornate boots on my server cost as much as bps /boggle<br />
arms drop in GoD trials (easy to get) which are &gt; ornate<br />
<br />
bracers would be high on my list, as would boots and helmet.<br />
legs/bp would pull far behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, the Tak bracer can use the +40hp augment from Tak camp, making it 110hp.  Thus the wrist slot is a terrific slot to spend LDON points on.  Arms might be next, as the Kizrak arms are not too impressive, and the arms can still get +40hp augments.<br />
<br />
You can add +40hp to any boots or hat, using the augment from Rujark camp, so I'd not buy Tak armor for those two slots, personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ornate boots are relatively rare, since they aren't on the BoT drop tables that I know of, and I don't think they're on any of the tactics drop tables. All ornate boots seem to come out of Sol Ro's tower. If they drop elsewhere, they're Fucking Rare(TM). Add to this that it's one of the higher &quot;readily&quot; obtainable FT pieces for knights and bards and mana preservation 4 for clerics, and all of a sudden it's worth a whole lot more than some mediocre vengeance boots, or a BP that gets utterly blown away by smartly augged Royal Sand for most plate classes. Royal Sand boots, on the other hand, aug up well, and are easily accessed - It was the first piece of tak armor I went with, to replace my Dark Prince Regent. If you can use Feirce Heraldic, it's a smaller upgrade, but is still worth while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gonna have to agree that the bracers with a 40hp augment are the best pieces of LDoN armor. It is hard to find bracers with at least 100hps. Torque of the Wyrmlord is a rare drop from Emp. Acid Bracers are 300k on my server and a rare drop from RoS. Serus Torque again seems to be rare. VT bracers dont have the hps, making them unauged comparable to Tak bracers (75hps and 85hps) Besides the Bracers Inny drops the next best things youre gonna find are Raex.<br />
<br />
The Tak arms are also pretty solid and an improvement over Kizraks. They would be my second choice followed by boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So here we go :<br />
<br />
ARMS :<br />
LDoN Arms while nice are not really worth it.<br />
ORNATE Arms suck, they are too expensive for the stats.<br />
<br />
Go to Barindu, Camp Sewers, and get the ones from &quot;Sludge Eating Fly&quot;<br />
<br />
LEGS<br />
LDoN Legs are really nice but not really worh it.<br />
ORNATE Legs SUCK.<br />
<br />
Go to Barindu, Camp Vxed, and get the ones from &quot;Chavoor the Trickster&quot;<br />
<br />
BRACERS<br />
LDoN Bracers are GODLY, they can be pushed to 100+HP.<br />
ORNATE Bracers SUCK.<br />
<br />
If you cant get &quot;Crystalized Acid Bracers&quot; get the LDoN ones.<br />
And augment them to 100+ HP. You will probably never replace them.<br />
<br />
BOOTS<br />
LDoN Boots are really nice too, but they arent unique.<br />
ORNATE Boots SUCK.<br />
<br />
King Tormax &amp; LDoN MM Hard have some nice dropable boots.<br />
If you dont have access to these, you could grab LDoN ones as last resort.<br />
I dont think getting LDoN boots is worth it.<br />
<br />
GLOVES<br />
LDoN Gloves are unique, they can be pushed to 100+HP.<br />
ORNATE Gloves are at best decent, but great if you solo/2box.<br />
<br />
Its a really hard call, depending mostly on the availability of hastes.<br />
Since i 2box a cleric, i had to get Ornate. If you rarely lack haste dont.<br />
King Tormax &amp; ??? LDoN Hard have some nice dropable gloves.<br />
I dont think getting LDoN gloves is worh it.<br />
Specially since you can MULTIQUEST Skyshrine Gloves (and they own).<br />
<br />
HELM<br />
LDoN Helm is totally awesome if you dont have a good haste.<br />
ORNATE Helm SUCKS.<br />
And AoW / Yelinak Helms are too rate &amp; expensive.<br />
<br />
39ac 115hp 36% Haste is awesome for a helm.<br />
<br />
BP<br />
LDoN BP is really nice, specially since it can be boosted to 200hp (Tipt Farming).<br />
ORNATE BP is awesome because it can reach some very nice stats.<br />
And also provide a great buff when shm/bst are not around.<br />
<br />
I would probably go for the ornate because of the polyvalence factor.<br />
<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION<br />
<br />
Overall LDoN armor (even Miragul which is the BEST price/stats ratio) totally<br />
beats the shit out of Ornate Armor.<br />
<br />
My advice : Stay away from all ornate exept : Gloves / BP<br />
<br />
PS : In Tipt there is a named &quot;Enraged Maternal Cragbeast&quot;<br />
That drop two really sweet augments 30hp/end 30hp/mana.<br />
<br />
Which means that you can add 60HP to ANY LDoN ITEM.<br />
(Or 30hp to the already awesome 39ac 115hp 36% Helm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Ornate boots are on the piglet drop table in Tactics I think, just to answer Arathena :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, there are definitely boots in Tactics.  I believe they are also on the loot tables in Halls of Honor (which nobody ever seems to consider for camping ornate).  Neither are listed on Allakhazam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Six months in the pit in tactics, 150 AA later, 0 pieces of Ornate from the piglet. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">EmiliaEQ pretty much nailed it. I would follow that advice exactly if I didn't already have decent gear in those slots. Personally I rank the BP #1 since 69ac 200hp just can't be beat. That BP will last you until you get Raex's. Bracers are also teh win, if I didn't have CABx2 I would be wearing LDoN. Good bracers are hard to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grablok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks all for your wonderful responses.<br />
<br />
Grab</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Great post Emilia<br />
<br />
 King Tormax &amp; ??? LDoN Hard have some nice dropable gloves. <br />
<br />
warlord steel gaunt from EC hard ldon = 90 hps..pretty decent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd go with what piece gives you the biggest overall upgrade.  If putting on the BP adds 10AC and 10hps from your current BP, but putting on a bracer would add 10 AC and 30hps from your current bracer.... I'd get the bracer.<br />
<br />
I got my helm first.  Why?  Cause it was about a 50 hp and some AC of an upgrade for me over what I already had.  Would have only gained 10 hps and a small amount of AC if I had gotten the BP first.  Same with my arms, then my legs, now I'm on to bracers.  BP will be near the end for me.  Guantlets won't happen till I have the augs to aug them with before putting them on.  Probably be my last piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Emilia on pretty much everything except the legs, at 48 AC and 85 hp royal attendant are pretty much the same as the 45 AC 90 hp ornate legs, and Burnished Antique Greaves off of Chavoor at 40 AC and 110 hp with more plusses to stats and saves are nice, but with named spawns nerfed in expeditions you're not really going to pick these up very easily unless you know the right people or can get them yourself.  <br />
<br />
Once you aug any of these legs you probably wouldn't want to switch them out for another one of these three unless you have a lot of ldon points to burn for another 40 hp aug to get a minor tweek in stats, just because they all come out with pretty much the same stats in the end anyway.   <br />
<br />
The only reason i would call one of these legs better than the other is availability.  Anyone can get takish legs with enough points, or ornate greaves with enough money, and vxed legs are rediculously easy to get *if* you can get into vxed.   So if you rake in the ldon points, consider the takish, if you're rolling in money, buy (or camp) some ornate, and if you can get into vxed and have a solid group that can kill the front named like umbiki and chavoor, grab those 1st.  In my opinion all of these legs are pretty equal, just get whichever you can most easily with your resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like your response Emilia, however Ornate legs do not suck. 45ac 90hps are rather nice and there isnt much out there that compares hp wise. Kizraks Gloves are decent, Warlords, Velium Encrusted and Myrmidon are all better.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah the right click 30pt sta buff on the legs is really nice for those that dont have a shammy or bst in thier group and are under the cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did all my LDoN before GoD came out and the only piece of RA armor I ended up getting were the arms, so I'd have to go with them first as that was what I did (I actually got the MM neck too since I couldn't get a nice neck anywhere). Although with the Pitted Vambraces from GoD, they are not as appealing as they once were. <br />
<br />
However, I think it really does come down to what kind of stuff you can get outside of LDoN. If you can't get Acid Bracers/farm tipt boss, then I would say bracers are the best buy. You can throw GoD augs (Natimbi or Ferubi) into  Warlords Steel/Myrmidon's gaunts and get about the same results as 40hp in the RA gaunts, etc. Everything else has a droppable or easily obtainable equivalent as people have already mentioned. <br />
<br />
However you plan on doing it though, I'd suggest getting at least 2-3 pieces simply for the augment slots. As others have mentioned, the Enraged Maternal Cragbeast drops Some really nice type all augs. There is nothing nicer than having some crappy type 1 slots to actually put decent augments into.<br />
<br />
Finally, unless you plan on doing craploads of adventures or are part of a guild that is progressing fast enough to where you are going to be outgrowing your gear in the near future, for the most part it is more efficient to get the 40hp and 10ac augs than getting a bunch of the armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OK I have been looking at this post and searching Alla and LDoN DB and i found 2 haste augments one is like 210 points and the other is 1150 or so what is the difference they are both linked to lucy as same up to 50% haste at 65 I am one very confused Hobbit Help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Some differences:<br />
<br />
The 1150 point haste aug will fit into 4 different type 3 slots. It is 36% worn haste.<br />
<br />
The 510 point haste aug will fit into 4 different type 3 slots. It is 31% worn haste.<br />
<br />
The 220 point haste aug will fit into 4 different type 3 slots. It is 24% worn haste.<br />
<br />
The 100 point haste aug will fit into 3 different type 3 slots. It is 21% worn haste.<br />
<br />
The 30 point haste aug will fit into 2 different type 3 slots. It is 13% worn haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I find Ornate legs WAY TOO Expensive for what they actually do.<br />
<br />
Ornate BP is worth every PP because of the clicky (no pocket shaman/bst here).<br />
Ornate Gloves ... well haste is more common ... but still it comes in handy?<br />
<br />
And yeah LDoN BP = UBBBBBBBBBBBBBER<br />
<br />
Takish BP : AC 69 100 Hp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Worn haste effect never stacks.  Not even if you have two haste effects on the same item through augmenting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Before GoD was released, I upgraded arms from Champions to Royal Attendent because it was the biggest single slot boost I'd get. If I had it to do over again though, I would have gone with the Everfrost arms, a very small decrease in noteable stats for almost half the price. If I had done that, I'd now have enough points to get the RA Bracer from N Ro to upgrade my sta augmented Helanic Tundra bracer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ornate boots drop from pigs, but not from the piglet.  They are from pigs that are spawned as adds on one of the named in Tactics.  Certain bards have been known to kite the named around so he will continue to spawn adds with a chance to drop boots, but it's probably a borderline exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Lathen <br />
<br />
Thanks for the Haste Breakdown I really appriciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">There are two ways of looking at this, I think.<br />
Emilia has done an excellent job of outlining the first way of thinking about these pieces--that is, of the armor sets in these groups, which are best in each slot?<br />
The second way of looking at upgrading is referenced by Alisdahre, who points out the value in upgrading for the biggest boost given the gear you currently have.<br />
In general, I'd progress along these lines:<br />
1. Know yourself: What stats most need improvement on this character? Are STA/DEX maxxed? How are AC/HP, not just in an absolute sense, but relative to each other?<br />
2. Know your gear: identify the best and worst slots you have and become knowledgable about the relative costs of upgrades in the slots that lag.<br />
3. Know your power: Can you get access to drops outside of LDoN? Which ones? Where is your guild?<br />
4. Know your pocket book: how easy is it for you to generate cash?<br />
<br />
I'd say that it would be helpful to know not just how these pieces compare to each other, but how they compare to armor pieces that are in a class below these categories.<br />
This can get pretty complicated pretty fast because of the variables involved, but let's take a simple example: you level to 65 and you're wearing cultural BP and legs. You're trying to figure out which slot to focus on upgrading first. Everything being equal, I'd focus on the BP first. Neither the cultural greaves nor the BP is at the same level as these other armors, but the LDoN BP is a far superior upgrade for you than, for example, the ornate legs: Ornate legs 45AC, 90 hps, clickie STA boost; Helanic Tundra legs 40 AC, 10 STA, 80 hps (bleh, sorry don't know RZ stats off the top of my head, but the AC is the same on them, I'm pretty sure). Yes, ornate would be an upgrade, but the 69 AC bp is a much bigger upgrade over cultural's 51AC bp, and the LDoN bp is going to last a long time.<br />
Anyway, that might be a less real-world example than I'd like, but my point is that in addition to the relative value of the possible armor out there, you have to figure out how many LDoN points you have, what your armor is like, how easy it is for you to get pp, where your guild is in it's progression, and perhaps how many raid/loot points you have.<br />
I'd also say that it doesn't hurt to have at least a vague idea what your friends need/would like to advance their characters and to help them if you can. My personal view--and, to my credit, one which I have announced in /guild -- is that it's all about me and my needs. Luckily, people thoguht I was kidding: the longer my friends are in the dark about that, the better for me. Anyway, it's much easier to talk a guildmate cleric into coming with you to a boring or dangerous camp for an armor upgrade you need if, every single time that cleric opens his inventory and sees that he has his Epic, he remembers that you were the guy tanking those boring epic camps for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Alisdahre makes a good point.  If you're looking at the LDoN armors, your first purchase should be whatever is the biggest upgrade.  Mine was an EF helm, it was only 760 points, and I was wearing a champion's helm at the time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">OK all I am going to ask a HUGE favor then please.<br />
<br />
My magelo is posted and I am one yellow from DING 60.<br />
<br />
I have virtully no cash and refuse to buy it this is a game and I will earn what I can on my own. (This is just my position on this no flames please)<br />
<br />
I have been doing EF so I can get the Anger 2 augments for my weapons first (am like 60 points short of seeing them) <br />
<br />
Please tell me with what I am wearing what I should be going for. LDoN's are a blast and the group I run loves doing them. <br />
<br />
My guild does not raid nor does my server hold open raids so any help would rock please thank you in advance all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Your gear looks fine, just get level 65 and get those hp AA's. As you grind out that xp in ldon adventures you will get enough points for a couple pieces by then. I'd recommend Royal Attendant because it has better ac and hp than Malevolent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I agree with EmiliaEQ that ornate legs are wayyyyyyyyyyyy too expensive.  I picked up a pair in solro an I wear them, however, and having not paid a red cent, I'd say they kick ass :)<br />
<br />
I disagree, however, that the LDoN arms aren't worth it.  80 base hp rocks, tossed a 40 hp aug on it and I'm at 120, with 2 more slots to stick in from GoD farming at a later date.  That doesn't suck one bit.  Can't find anything better droppable, and the sludge aren't much better, especially if you have invested the time into augging the arms :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Also, one other thing to consider when when you decide which item to upgrade next -<br />
<br />
LDON Tak armor has 3 augment slots.<br />
LDON Tak armor has 3 augment slots.<br />
LDON Tak armor has 3 augment slots.<br />
LDON Tak armor has 3 augment slots.<br />
<br />
This is so uber and so often over looked. While the base stats on all of the items we are discussing are all very similar, you can make the Tak armor much better with augments. There are several vendor bought augments that are very nice, and a slew of GoD augments that are type all. If the chance for further upgrade is a long way off, the Tak will probably last you long because you can continue to augment it in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kirle1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I may be missing something here but Cragbeast in Tipt the 30hp/30 end aug is lore no?  So then you can only loot 1? Where are people getting the others when talking about aug'ing the Tak BP to 200 Hp's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Augmented Takish : 34ac 120hp  (2500 Points)<br />
Augmented Sludge : 28ac 125hp (1100 Points)<br />
<br />
Ok you may say that you can add some nifty atk or other effects to Takish Arms...<br />
But chances are, you would be much better off spending points on more Armor.<br />
<br />
Most people doing LDoN will get the Takish BP... That implies AC69 200HP BP (Tipt Farming)<br />
<br />
So while going full LDoN IS the best solution (stat &amp; effect wise).<br />
Its not really efficient because you can get &quot;almost as good&quot; items with less trouble.<br />
(Talking specially about Slugde Eating Fly Arms).<br />
<br />
<br />
Takish BP : AC 69 100 Hp<br />
Slot 1 Type1 : 30hp/end (Tipt)<br />
Slot 2 Type 2 : 40hp (LDoN Vendor)<br />
Slot 3 Type 3 : 30hp/mana (Tipt)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The thing about it is you can put those two Tipt augs on any piece of Tak armor. You could make 180hp arms, 170hp bracers, 185hp legs, etc. If you pick any one tak piece and put both tipt augs in it, of course it will be amazing compared to the item you only put 40hp into. If you compare triple aug'ed arms to single aug'ed Sludge arms, the sludge arms get blown away. Just like if you compare the single aug'ed Ornate BP to triple aug'ed Tak.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it is much more effective to get 2 pieces and spread the tipt augs over them and get 12-14cha in the off slots than to stack the tipt augs in one place. If you are buying RA armor, you probably aren't going to be looting much stuff in Time so you aren't going to be getting much cha elsewhere so any free slots for it are always welcome.</div></div><hr />
