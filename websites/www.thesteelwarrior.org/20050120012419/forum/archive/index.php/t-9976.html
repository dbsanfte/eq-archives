<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have a &quot;Bite of Yak&quot; augged BoC in my Pri and an unaugged SoTB in my offhand with 304 DEX unbuffed. I was wondering if the &quot;Bygone Butchers Cleaver&quot; would generate More, same or less Hate than the SoTB? If this Cleaver is not a good aggro replacement then can you maybe provide a recommendation. I am not in a uber guild so I dont see me getting any raid type upgrades anytime in the near future. I do have around 70K to spend. I heard that the Midwinters sword generates a good amount of aggro but it is going for 100K+ on my server so that is out of my reach atm.    <br />
<br />
Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

aug that puppy with something and you got a beast of an offhander methinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also that new stun mace (tradable)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at lvl 70 BB'sC is far greater than SotB in primary but just a bit better than SotB in offhand. btw SoM'sV is as good as BB'sC, both prim and secondary hand, and MoM is between SoM'sV and SotB offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what you are saying Yoda is the SoTB produces more aggro than the Mace of Memories? ..<br />
<br />
I am mostly tanking mobs 66+ atm and the procs (75DD - Stun 0.0 (Mace) - 75DD Stun 0.0/65 (SoTB)) along with the DMG/Delay seem pretty equal so I will lileky get the MoM as it seems to be a bit cheaper than the BBC and better stats than the SoTB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to say that in offhand BB'sC = SM'sV &gt; MoM &gt; SotB and in mainhand BB'sC = SM'sV &gt; SotB &gt; MoM</div></div><hr />
