<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you don't care about damage/delay, what do you care about, aggro?  Since it has no proc you're basically looking at one slot (Anger 3 or Yak) versus whatever proc the weapon normally has.  Consider pretty much every War only weapon comes with Anger or Enraging Blow, this means epic 2.0 is less aggro than what a War only weapon would've been.<br />
<br />
So what's left, the AC/HP/shielding?  Get a shield.  It's going to go on your offhand anyway when next expanson's war only weapon comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rokkar</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why would you use a shield over this.  it has about 100 hp more than the MPG raid trial shield, 6% shielding and with the right aa's your offhand wont get riposted.  and shield block really isnt that good to replace this with a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naerron</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it has two aug slots, which mean it can hold two 600 agro procs, same as 1.5, 1.5 doesnt do a bad job, but the weapon isent the best agro out there so it is an accent weapon, but  the stats and 6% shieldin still make it nice in my book.  <br />
<br />
however, my point is, when i look at a weapon i look at dmg dly ratio last, because lets face it, warriors will never be DPS!<br />
<br />
also in response to a shield, most war i know who use shields ( my guild is only up to txevu) use shields for boss mobs only, but when just MAing i use both weps, and also i use both weaps for long fights or if i just dont feel like useing shield.<br />
<br />
and rokkar, you would use a shield over this because of new shield block AAs, its better than + 100 HP, and shield from time has 5% shielding, so its not that much of a huge downgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Consider this your uber shield.  70ac 6% shielding and almost 400 hps.  With right aa's you have 0 offhand ripostes.  This leaves you with a *shield* with high stats, high dps output, and a fuckton more aggro than Furious Bash 27 would ever have.<br />
<br />
Honestly put down the crack pipe.  Use your DBoTWL/BBB/next_uber_mainhand-only_angerproccing_badass-motherfucking_weapon in the mainhand and think of this to be what it is:<br />
<br />
The best damn offhanded weapon you'll ever see.  There were ceaseless complaints in the other expansions that there were no good offhanders for warriors past the EoE.  Now you have it ... toss 2 yaks (if stun is your bag) or 2 anger3's on it and go to town.</div></div><hr />

the only good point about this item is the possibility to use the effect from bag thus we will keep it always with us.</div></div><hr />

Big Congrats to whomever finished it first. I should have mine completed by 2009.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Seriously guys there should really be nothing for us to complain about this weapon except the fact that we didnt get it yet or finish it first. If the proc isn't good enough augment it with one that you like. If you want it to swing faster get the LDON aug that lowers the delay. If you want it to hit for more dmg get a Cleave 3 aug. More anger put two A3 augs on it. There is so much customization allowed in EQ nowadays you could make it anything you want. Hell even the idea of offhanding an uber shield with it awesome. <br />

<br />
Seeing Tacvi's Paladin Weapon &amp; MSC,  its safe to assume our class specific will be a 1H.<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22999<br />
Thus it is safe to assume, it will be ment to be used to replace BBB or DB or FB.<br />
My guess is Tacvi weapon will be a 55/30 with 400hp and a bit of shielding BBB 2.0<br />
<br />
<br />
2.0 Is really nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for now  epic 1.5  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60321) &lt;  epic 1.8  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60329) &lt; or &gt;  epic 2.0  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60332)<br />
because you can chain cast the 10% rune of the 1.8 to replace the 3% (or the 6%) shielding from epic 1.5 (or from epic 2.0). the only drawback of the epic 1.8 is the 'must equip' tag of the effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, a linear progress from PoP -&gt; GoD -&gt; OoW would create a 45/30 weapon with anger proc (without proc rate mod), not a 55/30.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reason people bitch is it was said these weapons would be near gamebreaking, and yet here we are with a great &quot;offhand&quot; weapon, sorry but this is a letdown.<br />
<br />
If this is what we're left with maybe it's time to attach Secondary to the DBotW/BBB/FB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True Yoda 45-50 dmg seems more accurate.<br />
<br />
Warrior :<br />
Time : 38/35  = 1.09<br />
Uqua : 35/30 =  1.16 <br />
Tacvi : 42/31 =  1.35<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Time : 41/25 = 1.64<br />
Txevu : 48/25 = 1.92<br />
OOW :  52/25 = 2.08<br />
Anguish : 71/32 = 2.22<br />
<br />
Seeing the INSANE ratios on OOW weapons (mudflation) paladins end up from 1.64 to 2.22<br />
(Which is a 35% Increase in ratio)<br />
<br />
Take the Fleshbiter 35/30 For base reference, 35x1.35 = 47.25<br />
Since Epic is already 45/30, the class weapon should be about the same, if not a bit better.<br />
<br />
Still this sword kicks ass just for the stats (i can live without the clicky)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">right Emilia, but I was using our weapons as reference :<br />
from a fully auged DBotW at max haste, max AA and no CE to a fully auged BBoB at max haste, max AA and no CE we have only 3% more hate generation !<br />
which is far from pal 's progress, that's why I assumed we would get a little increase again (3.5%) and calculated what kind of ratio we could expext with this little boost : 45/30</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really hope to see some aggro augs dropping from mobs.  Since augs are pretty much a requirement for this epic, I hope they give another option besides LDoN for finding them, and that it's possible to get something better than the LDoN augs (like an Anger proc aug).  LDoN sucks at 70 and will suck worse with each expansion, so I hope it doesn't continue to be the only option for aggro proc augs.  <br />
<br />
I think Emilia is right though, I think this is meant to be an offhander, and a Darkblade of the Warlord/Brutish Blade of Balance upgrade will probably drop in Anguish for mainhand.  I personally wouldn't get too worried about the delay.  Lower delay means less ripostes and the damage bonus doesn't mean what it did back when we were choosing between a jade mace and a frostbringer.<br />
<br />
Oh and...<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG this weapon is such a piece of crap.  It's worse than epic 1.0!  At least 1.0 had a proc OMG.<br />

<br />
Hell yeah.  One of my favorite graphics.<br />
<br />
I took a short break from EQ a while back between Luclin and PoP and messed with one of the EQ emulators.  Completely repopulating the dungeons differently, completely different drops, with my friends characters as the boss NPCs of the repopulated zones.  Anyway, enough with the history, the point is that Seru's sword looks really menacing as a dual wielded choice.  This would be one hell of a cool looking warrior epic set:</div></div><hr />

it was a very nice looking sword. i wish it was in game somewhere ( it prob is but i'm too far out of the loop to know these days )..<br />

<br />
Hmm, implying they are setting class dps values so precisely that a half-point of damage matters. So they must have some mathmatical formula saying SKs should do X dps and then they play with the weapon numbers to achieve exactly that output for some testing situation.<br />
<br />
Interesting, I wonder where each class falls in that calculation and where casters fit in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cleric epic is fantastic, but I also say this because I play a cleric!<br />
<br />
Divine Arbitration has probably saved your ass in groups more than you realize.  It can be a huuuuge heal to the tank if used properly, it'll never pull agro to the cleric, and it's almost instant cast!  A great way to complement Divine Arbitration is with, duh, a Paladin!  The epic does this all in a single click.   <br />
<br />
6% hate reduction seems like meh, but it's really not.  SCS for Clerics is total ownage.  It was literally a night and day difference for my cleric once she got SCS3.  The epic just makes it that much better, hehe.<br />
<br />
(But you know SoE will balance all future content around it! &gt;&lt;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venox</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Warrior Epic has bad ass particals on it. It is like the Red Blade but it has a white swirl that goes through the sword. Looks really good IMO.<br />
<br />
Also, Warrior epic is a lot better than SK epic. SK epic is 2HS and is only 50 more HP than the 1HS Warrior Epic. In terms of stats and mods, Warrior Epic 2.0 is clearly the winner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cleric epic click rivals the old cleric epic for usefulness.  It's more of a group tool than a raid tool, but with a 3 min recast well, just try grouping with a cleric with one.  If you have ever played a cleric you can imagine how useful it is to have a a group heal, a group cure, and dva with no spell slots needed and awesome stats.  Honestly, if that shield was 1 ac 1 hp 1 mana, my cleric would still equip it full time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do these new cleric epic clicks cause much aggro? They are indeed amazing, but can you still use them to heal the puller that comes back at 10% health, or is that just a death sentence? Normal group heals are crazy aggro, is this the same?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if its anything like original divine arbitration AA, then no it would not. Though I would guess there might be aggro from the heal portion, but thats just a guess.</div></div><hr />

DVA is no aggro, but with the group heal I would think that the shield click would have to have at least some.</div></div><hr />

Besides it looks cool hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clearly the answer to warrior aggro problems lies in the ability to use our incite line more often  :rolleyes:  .... you know ... because most of us use it like at least 3 or 4 times per fight  :rolleyes:  ...<br />
<br />
Besides it looks cool hehe<br />
<br />
And that's all that matters in the end eh?  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
If you want to tell the world how great it is then focus on the stats and dmg/delay.  The graphic sucks ass and the effect on it is laughable at best.  You've picked the 2 worst possible things to utilize in telling us how great and mighty it is.  Use your brain.<br />
<br />
