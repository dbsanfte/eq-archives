<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, 45th warrior here. I just wanted to see if I was on the right track so far with equipment, and get any possible upgrade suggestions. I have players I group with pretty regularly (48 druid, 49 cleric, 48 warrior, 47 paladin 50 mage). I am getting a velium fire wedding ring for my other ring slot soon, and was thinking of the 150 pt MM ldon armor to replace crafted BP (upgrade of 18 raw AC plus stats without losing HP). Could use suggestions on where to go from here. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1013952<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit* forgot to mention I only have about 1k pp, so anything that can be quested/bought with ldon points is probably most realistic<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're doing quite fine. You should be saving your moneys for fierce heraldic, it's the next step for you. You should start looking for a haste item, that will help you in the DPS/agro department. Other than that, just conintue to have fun, you're right were you need to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats on getting your eyepatch.  I never got mine, Stormfeather(?) wouldn't spawn for me.<br />
<br />
Your gear is good for your level.  I would not spend my hard-earned LDoN points on anything except Aggro augments.  You have tons of affordable bazaar upgrades possible.  But hate-proccing weapons are few and far between - but you can make your own.<br />
<br />
Your best armor upgrades will come from Kael Drakkal.  Cruise the bazaar to see if anyone is MQing the pieces.  Not as common any more.  If you're on Druzzil Ro, shoot me a tell and I'll give you some.<br />
<br />
I'd look to replace that +2 STA earring ASAP.<br />
<br />
But really, your gear is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spikela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Full agreement with Ahz. Your well on the track, and personally I'd say save those LDoN points for when they're useful (Anger augments, Ykesha augment, HIGH-end LDoN armor, etc.). Have you done any factioning in Velious? Thurgadin/Kael/Skyshrine armor is pretty darn good (mine's below par in the Elementals, but the helmet still looks amazing after customized and NDTd... but anyway) you'll use it for a LONG time, but people don't sell it much anymore. My best advice is to look up the Velious Quest Armor on Allakhazam and see if you can farm the Arena in Kael Drakkal (might be mentioned on your map, if not, ask), take the Corroded Plate drops, find the appropriate GEMS from the bazaar or somesuch (cost probably around 150-300pp a gem, need 3, so at this point you could afford 1 or two pieces) and do the turn in in Thurgadin. I'll help you farm some in the fall if you're on Fennin Ro.<br />
<br />
PS: If you can't farm Kael (probably hard at your level) you can hit places like Velketor's Lab to get the gem drops and work the quest in reverse (shout in bazaar you need corroded plate MQ etc.)<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tend to agree with the other responses; you're doing fairly well.<br />
Some random comments, starting with some stock suggestions:<br />
1. Start going to the bazaar at the end of every other session or so and spend a few minutes searching your armor slots one by one by race, religion, class, and AC. I'd key on AC, because you're getting to the point where you'll need more of it and most armor out there with good AC will also have other stats. Do one search for 0-500pp and one for 500-2000 pp. Start tracking prices and get a feel for the market on your server. Take notes.<br />
<br />
2. Your STA earring would be a good place to start looking for an upgrade.<br />
<br />
3. You don't list any other weapons that you might have. If the only weapons you have are 1H slash, you might want to work on finding useable stuff in other categories. My standard suggestion for 1H blunt is for you to go to Maiden's Eye. Stay near the zoneline and /ooc that you are looking for a goranga spiked club (primary only, 12 dam, 23 delay, AC+5, STR+2), if anyone is letting one rot (they're no-drop, and the folks fighting in this zone will have better weapons). You should get this weapon for free, and you could use it in primary and move your graverobber's to secondary. That would train 1HB and marginally improve your offhand ratio. And 1HB is good because eventually you'll probably want a Copper Hammer of Striking. Be very careful while you are in ME.<br />
<br />
3.A. For similar reasons, you might look around for a good 2HB. Before you can afford the droga one-hand weapons, you can get by in your late 50s with a Greatstaff of Thunder (2HB) for aggro. The Greatstaff of Thunder is not usable until (um, I think) level 56, but it costs only 100-400 pp and will hold aggro in the ballpark of weapon set ups that cost 10K+ plat. It's nice if your skill is trained up in 2HB, though the skill only influences the damage you actually do to the mob, not the aggro you generate.<br />
<br />
3B. You might look into the price on weighty polearms (2HS, 29 dam/34 delay, AC +15, AGI +15, Fire +10, hps +35). Haven't priced them since the recommended level fix, but they used to sell for less than 100 pp on my server.<br />
<br />
3C If you want to bother with piercing, check the prices on jarsath Tridents (1h piercing, pri/sec, 11 dam/22 delay; STR +5, DEX-5, STA +5, AGI -5). It's warrior-only and also used to go for well under 100 pp. The combination of piercing, warrior-only restriction, and the fact that it lowers DEX and AGI keep this weapon low in price. But it's fast (in fact, you would lose nothing in the aggro department by putting it in your mainhand and using the Graverobber's in the offhand) and until you start using proc-ing weapons the significance of -5 DEX is completely trivial. You can use this weapon until level 50 if you use all of the other tools available to you for aggro generation. Check recommended levels on all of these before you buy, since I haven't used these weapons since the fix.<br />
<br />
4. Cultural armor is going to be something you want to look into eventually. Start checking prices now to get a feel for what you need to save up for. It's going to be a while before you can afford it if you are getting all of your pp from fighting and farming. when you search the bazaar for your cultural armor, take note of who is selling it. Go to EQ Traders and check to see what the subcomponents are for this armor. If you can gather significant quantities of the subcomponents and can make friends with a smith, you might get this cheaper.<br />
<br />
5. Haste. You'll soon need some. Be prepared for sticker shock. there's a list of haste items in the library; start looking it over.<br />
<br />
6. while saving your LDoN points for the truly useful things (anger augs and top-end armor) is certainly the best plan long-term, you might find that the gothic armor isn't cutting it sometime before you can afford cultural armor. Some of the 150-point MM (Butcherblock) armor is a potential upgrade. There's a decided tradeoff here: that armor is not going to last you very long, and you already know how hard LDoN points are to accumulate at your level. But this is an option if around level 50 you start feeling like a lighter tank than you want to be and you're really broke.<br />
<br />
7. If you don't know how stat bonus food and drink work, find out. Then get some. Certainly use Halas 10-pound meat pies, as they're cheap and fairly common. Grobb Liquised meat is also often available and affordable.<br />
<br />
8. Rallic pack quest is something you *might* be able to do youself, if not now, then fairly soon. If you can get a buddy, so much the better. It's a nice bag. The grimling runner appears outside the Grimling caves in Ten. Mountains (be careful on the run out there). The perfect (I think it's &quot;perfect&quot;) owlbear pelt drops off owlbears in the owlbear caves in Shadeweavers, and both the run to Ten mnts. and the owlbear cave would probably be a lot safer for you with a friend or two along. But, research the quest, as the reward is useful and the quest is fun.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I'll think of more later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What LDOn's are you doing? If I were you I would do all the Takish and Everfrost LDON's<br />
The Takish plate is real spendy but if your doing alot of LDOn's its not that hard.  The anger 3 augs are in Everfrost. Like they said about the plate cycle in Kael. Vindi BP is great till you get ornate but if you get the takish  BP then  you wont need a BP till Elementals perhaps.<br />
Unless you get the Seru BP /drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Guy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the replies. As of now the only fierce herladic I've seen on my server tends to cost more than I have. BP has been running around 27k, with the lowest pieces (usually mask/cloak) running about 10k. I did triple my bank account recently though, sold dusty soriz boots for 1k and won my guild's drunken run for a prize of 1k, so I have about 3.2k right now. I do have a weight polearm, and did train piercing for a long while (used to use a blackened sand dagger). Still looking into 1 and 2 HB, might try the goranga spiked club sometime soon. Hopefully I can get into Kael and get some corroded drops soon, I guess I'll be saving my LDoN points (although I am only two adventures from the MM BP).<br />
