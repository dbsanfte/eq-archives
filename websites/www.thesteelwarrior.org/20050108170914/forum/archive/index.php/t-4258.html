<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok step one: eliminate warrior class. <br />
<br />
Step two: give paladin's defensive, and SK's evasive, just to you know, mix it up abit.<br />
<br />
Step three: on patch day, upon logging into your warrior you're presented with a box.  It is a simple box, filled with 2 choices: Paladin, and Shadowknight.<br />
You choose one, it becomes your class, you automatically recieve a bonus of EVERY spell up to your current level and, eh 100 free AA's.  And all war only gear is changed to paladin SK, and weapons like the blood frenzy and the Cord hilted spike driver, they're changed to proccing SUPER COOL ANIMATION -- does nothing, but looks hot.  oh and their ratio's are raised to, I don't know 175/18 for both weps.<br />
<br />
This solves all problems, now you don't need any of the other classes, just Paladin, and Shadowknight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Always enjoyed the idea of of a warrior monk. Hey a guy can dream...</div></div><hr />

Nope, when they reclass me, they can make me a beastlord, and I'll be breathing down the necks of the knights who howled the choice epithets along the lines of  &quot;The game is balanced, warriors are obsolete&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Evolve, and persevere. Darwin knew it.<br />
<br />
But if I was to be a Berserker; I better be able to change into a werebear.</div></div><hr />

If that music follows me everywhere, I really won't be able to ever find a group again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an idea. Let pure melees(and only pure melees) multiclass.  Let me pick up say.....40 levels of shaman in addition to being a warrior.  Hell let me pick up 24 levels of shaman, that'll be enough for me.  Of course, just combining all the melees into one class has merit too.  If I could backstab, feign, evade, mend, dragon kick, and still wear plate and have warrior hps and gear, I wouldn't care who was tanking in the raid mob. :)</div></div><hr />
