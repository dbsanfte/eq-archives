<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does having a 36/41 pct haste item as opposed to a 27 make any significant difference as far as MAing goes?  I know theres an increase in DPS, but was wondering whether theres a noticeable difference in aggro control.<br />
<br />
I currently have a RBG and was wondering whether its time i upgraded it. If so, should i pick up a spiked seahorse belt at 50k or plumb for something like a CoF at 60k?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macnair</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes at lvl 63 it will make a differnce.   You should hold agro better and do more DpS.  I got a 36 haste and it was a big upgrade for me at 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference is there but its not that huge .<br />
It actually rather minimal fully buffed.<br />
<br />
*** Without haste buff ***<br />
No haste DPS = 100<br />
RBG DPS = 127<br />
CoF DPS = 136<br />
<br />
RBG -) CoF = +7% DPS<br />
<br />
*** With Shissar 66% haste ***<br />
No haste DPS = 166<br />
RBG DPS = 193<br />
CoF DPS = 200<br />
<br />
RBG -) CoF = +3.6% DPS<br />
<br />
If you are worrying about MAing (thus fully buffed ?) then no.<br />
The gain in way too minimal to spend money on that. Better buy Armor/Weapons.<br />
<br />
I have a 41% haste, and i know i could do my job as well with a 27%.<br />
Why ? Because fully buffed, the difference is minimal at best.<br />
(Non existant if u have bigger than Shissar haste buffs)<br />
<br />
Ps: Dont get me wrong, there is an upgrade 36% &gt;&gt; 27%.<br />
But if you worry about fully buffed situations. <br />
Then no its not worth the PP.<br />
<br />
Ps 2: CoF + Putrid Belt is a totally awesome combo.<br />
You will be able to keep it for a LONG LONG LONG TIME.<br />
But its gonna be very very expensive.</div></div><hr />

This is always having vallon on to...maybe it was just my imagination?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll run some parses and see.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i believe SoV is 76% haste so any 24% haste item will put you at max. high end haste is therefore only good when you dont got an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The highest chanter haste you can get is 68% (SoV and VQ), so depending on what you believe max haste without a bard is (100% or 105%) then you need either 32% or 37% worn haste to hit the max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah, it is 68% on SoV, ppl did a bunch of testing to determine max haste at 60 was 100%, maybe its 105 at 65 but i havent seen anyone prove or post it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO a 2% increase in damage is, well.. 1/50 more damage than you would be doing otherwise.<br />
<br />
What you really need to look at the the stats of the items, forget about the haste, they cancel out.<br />
<br />
For comparison's sake, I use a Cloak of Greater Pernicity and a Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
CoF<br />
10ac 50hp 9dex 9agi 15svF<br />
<br />
Putrid Belt<br />
13ac 65hp 10dex 10agi 10svD<br />
23ac 115hp 19dex 19agi 15svF 10svD<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
CoGP<br />
12ac 50hp 10sta 25str<br />
<br />
SSHB<br />
10ac 25hp 4sta 4str 4dex 4agi 1svALL<br />
22ac 75hp 14sta 29str 4dex 4agi 1svALL<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
23ac 115hp 19dex 19agi 15svF 10svD<br />
vs<br />
22ac 75hp 14sta 29str 4dex 4agi 1svALL<br />
<br />
CoF/PBoRH: 1ac 40hp 15dex 15agi 14svF 9svD<br />
CoGP/SSHB: 14sta 29str 1svM, 1svC, 1svP<br />
(the stats above is what each combo has over the other combo. IE, cof/pborh has 23ac and the cogp/sshb has 22, so 1ac is listed for the cof/pborh)<br />
<br />
We'll say you're 60, and get 6hp/sta. (giving 84 hp from the belt)<br />
<br />
CoF/PBoRH: 1ac 15dex 15agi 14svF 9svD<br />
CoGP/SSHB: 44hp 29str 1svM, 1svC, 1svP<br />
<br />
The 15agi is about 3ac. Giving the top combo ~5 more AC than the bottom. (~5 because sometimes items say 10ac yet you gain 14 or something like that). We'll say that 5ac = 14hp.<br />
<br />
So, here you have it, with the stats fully weighed out:<br />
<br />
CoF/PBoRH: 15dex 14svF 9svD<br />
CoGP/SSHB: 30hp 29str 1svM, 1svC, 1svP<br />
<br />
Note: the 29str bonus could quite possibly make or overtake the dps difference of the 2% haste you wouldn't have using the cogp/sshb combo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for that. id prob still prefer the cof combo for the higher raw hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is an inherent flaw in comapring raw HP and HP from STA. The problem is that you have to take into consideration the fact that any STA that takes you over the cap is wasted. You also have to consider that you can get 60-80 STA from buffs as well. For any warrior that is within range to max STA with buffs, they will net LESS HP buffed with the CoGP/SSHB combo. In the case of my warrior, I would have 40 more HP with the CoF/PBoRH combo.<br />
<br />
With the realitive ease of getting STA maxed with all of the new gear available, I would say that in the long run raw HP &gt; STA even if you are not yet at the cap.</div></div><hr />
