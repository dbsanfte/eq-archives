<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I decided to take my ldon party consisting of me + assorted casters on an assasination mission in Guk.  Everything went fine until it was time to pull the named.  Once the named got to camp I was promptly rooted (with 236 MR), and forced to watch helplessly as the 800s hitting mob raped the rest of the party.<br />
<br />
One more reason to bring a knight vs a warrior to ldon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One more reason to scream rooted the moment it happens and to warn oure party to watch aggro. Sometimes we spend to much time thinking our class sucks to do the right thing. As soon as youre rooted you should let youre party know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Danca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are rooted, and the mob is on others, tell them to come to you.  It is your responsibility to communicate when you are rooted (or slowed or dotted or whatever).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, lots of healer classes have the RC aa which can help.  Soon as your rooted just ask for RC, will almost always cure it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, I yelled &quot;IM ROOTED!&quot; all right.  But the cleric was too busy trying to DA &amp; the shaman trying to patch heal.  When you have a mob hitting casters in the 800 range, things happen fast.  There was absolutely no way to control the situation under those circumstances.  The average geared cleric is not going to be able to tank that mob long enough to bring it over to you all while hoping it doesnt ping pong to the shaman trying to slow it.  There is NO FUCKING amount of GD communication in the world to make up for 5 casters dropping like damn flies.  If I were a paly stunning the crap out of it I am sure it would have been a very different ending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Danca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it was really dropping them that fast, low health aggro would have kept it away from you no matter how fast you stunned.  Stuns aren't THAT powerful.  (trust me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It takes 1.5 seconds to cast a stun.  Not only would it have drawn agro, but it would have possibly given the casters time to react.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wudgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds like a lot of others really dropped the ball after you was rooted.  Casters could have very easily ran the mob to you.</div></div><hr />

.It takes 1.5 seconds to cast a stun. Not only would it have drawn agro, but it would have possibly given the casters time to react <br />
<br />
Not sure where you got the idea of you being rooted any anything different than from a knight being rooted.  Not too sure bout SKs but im willing to bet they can agro mobs to them.  No, paladins cant agro a mob to them.  We can stun mobs, but that doesnt mean they're we're gonna get mobs agro.  If that mob was hitting that hard unslowed they would need more than a 3-4 second stun to save them (assuming no fizzles/resists).  I probably wouldve said bring mob to me or EVAC lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My frame of reference comes from playing an SK.  Maybe I should have use that class as an example, I just assume paly stun agro would be the same.  On my SK I can pull a mob with slow agro from across the room with a single cast of clinging darkness.  Being a knight in that situation would have at least given me some options for gaining back agro from beyond melee distance.  As a warrior I suppose I could have plinked arrows into it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Instead of screaming 'I'm rooted' because there was nothing else he could do, as soon as he WAS rooted he'd have started casting aggro spells immediately,  if he was on the ball and not too unlucky with fizzles the mob'd not be unoccupied long enough to get started on the casters before he regained it's attention. <br />
<br />
Fairly obvious I'd have thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ok 5 caster in group? did not one of them have a root spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ok 5 caster in group? did not one of them have a root spell?<br />
<br />
Probably one of them did.  But here is the difference.  If a Knight is rooted, and is on the ball, then they have things they can do to salvage the situation based on their reaction and abilities.  If a Warrior is rooted, and is on the ball, all they can do is communicate the fact to their group and hope someone else has the reactions and abilities necessary to salvage the situation.<br />
<br />
One is active, the other passive.  One counts on their own wits and reactions, while the other has to stand there like a bump on a log and count on someone else's wits and reactions.  And I don't know about you, but I find that when in a pickup group having to count on someone else's wits and reactions is often times a formula for disappointment and frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No snare poop eh?  Snare poop woulda prolly brought teh mob to ya, or a stun idol...<br />
<br />
Didya at least shoot the fucker with a few arrows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sitting down has worked for me in the past when I was rooted, but it has to be done quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Or you could use a Pumice Stone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;Not only would it have drawn agro&quot;<br />
<br />
Stun wouldn't get a mob off someone with low hp aggro.  If the mob was stunnable at all (most of the bosses in LDoN aren't), it would have prevented some damage for a few seconds, but it wouldn't have drawn aggro if a member was already frenzied on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Stuns or other aggro means at range so the mob didn't start in on the casters at all was the premise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually, an Egg Shaped Pumice would have been perfect since it's an instant. However like Swollen Fungusbeast Glands it can't be vendor recharged (costs too much) as it would give Warriors a useful tool and thats not allowed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think you did the only thing you could really.  When you're rooted and the mobs go running off ahead of you to the casters, there's not much any warrior can do unless they happen to be carrying a Totem or any other charged agro clicky.  <br />
<br />
In a most optimal situation, what probably would have happened is at least one of your casters would have died.  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about that.  Casters simply do not live long against a quad 800 hitter.  But if they're smart and act fast, they'll all move to you so you can start hitting the damn thing again.  <br />
<br />
This is also part of the reason my most successful and flexible groups have consisted of multiple tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What I have noticed about LDoN &quot;bosses&quot; (ie assassination missions) is that they're USUALLY hasted. Have somebody pull the boss with annul and they're not nearly as much of a problem as they would be otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sirulus Delon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">First time user, first time poster. My main is a mage, my secs are Rogue and Monk. As a mage I have enough sense to see tank rooted, me with agro then run to the tank and stand there so she/he can get agro back. If I die, I die. Heh no biggie (buffed with group buffs I can get about 4.3k hp so I should live long enough. I have lived through the Ancient of the Trees' Rampage 2 times, I have lived through Auliffe's Quad...). Those who dont help i.e. running around the dungeon because a mob is hitting them, are usually an extension of the problem caused by rooting. I learned long ago to just stand still and pray/die. Also another poster has mentioned the sitting effect. That works tons as a few times my Rogue has had to tank and the only way to keep agro was proccing weapons, and sitting.<br />
<br />
All in all, based on your postings, I would say that the casters were in heavy fault here as well. I go out of my way to make sure I dump agro on the tank lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">LDoN bosses in level 65 Normal dungeons are over level 65.  The only way a Paladin can stun that mob (and actually stun it) is with the Divine Stun AA.  Divine stun is a short, low aggro stun, so there would be no 4 – 6 seconds for others to figure out what happened because of a Paladin stun.  Also, Divine Stun has quite a few pre-requisite AA, and most Paladins don't get it until the 100 – 150 AA mark.  I have 50 AA, and no Divine Stun, for example.<br />
<br />
When I pull LDoN bosses, I use Nullify Magic, and follow up with a stun as the mob gets close to camp to solidify aggro.  In this situation, it looks like you were rooted while the mob was still at his spawn point, or at least only partially on his way toward you.  If casters were to cast on the mob before I dropped the stun on it, or overcast before I got a second stun off, it is quite likely they would have drawn aggro too.  If one of them got hit enough to get into low HP territory it would be over for that squishy.  But most likely I would have regained aggro after that.<br />
<br />
I do agree that the Warrior is in a bit of a helpless situation here.  About all you can do is to let folks know you are rooted, remind them to come to you, fire off AE Taunt (if they come to you), sit, and pray.  Not much.  As a Paladin, my first thought would be to root the mob, then continue stunning it to gain/hold aggro until my root or the mob's root wore off; a much more active role.<br />
<br />
A LDoN assassination boss is actually a situation where a Warrior's increased mitigation and /defensive do matter though.  I have been smacked down three times by LDoN boss mobs, out of the 9 I have tanked. (By boss I mean the Assasinate target, not normal LDoN named)  A Warrior with comparable gear and AA to me would probably been able to survive, especially if they activated /defensive.  By and large I have to agree with Warriors who say the difference in Warrior AC/HP/Mitigation/DPS does not make up for the Paladin's spells, especially when mudflation has made it that almost every experience mob is tankable by Paladins as easily as by Warriors.  This is just an example of where Warrior's advantages are valuable.<br />
