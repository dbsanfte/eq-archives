<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been having fun with groups in PoP, but my playtimes suck so I do much better 2-boxing with my 54 cleric. Just got fed up with Velks and was looking for a zone that'll get decent xp at my level.<br />

Any ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your magelo would definatley help. If you dont mind geting key then HS would be pretty sweet at your level till 60 or PoJ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, at 56 you might be best heading back to a Kunark zone like Chardok or HS and killing in there. Veksar might be an option as well. Otherwise, PoJ or PoI might be decent. PoN and PoD trash could be another option, though I'd think it'd be a tad too tough for you.</div></div><hr />

I also have a 65 druid and a 62 shammy to buff with, but am trying to level cleric to get him up a bit, hence 2-box with clr and not druid :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agreed on the above recommendations.  Get your HS keys and go profit from that excellent zone sooner, not later.  Although you can find sections of HS that are blue to 65 nowadays, you will not want to be there much beyond 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In the rare times I haven't been in a group I have boxed yard trash with my cleric in PoN, pretty decent XP there and easy to get single pulls.  Just pull trees, ravens, and spiders.  If to the left of zone is open pull there, to the right is decent as well.  If you get two just pop defensive and try to keep both mobs on you, I find that is easier than trying to root park with cleric.  You'll have a really hard time dealing with two mobs.  You might have better luck in PoI, but I haven't tried there.<br />
<br />
However, I am level 59, cleric is 58, so we are a little higher level, but with your gear you should still be able to handle it.  I also use a ToD for slow, else I get beat up and cleric is healing A LOT which makes for more downtime.  If you don't have, get a ToD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would stick to the old world zones over PoP until they go light blue on you.  The exp is decent in PoP but the HP on the mobs is very high.  You will probably find you get more exp per hour in one of the pre-pop zones with exp modifiers due to the increased number of kills you can make.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it.  XP modifiers are so much higher in PoP that going anywhere else for XP usually doesn't compare.  He might be able to get a few levels faster in some old world zones, but I seriously doubt it.  I have tried boxing old world zones like Droga, Veksar, Seb, but the xp is just better in PoP.  Loot sucks tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of the zones you have listed are anything special in terms of xp. If you want good xp check out Hole, HS, Veleks. Then come back and we can argue about this.<br />
<br />
By the way try Hole too. Althought I just dont know how it is after the rewamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PoP might have high experience mods, but with a mid 50s duo of cleric and warrior he might have trouble killing them while keeping mana up. PoP mobs hit HARD compared to old world mobs. At any rate, he can check it out and see how the experience is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I 2-box a cleric/war also and this is what Ive found.  PoJ jail area is pretty good exp and the mobs drop spells and diamonds.  Also might want to try Dulak.  Just head to one of the ships.  Easy single pulls with no surprises.  Seb is always fun because its empty nowadays.  I just got back from there and even at 62 made decent exp.  PoJ jail area would be my first pick though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd personally recommend some of the &quot;new&quot; hotspot zones. I believe the level 50ish options are crypt of nadox and the torgiran mines. If those are too hard, go to dulaks harber. You can do the temp spell quest there too if you don't have it already.<br />
<br />
They're easy to get to now that there's a book in gunthak. I went down there last night to help some level 49 friends of mine, and most of nadox was red cons to them, and light blue to me. Torgirans was a little tougher. They seemed to think the xp was very good.<br />
<br />
I believe the ZEM is supposed to be around 180 (like pal cav), compared to 144 for pop, and 100 or less for old world zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PoP might have high experience mods, but with a mid 50s duo of cleric and warrior he might have trouble killing them while keeping mana up.

<br />
I was boxing war cleric when war was 58 and cleric was 57.  Cleric had a horse and KEI and warrior had ToD for Slow.  With FT3 and KEI I never had mana problems with my cleric.  In fact I could throw in a nuke here and there, pull non-stop, and never had mana problems with PoN yard trash.  Only trouble was when I got two mobs, and then I just popped furious/defensive, and was totally fine tanking both.<br />
<br />
It's not like this guy has crap gear and is going to be getting the crap beat out of him.  He's got super twink gear for his level, with Temp and Kizrak buff he's going to be pushing 1350ish AC and well over 5k HPS.  With those kinds of stats, even in the mid 50's, PoN yard trash is not going to be that difficult.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I don't believe the xp modifiers in the Hole or HS are that much higher than Droga or Veksar, so I seriously doubt the XP is going to be any better there.  Plus the HS key quest will take a bit of time for both chars for what, 2-3 levels of xp'ing?  I've xp'd a bunch in the Hole, and sure it's good xp, but it really isn't much better than Droga/Veksar.  In fact, you have to fight through quite a few green/low blue mobs to get to the decent xp in your mid 50's.<br />
<br />
I concur with the other poster also, PoJ jail area should be great xp as well, stay back in the corner and pull the hall, pacify to get singles and that should be great xp.  Haven't tried boxing there, but I know xp was great in groups down there and the gems and parchments are also nice.  Might be tough boxing there though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PoJ jail is what I did with my war/cleric at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Oron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In the jail area there are Punishers and Executioners.  Punishers flurry and Executioners rampage.  They dont hit as hard as PoN trash, so I would definitely give it a try.<br />
<br />
And the book in PoK to go to Gunthak is next to the Paineel stone.  It poops you out on the bow of the ship thats docked near the lighthouse.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the thing is in previous expansion zones mobs are very weak comparing to PoN so while you killing one in PoN and have to slow it. In old word you may be able to kill 2 and start on third.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There is more to XP than just the ZEM.  It is generally more profitable XP to plow through easy mobs nonstop than to struggle through hard mobs slowly.  For example, mobs in the HS are weaker than same-level mobs in Sebilis.  Mobs in Veksar (beyond the entry area) are generally much easier than same-level mobs in PoJ.  The same is true of Nadox vs. PoJ, and Torigiran vs. PON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks for all your help, I've headed down to Nadox to get my cleric up to lvl 56. Xp is pretty good there and i'm killing them reasonably quickly, the main this i'm just getting my 2hb up from about 130 to 230. I know, I know, I should've kept them all maxed :)<br />
<br />
I'll prolly then head to PoN as with Virtue I'm running about 1390AC and nearly 6k hps. Only problem is I may need to keep a chanter on hand for haste.<br />
<br />
If I was to get haste off a friend, which haste has the longest duration ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help<br />
<br />
Dak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Another place that I found to be really good at that lvl is Chardok entrance to the fort. Plenty of mobs to be killed and very easy.</div></div><hr />
