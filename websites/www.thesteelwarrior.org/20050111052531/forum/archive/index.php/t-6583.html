<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slovack</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct me if im wrong, but its against the rules of SoE to purchase items/Plat from places like Yantis. With penalties up to and including banning of acounts, right or wrong?<br />
<br />
If in fact this is correct, why then does SoE allow Yantis to stay in buisness and not find some way to shut them down as this is a clear violation of a pay to play game.<br />
If this is correct, im guessing that SoE has there hands in the kettle over at Yantis to allow this to happen? Maybe some type of kickback or commision.<br />
<br />
Personally i've never bought Plat/items, i've worked for them, but it stands to say that SoE has some kind of understanding with Yantis. Afterall its money, and money talks BS walks.<br />
<br />
<br />
I may be wrong on this whole deal, thats just my conseption of it. If im wrong SUE ME....lol  :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the simplest reason for why they look the other way regarding this kind of business is this:<br />
Him and the people like him, keep this game going, and going, and going, like the energizer bunny. By reselling old accounts, those accounts never die. SOE never loses that money, as they remain active and paid for. People leave the game, but subscriptions stay high.<br />
<br />
So yeah, people like that break the rules. But SOE's not gonna crack down on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's had accounts banned, tons of them. The problem is it's not a hobby to him. It's a business. When you're pulling in 6 figure income from your business, you'll pay for more than 1 copy of a game.<br />
<br />
Not to mention when you're getting that kind of cash, you can get a good lawyer...and would have a hell of a time winning in court.</div></div><hr />

So he is legit.  I don't like it more than anyone else but that is the truth.   <br />
<br />
   The only way SOE can stop him is by doing a complete wipe of all money in the game,  then make all coin no drop and can only be used sell to merchants, and flag all gear as no drop that is the only way.  Will never happen the masses would bitch and moan.</div></div><hr />

But if they have a different type of EULA, I do not know.</div></div><hr />
