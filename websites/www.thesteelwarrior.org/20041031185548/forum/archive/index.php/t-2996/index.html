<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Curly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My current weapon setup is either BoC/Blackout for aggro and TSBS for dps.<br />
<br />
I am currently trying to decide whether to go 1HS or 2HS after adding Force of the Yakasha to the above weps.<br />
<br />
On one hand, adding a 125dd plus 0 sec stun to both 1HS should increase aggro to a noticable degree but will only have a marginal increase in DPS.<br />
<br />
Adding the proc to the TSBS may make using 2HS a viable alternative for MT'ing as the DPS is already very good but crap for aggro atm with no proc.<br />
<br />
Few things to consider..<br />
<br />
Am currently guildless and the weapons are all i will have for the forseeable future and will therefore be used in LDoN or to xp grind in SolRo/PoE/PoF.<br />
<br />
Have both defensive and offensive AAXP maxed.<br />
<br />
I suppose what im looking for is which setup will give me the best all round performance in a non raid enviroment where both DPS and solid aggro are required.<br />
<br />
Also considering upgrading a long since banked Claw of Lightning as 14/18 with a nice proc would kick ass, only downside i can see is the loss of hp.<br />
<br />
Just looking for opinions really as its still a little to early for parsed results to hit the boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd go with 1 handers, never entered a dungeon yet (school, then as servers we brought down wer killed a lot) so im not too sure but i think you can remove the augs from items and switch them around, so try 1 handers with that stun aug see aggro then try out TSBS with aug.<br />
But EB + stun has to be huge aggro...<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: or you just might not keep the aug is you remove it from the item it was in, not sure about that :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KhalimBloodhelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also wanted to do this to my BoC, Curly.  BoC with hate proc AND DD/Stun would be an awesome friggin DPS weapon.  <br />
<br />
I'd go with the 1hers for aggro, they will still do ok DPS.  More stats as well.  TSBS is sorely lacking on those.  <br />
<br />
You can remove augments, but when you do, the augments dissappear.  So you lose em.  One question, where do you find this force of the Ykesha proc augment and how much does it cost??  I really want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Curly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oop's ...<br />
<br />
Force of the ykesha - type 4 - 760 a pop from deepest guk, tad expensive but worth the effort methinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wymp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Force of Ykesha is listed as being at part of the Guk camp for 760 points.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What is the cheapest stun aug ? i mean the dd part of it isnt really important... of course it's a few more dps but what really will get you aggro when you disc is the stun part of it...<br />
But if there is lets say a 0 or very low dd and stun will it proc just as much as high versions of it or the better ones proc more often than the cheaper ones ?<br />
Might as well save points for hp augs since stun is stun :)<br />
Just a thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">does anyone think the yak effect would be worth putting on a faster 2h weapon, like a WMBS?</div></div><hr />
