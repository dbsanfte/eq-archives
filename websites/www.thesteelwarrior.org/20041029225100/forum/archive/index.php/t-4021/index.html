<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Master_race(tm)</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone notice a trend in a particular theme for a more common drop rate of the +12 hp augs?<br />
<br />
I would like to get one for my BP and have had no luck. I have yet to see one drop, yet I know they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think there is a common theme, they are just rare.  If you get one, i'd recommend putting it on an armor slot that won't support the 40hp augs.  I put one on an earring for instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">12hp drop augs are now type 7, as such they won't fit in your LDoN bp. Pre-nerf 12hp augs would have tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>azon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only place ive got this aug has been in mistmoore, group was all over 61 iirc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ear slot will take type7 20hp/mana augment (ooze-covered pebble). Bracer/gloves won't take the solid coal of prowess or ooze-covered pebble of perfection, though.<br />
<br />
BTW I've seen 3 of the 12hp augments drop total through friggin bucketloads of adventures, 1 went to a caster, 1 to a hybrid, and 1 to a warrior. I've seen tons of 12manas drop, of course. /grumble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got my +12hp aug in Mistmoore as well.  I think my +8hp aug was from Guk with the same group, but I can't be sure on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apocaly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For those who are wanting to change your +12 or +15 hp type 7 augs to type 8,  there is NPC in South Ro camp that will change them.  He will change a perfect/pristine garnet of constitution into a radiant crystal/garnet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BattleaxTN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Around 250 LDoN Adventure,  saw 2 hp 12 aug dropped (Both from Everfrost, but ALL themes drop it)<br />
ONe went to Ranger, one went to a shaman but he let me loot.<br />
<br />
It's seems so rare, and the chance to win is more rare. To me, it's<br />
2/250 * 1/6= 0.133% to get a hp 12,15 aug in a full group.<br />
<br />
And for all slots, seems only BRACER no HP/AC aug u can buy and put there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i saw my first 12hp aug on my 100th adventure in Takish theme. I was lucky enough to win it and put it on my earring. unfortunately i had to get rid of my nice Cha aug :(<br />
<br />
for bracers i threw a vengence 4 item on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">it's all random, I've seen four and only done 24 adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And for all slots, seems only BRACER no HP/AC aug u can buy and put there <br />
<br />
Add hand slot to the list of &quot;no hp/ac aug available for purchase.&quot;<br />
