<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As some of you may remember absor was at the question and answer irc chat prior to the release of gates.  At this chat he promised us a game play discussion forum on the eqlive sight.  He was very clear that this was going to be implemented.  After inquiring about this,  this is what occured.<br />
<br />
Brutall &quot;where are the new game discussion forums absor promised us durring the question and answer session before the release of gates? &quot;<br />
<br />
Brenlo &quot;I am fairly sure Absor was not even in the live chat.<br />
 <br />
Patience is a virtue . . .<br />
 <br />
Brenlo the Patient&quot;<br />
<br />
So from this i gather brenlo has no idea that this is planed or promised to us and that I am impatent for waiting a over 2 months before even asking about the foums.   I think any rational PR person would say &quot;I'll look into it&quot;  or something,  hell just don't reply, blow me off but don't write incorrect information and THEN tell me to be patient about something that is long over due.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think what he really meant was that Absor should've kept his mouth shut instead of promising a forum like that. They haven't liked 1-on-1 discussions about this game since the original boards. They much prefer the highly filtered and ever quiet Dev boards to having to answer everyone.<br />
<br />
On a side note, if you really want them to answer your questions all you have to do is become a loud suck-up on TNZ, and they will get right on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok I asked and I got this......<br />
<br />
We're sorry, but you have been banned from using this site.  <br />
<br />
ok Here is a quick recap...<br />
<br />
[Brenlo] Smed any word on community message boards for EverQuest?<br />
[Smed] Absolutely. We are going to be reopening the EverQuest community boards on a MUCH broader basis in the near future<br />
[Smed] and the Devs will be around daily to answer questions on these boards<br />
[Smed] and they will be free<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Brenlo and tech support people are not developers imo.  Then I asked  about it on the message board and developers posting or the lack theirof.....he bans me!!!!  So the moral of the story is,  Brenlo is always right on the soe message boards and you will get baned for posting uncomplimentary information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You got the loud part, but not the suck-up part heh. After the 2nd or 3rd thread you may have been better off waiting a bit before asking again. Sorry you got banned though. Was kinda harmless and straight forward questions you were asking. They just weren't going to answer it in that forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Torinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You mean forums like these?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No I'm talking about a game discussion forum where if for example, you step into a zone like uqua and it's a total disaster and your having all types of problems and things are not working,  you can post about them.  Their is no forum like that.</div></div><hr />
