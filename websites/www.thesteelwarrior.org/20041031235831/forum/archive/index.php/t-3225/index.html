<br />
(Check my magelo...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OMG any body know if they really are putting the DE mask to all/all???</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Is Guts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can o' Whoop Ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm... time to see if the BFG quest can be done again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My guild did this GM event last night.  We had 2 of our guild members taken hostage by an Insane Imp... and he drug them from zone to zone in SoV and I think RoK.  Finally after moving 3 zones or so, he stopped and awarded a bunch of people loot.  I think he handed out something like 10-20 items.<br />
<br />
They included:<br />
<br />
Guise of the Deceiver<br />
Rubicite armor (all pieces, some useless ones like boots, etc given to wizards, boggle)<br />
Box of Abu'kar<br />
<br />
There were no Manastones awarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bladestorm!!! OMG, I don't care if it sucks, I want one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What a piece of crap gimmick.  Is there anything that's even worth having that's been taken out of the game?<br />
<br />
I've got a full set of Rubicite on my bazaar mule cleric that's worthless to sell, only reason i've kept it.  It's not even good twink armor anymore.<br />
<br />
The manastone works in about 6 zones now, so that's complete shit.<br />
<br />
The Guise has been made totally obsolete by Project Illusion.<br />
<br />
Bladestorm?  Pff.  Earthshaker is where it's at.  <br />
<br />
I'm can't remember anything else that would even be worth an hour of my time to get.</div></div><hr />

I'd like the mask though ;-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd love some holgresh elder beads or a BFG =p  Though I doubt that they'll give those out.  Guise would be nice just for fun.</div></div><hr />

It works great for LDoN adventures. You can use them just outside all the dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, druids and wizards have been using them since Kunark came out because they can just port back to the old world, stone down and gate to where they were, and with the advent of PoK, I'd wager it got even easier to use a stone for most people.  It's still rather low on the usefulness scale these days.  How long you gotta click a stone to fill up a 6k mana cleric? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I want some Holgresh Beads and a BFG just like Hussar</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I said how long dammit..not how many times :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's insta-click, so it'll take however long it takes to click and not die. With a bot healer, it might take a few minutes; without a bot healer, you're better off medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Clerics can Med to full in under a minute with a 6k Mana pool.<br />
<br />
Remember the 400 mana for Complete Heal is about 20 clicks.<br />
<br />
That is only 1200 Hit Points.<br />
<br />
All other hps above that are free mana.<br />
<br />
A buffed cleric with a 6k mana pool can easily get to 5000-6000 or more hps.<br />
<br />
That is 4800 hit points or 1600 mana. <br />
<br />
At that rate, it only takes about 4 Complete Heals to get full up.<br />
<br />
That is 40 seconds.<br />
<br />
You can click the hell out of that stone too. I have one still and it basically can drain 4000-5000 hit points in about 4 or 5 seconds :)<br />
<br />
Manastones are the bomb. They weren't that unbalancing nowadays with AA's and FT, etc...<br />
<br />
They should un-nerf the little bastards :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">the old war only hammer that was the only thing worth getting 2hb skill up before RoK was released. it was like FA level in the old days like supper uber. i think it was even better damage delay then FA.</div></div><hr />

so is like the assasin in guk dropping a DE mask useable by all this week ?  Nope - they're only being handed out at GM events.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Aye, manastone rocks for clerics. It's like canni, except they can self-buff to 5k+ (my clerics hits 4.5k and he's not even uber) and CH. The fact that it's instaclick makes it even easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'd love if they handed out Shroud of Longevity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Kinda sucks that some of the old items like the guise of the deceiver were kinda proof that you had been around for ever . Now it means nothing.<br />
<br />
Mofu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">so was haveing the blued two handed hammer till they got around to fixing the quest.<br />
<br />

<br />
i mean 34 damage 43 delay in seriously old eq was totaly way over the top awsom!!!!!!!! warriors prayed ate slept dreamed about getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Tonight after leading an Open Kael raid (whew, hard work) I heard there was some commotion in LoIO. I arrived to see a few named bloodgills running around on the shore, obviously GM controlled.  Then a water dragon (like the one in TD, but bigger) popped out of the lake!<br />
<br />
Well, after a good hour of figuring out how to kill them (a low level player had to get inside a building a kill a certain mob before the rest could be killed), I ended up with a Blade of the Black Dragon Eye (14/24 1HS and Envenomed Breath Proc)!  While I was there with my Monk, it'll make a great addition to my weapons for my 39 warrior I'm working on now.<br />
<br />
Very cool!  Good Karma I guess for dealing much death to the giants in Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Got me a pre-nerf Dark Elf illusion mask, clickable from inventory.<br />

This is why GM events are inherently flawed. People should get crap they can actually use, not something for their twinks for something to sell in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">yep last one i was it i was participate and doing good then bam i couldnt fight anymore. turns out people logged on the 40,50 twinks and the gm adjusted the level to match the people working on the event. so after beating on ungodly hp scarecrow for 15 min. i no longer got to play. add to that people wern't rewarded for participation they were awarded for being the first to ninja the corpse.<br />
<br />
i defintly had fun at the time, but in hindsight i could have worked on sence heading or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/boggle...<br />
<br />
Actually, I could have brought down my Warrior (who's more than an alt...I play on FV so it's a whole separate account) but I happened to be on my monk when it happened, so I just ran him down, not knowing what to expect.  This event was anything but flawed.  The mobs weren't too high in level, and it even required a lower level player to finish the encounter, who was awarded a nifty gnome illusion mask if I remember correctly.  <br />
<br />
So I'd say the weapon is definitely something I'd use for quite a while, not something I plan on selling.  Guildies also got great upgrades in that fight, including a Belt of the Great Turtle and a Brell's Girdle.  <br />
<br />
Loot was very much in line, both with the levels needed to do the event, and the levels represented there.  And it surely outweight the risk...zero xp loss deaths make dying so painless.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure if you mean that they should have been dropping BoC's and Ornate stuff, or they should have been dropping rusty daggers.  But to me, seemed that the drops were ok.  But more importantly, it was FUN!  And so was the other GM event I attended earlier that week in Dreadlands (Giant doggies attacking KC), where loot wasn't nearly as good and was significantly harder.<br />
<br />
Oh well, can't please everyone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Note aside, during the past GM events, it sickened me to no end the &quot;If this is a gm event, where is my phat l3wtz?&quot;... there was this event in DL and was fun, 2 dragons and ppl killing them, both conned LB and I stood far and kept shooting arrows watchting the fight hehe, and after it, a GM came on the spires and started to give some coins to everyone who helped (or I think it was cookies or something like that), and 70% of the zone had that &quot;loot whore&quot; attitude, oocing and shouting that they wanted real loot and stuff.... it really sickened me... and after that, they attacked the GM thinking they could loot him... I dunno if I should've laughed of the ppl dying to a naked GM with a rusty sword killing them or puked.....<br />
Jesus... come on.... its for the freaking fun of it... like paladiin said, it was FUN!... but 70% of the zone didnt seem to care</div></div><hr />
