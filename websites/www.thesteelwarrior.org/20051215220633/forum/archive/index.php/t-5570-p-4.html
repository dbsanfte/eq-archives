<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it just me or does anyone else think its possible the aug proc rate could be a function of the weapon proc rate.<br />
<br />
At the very least the aug proc rate is not the standard 2PPM as some think.  Notice the GRMK has less then 1PPM on its aug, which corresponds with the barely more then 1PPM on the weapon.<br />
<br />
Unlikely imo.  It's common knowledge that an augment will fire less often than the weapon's natural proc, as long as it's one of the numerous normal proc rate weapons, since the order is 1) natural proc 2) augment 3) imbued<br />
<br />
I don't have access to a cleric that could current parses but was quite obvious when I was guilded with a cleric that put the mirror 1 aug on the furious hammer of zek (off VZ-Tactics) that the augment has no correlation to the weapon it was on.  The weapon procced like mad while the augment stayed true to the normal proc rate.<br />
<br />
I'm with everyone that has stated augments have their own base proc rate, which doesn't quite reach the 2ppm primary / 1ppm secondary @ 305 dex, WA0, CE0, because the natural proc takes precendent, thus, reducing the augment proc rate so around 1.8ppm/0.9 ppm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you can only get 1 proc per swing on a weapon?  That's how I understand the posts about the natural proc taking precedence over the aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct, 1 proc per swing, though some will state they got multiple procs on 1 swing but it's due to a double attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, it seems to be one proc per round. So whether you swing once, twice, or more in a given round, you can only proc once (round being defined as the set of swings for a single weapon each time the weapon's delay timer is up. Primary and off hands would have separate rounds). But if you've got a log that shows differently it would be great to see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're correct on that, I've never noticed it before.  I went through some logs and couldn't find one double proc on a double attack on primary in one round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Procs happen once per swing, whether the swing is due to a double attack, triple attack, duel wield success, or rampage. This has been repeatedly proven by the multitude of warriors who have done any Earthshaker+Rampage AE killing. A single round of melee will result in many actual swings and many procs on a single round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rampage is a very special case, and is independant of the weapon delay. Do you have any logs that show multiple procs ocurring in the same round for non-rampage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is rampage a special case? Weapon delay does not change the ability to proc per swing. The effective weapon delay certainly will affect the chances to proc on a particular swing, but it does not change the fact that any single swing can produce a proc.<br />
<br />
The fact that individual swings can proc is the reason that someone with max offensive AAs gets more procs/minute than someone with the same DEX and no offensive AAs. This has been hashed out many times, in particular when people claimed to have weapons with multiple procs going off on the same swing.<br />
<br />
I am sure I can easily produce a log with multiple procs in a round, it's not that uncommon of an occurance. I have seen it myself many times, and since I don't have rampage it would be safe to say that the multiple procs where not due to a rampage. I'll have to see if I still have the logs of proc rate testing. If not I'll run some 10+ hour logs tonight and get back to you.</div></div><hr />

I went through a 9 hour log on my parse mob and gave up after hitting F3  (Find Next) trying to find multiple procs on the same round - gave up after 2 hours in the log file.  I found numerous times primary and offhand firing simultaneous but not once on just a primary round or offhand round.</div></div><hr />

I found numerous times primary and offhand firing simultaneous but not once on just a primary round or offhand round.I'll run a log with just a main hand weapon tonight to rule out the possibility of consecutive mainhand/secondary procs. Keep in mind that on a typical 2 proc 20ish delay weapon hasted 36-41% you have a 5% likelyhood of procing on any one swing. The chances that procs will occur on back to back swings drops down to .25% so odds are not in your favor that this will ever happen. The only way to know for sure is to parse many hours of logs.</div></div><hr />

I'll see if I can find a weighted axe to do some testing with.</div></div><hr />
