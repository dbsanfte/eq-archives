<br />
Well we have tried three of them so far. EC, Nro, MM. We have beaten the EC raid. All three are very different, require different strategy, you cant just throw numbers at them, corner the boss and chc the MT. They all implement different types of contacts.<br />
<br />
Why do people seem to say they suck. is it because they are losing?<br />
<br />
To me the most challenging and unque type raids in EQ.</div></div><hr />

Every design decision SOE made when making them was either flat out wrong, or totally annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The LDON &quot;normal&quot; raids are easy but again not worth it for Time level guilds. The LDON &quot;hard&quot; raids are completly out of whack as far as risk vs reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, LDoN raids suck because 3 high risk missions for 315ap &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 raid for 30ap. Chances are you can save enough points for hard missions to buy 2+ 40hp augs before you'll see a raid lvl hp aug in your inventory.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, there are some nice rewards to be had from the raids, but the effort to get them just isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They suck because they are way too restricted, and in many ways. To name a few:<br />
<br />
- Get more than 36 people showing on at raid time? Too bad, some of you have sit out<br />
<br />
- Get less than 6 clerics showing up? Too bad, come back another day<br />
<br />
- Cannot replace, nor add people along the way, thus everyone have to commit for 3-4 hours. This is very bad.<br />
<br />
- Deathcount = teh suck. Beating them within the time limit is enough of a challenge.<br />
<br />
I doubt anyone could disagree with the above. Further problems with these raids(more open to debate):<br />
<br />
- Retry on failure is too long. When you lose a raid due to deathcount or timeout or whatever, you should be able to come back the next day and try again.<br />
<br />
- Deathcount + the long retry time + the less than steller rewards = Very poor reward/risk ratio. <br />
<br />
- Several of these raids have what I would call &quot;crunch&quot; points, or places where one mistake can cause a critical fail. While this might be fun for the gamedesigner point of view, from a player point of view it makes for a very frustrating experience. Example=the Everfrost raid where you have to protect the corpse of some NPC. This corpse will be ripped to shreds by an attacking wave of NPCs in 1 minute. Fail to stop them=get ported out=wasted 3hours+wait 5 days=#¤&amp;¤#%<br />
<br />
- And finally, yes IMO most of the PoTime level raids needs a slight downwards tuning. The rewards simply do not justify making them so extremely demanding as they are. I could understand it if the rewards were better than PoTime, but they are not. Therefore it makes no sense to have PoTime being _much_ easier to beat than LDON raids.<br />
<br />
If the designers would look at a few of the points above and make some adjustments, they could easily make LDON a much nicer and more fun experience for the player. Because the raids themselves are OK imo, I had fun the first few times on them all. But the parameters(deathcounts/retry times/difficulty level etc) desperately needs finetuning.</div></div><hr />

Wow, I havent done them...that does sound harsh :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to mention most guilds capable of doing the Time level raids have around 72 people..which means the 37th thru N players get to sit out if you don't have enough of every class to support two unique raids.  Many guilds simply avoid the LDoN raid alltogether for this fact.  LDoN has amounted to a paid beta test for GoD and EQ2 instancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The raids themselves are pretty good.  The risk vs reward is just very poor.  If you could have completely stopped raiding PoTime and just raided LDoN, then it would have been more successful.  Or if they had a single raid zone and you had to beat all the raids in order to get there and this zone allowed you to surpass PoTime, then the raids would have been far more successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the challenge of the Time level LDON raids is pretty good, and doesn't need to be tuned downwards.<br />
<br />
I do think there is a bit too much &quot;trash&quot; clearing in some of them though... rather than making them 3 hours, make them 2 and remove the mobs for which that extra time is allotted... removes some of the tedium of clearing, and cuts down on  the time committment in raids where you can't add people as others camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing that would make LDoN raids a lot easier on guilds with 36+ is to allow everyone in the raid to endter the dungeon, while still keeping the 36 man limit. That would enable people to leave early without screwing the raid. It would also allow for late people to join if there is room. My guild does a few LDoN a week, but I haven't been able to attend a single one due to start time being earlier than get off work time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I happen to enjoy LDoN raids more than time, and pushed hard to get my guild to do them, but all the reasons listed in this thread are very correct.<br />
<br />
IMO the NUMBER ONE thing they need to fix are the absurd loot drops.  Our first two LDoN raids we beat, we got TWO non-rot items out of 12 drops.  I lost count of number of regen 4 augments we got.  Out of 12 victories in various raids, we have yet to get a +dmg weapon augment, but TONS of type 3 crap.<br />
<br />
They also need to port the GoD instance code to LDoN after they finish with it.<br />
<br />
One thing I appreciate about LDoN is that it made my guild better players, certainly.  We used to have deaths from 3 pulls.  Now we do 5 pulls no sweat, and more sometimes. (not in violent experiments)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or, people have done them many times and found out they hate them. On the hard level raids the risk vs reward is simply out of wack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our guild still farms Time, but mostly only for a few more Tier5/Quarm items.  Lots of people have quit lately because they would rather quit than try LDoN raids.  We officially quit doing LDoN months ago and have never looked back.<br />
<br />
Personally I LOVE raiding and doing new things.  But I HATE clearing hours of trash just to get to a few decent encounters.  Remove all the trash and it might be more worthwhile.  It got to the point though if a LDoN raid was planned, no one would log in that day.  If a LDoN raid was called, everyone would /q or /afk 'My cat just killed my father and my sister is pregnant, red pigs are flying around my house'....</div></div><hr />

I for one am tired of Sony catering to 1% of the players. I have said this over and over again, your player base is the 99% who will never even see Elemental Planes. We HATE raiding, and we really could care less FoH and Afterlife players can commit so much time to the game. Please the 1% and the 99% will leave for WoW.</div></div><hr />

Its because some retards think just like you, that some of us<br />
end up with nothing but lame retarded useless expansions (see LoY)<br />
Where the fuck did you ever hear about Elementals or Time ?<br />
<br />
So you want stuff to do with Friends 1 group ?<br />
Try PoG, Try Kael, Try CT, Try DN, Try Akheva  etc etc etc.<br />

Get a fucking clue and realise there are things to do.<br />
And go do them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since, SoE Devs actually seem to be listening these days, maybe we could make some suggestions to try to fix this. I really think some of the actual end encounters are well designed, its the rest of the raid setup that gets in the way.<br />
<br />
So here is what I am seeing...<br />
<br />
1.) the 36 person limit...<br />
<br />
 this was basically set as anti-zerg coding. However it causes several problems. late people, wrong classes, people leaving, etc. So if LDON dungeons had the same 'instancing' style as Plane of Time, where you could replace, add late people as long as the 36 person limit is not exceeded, this would help tremendously.<br />
<br />
2.) Death counts ...<br />
<br />
Death counts + Timer + raid limit... the gear better make Quarm loot look like Bazaar trash...  currently with the death limits, 2 wipes and you lose raid, but honestly with the just sheer numbers of trash in the way to objectives, 2 wipes and you dont have the time to complete the raid anyways. So either remove the death limits or lower the numbers of trash mobs.<br />
<br />
3.) Failure reset....<br />
<br />
Set the failure reset timer to 24 hrs instead of 5 days. Leave the success timer at 5 days. Actually I dont see the 5 day timer as all that bad, IF they had a VT, Ele, and time level raid in EVERY camp, if they did then you could just move to next theme raid, and come back after completing the cycle. Without increasing number of raids, especially the lower challenge ones, then the 5 day wait is just too long.<br />
<br />
4.) length...<br />
<br />
3 hours just too long, would be better if reduced time to 2 hrs and reduced the trash mobs by 50%.<br />
<br />
Anything I am missing, that is just blatantly wrong, or would this actually make LDON raids more enticing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wish there were more levels of raids in LDoN.  On Quellious, it's hard to get into those Ssra-VT areas due to competition...and the instanced aspect of a Ssra-VT level raid would be quite beneficial to those guilds (like mine) that raid once or twice a week.<br />
<br />
As it is...we're competiting not only with other 'up-and-coming' guilds, but with the uberguilds who like to see how well they can equip their twinks using Time equipped chars.<br />
<br />
I'm quite interested to see if they expand upon the instancing mixed with standard dungeon idea in GoD.  It could be quite fun properly implemented...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this happening on every server?  I thought it was just mine.  <br />
<br />
I have basically given up on the ssra / VT progression path until GoD is out and the ubers get a life.  Watching the top 3 time guilds on our server racing for emperor ssra is......funny for lack of a better word.<br />
<br />
I believe the message dev's can take from this is that when the elemental+ powergamers are NOT doing LDON raids AT ALL, for whatever reason, it closes the progression path to the rest of us.  The raids obviously have to be nerfed to make them more appealing so you dont have 3/4 of the server's powergamers bottomfeeding constantly.</div></div><hr />

Ever been to PoHate to get Armor that never drops ?  [i]Still waiting for that Fooking BP... though it's worthless now.  It's too bad none of the newbs today will have the joy of having 30 people all trying to get 1 cleric camped out at safe wall.<br />
Ever tried loosing 2 3 levels breaking Fear ?  Yes.  Then called another guild to get us out, hehe.<br />
Ever spend 4 days in a row in PoSKy ?  Yea, I didn't think <br />
I'd ever want to raid again.<br />
Ever saw 40 people get gangbanged by 2 Protector or Growth ?  Close.  I saw 25 people.<br />
Ever Tried Vaniki to get Owned ?  Never spent much time in DN, myself.<br />
Ever Wiped ToV ? NToV ?  More times than I'd really like to remember in both.  I think we were the only guild who bothered farming Telk and Gozz, but I'm glad we did.<br />
Ever Dealt with the Clusterfuck that was Grieg ? Yes, and still do.  Emp ? Can't yet.  Seru ?  Would love to, but no, not yet.<br />
Ever Farmed ST keys ?  Working on it.  We've managed 2 so far since we can't kill Sont yet and Zland/Kland are so camped I think they gave up spawning.  Trying to talk guild into taking LtK, but...<br />
<br />
I have to agree with you totally.  There is a ton of stuff out there to see and do.  The problem is that so many people want to cut straight into PoP now that they know nothing about the rest of the game.  My only real complaints are quest mobs that drop loot.  More specifically, quest mobs that are required for progression that drop good loot (i.e. Emp Ssra).  All that does is make it even harder for guilds to progress as it makes these mobs appealing to higher end guild to farm when they are beyond needing them.  Other than that, I currently raid almost every night and there is always something good to hit.  If nothing else, Paffa is pretty much ignored anymore, Mujaki is easy if you figure it out and our current favorite, Xanamech (can't get enough of those 41% haste necks).  I'm definitely glad SoE added a few worthwhile triggered events for those nights when there is not a mob to be found.  For a long time, Lcea was a favorite and she was pretty good to us, though I still haven't gotten my damn mask from her.  Hell, I even want to hit VP just once to say that I did it (I love seeing people ask me what VP is when it was once the top zone in the game).  There are a ton of mobs out there that are just blatantly ignored because they don't drop top end gear, even though they drop decent items that people can use.  The entire idea of progression was finally killed with LDoN.  Now people don't have to learn how to raid to get good gear.  They get to PL to 50 (yes, the rate at which people XP normally nowdays can only be considered PLing by those who have been around for a long time), just do adventures all the way to 65 and then jump into a PoP guild and get some flags.  My only wish is that the PoP guilds will recognize those with no raiding skills and let them go to learn how to play, but it never seems to happen.  My other favorite thing lately is seeing the new Warriors splurging on high DPS weapons that don't hold aggro worth crap.  I guess that's not too bad since they are usually wearing paper for armor, too.  People are simply leveling so fast that they never really learn anything about thier class or how to play.  I can't even count how many times I've had some newbie link me his uber Reaver he bought in bazaar with no proc on it saying how much better it was than my JBoW.  I always tell them the same thing.  Sure it is, if you are trying NOT to tank anything.<br />
<br />
As for those who don't want to raid, then don't raid.  LDoN is your dream come true.  All the &quot;PH4T L3WTZ&quot; you can handle and all you gotta do is grind for them.  Personally, I see no reason to even bother playing if you don't like raiding.  Why the hell do I want to kill pathetic_blue_con_98,102 when I could see something really amazing, like Aary or (hopefully soon) Sleepers Tomb.  It's just too bad that SoE chose to make so much one-time content that most of us will never get to see (i.e. Sleeper /pout).  I also find it unfortunate that the older content has become so incredibly obsolete with the new expansions.  I remember intentionally staying at 52 just so that I could keep killing Naggy and Vox.  Now they are something for UberguildXXX to do with thier Alts so they have something to sell in Bazaar.  Half my guild doesn't know who Severillous is.  And another thing that struck me the other day.  A guy asked me to link my belt to him the other day (RBB).  Now, once upon a time the first question I'd get asked is &quot;Who dropped that?&quot;.  Not anymore.  Everytime you show people something nowdays, they ask you how much it cost you.  The mentality anymore is that everyone just buys what they need in bazaar, I guess.  I'd seen it before, without really registering it.  This time it struck me because I remembered back when seeing an RBB for sale was very rare and camping it was pretty much the only option (unless you were lucky enough to get a CoF).  Here was a guy who didn't even know what a RBB was, let alone how to get one.  A decent group of 65s can take down Talendor or Sev nowdays.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm rambling, but I agree totally.</div></div><hr />

Granted we are not EP yet, we have killed about 1/3-1/2 the mobs to get access.  From our perspective, these raids are too hard.  If there were a few more levels of raids, it would not be so bad.  There is just so much enjoyment from pulling a mob that brings 10 of his buddies that requires a tank with a personal healer.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, we have tried them and will continue to do so later on.  Our second attempt was much better purely for the fact that we hit the timer limit before the death limit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is the high end game is crowded, whether people like Doomflayer want to admit it or not. My server has 5 North American guilds in Time, a half dozen more in the Elementals and about 4-5 more that are in VT... and add a couple Asian and one European guild into the mix at various stages.  Thats not 1% of the player base. Its a good portion of it, and when people run out of things that challenge them, they kill the next most challenging thing out of boredom. <br />
<br />
I'm not in an uber guild but I talk to friends who are: most guilds don't cockblock &quot;lesser&quot; guilds out of malice, they're just looking for things to do. For the reasons summarized above, people do hate LDON and would rather do things like a Ssra or VT run or a 10th Ring War for alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats where you are wrong.  If a time level guild is not in elementals / time / backflagging and not in LDON raids then they are NOT doing anything challenging.  LDON raids are challenging.  Taking out King Tormax or Emp or Seru with 50+ time geared players is not.<br />
<br />
My point is apparently the LDON raids hold zero appeal to our top server population because they would rather raid things like Kael for their twinks than do LDON raids.<br />
<br />
There has to be some way for devs to look at a report of how many raids were attempted by the top 5 guilds and realize &quot;wow, we made a completely ignored expansion.&quot;</div></div><hr />

 Yep, and most of the good stuff is being two-boxed. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
 You know, it's funny listening to that rant. Bitch bitch bitch about players who want challenging content with good loot at their level in a thread about how LDoN raids suck because risk != reward. Oh, wait, the folks not in LDoN raids != 65/100's or better who are EP/Time flagged. So sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a bottom feeder. I kill with 1 group or 2 raid targets.<br />
Why ? because we are BORED.<br />
<br />
Lets see ..... Tonight after clearing Time ....<br />
Go make 2 LDoN Adventures.<br />
Go Clear NToV for the fun of it ?<br />
Hey lets try KT with 12 ! AoW with 20 etc etc !<br />
Wonder how long it will take me to duo Gorenaire with my bot ?<br />
<br />
Trust me EP+ Players have a lot more to do than bottomfeed.<br />
LDoN has nothing to do with that.<br />
<br />
Want to keep &quot;EP+&quot; busy ?<br />
Make &quot;Insane Assinate LDoN missions&quot; with a badass boss in the end.  <br />
that can drop great loot. <br />
<br />
20hp or 30hp augments, 10ac all slots, +20 to a save !<br />
Some really nice stuff with class restrictions.<br />
Like 35% of the time, and it takes 2h to do the mission. <br />
<br />
That doesnt need puller/mezer/3K DPS.<br />
That a good balanced well played EP+ group can hope winning.<br />
<br />
I prefer having to deal with 2 mobs hitting for 1800<br />
Than 4 mobs hitting for 900.<br />
Bad resist, Bad lull/pacify = wipe or train or time loss.<br />
<br />
Make 1 group raids in LDoN with Raid like loot.<br />
And you will never see EP+ people again.<br />
<br />
When i killed RZTW i spend after that like 2 months in Fire.<br />
Now i have killed Quarm, LDoN still sucks after 300 wins.<br />
And i have 600AA.<br />
<br />
What do i do ? Bottomfeed.<br />
<br />
Thats right, because there is no &quot;Insane Difficulty LDoN&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one LDON raid I did, I think the trash hit for 1400 or 1500, and had maybe 25k hp.<br />
<br />
I could see a 2-hour, 1 group mission with mobs like that.<br />
<br />
Make each mission drop an 1150-point augment, and/or worth 200 points each, and people would do them.</div></div><hr />

Might as well make the boss death touch every 30 seconds (for one group!)<br />
<br />
Due to the way EQ works, if a group can once they can always win if they do the same thing.  Maybe if they can be worked like a trial where you only get to do it once it would work, but not as repeatable missions.</div></div><hr />

- Make the refresh Timer 2h for &quot;Insane Assasinate&quot;  (45mins atm)<br />

- 25hp or 25mana or 10ac or 15 save agument on boss<br />
- 50% chance to drop loot. One loot per boss.<br />

- Correctly spaced mobs (Guk sucks in hard)<br />
- Balance the Maps<br />
- Increase downtime (AE manataps)<br />
- Add a random surprise factor mob<br />

- Make the timer mean something<br />
(I havent failed a hard collect with 1 or 2 full wipes, 3 is a limit)<br />
<br />
I finish my hard Collects in 30 to 60 minutes.<br />
Lame &amp; Boring exept when u have 5 mobs in a small room.<br />

I want something that will make a PoF C2 &amp; Deep Water group be scared of going there.<br />
Compare a Valor mob to a Fire C2 mob.<br />
That same difference should be fome Fire C2 mob to Insane Assassinate.<br />

Today i can spend 2h getting 200AP.  Easy &amp; Efficient &amp; Boring<br />

I want that &quot;OMG we're gonna die&quot; feeling i had in sebilis.<br />

<br />
Like I said, no matter how hard you make it, if it's winnable at all then it's also repeatable and it'd be too easy for RvR.  It'd have to be something you can win only once, sort of like the AA reward for your flags in PoP.  It can be like Justice trials only instead of looting Mark of whatever you loot a lore augment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My proposition gives you 1 augment  50% of the Time.<br />
That augment has to be reasonably better than 1200AP ones.<br />
<br />
Stats vs Manhours have to be in favor of the &quot;Insane Assass&quot;<br />
<br />
I would prefer doing 20 Missions to get a shot at one +35hp Tank only augment.<br />

<br />
 I will cheerfully submit that when one is bored with any other game, when it becomes boring, one shuts it off and plays another, or finds something else to do.<br />
<br />
 Unfortunately, your being bored bollixes content for everyone else who plays, some of whom are just reaching the stage that the EP/Time guilds passed so long ago. It's hard enough fighting for spawns with competing guilds (As EP/Time guilders SHOULD know by now), let alone ALSO fighting for them with competing groups of 'bored' players. So save your righteous indignation that a lower level player dared vent his feelings about 'ubers' taking content they have NO logical reason to do.<br />
<br />
 (As an aside, I too think Doomflayer is a moron, but this time, at least there's a grain of good sense to his ranting.)<br />
<br />
 I personally would find it wonderful if they reflagged expansion zones to not allow in folks with selected keys/flags. After all, once you've gotten to high school, you just look stupid kicking the third graders out of the sandbox because you're 'bored'.</div></div><hr />

I for one am tired of Sony catering to 1% of the players. I have said this over and over again, your player base is the 99% who will never even see Elemental Planes. We HATE raiding, and we really could care less FoH and Afterlife players can commit so much time to the game. Please the 1% and the 99% will leave for WoW.  <br />
<br />
Funny this comes from someone with AoW Helm and SS BP, stuff that was restricted to really 1% of the playerbase a few years back. <br />
<br />
1% never see EPs? we have 6 guilds EP+ on our server, each of that guild probably has 80 full members on average, means on my server 480 ppl have seen EPs. so my server has 48000 players according to your maths.<br />
Now EQ has 48 life servers, so if every server has 6 guilds that you claim to be are 1% of the playerbase a total of 23040 are EP enabled. <br />
That means EQ has fucking TWO MILLION THREEHUNDRED THOUSAND subscribers according to you!<br />
<br />
If we are working with figures closer to reality, like 9 EP guilds averagly per server with 100 members average we are talking about 43200 EP flagged people, and almost 4,5 million subscribers for EQ!<br />
<br />
People like you, that pull massivly false numbers from their ass to argue with them to make their own point of view look better really, really piss me off.<br />
<br />
Face it mate, you are BELOW average. You are a minority that has been served too well over the last year, you have huge loads of content. NOBODY competes for level 63 exp spots. NOBODY competes for 3 year old raid content. <br />

<br />
That quote = Idiotic bullshit.<br />
<br />
Old content has MORE people competing for it than there were when you were doing it.  People who do old stuff have to fight not only more guilds at the same level than you had, but also have to deal with &quot;bored&quot; higher players taking shit too.  Try having 10 guilds at your level, and then 6 EP guilds being bored and fucking people over also.  Obviously not all high level people are like that, some a pretty nice, but when people killing quarm take KT, Seru, Emp, Doze, and a lot more, they leave people who are TRYING to do content at their level screwed.  My guild only kills Seru out of that list now, but we've seen numerous EP+ guilds killing those and many more.  Some came through and killed XtC, AL, HP, Cursed repeatedly.  Haven't had a single shot at Emp, EP+ guilds have him perma killed.  I understand how annoying it is to run out of content, I deal with it often, just imagine having 3x the competition you do now and that will be how it feels for many of us.  Sure there is a ton of older content, but just as you out grew those in the past, many have outgrown a ton of that content too, and are stuck with more competition on things you did so long ago.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'd like to clarify that only some do that, not all, but I thought you should understand how it feels to be someone who is mainly on Luclin mobs when people bottomfeed often.  Additional content has been added at this level, but the level of competition remains very high.</div></div><hr />

Are you not pulling false numbers out of your ass now ?<br />
<br />
Bottom feeding has always happened and always will, until they put something in place that will keep those *at the end game* busy (which I don't know if its possible to do).  As Hussar said the competition is still there for old content, exactly how much is just being done for the challenge is debatable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hussar nailed it right on the head.  Competition for the elementals must be rough, but competition for targets sub-elemental is even worse.  Imagine your current competition level  in elementals and add in 6 guilds above you that have 3x - 5x your player base that bottom feed 2/3 of the time.<br />
<br />
Those numbers come from my guild's situation.  We normally raid with 25-30 people, and have about 6 or 7 guilds &quot;above&quot; us that raid with 70 people minimum, and 4 or 5 at our level or close to it.  <br />
<br />
LDON raids should have fixed this problem.  They havent.  Im hoping GoD will.<br />
<br />
Emilia : What would it take to bridge the gap between your 1-group idea and the current 6-group architecture?  <br />
<br />
 You cant say that LDON raids arent Challenging, or &quot;Insane&quot; enough.  They're obviously very tough for their level.  Why would you lust after 1-group content so much so over 6 group content?  Considering you're obviously in a huge guild, you arent new to large raid mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Korocust in ChardokB, Innoruuk in Nadox, lots of casual stuff in Nadox / Torigan that have ATK and FT effects on their loot tables. You can always go to HoT or kill west wing dragons. KT and AoW being down doesnt mean theres nothing left to kill on velious.<br />

<br />
I would love to raid LDoN. But my guild will never do that.<br />
The tensions after the 3 first raids almost turned into civil war.<br />
(Ok i'm over reacting but you get the picture).<br />
<br />
What i want is a raid difficulty adventure (aka ultra hard)<br />
That will give rewards a bit below raid level (in augments)<br />
With a much lower drop rate.<br />
<br />
In 10-15 hours my group gets 6x20hp/mana or 6x40hp.<br />
With a 100% drop rate (vendor sold)<br />
<br />
With 10 adventures (considering 1 hour each):<br />
Hard =  6 loots  <br />
Ultra Hard = 2-3 loots of better quality<br />
<br />
I'm insulted spending 10hours to get 20hp/mana.<br />
I would be exited spending 10 hours to get a shot at that<br />
30hp 5ac , all slot warrior/pal/sk only augment.<br />
<br />
I am the only one missing the exitement of doing Necro/4Room<br />
hoping &amp; praying a lamentation/hiero will drop ?<br />
<br />
Want a loot table ?<br />
- Empty (55%)<br />
- 50 hp , all/all , visible armor only (5%)<br />
- 50 mana, all/all , visible armor only  (5%)<br />
- 35hp all/all , all slots (5%)<br />
- 35mana all/all , all slots (5%)<br />
- 30hp/mana, all/all , all slots (5%)<br />
- 30hp 5ac, all plate, all slots (5%)<br />
- 15ac, all plate, all slots (5%)<br />
- Veng4 all/all , all slots  (5%)<br />
- FT2 all/all , all slots (5%)<br />
<br />
Now i take my regular group, grind for 10 hard and get<br />
6 of the easy lame vendor augments.<br />
<br />
Or i go and do 10 ultra hard and get 3 of these sweet augments.<br />
<br />
Guess which one i will chose ? :)<br />
<br />
Of course after 1000 missions a huge mudflation will settle in.<br />
But the lower drop rate will mean it will settle much slower.<br />
And keep people like me busy.<br />
<br />
When i was busy at lvl60 w/o any AA camping Hiero for PP, <br />
i didnt go to Crushbone killing emp crush for the fun of it.<br />
<br />
If i'm busy trying to get that &quot;God damned fucking plate augment that never drops&quot;<br />
with my grind group, i wont be running around bottomfeeding.<br />
<br />
As for the mobs ... keep them like they are ATM.<br />
Just add 200 to min hit &amp; 400 to max hit. <br />
Or 0-700 for some extra spice to the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tensions after the 3 first raids almost turned into civil war. <br />
<br />
Implies that you represent a small minority of your guild that actually wants challenging content.  The rest, I assume, just want to farm, get phat loot, and the LDON raids are too hard for them.  So even if you got your wish with insane 1 group content, the other 3/4 of your guild would be bottomfeeding.<br />
<br />
The real fix is a sharp uptick of rewards from LDON raids or another expansion (GoD) that has POP+ amounts of raid content.  Im hoping for both.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned Koro in CharB.  Great fight, great mob, farmed incessantly by our resident euro-ubers for his ring.  The rest rots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I asked one of my guild's officers why we never hit AoW anymore.  He tells me we don't because mini-raids from Time guilds race each other to farm him.  In the past year, my guild has seen KT twice, never seen Cursed, Seru once, Shei once, etc etc etc.  Most of that is competing guilds of our level or slightly above but a good chunk is EP/Time people who are bored or alt-farming.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, going back to the original question.  My guild did the VT Tak raid again last night, about 2-3 months after the last one failed because a couple mobs pathed below the world.  Same thing again.  So, yeah, despite a flood of bug reports, the raid is still broken 6 months after release.</div></div><hr />

EP Cleared (for rare drops) Time Cleared.<br />
<br />
If there was a PoTimeC with Some really badass mobs there.<br />
We would be working on them. Even chain wiping.<br />
But halas, there is nothing to do 55-65 people once Quarm is dead.<br />
<br />
You end up giving 55-65 people a free night.<br />
Because as a guild there is nothing you can do.<br />
<br />
We cant make 2 LDoN raids. Making One will lead to a civil war.<br />
Why ? The same reason 90% of guilds hate LDoN.<br />
<br />
36 is NOT  72/2   that goes for tanks, clerics, shaman etc etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
So its either :<br />
A) Mindless LDoN Grind for 50ish bored &amp; half pissed people <br />
B) Hey lets go 1 Group Sontalak !<br />
<br />
I dont like B, but i admit it.  I'd love a different A.<br />
And its easy to implement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have a few friends on terris that I kill things with when we aren't raiding. 4-5 people, boxing 1 or 2 each..we can get 6-10chars on at once. KT, aow, Yelinak, Ntov, Dozekar, VT, ST, Ssra, Zland, Kland,Sont, TZ, VZ...whatever we can find. Theres generally TONS of this type of stuff up on our server.<br />
<br />
We do 5-8 ldon raids a week, plus 1 clearing of time. In between all that, we look for those targets. Usually at least 3-4 will be up. I don't know where the guilds are on our server that should be clearing them...I guess the loot in ldon has killed the middle-level guilds on Terris.<br />
<br />
But, i'm a bottom feeder i guess. Farmer. Whatever you wanna call it. Those terms have such a negative connotation...I just dont understand I guess. EQ is an aging game, and if I can get fun out of killing something that someone else isn't after - why should I appologize for that?</div></div><hr />

LDoN fails to provide LOW NUMBER Time+ people &quot;Fun&quot;.<br />
<br />
Vindicator with 1 group, KT with 10 , Zlandikar Duo.<br />
Are great memories &amp; FUN.<br />
<br />

I don't wanna sound like a dick here, because that's not how I mean it, so i'll clarify.<br />
<br />
If I was in your shoes (IE: Elemental/Time flagged), I'd do the exact same shit.  Honest to god, I'd go twink up my level 15's with fucking Doze loot, Vindi BP, GoDs, Dain belt, the whole nine yards, just to say I did it.<br />
<br />
However, that doesn't mean that I'm not pissed off that it happens now.  Trust me people, when the fuckin ubers tell you that they need more content, THEY FUCKING NEED MORE CONTENT.  More content for you doesn't solve shit.  More content for them GETS THEM AWAY FROM YOU.<br />
<br />
If you are not at the top of the game, you should NEVER EVER be bitching about them doing another &quot;Raid expansion for the ubers.&quot;  That means that they're out of zones that you couldn't do before and off doing their own thing and leaving you the fuck alone.  That's a good thing, and I don't think some of you realize that.<br />

About a month ago, I took my guild of like 8 or 9 people, I can't remember what turnout we had that day, and I took down Telkenor in WToV for the first time.  He dropped a lateral upgrade (Lance of Thunder, a rot (Duplicate Lance), and a lateral upgrade for a bard (True Mith BP).  I checked loot tables on Telk, Gozz and LTK, and aside form the ST key piece on Lendi, there is zero reason for my group of fucking gimps to be in WToV.  Bazaar and 1 groupable item equipped people are too well geared to benefit from killing those dragons, so they're completely out.<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to work up the balls to see if we could pull off the same feat with Eashan and Ikiatar, but I don't think so.</div></div><hr />

We all do some stuff, just to see if we can do it, especially when bored.  It just does get stressful to run out of content, no matter the level.<br />
<br />
Raaj, I don't know how you are finding those all up, we never see anything.  Of course we are semi casual, and don't check on non raid days (2 per week).  I'm sure we'd find more if we could during the week. =p<br />
<br />
Haass, we always pulled Ika and Eashen to zone in also.  Can run them past the hub mobs if you aren't kos and don't actually engage in front of them.  Ika is like 750 quad not slowable.  Eashen has an AE, but you can put him in a corner just north of the zone in and hide in the doorway.  Have to kill one trash mob that way though.<br />
<br />
We all need more content heh.  Trust me, I want a ton more content for you guys too =p</div></div><hr />

AMEN !</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  36 person limit.  We typically have 45-70 show up for a raid and there's no way we're going to tell 30% of them &quot;sorry, we don't need you... go away&quot;.<br />
<br />
2.  Inability for people to join late or leave early.  We're an EST guild but many of us are on PST and have no choice but to show up late most days.  We also have many people who have no choice but to leave early.  Neither is possible in LDON.<br />
<br />
LDON raids could have 1000 HP items and we still wouldn't do them because of those reasons.<br />
<br />
LDON was a fantastic expansion for XP grouping.  It flat out sucks for raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another reason I don't like about LDoN is how you get absolutely nothing if you fail.  Generally speaking most expansions if you can't kill the uberest boss you can still get something to show for your time clearing to that guy via lesser named.  But no such luck in LDoN and with the 5 day fail or succeed it's really frustrating to be working on an encounter with nothing to show for it.  I mean you even get the emote 'your victory has weakened the shroud of magic surrounding the dungeon's treasure' so why not let people claim some minor prizes?  Why not give the Fury of whatever focus, regeneration, shield of pain, FT, and vengenance effects out as you clear up to the boss?  I can't imagine any guild who can even progress a reasonable amount in the Time raids would do this for the sole purpose of getting those augments but it gives you a consolation prize.  Leave the better stuff like +HP augments and Time effects after you beat the boss, that's fine.  But no reason why you shouldn't get a few shield of pain III or regeneration V augments for making to the boss IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i guess myself too; I was a bottom feeder in my old guild. PoP raids and backflagging and all that other stupid flagging nonsense tore my guild to pieces ( you guys on TT know ) and the ones tht were left that couldn't make all the flagging and stuff ended up bottom feeding, because, well, sure my tag than was EP+ but some of us knew the older content was all we had to do.<br />
<br />
I gave up though. I feel the pain of being a sub-EP player these days and hear about people 2-boxing and 6 man'ing mobs that require a aid foce for the lower tier guild..but there's a real easy resolution to it all...<br />
<br />
sh!t or get off the pot. don't hate the players; hate the designers of the game who cubbyholed you into being second-rate people in their eyes.<br />
<br />
Or just plain don't expect to have and experience things the game more than likely weren't designed for your type of players.<br />

( not a flame, seriously. just a point-blank unbiased view of the state of affairs in EQ )</div></div><hr />

You EP fucks make me laugh. &quot;We have no content.&quot;  You wanna know how hard it is for anyone NOT in EP's to do shit when you guys are running around taking OUR content?  <br />
<br />
Yep, and they do it to stop progress of other players in the game, so they won't have competition. Starting with Kreiger (and many GMs belonged to this guild on Tunare{GMs no longer in guild}) to the other asses in EQ, this goes on. Finally instanced dungeons were added, but WoW has the real solution, quests where everyone gets the reward, THEN YOU CAN NEVER DO IT AGAIN WITH THAT CHAR! Good, you killed RZ? He is dead for that char forever! But give everyone loot, of course the dumb &quot;Programmers&quot; should not have added a lot of outrageous loot like they have.</div></div><hr />

LMAO now this is summom of sheer blind stupidity.<br />

We kill for fun/twinks/cash (chose one of these).<br />
Cockblocking has nothing to do with this.</div></div><hr />

which is the makor reason half of the content is not used by anyone and everyone is at each others throats to get to the other half.<br />

The sollution make encounters/items more different/versetile and not more dps,hp,bigger cock...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little background:<br />
<br />
My guild has about 25 (mebbe getting closer to 30 now) mains in our roster, and our lowest level is 51 (almost all the rest are 55+ though). Under the &quot;what mobs can we defeat slide&quot; on http://www.eqclanx.com/vision_files/frame.htm we are finishing up Tier 1 and looking for targets in Tier 2. <br />
<br />
We scout mobs pretty often (well, I and my officers do anyway) and we found Trakanon up last week. We gathered the forces, fought our way down, and because of some bad advice, wiped. CR'd and logged for the night (it was about 2:30-3:00 CST). We decided to go back a week later (thinking that someone prolly had come in that night and killed him), and lo and behold, no trak. So we kill Jumpy and the Protector and call it a night. I started asking around to other guilds around our same level and those slightly higher then us, and find out the Top SK on the server had solo'd him the previous afternoon. Trak had stayed up from Saturday to Thursday and was only killed because she had come and Solo'd him.<br />
<br />
Did I rant and rave? Do I hate her for doing that? Heck no. I scheduled a raid for this thursday and planned to go take him down (duh, patch got in the way of that).<br />
<br />
Suck it up and try harder. If you are one of the many people in lower tiered guilds who want to fight better and tougher content, work harder on your scouting. Get there before Uber_01 can come through and he is yours. Back when we needed VSR for our druids, I had camped (and still do have camped, because now we need VS for our Wizzy's) a 27 Rogue in the &quot;prep room&quot;. I logged in to find an EP+ guild killing VS, so marked the time, and my raid was IN the prep room when VSR popped the next day.<br />
<br />
I know this doesn't work like this on all mobs... but truly, is it so hard to find something to kill at your level?<br />
<br />
Stop whining when the High Ends get something new to do, and start farming the Ph@t L3wtz</div></div><hr />

I can sooooo see the GL of a Time guild say &quot; we have to kil Dozekar tonight or Heroes of Tomorrow will catch up with us..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only mobs that it's really feasible to kill to block people are the major bottle neck mobs like Emp to stop guilds from getting to VT, RZ to stop them getting to EPs, etc.  I don't know of any guilds that actually do that on Mith Marr but it's probably perceived that way when a guild farms a target like that for loot.<br />
<br />
PoP is typically worse when it comes to farming because a lot of mobs only drop 1 or 2 items.  Compare that to VT where mobs drop 4 items and you're looking at twice the farming in PoP to get everyone equipped...</div></div><hr />

Since they can't seem to release content fast enough to keep people happy, they should increase the rate of spawns on the existing raid targets.  If they did that then mobs being down all the time wouldn't be such a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but then on servers with a lower population guilds could farm uber droppers more often per week, gear faster and progress faster :P</div></div><hr />
