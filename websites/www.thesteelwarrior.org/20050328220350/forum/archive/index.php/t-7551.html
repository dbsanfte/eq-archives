<br />
Here's my guesses for order of difficulty right now.  I've never done many of the fights though.  They're listed from easiest to hardest.  Input is welcome.<br />
<br />
1.  Grummus<br />
2. Terris Thule<br />
3. Manaetic Behemoth<br />
4. Carprin Cycle (really didn't seem any harder than 2 or 3 though)<br />
5. Aerin Dar<br />
6. Vallon Zek (easier than previous bosses? We lack attempts against him, never up)<br />
7. Tallon Zek<br />
8. HoH Trials (Rydda Dar is the hardest one, I assume)<br />
9. Saryn (I guess Keeper of Sorrows is required too but easy?  Yellow con to 65 according to Alla's.)<br />
10. Mithaniel Marr<br />
11. Bertox<br />
12. Agnarr<br />
13. Rallos Zek<br />
14. Solusek Ro (I don't know if he's harder than RZ, but the RZ flag is needed first anyway)<br />
<br />
Based on this list, our top priority new targets are planned as the lesser Zeks, HoH trials, and Saryn.</div></div><hr />

Vallon is easy, compared to most of the bosses. Saryrn is also easy, if your raid is smart enough to get out of the way of the bird. Most people just don't comprehend that though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild is fairly smallish in terms of possible raid sizes (25-40 folks on any given raid) but we recently killed Aerin Dar on our first attempt (~36 folks), and Grummus on our first attempt in many months (~40 folks).<br />
<br />
I know with 40 we're not going to get *too* far, but would be nice to do what we can with what we have.  Most members are 65 with quite a few of us having 100+ AA.<br />

<br />
Difficulty of encounters do not follow the planar path.... If you know the scripts, they become pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Grummus - Mr Gimp No special script, AE's are pointless<br />
HoH Villagers - Easy<br />
HoH Nomads - Easy<br />
Carprin Cycle - Only hard part is splitting the twins<br />
Aerin Dar - Straight up dragon fight<br />
Tallon Zek - Ranged fight, wayyyy gimped<br />
Vallon Zek - Easy<br />
Terris Thule - TT is a wuss, only problem with her script is the adds, easy to deal with<br />
HoH Rydda Dar - Straight up dragon fight, but he can hit<br />
Maenetic Behemoth - complecated script, can catch you off guard if not done right<br />
Saryn - Long and tooooooo boring<br />
Agnarr - Great script - Agnarr is easy though<br />
Mithaniel Marr - Straight up fight, hard hitter, adds respawn fast<br />
Solusek Ro, Another gimp - I'd almost put him below MM, but he does have some HPS<br />
Bertox - HUGE rampage range, if not set up right, you can wipe the raid after spending an hour prep<br />
Rallos Zek - Awesome script - RZ is what PoP is all about<br />
Fennin Ro - Gimp, ranged fight, lotsa HPS<br />
Xegony - Longggggggg and boring. The time it takes will kill ya<br />
Corinav - Massive Adds unless you control the script properly<br />
The Rathe Council - Tough to break in, you fight multiple gods at the same time</div></div><hr />

VZ is the easiest god, tho getting to tactics is harder than Grummus.  VZ imo is a broke event, the 5 clones should all chain aggro, so that atleast he puts up a good challenge, and he shouldn't stay at the middle of the room until aggro'd, should have room-wide aggro so soon as he reclones, they attack the raid.  Kinda stupid to have 5 tanks each select a target before hand and then pull.. or getting a bard to FM/pull singles.   I think some of these events are really dependant on your guild's strength and weakness, Gods like Bert/MM are pretty much having a good tank/healers</div></div><hr />

<br />
Daabu contradicted this statement.  So do you need the RZ flag or not to engage solusek (the mob, not the zone)?<br />
<br />
I haven't fought Saryn yet, but I'm surprised you'd list him as even easier than Carprin cycle and the MB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saryrn is very easy, just a lot of clearing to get to her.<br />
<br />
The reason Carprin is harder is because:<br />
<br />
1) you have to kill all 3 of Carprin's guards at the same time w/o pulling Carp to the raid. If they aren't dead he's a bitch to kill.<br />
2) Ahvi (sp?) is where most fail because 1 death spawns 4 reavers and those reavers can turn into 200 very quick.<br />
3) Splitting Raex and Vindor can be hard if your monk catches a lot of 3.5k or 5k procs. Get both and once and your raid is pretty much gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daabu was mistaken. To fight SolRo the god, you need 32 people who have RZ flag and the 5 mini flags.<br />
 <br />
You do not need Agnarr for any activity in the SolRo zone.<br />
 <br />
Saryrn is very easy, easier than Terris Thule, IMO.  Hits the weakest of any god anywhere, and has a very simple script.  Doing the various tower encounters to reach Saryrn's room is not really any harder, just time consuming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a 10 minute breather and they walk away from each other and split themselves. Zero difficulty. Caprin is one of the easiest events since there are a few rooted bosses and rooted mobs are just insanely gimp. Clear mobs around them and take your rampage tank, some aggro caster, and a chanter down there to him. Memblur it while RT chain shoots it till you get memblur clear message and HoTt shows RT, have ench stop casting. Then RT can go home to raid. Then have like a paladin, ranger or SK or whoever sit there and chain cast some stuns, snares, fears, whatever for like 2 minutes. Move your raid into position, debuff it, start ch rot, when heals land have warrior hit taunt and have your casters burn it down in 20 seconds since you have insane monumental aggro.</div></div><hr />

4. Maidens Trial<br />

13. Mithaniel Marr<br />
-Huge single target melee, tons of hitpoints.<br />

-Huge melee on single target and rampage.  Lower hp than LMM, but still has a decent amount.<br />
<br />
15. Solusek Ro<br />
-Low melee (unless you don't slow him).  Some rampage damage mixed in there.  Blazzax the Omnified style AE damage, only a little more.<br />

16. Rallos Zek the Warlord<br />
-Best.  Script.  EVer.<br />
<br />
*ADDING*<br />
<br />
X)  The Seventh Hammer<br />
-Tier 1 &quot;God&quot; on Tier 3 difficulty.  Loot is great though.  Has some very nice melee damage, light but interesting AEs, bajillions of hitpoints, and... AE rampage. <br />
<br />
X)  Innoruuk<br />
-Great encounter once you figure it out.  Best RvR in the game.  Has some decent melee until you slow him, once you realize that slow will only land in melee range.  AE (and single target) grav fluxes, dispells, and AE Rampages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He pretty much attacks whoever is closest as long as your not low health. I personally just use 2 warriors that alternate when they get knockbacked and keep lots of pets on him and everyone else just range fights. Dps is gimp enough that healers switching between two unbuffed (dispells you with knockback, procs it so sometimes does more than one at once!) is quite easy.<br />
<br />
Can kill him with like 6 people using this to your advantage.</div></div><hr />

False.  Friend of mine had all flags except RZ and Sol Ro.  He could zone into tower and zone up to Sol Ro's room without being 85'd and got his Sol Ro flag.</div></div><hr />

We beat carprin cycle on our first try after having only killed the tier 1 bosses before that and it didn't seem very hard at all.  So I have to rank that one fairly low.</div></div><hr />

I killed him my first time with 36 (non VT non EP). The fear is only once a minute and if celrics have 500mr they will resist it quite easily so a Ch rot works fine. Have a beastlord spam cure the MT of her dot with abolish disease. Since I only have a handful of healers and tanks that arent really equipped to tank her rampage, I made sure to get 3 enchanter pets on rampage and have 2 druids heal them. As long as you can control that you will win np assuming you have some OK dps.</div></div><hr />

RZ has been nerfed sooooooooooo badly its barely the same event as 2 years ago.<br />

Of course Time &amp; Gear &amp; AA chances the way you look at things.<br />

I was in his apartment ~two weeks ago when he got his Sol Ro flag.  I watched him not yet in any group click up to sol ro's room.  I watched him get his sol ro flag.  I watched him check his flags and confirm that RZ was all he was missing for elemental access after the raid.<br />
<br />
Edit: maybe your toon is bugged, maybe my friend's berserker was bugged, I dunno, all I am saying is he does not have RZ and had no problem clicking up to Sol Ro's room.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
He was in the raid I bet. You don't have to be grouped.<br />
<br />
No he wasn't in the raid.  I'll clarify further, he got a phone call that the raid was going on, he logged on, ran to sol ro, ran up and clicked up to sol ro's tower.  No group, no raid, no RZ flag.</div></div><hr />

Considering the difficulty (of staying awake) clearing to Saryn, i'd say she's right where she belongs, until of course we bent the rules and learned to drag/res and bypass the entire ordeal.  And VZ would be a pretty challenging encounter if he auto aggro'd you once the trigger spawn is hurt, as of now, he's gimped cuz you can prepare for each wave before hand.</div></div><hr />

I'd say move VZ to the first slot. He can practically be done with 2 groups, and I've done him with 18-24 people many many times, it's why he's never up. Saryrn is a very, very is (if horribly long) raid. Put her up before MB (where 1 mistake of various types shoots you down for 3 days). Agnarr as well is very easy if you have his strategy down, so I'd opt to put him before MM. Did RZ with 39 people but then again it was an AMAZINGLY well run raid. Haven't gotten around to getting my minis yet so I can't say how hard SolRo is. This would put my revised list at:<br />

Raids start at about 8:30 est pretty consistently.  There aren't enough people on very long before that to do much and by late night, most are gone.  So... how do we EVER find VZ up?  It's a required flag mob, but they made it so easy for a couple groups who know what they're doing to kill that he's dead all time, or at least it seems like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no way SolRo should be after RZ.  By the time you can access SolRo, he basically falls over dead and hands you his loots.  Even RZTW alone without the adds is harder than SolRo, in my opinion.  I would put SolRo just after Agnarr, personally.</div></div><hr />

I think you need RZ+Sol Ro for PoFire access (once you already have Sol Ro tower access).</div></div><hr />

Having done it now, I'm puzzled why people ranked him as hard as they did.  With a large raid force we thought he was a joke.  I was supposed to be MT though I spent more time running back to TZ after getting thrown all over the place (got tossed about 20 times) than I did actually tanking.  It still wasn't an issue.  He wasn't putting out enough dps to be a problem.  That was our first attempt and I think one person died.  Our Aerin Dar and Carprin kills were far more challenging.  Maybe there's a way it can go bad?  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, whenever TZ sends a shot or two at the softer people, they tend to die in bunches.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you had a lucky first attempt, or you guys were really on the ball, because TZ is certainly not a walk in the park.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lost aggro on a regular basis.  I was picking myself off the walls, the balcony, down the hallway, etc.  I spent more time running back to TZ then anything.  Many other people took hits from arrows, but most survived.  They'd get hit once and then aggro would ping pong to someone else.  Just like I'd get hit by some TZ melee, struck hard by an effect, and launched across the room.  Then aggro would bounce again until I got back to him and launched again.  <br />

We were also spread out all over the place so no large group of people could get taken out at once.</div></div><hr />

As he turns and faces people have them just move out of the way he is facing, then when he moves they go back to there corners. This may sound crazy but its very effective.</div></div><hr />

That's why you did fine.  It's a simple tactic in hindsight, but a big leap for most guilds who are accustomed to huddling together for group heals/buffs.  Any clump of people that contains a high aggro person is vulnerable to being slaughtered.</div></div><hr />
