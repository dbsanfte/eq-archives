<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gutsheild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw a thread on this msg board that had the AAs for warriors broken down into raid AAs and group AAs, and i am trying to decide what route to go. i have all my defensive AAs ( ID/LR/CS/CA/PE/planare power/po=lanar durability, and currently working on SE 3. i have right now 122 AAs.<br />
<br />
i was wondering if anyone had the link to that thread for the raid and group AAs broken down down. and what AAs would help my mitigation. i tried searching the threads..and reading thorugh about 30 of them with no luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There aren't any group/raid AA's that help with avoidance/mitigation. If you click on them in the leadership window it will say what each of them do. I think the closest you are going to get is the hitpoint AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think Gut isa referring to the warrior class aa's being divided into group and raid columns.<br />
<br />
If i were you Gut, i'd get some WA. Procs are TH3 win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You've got all your defensive AA (well, after the last bit of SE), so there's no more AA that will help with your mitigation.  It's all equipment now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gutsheild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well thanks guys for your help, and thats what i was afraid of was that i was done with all my mitigation stuff.  maybe in oow there will be something. any news on the AA that will be coming out with oow? not that ill be getting any of those Aa im sitiing at 128 right now =(</div></div><hr />
