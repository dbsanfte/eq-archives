<br />
maybe a blood lust skill where you do more dmg or agro as you kill more things in a row, maybe blood points system, i kill 3 mobs i can unleash a super attack or something. how about a axe handle smash? its a very basic move taught to all soilders in the middle ages. maybe being able to &quot;twist the knife&quot; basicly what im saying is lets get some new inovative crap coming from sony instead of the constant retuning of a system that relys on the broken walking stick of a dice roll, or instead of ignoring us or making promisses and we dont hear about them ever again like they got whacked by the mafia<br />
<br />
(btw i heard stuns just got narfed, is it true? please let it be true)<br />

&lt;listens to gorillaz - clint eastwood while comtenplating the future of warriors, im useless but not for long :) &gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Paladins got a new spell, but it fills a gap.  Previously, the only pre-60 spell that could be used to stun 55+ mobs knocked those same mobs back about ten feet.  Since that's something that tends to take the melee classes by surprise (particularly the rogues, who suddenly discover that the mob is behind them), putting in a stun that works on the same level mobs and doesn't have the knockback is a good thing for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great, Paladins had a gap in their spell line up.  It's good that SoE filled in that little hole for the Pallys, no beef with it what so ever.  But it seems to me that the Warrior class is in need of a little attention as well.  And I would think that it would take just a bit more priority than filling in small spell gap that people have been working around with very little problem for months.<br />
<br />
It is very frustrating to watch class after class receive little upgrades/fixes/improvements and so forth while your class just languishes in the corner, apparently ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The difference is that the problem with warrior agro is a much more difficult problem to fix than a simple hole in the paladin spell line-up.<br />
<br />
Sure, the devs can make a make an across the board change and say that warriors now generate ten times more agro as they previously did with every swing.  Yes, it would &quot;solve&quot; the problem from the warrior PoV (i.e. they wouldn't be overlooked as tanks), but it would also put the paladins back to Kunark (no idea what it would do to shadowknights).<br />
<br />
What the new paladin spell means is that on the odd chance that you actually group with a paladin (and as a paladin, I love grouping with warriors - I get the early agro build up with a couple of stuns, and then I let the warrior taunt it off me.  It uses the advantages of both classes, and means the slower doesn't get turned into paste if the taunt takes a bit to stick.), you don't have to go looking for the mob every time the paladin fires off a stun to interrupt the level 57 caster.<br />
<br />
Yes, warrior agro is a significant issue, but that doesn't mean that development in every other facet of the game should come to a screeching halt while the problem is examined.  Simple fixes for simple problems, like the new stun spell, should still be implemented as they crop up.  The big issues (and warrior agro is hopefully the biggest right now) will be looked at regardless.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Regarding the &quot;stun nerf&quot; rumors.<br />
<br />
This has been circulating around for a while.  The first trigger for the rumor was the inclusion of the comments in the spell descriptions.  Spells now include descriptions that tell you what the spells do (or at least give hints - my alt had to educate a paladin the other night about the fact that Lull was useless once combat had started).  The descriptions of the stun spells mention which levels the stuns no longer stun.  The initial assumption by many when this popped up on Lucy (while the descriptions were still on Test) led some to believe that the lower level stuns would have no effect on mobs over 55.  i.e. they currently don't stun high level mobs, but some thought the spells would no longer be able to be cast - much as some spells (such as Lull) simply will not start to cast if the target is too high of a level.  Then after people were able to check the spells on test, they found that the spells could still be cast, and therefore generate agro, on any mob in the game.<br />
<br />
There was a minor change, although its pretty inconsequential.  Whereas low level stuns could previously be used to stun/interrupt level 55 mobs, now they can only be used to stun/interrupt mobs up to level 54.  No idea on why that happened, and it doesn't mean anything to agro.<br />
<br />
When Force of Akera turned up on Test, some people once again believed this would herald in a stun nerf.  The new stun doesn't damage mobs (one problem with QWoT, the other post 55 stun that's available in the 50s, is that it damages mobs, meaning you can't use it to gain agro on mezzed mobs).  However, its now gone live, and the old stuns still seem to be working the same as always.<br />
<br />
It is possible that the devs are planning on eventually implementing the &quot;stun nerf&quot;, and the introduction of Force of Akera is the forerunner of this, but the new stun honestly does fill a gap in the spell line-up, and its possible that's all the new stun was for.</div></div><hr />

Which is all well and good.  But understand, the Warrior class is a very simple one from a player's perspective.  We really only have so much we can do.  Either we tank or we log, there really aren't much in the way of alternatives because frankly most people won't pick up a Warrior strickly for DPS if any number of other classes are available.   Right now our ability to tank is hindered, which means our ability to play.  Which also means our entertainment is reduced which brings into question our justification for paying our monthly fees.  We as a class have been extremely patient all things considered.  Yet not only do we have no official word when a fix might be forth coming, we don't even have official word that they're working on it.  Meanwhile, Paladins get a hole in their spell line up fixed.  It just makes you want to spit, ya know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The purpose of the Warrior class may be simple from a player perspective, but that doesn't mean that the solution to the current problem is necessarily simple.  Paladins and Shadowknights exist primarily to get and keep agro, as well.  You want to fix the Warrior agro problem, but you don't want to do so in such a fashion that you merely switch the knights and the Warriors - i.e. make the Warriors in vogue while the knights stay out in the cold.<br />
<br />
<br />
And it is still possible that Force of Akera is the lead-in to a forthcoming stun nerf.  If (and its still a big if) such an event takes place in the future, you want to fix the holes in the stun line-up first.  You'll also want to implement a similar &quot;fix&quot; to the Shadowknight class, or all you'll have done is made the Shadowknights, and only the Shadowknights, the premier tank class in Norrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
In short, even if it is the lead-in to a future nerf, such things take time to implement properly or you end up with an even bigger mess than the one you started with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides, as I've mentioned 3 or 4 times in this post already, I view the new stun as a good thing for warriors, as well, as it means that I can now interrupt casters without making every melee character in the group reposition themselves.  It doesn't fix the agro problem, but that doesn't mean that warriors don't get a benefit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what?  I rarely group with a Paladin.  The majority of Warriors rarely group with a Paladin.  Why?  Because it's a duplication of function and for the most part it isn't done.  It would be like having two Clerics in a group or two Enchanters.  Occassionally it may happen, but it isn't the common scenario by any stretch.  So your nifty new spell means just about jack for me and most Warriors.  Gratz on getting it, but don't try and paint it as some kind of indirect improvement for Warriors, it's not.<br />

Yes, yes, this is all well known and understood.  Regardless of the complexity of the problem it's a major stumbling block in our enjoyment of the game.  It needs to be fix and the sooner the better.  They slam in all sorts of fixes all the time for things which are substantially less important and have dramatic negative impact.  What's one more, more or less?  At least then we'd be sure it was even being worked on.</div></div><hr />

I am glad this is the outhouse so i can flame ignorance(not the player but just plain stupidty). tanking is taking damage from melee attacks, tanking then, REQUIRES agro, and to hold it long enough to get hurt.<br />
<br />
I am thinking you are a pally or a SK, let me tell you, you are NOT WARRIOR, your NOT a CLERIC, you are NOT a NECRO if your EATHER of those classes, you are ment to fill a HOLE as you are a jack of 2 trades and MASTER of NONE. Do NOT tell me anymore that you should get duel wield if we get any improvment( something i hear alot, i know he didnt mention it) because then i could say i want your LoH or HT, i mean you should suffer a little for the rewards you got for not being able to pick a pure class<br />
<br />
Your role in a group ISNT agro if your a pally you are ment to do secondary DSP much like a rogue does(i call it secondary because you arnt ment for attention) and to stun mobs to STOP THEM from CHing or casting a really strong harmful spell, SoE never intended you to use stuns to get agro and i think its a damn shame that a cockup like this was let thru test<br />
<br />
If your a SK you are also ment for secondary DSP and your ment to use DoT/slows and also provide some excellent nukes to undead, you arnt a tank, but SKs arnt my beef here they cant take my agro if they want to die i dont care, i dont normally see them standing toe to toe with the mob like i do, this is because they dont have godly self buffs like in the case of the paladin which allows them to catch up to my hp/ac in almost any situation<br />

DPS Just like a rogue except for being half a large.  I now see the vision warriors are striving for.<br />

Slows?!? Damn, I levelled that shaman for nothing.  Or did you mean snares?<br />
<br />
And I know that 49 necros get invites in planar groups (like, say, where a 60 SK would be invited for /snicker DPS) for their leet DPS from DoTs.  Wait, they don't.<br />
