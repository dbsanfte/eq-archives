This build is specifically for PVP and is intended for a Level 60 Warrior. I don't think it would be prudent to start trying to build this until you're 60 because you lose quite a bit of dps from the Fury shouts.<br />
<br />
So let me quickly state the pro's and cons :<br />
<br />
Pros<br />
<br />
-Maintain a good natural crit rate or mastery for whatever weapon you choose.<br />
-Have as much AC as a Prot build, excluding the defensive skills and mastery.<br />
-Get a great skill : Concussion Blow (In my opinion, outweighs the usefullness of Sweeping Strikes or MS for PVP currently)<br />
-Get yet another stunning skill, although hard to dish out - Improved Revenge<br />
-Get to use Bloodrage more often with less danger because of Improved Bloodrage (lowers the health cost of the skill)<br />
-Get passive resists against Charm (Fear?) and Stun. Though I don't exactly know how resists work with those stats.<br />
-Have some of the useful attack skills Arms tree : Improved Rend, Deep Wounds<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
<br />
-You lose quite a bit of DPS from not getting the Fury skills (If you were Fury Build) and Improved Battle Shout. You also lose some DPS from getting only 4% of 2H Specialization.<br />
-You don't get Mortal Strike or Sweeping Strikes<br />
-Concussion blow has a 45 second cooldown (Ridiculous for a talent I think)<br />
-As a previous Prot build, you'd miss out on higher tiered protection skills like : 1H Mastery, Improved Disarm, Last Stand, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Coming from an early prot build, then to Arms/Fury, I realized quickly that a Warrior can be useful in any stance for PVP. The key factor in winning though, as a warrior especially, is disabling your opponent. Though you lose a bit of DPS if you were Fury or some of the duration talents for your Prot skills if you were Prot build, you do maintain a  good crit rate that is both important in PVP and PVE. You also gain the use of concussion blow, which, even with it's long cooldown, can actually turn the tide of battle especially in smaller confrontations. <br />
<br />
The 10% more AC will also undoubtedly help in any situation. Not to mention the extra Charm and Stun resistance. <br />
<br />
Improved Revenge, although a quite isolated move, would actually snap off often because classes like Rogues would dodge quite a lot. I actually think Improved Revenge is better than Improved Overpower. I mean, the stun is 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Again, this build is only viable with the current patch and only when you're already level 60. Go Arms/Fury if you wanna kill or Prot if you wanna be the instance king before then. You're not gonna have the talent points to get the most useful skills till you're 60 anyway. <br />
<br />
Which leads me to another topic/complaint -- Tactical Mastery is a necessity now... WHY do we need to have it as a talent? Can't it just be inherent to free us a few more talent points? <br />
<br />
Again, this is a suggestion of mine. I've used all the skills I have above when I was in different builds. I find that those skills were the ones I used and relied on the most when I played in those different builds. Of course, if you prefer different weapons or skills such as 1H mastery, you can modify the build to still give you the best aspects and not lose it's integrity.<br />
<br />
This build has a crit/Arms edge because in my time playing, I've found that especially in PVP, the Arms tree is one of the most useful trees to have with you.<br />
<br />
If this has been done a lot before, sorry for missing out on people's suggestions. Really though, on my server, most people are Arms/Fury, Fury/Arms, or Arms/Prot. This build is technically Arms/Prot, but it doesn't go deep enough into any tree to get the 'Ultimates' that most builds usually do. I actually think our 'Ultimates' are mediocre right now at best. But of course, you guys can show me how MS or SS should be used in a PVP battle and I'll try it. From my experience though, Bloodthirst was probably the talent that had the most noticeable effects.<br />
<br />
I know... or hope that the Warrior will get some good changes coming and that could turn this whole build obsolete, but currently, I see it as being very useful especially in PVP.<br />
<br />
Suggestions? Ideas?</div></div><hr />

So you don't like being the prot specced instance bitch either? Lot's of people are starting to say it's a necessity. It concerns me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You don't really NEED to be spec'd for instances until about your 50s, you'll tank fine before then. Some people will notice, but it's certainly not a necessity.<br />
<br />
I just interpreted that you wanted a pvp build, but I just skimmed your writing, so I'm sure someone will point out what I'm not seeing.<br />
<br />
This isn't EQ where pvp fights can last a while, most people are dead within 20 seconds at the most, so burst DPS is a priority.</div></div><hr />

Of course you can't be doing stuff like using Mortal Strike which would give it away immediately.<br />
<br />
I mean, I've been in groups where the healers apparently don't heal in instances, and that certainly seems like a bigger obstacle than not having +15% aggro in defensive stance or whatever you get out of the defensive tree.  People are more concerned with having this and that talent or class as opposed to whether the people in your party actually knows what's going on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you don't even need protection outside of raids.  It certainly lets you take a bit more beating but.. I really think that the damage boost (fury is a -very- hefty one properly equipped) you get from the other trees weighs more in your favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rodocite</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive been looking into other builds and looking at comparing it to my first post recently. at 58, ive actively started using MS a lot more as well as SS instead of feeling like they were draining my rage. I have to say that though MS was nerfed bad, it, as an instant attack really is useful for us warriors. <br />
<br />
i take back what i said before when i described MS as mediocre. its still an excellent skill. as for the build i posted, ive come to the conclussion that concussion blow is not worth it-- however, the 10% damage reduction IS worth putting a few points in prot. Maybe even go as far as last stand.<br />
<br />
I also am starting to think that enrage is an awesome passive skill. I looked at how often I was being critted and it happens more often than not especially in pvp where were up against human players who focus on crit for their melee. <br />
<br />
at max, enrage is 40% added damage bonus for 4 strikes. that is a huge damage bonus for us. couple that with MS and a crit or execute and a crit, or cleave and sweeping strikes while critting again, and thats some major damage. <br />
<br />
i think for now i will stay arms and maybe sooner switch to drop my demoralizing talent and get enrage than to switch prot. <br />
<br />
i think that the necessity for us tanking in later instances isnt to become more prot based but to simply equip a shield. i mean i think i handle aggro effectively, but since i dont have a shield, i do take more damage. i think that the damage mitigation increase from an excellent shield will fix most of those tanking problems. <br />
<br />
i do have to say, usage of all stances CONSTANTLY is needed for a warrior especially in pvp. thats really what confuses me. im used to switching stances, but i do see a ton of prot based classes who dont even seem to have TM and claiming they have a lot of success. <br />
<br />
our class needs so much finesse and balance. its kinda contradictory to what most would perceive a 'warrior' is.<br />
<br />
Edit: I also wanted to add that in my opinion as of late, i dont think  the warrior was nerfed so much as to be totally gimped. I've realized our class is totally viable and effective. There are glaring problems that need to be addressed though, such as our skill tree being sort of awkward, some skills not being as effective as they should be for the cost, miss rates, etc-- However, our class, though you can't notice it now, i think will really shine when things are refined a bit. A lot of the balancing we do to our characters will pay off when blizzard finally starts listening to the complaints and suggestions of the warrior population.<br />
<br />
Oh and one more thing, I hear about fury a lot. What would a Fury Warrior's equip be like? How about the build? NinjaBurger posted a Fury build, but it didn't have Blood Thirst. To my understanding, Blood Thirst is one of the main damage dealing skills right?</div></div><hr />
