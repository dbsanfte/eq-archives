Nice deep purple.<br />
<br />
Of course, there's a lot of posers around copying it, so I don't know how long my color scheme will remain.</div></div><hr />

There are waaaaayyyyy too many color blind or stupid people out there making pink and lime green colored armor suits.  It hurts my eyes when I have to look at these abominations.  You are a warrior.  Warriors adapt to what they find to use in all situations.  Be happy that we are so versatile and can use such a variety of gear.  Leave it the way you found it and be happy that it provides protection for you.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of exceptions I would be willing to make however if they invent transparent dye.  Azlana should immediately dye all of her armor then ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for colors, I'm still trying to figure out what color goes with grey on Kritta. Gnomes just can't wear some colors without being the rump of jokes.<br />
<br />
*mutter mutter* I know, I know. Jokes don't need color. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Friend says he looks like bat mite.<br />
<br />
Heh.<br />
<br />
For my monk I tried to combine dark green and black for the commando monk style look.<br />
<br />
It backfired, as I get asked for SoW all the time now. Human in dark green chain and leather is obviously a druid or ranger right?<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Then again I caught another monk in bazaar with green/black commando style.<br />
<br />
I felt violated.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can check Lucy for all those combinations for any armor.<br />
<br />
I also agree that dyes are bad..worst choice ever for the game.  I spent a long time being able to judge how useful someone was gonna be to my cause just by looking at them.  Back in the day, the uber warriors wore blue, the ones who had quit for awhile and just came back were wearing Indy brown, and the gimps were wearing orange.<br />
<br />
Guess i'm just old fashioned.</div></div><hr />

130, 70, 40 is a good one (Copper)<br />

My armor is all primer grey.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing that gets me is there are 2 schools of thought on dyes: eyesore colour schemes and monotone black. I hate loud colours (although as one of my guilds MT's I try and use something that makes me stand out) and I'm not a freaking rogue...<br />
<br />
BTW Mekil joo sux0rz ughre :p</div></div><hr />
