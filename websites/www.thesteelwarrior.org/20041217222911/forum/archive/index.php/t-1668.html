<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dantek</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find myself L64 with hardly any raid experience behind me.  Being an ogre warrior, I'm a fairly natural choice to be asked to tank mobs.  The raid alliance on Vazaelle I'm with does SSRA, BP in the Deep, Dain in Thurg, KT in KD and ST quite often.  Some of these mobs in these places rampage, and I'm at a loss as to what to do.  People have tried to explain it to me (but due to language problems, I don't often understand what their trying to say, in guild/raid chat there are English speakers plus many non native English speakers, but most of the uber tanks are non native English speakers), and also due my lack of experience, I have a hard time understanding what I'm supposed to do, when it comes to being the rampage tank.  I know I'm supposed to get rampage, but how is this done?  Also they talk about another tank taking rampage after the first rampage tank or main tank dies, this is the one I completely don't understand, can someone enlighten me please?<br />
<br />
P.S Hi to everyone from the new tank on the board!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Ssra, you can set up rampage very easily, due to the rampaging mobs being rooted (save Emperor).<br />
<br />
What you need to do it quite simple. take Mr. MT and Mr. RT into the room where the rooted snake sits. Bring and enchanter too, for mem blur. Then the both of you (MT/RT, not the enchanter, cannot stress this enough) start shooting arrows at the snake. Make sure you don't have any bard songs on. Also make sure noone except MT and RT are in LoS (line of sight) of the mob prior to engage.<br />
<br />
After a few stacks of arrows, the both of you run up to melee range of the mob to trigger a rampage. Everything should be working fine now, so at engage, run up with the MT and start swinging to keep the rampage on you, but not get aggro (not that important since you're gonna get healed anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, during a short period at the start of a fight the mob decides who it hates most based on who's done damage so far, wether a bard is singing in range, heals dropped on MT etc. that 'Rampage list' stays 'fairly' constant during a fight, rampage attacks are applied against the next most hated target(s) on that list to the MT (who should, in effect, head it). Typically if your Main tank goes down the Rampage tank gets promoted to MT and the rampages shift down to the next person below him on the list. <br />
<br />
What people try to do is stack the rampage list so that the people they WANT getting hit (usually warriors or other plate tanks for their high durability) take the rampage.... Choppin gives one example of that above....<br />
