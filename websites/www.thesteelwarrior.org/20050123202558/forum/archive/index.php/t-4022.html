<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Turgin</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was camping Stormfeather this weekend.  Started Friday evening after work.  Get tired of it about 11:00p so I make a druid and run him to the hill where the gnomes spawn, sit him down and hide him.  Come back Saturday morning and check my log.  SF had been killed around 11:20p Friday night ARGHHH.  So, I make another little druid on my Bazaar mule account and park him there just to observe.  I go play my warrior a bit.  Have some stuff to do around the house so I move the warrior back to SF camp and go semi-AFK watching and listening.  Nothing all day Saturday.  Camp my warrior there Saturday night and leave the druid.  Get up about 7:30a Sunday morning and check the log on the druid.  No SF.  Log the warrior back in just before 8:00a.  Sit there killing cougars, making arrows, etc, etc to pass the time.  At about 10:15a I decide to go AFK a minute and get a drink.  Guess what?  SF popped and was killed in the 3 minutes I was AFK.  Killed by a level 52 rogue that had just ran up to the camp and I was chatting with.  He had been there about 15-20 minutes.   <br />

I see that guy up practically every time I port my wizard in there.  He assuredly is not the suckiest camp in EQ.  Bitch slap me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />

About an 18 hour spawn and skips spawns according to my research.<br />

Oh what a dwarf will do for haste...</div></div><hr />

You will get exp while you do it.  You also will get an item with 30% clicky haste instead of 20%.  At lvl 63 there isn't a lot of good exp spots that you can do without a slower which means you have spell haste already.<br />
<br />
/shrug, just my thoughts anyway.</div></div><hr />

Shitiest camp in the game by far.. and its 18hrs 40 minuts on the dot.. can and does skip, but never skips more than twice.<br />
<br />
edit: OMG I forgot /beer.. somebody shoot me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasco</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That 18 hour respawn on Stormfeather is wrong, I have camped him twice now and went by what someone had posted on the old board for his spawn time... 32 hours. I also have found that he does have a variance to his spawn time, +/- 2 hours. So sticking to the 32 +/-2 hours I have seen SF many times, though I did not get to kill him due to someone else being there ahead of me.<br />
<br />
Honestly though you should look into getting ornate gauntlets, better and longer lasting clicky haste, unless of course you are set on geting the eyepatch.<br />
<br />
So to anyone else camping him just remeber these few things, SF is NOT an 18 hour respawn, he is a 32+/-2 hour respawn, SF does NOT skip spawns, most  importantly, make friends with who ever is camping him, if you can get a time of death from them you'll have a leg up on ALOT of other people who are camping him. Also if you just want to stand there with your' warrior to camp him, stand underneath the tree just  a tad NW of the gambling gnomes, and look to the north, no coguars will aggro you and you'll be looking directly at SFs spawn point. One last thing, he is NOT up on server reset. :(<br />
<br />
Hope that helps you and anyone else who's starting to go insane camping him. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MaxiVisVires</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SF is the worst camp ever. My roomate camped it for 170 hours (1 ks... and 4 server crashes). When it was my turn to do it for my warrior I cringed. Day 1... nothing. People came to the camp to check if it was up, and they saw me and were like... heh, when you fall asleep... The night was long, but hey I had to sleep. Woke up next day, nobody at camp, no SF either. Hmmm... had my roomate camp him while I went to class (bribed him with lunch). Come back, still no SF... 1am rolls along, still no SF. What I do? Take a female druid (the cougars won't attack her), put all the music volume down but crank the fx volume way up. Go to sleep. Sure enough, I heard my little Jezebel's cries of pain around 4am. /q'd and logged in the warrior. Took out SF and got my map piece. Total camp of 32 hours. Well worth it... back then heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stormfeather is an 18 hour 40 minute spawn time.. I have camped this for 2 of my characters as well as countless friends, I personally have witnessed 14 SF kills and I can say with great certainty that it is 18 hour's 40 minutes with no varience. and does skip.. I have seen him pop 18hr 40 min's after last kill.. 37hr 20min's after last kill and 56hr's after kill.. this was with myself and my roomate watching the spawn 24/7 and the only downtime being trips to the crapper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok for some reason it says I cant edit my post so typo correction<br />
<br />
56 hr's = 58 hr's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasco</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... when did you do the marathon camp of Stormfeather?... over a year ago? I would also like to hear how you apply that 18 hour 40 minute theory to my latest killing of SF.<br />
<br />
On 11-01-03 at 1:30am I watch SF die. The camp is now mine. At 8am 11-02-03 I see SF spawn.<br />
<br />
30.5 hour respawn... seems to fit into the 32+/-2 hour respawn &quot;theory&quot; to me. Now I don't know if the respawn on every server is the same... mabey it's not, mabey it is. But hearing from people on message boards and in game, I don't think I've ever heard of anyone ever seeing him spawn around the 18 hour mark with in the last year. I'm just posting what has worked for me, and everyone is going to believe in their own theorys on SFs spawn time, to each their own I say.</div></div><hr />

was a 16 hour camp, turn your speakers on piss off the nabor's and listen for wings flapping, have your spotter be a vah shir, the cougers wont attack you and you dont have to hide</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've just had those other map pieces in my bank for so long now and I want to finish it.</div></div><hr />
