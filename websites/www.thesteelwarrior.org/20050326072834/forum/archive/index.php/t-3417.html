I do it mostly for fun and to collect augments, but have won a few mostly by luck.  Have 65 war, 65 dru, 62 shammy, 59 cleric.<br />
<br />
What I am specifically looking for is advice on which LDoN zones are easy (especially single pulls and physically small) to manage for a smallish, botted group.  <br />
<br />
I have no problem bailing immediately on tough zones and grabbing a new adventure.  <br />
<br />
I have compiled the following list so far:<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Hidden Vale - easiest so far.  no lulling and only pulled more than one (got two) twice.  nice small zone.<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Bloodied Quarries - not tragic, but requires some lulling to get through some rooms.<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Barracks of War - bail, multiples every time.<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Arena of Chance - bail, multiples every time.<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Gladiator Pits - not tragic pulling, some multiples needing lull.  Zone is very large (raid zone).<br />
<br />
Deepest Guk: Accursed Sanctuary - bail, multiples every time.<br />

 i guess thats why theres as many people who have tried mistmoore as tak+ruj+mira on my server seems odd to me,cause i think the lack of clr's in mira makes it really easy</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a blast in mistmoore and find its the easiest to pull.  Normally i can Pacify with the Chanter, pull with the warrior.  If I try to Get the 62 Chanter pet in for Dps then I pull with the chanter using slow.<br />
<br />
If I get a Multi pull the warrior Tanks one while the chanter mezzes and if i get more than 2 its Double tank and mezz one.  I have tanked up to 3 at once but the cleric was doing some serious fast heals.<br />
<br />
I began doing this when the warrior and druid were both 62, the Chanter was 61, and the cleric 60.<br />
<br />
Now the 4 are 64, 64, 62, and 61.  Omg is cleric exp slow.  <br />
<br />
So far I have 20ish Augs including one 12hp aug, BUT not one Sta aug yet /cry.<br />
<br />
And FYI I dont 4box to win,  just do it for exp, serious cash, Named mobs (loot) and Augs.</div></div><hr />

It's the only dungeon without a sowable type mob which means you don't have to worry about getting beat up pulls (if done from range) or runners (not that there are very many mobs in there that run).  The mobs are spaced far enough that you can usually pull safely, and everything is in relative clear view so you don't have 5 mobs pop out from behind a wall like Guk.</div></div><hr />

Didnt have any clerics etc. Was basically my SK and some rangers tanking as well. We didnt die cause the mobs are laughable, but MM was adding like no tomorrow last night.</div></div><hr />

I mean, my husband and I both 2box and it's great cause we have this automatic group ready to go whenever we want to play, but even we are realistic enough to allow that there are times 4 different people would be more effective.  But it's such a benefit to just be able to get on and do whatever we want and the down side isn't enough to even take any of the fun away.  I know I've gotten so used to 2boxing when one of my characters is alone they get rather lonely.  But 4?  I've gotten all our chars on occassionally before my husband got home from work and got them all buffed up and ready to go in pok and just that is rather a chore.  I can't imagine actually trying to run all 4.<br />
<br />
Is it just like a benefit thing?  You use each char for a few things or do you manage to have each character doing everything they could?  And if you do manage that how??  Realistically you only have 2 hands.  I can do different things on both my chars at the same time, but there's no way I can think of to get past the part where you've got 4 chars, and still only 2 hands.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't do Guk with a four-box.  Ever.  Takish would also be difficult since you couldn't ghetto mez with the large percentage of casters.<br />

I think MM is thought to be the easiest by the masses.  I find Mir to be pretty simple and expect places like The Grand Library will only become easier since the patch message noted having fewer mobs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You claim I want to know this so I can do it, even tho I have no interest in doing it.  Yet you know all about where to get whatever to do 6boxing lol.  I've seen people do any number of things I didn't know how to do or were unable to do in life.  I'm curious.  So I ask.  I've seen friends of mine 3box in a druid or somthing and it looked like a giant pain in the arse.  Any more than 2 characters would take the fun away for me.  I never even thought of a macro program nor would I wish to use one.  I just looked at the 4 pcs my husband and I use and thought &quot;geez, I'd be useless trying to do that and wouldn't even want to.&quot;  I even said in my post that just buffing 4 chars occassionally was a chore to me.  I wouldn't enjoy playing 3 much 4 as the original poster said or 6 as YOU suggest.  The whole 6boxing thing was entirely your idea, and I don't see why you are trying to make it look as if it would be something I want to know or as if I even care.<br />
<br />
The reason I don't normally post much is because people like you who want to get offended, jump to conclusions, start arguements where you have to pretend someone said or meant something they didn't, and generally make boards not fun.  Another reason I don't post much is because I actually enjoy PLAYING the game.  I check out boards for info, because I like to learn things, and because it takes my w2k pc forever to load with all the goodies in it.   <br />
<br />
I've a 64 almost 65 warrior, a 64 almost 65 cleric, and various other characters (all my original) and have been playing this game since before luclin, and watched my husband play it since it came out.  I refused to play on dial up, I like things to work at least reasonably well... and he'd die all the time due to LD and lag.  Which is why I couldn't even imagine 4boxing.  I actually like the game.  <br />
<br />
You can call me childish because I pointed out that you are wasting space with assinine comments.  I'm sorry, if you find someone stating the truth childish.  You don't see yourself acting childish by ranting and raving and making assumptions that don't even make sense in light of the facts?  Did you even read my post?  I'm pretty sure you either didn't or did not understand it.  If you did read it you would know that I thought 4boxing wouldn't work well, or at least efficiently.  Yet here you are sending links to 6boxing and acting as if I care?<br />
<br />
Would that you would have just taken your new found attention and left with it.  Then we wouldn't have to watch you have your little spaz fest.  Do you have any idea how immature you make yourself look?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xasam</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe to get this thread back on track...<br />
<br />
4boxing in adventures is actually pretty easy with the toons I have.  Goes kinda like this:<br />
<br />
1.  (optional) Cleric lulls to pull singles or doubles.<br />
2.  Shammy sends pet in and slows.<br />
3.  Druid snares.<br />
4.  Everyone (including cleric) nukes.<br />
<br />
If I pull 2 I just root one out of the way.  If I pull 3 I AE slow and then working on rooting 2.  If I pull 4 (rarely) I succor.<br />
<br />
What may be key is that I get the easier mobs because of having 65, 65, 62 and 59 in group.   <br />
<br />
I am still doing orcs and have switched to rescues.  My record is 4 win/4 ot win/1 loss doing rescues.  The one loss is because the zone was huge and after killing 60 mobs still wasn't too the person.   Oddly enough the rescue mob tends to be near the front and I often finish in less than an hour.<br />
<br />
And no, I don't use any macroing software because I have 4 computers...don't need it.<br />
<br />
My new list of Ruk zones is like this:<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Hidden Vale - easiest so far.  no lulling and only pulled more than one (got two) twice.  nice small zone.<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Arena of Chance - bail, big and hard to single<br />
<br />
Deepest Guk: Accursed Sanctuary - bail, hard to single<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Gladiator Pits - easy to pull.  pits have more multiples (but not bad)<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Halls of War - entrance has bad multiples, but rest of zone is great.  typically 2 mobs in a big room.<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Fortified Lair of the Taskmasters - relatively easy to pull, requires some easy lulls.  WAY too big for a small group.<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills: Blazing Forge - small easy zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...<br />
And back to the topic.  4 boxing is easy without MQ if you use hotkeys<br />
<br />
/assist &lt;warrior_name&gt;<br />
/cast 6<br />
/follow &lt;so_and_so_name&gt;<br />
<br />
If the question is how do you 4 box in LDoN?  its easy, just choose a normal adventure and make sure to root/snare.<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills are by far the easiest dungeons, don't even &quot;have to&quot; pacify.  Some of the other dungeons its &quot;easier&quot; to pull if you pacify.  If one of the four box is a enchanter then don't even pacify, just pull and sort out later.<br />
<br />
I''m not entirely sure the question about this whole post.  Are you asking that people put in input about each dungeon?  Well the dungeons are all the same on normal, Rujarkian Hills being the most spread out 3-4 packs per room.  I've never seen any dungeon mob hit harder then any other... just some do run and some do buff their friends.<br />
<br />
65, 65, 62 and 59 in group <br />
Another posted on the board said that with the 59 in the group youll get a normal mission easier then if the person was 60, and that it does not go average level but lowest level...<br />
<br />
BTW, there really should be a setting between normal and hard.  Normal is boring, hard owns me.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

The moderators are quite awake, thanks. ^_^ Let's keep it on topic, folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xasam</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mainly I was soliciting feedback about which theme/zones are easiest.  Seems MMC is considered the easiest theme, although I haven't actually tried it yet.  As noted, Ruj seems quite easy too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casca</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I four box as well. I don't use any automated programs outside of just having hotkeys on every computer set-up so most of the normal needs are taken cared of with a tap of my number keys.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 rogue (170ish aa's, all offensive and nearly all defensive of any worth. LR5 ,ID5 ,every reposit, etc...), 65 shaman (Just a Baron,  flowing thought 4 and a fungi+ 3 innate regen+ troll and a right click snare necklace) , 65 cleric ( baron, FT 4 ) and a nearly 65 enchanter ( no aa's,  FT 6)<br />
<br />
My rogue is fine for tanking normal adventures (or even my shaman....just gotta have em slowed first as he would never survive for long a mob that is unslowed). Not really great gear, only 4400ish hitpoints , 1230ac and 1250attack unbuffed. Full buffs from bots puts me at just over 6600HPs. <br />
<br />
I am very selective in my pulling. I pacify everything and always try for the single pull. Sure, I can pull the whole room and mezz with my enchanter, but that waste more mana then if I just took the time to insure singles and it can also easily wipe me...which pretty much ends the mission for any chance of a win. Pacifaction pulling  is very easy to do using an SoS rogue to target mobs for my enchanter to assist for pacify. I don't get very many suprises from mobs I didn't know were there as I take a good look at the room in sneak before I do anything. Perhaps  panning around in third person view will help. <br />
<br />
Pacifacation already has a very long range and the caster doesn't even have to have line of sight on the target, but I also went ahead and bought the enchanter an extended range IV focus item. This helps immensly as I do not have to run more then one character around just to pull a mob. <br />
<br />
I always keep my enchanter seperate from my cleric and shaman when he pacifies...just incase things go bad, I sacrafice the chanter. My shaman and cleric sit at the far wall, my enchanter sits around mid room where he is close enough to pacify even mobs two rooms away and still be able to nuke the pulls I bring or eat the agro on paci pull and get ressed back later.<br />
<br />
Other then this, it's just as what has been said. You need to have all characters doing DPS. Both my cleric and enchanter are always casting thier 1100 nukes. If I am good on mana for my shaman, then he malos, slows , poison dot, I evade, mob runs to shaman and I backstab and evade and repeat till dead while shaman cannies and snares. Usually a heal over time from my cleric is enough to keep shaman's HP up.<br />
<br />
I have tried charming with my enchanter and using my cleric and shaman to help my enchater keep the pet charmed. My clerics got a hotkey to assist my enchanter and stun his target. My enchanter has a hotkey to cast bliss (54sec mezz lvl68 cap) , my shaman has a hotkey to assist my enchanter and malosinia that target (70debuff) after debuff, I charm and redo the 1500 rune that needs no peridots so that on top of the 4700HP my chanter has with buffs, he also always has a 1500HP rune up...cause with a pet that hits for 400's, it's very much needed when the shit hits the fan, which unfortunately happens alot. Believe me, it's no fun having a pet that does crazy DPS (hasted, the pet can outdamage my rogue melee + cleric nuke + shaman posion DOT and nuke...maybe even unhasted, never tested that), but is ALWAYS breaking charm and riping my enchanter and very likely my whole bot army a new asshole if I  look away from the screens for a couple seconds. Forget going to the bathroom or going to get a drink or anything else. You have to watch the pet and wait for the break, cause it is very liekly to happen.<br />
<br />
I have found that with no aa's towards pet control, I waste more time trying to keep the pet under control then I would if I just nuked with my enchanter. So I stopped using pets in adventures for now. <br />
<br />
I do not do rescue missions or assasinate missions as you need to kill 60pct of the dungeon which I do not have the DPS to do. I do not do kill XX missions cause once again, I do not have the DPS to kill fast AND more importantly, move on to the next mob. <br />
<br />
I do collect missions. Not just any collect mission. I will sit at the adventure recruiter for as long as it takes for me to get exactly the mission I want. I have only 4 boxed in Tak themes, so can't say for anything else, but I have found that if you get a collect 24 to 26 in Tak, almost EVERY SINGLE mob you kill will drop the item you need to collect . Not 23, not 27. I really do mean 24 to 26. Stay there till you get one of those. You'll just have to kill 24 to maybe 32 mobs to complete the mission. I have won nearly all the adventures I boxed once I started being this choosy and a few times I even had over 30 minutes to spare. I play the adventures at a fairly relaxed pace. I can go faster if needed......but I like always having 80ish to..well..even 90pct mana on my shaman and cleric from kill to next mob inc.<br />
<br />
Wow, post went far longer then I thought it would :D  Also, I came to this post by goggle cause I too am trying to find more info on other dungeons so I don't blunder into them and choose an adventure I will most likely lose.</div></div><hr />

What about the physical setup of running 4?  Do you have them on 2 machines? 3? 4?  Using EQW to switch a couple?  If so, which do you double up, since there's a slight delay swapping window with the key and then hitting the hotkey.  (also a problem if the char is zonning for any reason)<br />
Do you think you could 3box that ldon?  and have you checked which are the easy Ruj collections?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the good info.<br />
I run a 65 war/65 ench (ft4)/62 druid (ft11)/62 cleric (ft11).  <br />
<br />
I tried a 4-box Ruj collect, that was ok but I didn't win it.  Good to know that others are trying it and succeeding.  My biggest problem is the periodic lag that I have from multi-link dial up.  I actually run 4 computers when I do this but number 4 is behind me and all I do is hit hotkeys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 3 box, and no I don't use any programs to help out. I have a distaste for those that do, your still quite limited on what you can do with them outside of the expected. And I see it as &quot;cheating&quot; also.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 warrior (Magelo at left)<br />
65 cleric (Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=440902) <br />
65 Enchanter (Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=440889))<br />
<br />
Hotkeys are everything. I have one setup for every major function on the bots, inculding autofollow. My cleric is on a laptop that I keep between the 2 monitors for my warrior and enchanter. I do have a USB mouse on the laptop, the touchpad just don't move as fast with EQ no matter how i tweaked the settings. (I run the laptop at 1900X1200)<br />
<br />
I used to try to do LDoN's with just my 3, but lacked DPS. I may be able to do them now that I have more AA and 2 levels on my ench with CoD, but have no incentive to try it. I usually pulled with the warrior and let the ench handle the adds if any.<br />
<br />
Currently I 3 box hard LDoN's with guildies filling out my group. I usually have a bard puller, so I get to be stationary most of the time. And I always ask one of the DPS joining us to KL, makes it much easier on me (and one of my chars does not stay FM from looting instead of nukeing).<br />
<br />
/agree on sacrificing the enchanter. Gather mana and Divine Rez means 2 free FM's!! (Plus the rezzer is still alive)<br />
<br />
/agree on pets. I was charming in hards, but it is just not worth it most of the time. Even unhasted a badly timed break can wipe the group, and at least the enchanter. Was not too bad on normals, but so risky when 3/4 boxing an advent.<br />
<br />
Yes, collections rock now. You can get unlucky once in awhile (got a collect 25 in Ruj with a 1 in 3 drop rate, lost by 2 mins) but overall are much faster. Currenty theory by the group is that the map has alot to do with drop rate, not just the number of drops needed.<br />
<br />
I like Ruj and Mirg for easy pulling. MM is not bad but sometimes tosses EVIL rooms at you. Guk.....sucks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raivene</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 4 box all the time and have been doing so for about 2 years now.  I don't use macroquest or any other simular program.  <br />
<br />
The only real secrets to boxing 4 at once are:<br />
<br />
1 - Class selection - Some classes do not lend themself to boxing.  Bards are impossible to utilize anywhere close to full potential.  I found that Shaman's at lower levels (when you have to chain cast canni) are difficult as well.  The classes I box are Warrior, cleric, enchanter and mage.  All 65s now with 300 to 375AA depending.<br />
<br />
2 - Hot keys are your friends.  The more repeated actions on your hotkeys the better.  For example, while I slow with my chanter I almost never tash (getting agro on the chanter is a pain).  So instead I have the first hotkey per pull on the mage as:<br />
<br />
/assist Raivene<br />
/pause 2<br />
/pet attack<br />
/cast 3   <br />
<br />
The cast 3 casts Mala on the mob.  This is almost always enough debuff to allow the slow to hit.<br />
<br />
The chanters hotkey, which is pressed right after the mages is:<br />
<br />
/assist Raivene<br />
/pause 2<br />
/pet attack<br />
/cast 2<br />
<br />
Where /cast 2 is slow.<br />
<br />
Animimation empathy is very nice to have on a boxed chanter btw.  The chanter pet does some decent damage even if it can't tank worth a flip.<br />
<br />
3 - Desk real estate.  <br />
<br />
Can't stress this one enough.  I use 15 inch flatpanel monitors, smaller than normal keyboards and trackball mice.  This reduces the footprint of the equipment to keep it manageable.  Fitting 17 inch normal monitors or normal drag around mice would require too much space to be efficient.  The desk itself is a patio bar lol.  A two tiered desk that allows the monitors and mice on top level and the keyboards on the bottom.  Works well for me.<br />
<br />
4 - practice practice practice.  At this point I can &quot;solo&quot; camps like arm/sup in tactics (great place to get sellable loots), any of the bots wing minis (still cannot take a tower boss with just my 4 sadly...) can use them in xp camps in earth a etc.  In LDoN I can win normals on pretty much every map.  Hards I can do, but usually will bring friends 2 box along with me and we win all of those usually (it's rare we lose anymore).  I generally do NOT win a hard with just my 4, but I can get to and beat the named for loots pretty easily depending on the map.  But that doesn't happen overnight.  The more you box the better you become.  Learning the tricks of your particular make up takes time.  It took me a while to figure out that in most zones a warrior + mage = FD pulling.  You just have to work through how to best utilize your toons.<br />
<br />
4 or more boxing does not require programs such as Macroquest.  It's fun to do, requires a lot of coordination and skill (IMO in anycase...;)) and the best thing is you NEVER EVER LFG.</div></div><hr />

I've been 6 boxing for a couple of years now, working up to try out 8 or 10 next, but 6 is fine for now.  I play 65 necro/mage/cleric/enchanter/warrior/druid.  I'm in the 80-120AA range on all the toons.  I'm decked in full Skyshrine armor but the warrior has Bastion of Thunder weapons (wicked shank and blade of storms) so aggro control is easier vs pre-pop weapons and a few HoT quest items.  I'd say all the toons average FT5, cleric being about that, necro actually being at 15 + lich.<br />
<br />
On to the real question, what is the best ldon to do?  Well, I've done 20+ in Mistmoore (butcherblock), 15+ Miragul's (everfrost), Ruj? (east commons), 10ish Guk (south ro), 5ish Tak (north ro).  My opinions are based on that.  I enjoy rescue/boss mob assasinates for certain themes, don't mind kill X mobs too much and will normally pass on collections, though they are better since they 'tuned' them.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore is pretty easy to fight through.  I do encounter a few areas with triple pulls, so pacify is very handy there.  The mobs here appear to have the most hitpoints vs the other adv types.  Doing rescue and boss mob assasinations are sure fire winners for MM.  I would not recommend kill all mobs type here, because (it seams) that boosts HPs and these mobs already have enuf hp, no need to add more.  I couldn't break under 70 minutes here, ever, but back then I would pacify every room and only pull singles.  The adventures take longer, but you get more exp and I do alright on aug gem drops here.  I think it offsets the extra time.<br />
<br />
Guk really is not too bad.  There tends to be more 3+ type pulls, but a number of casters which gives time for mezzing.  Should definately be able to snare when fighting here.  The casters are awesome for a mana tapping necro to keep the whole group moving.  This is a favorite dungeon of mine.  The mobs also mez nicely plus with 'undead' here, the necro comes in handy if needed to mez as well. The gem augs drop kinda ok here, not too bad not too good, exp is acceptable too.<br />
<br />
I find Tak to be very painful.  The mobs resist poison DDs quite a bit, which hurts my DPS.  They don't like dots much, so now that I bought my 63 &amp; 65 DOTs, it is less of an issue, but aggro is much higher on them.  This zone is my least favorite as the mobs have semi-high HP and resist more than others, making debuffing almost necessary.  I will never do another rescue or boss mob assasination here as the end points are too close and it is very hard to recover from a wrong direction.  I'd say this is more of a collection type adv, your mileage may vary.  This seems to be more of a money area than gem augs, also exp is decent considering the difficulty.<br />
<br />
Miragul's is my current theme, due to the Anger3 augments that I desperately want.  I used to finish the adventures in 70 minutes, but after doing them for a while I just say what the heck and let loose.  I do not bother to pacify anymore and I get triple/quad pulls maybe twice per dungeon on average.  Furious is a wonderous thing.  I now finish in the 50-60 minute range.  I find that collections / rescue / boss mob assasinations work best here.  The layouts are decision friendly, so it is fairly hard to pick the wrong way.  The one or two times I have, I easily managed to clear to the other end and barely finish the mission.  I don't even bother to slow on single pulls, it just wastes time.  When I triple/quad, I slow once furious finishes.  A little light on gem augs, but everything else is decent enough.<br />
<br />
By far, the easiest, IMHO, is Rujarkian Hills (east commons, right?).  This one is way too easy.  I've done 3 or 4 here and completed them in 50 minutes and that was when I was pacifying my way along to 'ease' the pulls.  These mobs seem to have very low hitpoints and I plan to 'farm' these to get points once I've done enough points in the other themes.  I did boss mob assasinations / kill all mobs, with no problems.  The difference between here and Mistmoore was shocking, for me at least.  I would think collections would work well here, but I cannot say.  I think all around it is light on gems / loot / exp, but they go much faster, so we'd need to look at it over time.  I haven't done enough to make that comparison, but it just feels light on everything but LDoN points per hour :)<br />
<br />
IMHO, I do not think any of the zones are 'too big' to run around with, even when 6 boxing.  The trick?  I put everyone on autofollow on my cleric, this puts all the casters a good distance behind the cleric, who is always behind my warrior.  This helps keep them out of harms way.  Also, this allows me to break follow on the cleric (following the warrior) when I 'setup' at an area.  The warrior can then run off and pull.  The cleric is the most likely to get aggro on the first heal when multi-pulling, so keeping her close to the war makes AoE taunt work well.  This also allows me to move at a good clip through the dungeons, so even long ones really are not an issue.  The suck are small tight areas (miraguls has these) that toons get stuck on.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, for those asking:<br />
It really isn't all that hard to do, with the /assist command and the builtin macros of EQ, you can do quite a bit easily.  Making a simple /assist button now makes it very easy to target with just one comp and the others can do whatever based on that, so macroquest is not needed.  I have two hands, but 6 keyboards layed out in front of me and mice to the sides.  Yes, I can get busy, but for the most part it is 80% concentration on the warrior and the other 20% doing (click #2 on 5 keyboards one after the other).  It also helps to have 6 keyboards/mice/monitors/computers, really makes it all easier.  Also having a nice desk with mini-keyboards helps, this is my biomorph desk (http://www.biomorphdesk.com/1-888-302-DESK/maxo/overview.html)<br />
<br />
Most importantly, have fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Ldon, I've found Miragul's to be the easiest for me.  I've tried a couple different adventuers in each area, and Mistmoore and Miragul's are definitely the easiest, and Mira's has the best benefits for my crew, so that's why I hang there most of the time.  <br />
<br />
FYI, 63 Cleric, 62 Warrior, 62 Enchanter, 60 Druid, 59 Monk, 61 Rogue.  <br />
<br />
Very easy with hotkeys and furious alt-tab action.  Would I say it's a super efficent group?  Heck no.  But it works, and allows me to do a number of things that I want to do, farming and xp both.  6 real players would be significantly more effective than I'm able to handle on my own.  But I frankly get bored playing only 1 or 2 at a time.  And I'll always drop one of my botted characters from group to make a spot for any of my friends of course.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arnie</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 6 boxed Mistmoore several times, and found it to be fairly reasonable.   I had some timing problems at first (failed first  5 while fighting boss mob), but last few have gone much smoother.  The ECommons dungeon is pretty good also, but I've not done the others enough to form an opinion.<br />
<br />
As to &quot;how&quot; to play multiple chars, I use 2 keyboards/monitors/mice, each hooked to a 4 way KVM switch that has hotkey swapping (Omnibox).  Pressing scroll lock twice then computer number (1-4) switches to the appropriate computer.  I have been using that and the built in EQ macros almost since EQ came out.  I started with 2 boxing back in summer 99, and have slowly progressed to more (I recently 9 boxed Dozekar).  <br />
<br />
True, you don't get near the efficency from multiboxing as you do from different people playing, but then I never waste any time LFG.  I just camp where I want to hunt, log on and get to it.<br />
<br />
And, like someone mentioned above, I get bored just playing 1 or 2 chars anymore :)<br />

I don't use this myself, as I only recently found out EQ supports voice commands, but it sounds like a good way to take the load out of controlling one of your more heavily used support bot. <br />
