You really dont know why patch messages should be in the outhouse?</div></div><hr />

Woopie, is the Outhouse for ranting against anyone but warriors now?  Then kill the damn section and move everything back into the Tavern.<br />
<br />
Clerics are not paladins, fortunately.  THAT is why I questioned it's location in the Outhouse.</div></div><hr />

I do see they added those useful numbers to my hot buttons at least--I can't say they never do anything for warriors now I guess.<br />

&quot;Future Plans for August, 2003<br />
Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game.  Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are.  Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time.<br />
<br />
... <br />
<br />
Class Balance<br />
<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
...&quot;</div></div><hr />

Long-term isn't EQ2 ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note the word VERY HIGH END.  Melee is not a synonym for Warriors.  They did exactly what they promised.  Warrior needed no fix relative to other pure melees in DPS, and the issue with Knight aggro isn't related to DPS anyway.  Warriors do significantly more damage than a Knight already.</div></div><hr />
