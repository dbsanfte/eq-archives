I realize that the Dam/Del is bad compared to PoP, LoY, LDoN. But when you are a casual player and not much plat you go with what you got :p <br />
<br />
Maelstrom (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6005) <br />
<br />
Sword of the Shissar (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4700) <br />
<br />
Veridix's Shortsword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6780) <br />
<br />
Howling Cutlass (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6647) <br />
<br />
Frozen Zweihander (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=463) <br />
<br />
As far as I can tell the procs are unresistable and all seem to have a stun with the exception of the Shissar Sword.<br />
<br />
I do have other weapons; Epics (both slotted and unslotted), SoTBS, GSoT, GHoC among others.</div></div><hr />

GSoT would be better than all of those, as would the two red blades.  The HP loss, alone, would make me look elsewhere.  Just from my cursory glance, I'd say you would be better off spending your time in other endeavors.  I realize it's been a while since VP was in the spotlight, but I have to think that it is far from a casual event, even now.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br />

Remember that the dam/delay is important for agro generation, and all of these have worse ratios. That means when your weapon isn't proc'ing, you'll get more agro out of them than the VP items.</div></div><hr />

I was fairly fond of my scimitar of lifestealing, but I wouldn't do another VP key if the sword was a ground spawn at the zone-in.</div></div><hr />

There is no essential gear out of there that cann't be found some place else without the pain in the ass and hours/days of learning the ropes once inside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten pretty much every weapon from VP except Maelstrom and Blood Orchid Katana.  Verdix/Veldrak's was the SoD before the SoD existed, but its age is long past.  Feverblade and Sword of the Shissar used to be great for stacking up the dot procs, but have long outlived their usefulness.  I used Sword of Rile and Scimmy of Lifestealing for soloing for the longest time, but I haven't really dusted them off since my solo aa days in FG.  The two VP weaps that I still use on a regular basis are Spear of Constriction from Xygoz and Howling Cutlass from Nexona.<br />
<br />
Spear of Constriction procs Ensnare, the only War-useable weapon that does.  Ensnare has roughly the same movement decrease % as regular Snare (from silken whip, etc.) but lasts more than 3x as long.  Makes a big difference.<br />
<br />
You're probably thinking, &quot;wtf do you use Howling Cutlass for?&quot;  Well I'll tell you.  Look at the proc: Shrieking Howl (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1803).  It has a 5-foot pushback component.  It's an insanely great weapon for positioning mobs.  You might think that a BFG or Stronghorn would be superior, but the 15-foot push from regular knockback is, in game terms, a huge distance, which can push your mob completely out of position and make things worse.  I've found the 5-foot from the cutlass to be damn near perfect for slapping mobs back into place - just enough, not too far.</div></div><hr />
