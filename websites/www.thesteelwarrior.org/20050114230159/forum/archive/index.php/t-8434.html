<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargasso</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...so i've spent my almost 4 year run in EQ as a wizard.  After spending all my time sitting on my and pressing the old reliable nuke button I'm wanting to start playing a warrior twink I made a lot more.<br />
<br />
I got him to 33 just goofing off but now I want to get serious with him.  My main is in a Time equiped/Qvic flagged wizard, so money is really not much of an object (have about 300K in bank)....and I can farm items fairly easily with a small group...however...my question is this.<br />
<br />
At level 33, I would like you all to help create a shopping list of the best stuff I can buy for my twink.  It probably wouldn't help linkiing a magelo as he is using mostly garbage at the moment.  I've searched in the bazaar and quite honestly, after having played a caster for so long, i'm overwhelmed with armor choices so I come here, to the experts for help.<br />
Remember...money..generally speaking, is no object in gearing this 33 Warrior UP!<br />
Thanks in advance for all your help on this!</div></div><hr />

Probably go with cultural armor if you can.  If money is not an issue, get him a Blade of Carnage and Scepter of Destruction for weapons =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm at work so I can't check deity as I'm honestly not sure..he was created a while ago...he is human however.<br />
What is  a general price range on Blade of Carnage and Scepter of Destruction?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well as I had said, money isn't much of an object...just trying to get the best gear I can use at this level.  I'm going to grab a few groups of guildies as soon as AoW is up tho and see if I can't get something nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ment that BoC/SoD don't need to be first. With 300k you could fully twink the character and then get a BoC or SoD with the next 300k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FurryCrew</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm..lvl 33<br />
Ok Boc/SoD<br />
Helm of RZ<br />
Vindi BP AND Boots (i'm sure u can get acouple of friends to gank him for ya)<br />
AoW Bow<br />
Gaunt of Dragon slaying for haste (hope ya faction is good)<br />
Loyalist shield for back item (easy camp for you, when named pops just get a healer and a tank)<br />
Belt of Dorf Slaying (see gaunts)<br />
<br />
you get the picture...<br />
<br />
or on an off night get a group or 2 of your guildies and destroy NToV and equip ALL you twinks (it's pretty much full pop on most servers these days)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scalecracker range slot<br />
Thulian Visage face slot<br />
Iron cog earring<br />
Crystallized Acid Bracer x 2<br />
<br />
Some/all of them will not be usable til 51, but buy them whenever you see them for sale, since they're rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargasso</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions gang...I'm going to start looking tonight for some of this stuff...let me know if anyone has any other thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If i was int he position you are, i would just try to get a group or 2 of friends and go wipe out old world named.  AoW would be the hardest target i assume.<br />
<br />
Maybe go wipe out HoT mobs for a saturday or sunday for Kael armor.<br />
<br />
Go kill the restless burrower in Acrylia Caverns for Wormhusk Harness (http://darkwind-guild.com/SoL/images/luclin/Acrylia%20Caverns/Restless%20Burrower/Wormhusk%20Harness.jpg)<br />
<br />
Would also recommend Vindi for his Boots (http://darkwind-guild.com/SoL/images/velious/Kael/Boots%20of%20the%20Vindicator.jpg) and Breastplate (http://darkwind-guild.com/SoL/images/velious/Kael/Chestplate%20of%20Vindication.jpg)<br />
<br />
I also suggest going to kill Vaniki for Willsapper (http://darkwind-guild.com/SoL/images/velious/DN/Vaniki/Willsapper.jpg)<br />
<br />
Oh, and, if you guys can kill Dozekor, aim for the Silver Bracelet of Speed (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/silverbraceletofspeed.jpg), Cloak of the Firestorm (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/cloak_fire_storm.jpg), Silver Mask of the Slayer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/silvermaskoftheslayer.jpg), and Silver Charm of Tranquility (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/silvercharmtranquility.jpg).<br />
<br />
The Strength of the Elements (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6989) quest is also a nice one to do for a great piece of shoulders.<br />
<br />
Will be alot of work, but if you even get 1/2 of these items, you will have a very formidable tank ready for basically anything you would want him for(unless he becomes your new name, then you ight want to look at this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8214))  If you work on these quests/items when you are bored, they will come together overtime and you win at life =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When looking for best droppable bazaar upgrades..... and no budget cap. refer to my magelo. I havent updated it in a few weeks so my newer GoD/Hard Ldon upgrades arent added. Its basically the absolute best platinum can buy with the exception of the ultra rare (Basically non-existant) Thulian Visage of Horror and a second Crystalized acid bracer. I prefer dual SoD's to the BoC/SoD set-up. I wont be tanking in High end GoD/Time zones just yet so the additonal dps helps. Ang III augged you will hold aggro any time u want it, and if your group isnt up to par you will hold aggro long after u dont want it :) plus with WA5 and ingenuity spamming anarchy is just a whole lotta fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">do ring of this or that in ct, doesnt take long and is very easy, drops lots of nice twink loots =P like 2x4 loots or something. It's the one where the woman aint allowed to die.</div></div><hr />
