<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulenticer</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all don't lecture me on this, yes I know this topic may have come up several times but the perameters I would use to find what I'm looking for are used prolly in every single thread on this message board.<br />
<br />
Alright, is raw direct damage the same as hate agro at 1 for 1? Lets two shadowknights get together and do not melee. One shadowknight casts Terror of Thule (600 hate) and then another SK casts Spear of Decay (600pt dd) are they both equal on the hate list (minus the minor initial agro)?<br />
<br />
Does a resist: (-100) or so have an agro mod on it?<br />
<br />
Is damage over time equal as well? For example if an sk casts Spear of Decay (600pt dd) and another casts Ignite Blood (56 per tick, 13 ticks) is the sk going to regain agro at the 11th tick?<br />
<br />
Also, has anyone tried calculating the hate of a 0 second stun? Is it an exact number or does it somehow vary with the level?/hp? of the mob it's being used on? I remember trying to kite at lower levels using flame lick and it would take very little time for my pet to gain full agro while at higher levels I can do this rather easily, but even higher then that the charmed pets would do so much damage flame lick would become pointless. And to further this is the value of a 1 second stun more? Does the hate value continually increase linearly? It prolly would be hard to find this stuff out. I can't think of any casters with a 0 second stun that doesn't have any other effects like damage and such. I know wizards can cast the Force Shock and enchanters can cast Anarchy, they are the important ones to know.<br />
<br />
Speaking of flame lick has Obsidian Shatter also been checked for values?<br />
<br />
Just another thought, maybe all these spells have an independent value of hate?</div></div><hr />

There were many dead wizzies before they patched it so crits would not effect agro.</div></div><hr />

Regardless of that fact, it's still not 1 damage = 1 hate.<br />
<br />
Oh, and you don't have to get all defensive when you post on this board.</div></div><hr />

I was being defensive? Perhaps the world would be a better place if no one responded to each other. As natural conversation is concidered being defensive.<br />

<br />
Anyway if it isn't 1 for 1 then what is it? It has to be some sort of ratio.</div></div><hr />

Its not bad, just a personality quirk. :)</div></div><hr />

Man, I have NO idea where Haas thought you were acting defensive. Sheesh Haas, you really read WAY too much into things.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
To answer your original question... we don't know what the exact formula is for dmg to hate. There are a ton of variables that have to be considered. The only exact hate numbers we know for a fact are the spells and procs that have a fixed number of hate on them. Everything else is an educated guess. I.E. Most warriors think stun is worth 400-500 hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crit/resist has no effect on a spell's aggro.  If you crit White Fire for 7k as opposed to resisted fully they both still produce the same amount of aggro.  <br />
<br />
And White Fire certainly isn't 2700 hate, thankfully, at least not when it's cast from range.  I've heard anything cast from range is like 1/3rd the aggro which would actually fit, as that'd put White Fire at 900 hate, and it certainly seems more aggro than any one proc but 2's usually enough to draw it off the wizard.</div></div><hr />

See how making blanket statements makes you look like a jackass?<br />
<br />
All I said was that you don't need to come in here with an attitude, but apparantly you DO need to be lectured.  Even if the post right below yours had the information you were looking for, you wouldn't have got a smartass comment about it ala Crucible or some shit, you would have got a link to your answer.  My point is that you don't need to come in here assuming that we all hate you because you're an &quot;noob&quot; or what have you.  You've got questions?  Ask away.  We're not gonna hang you around here, so it's okay to drop the pre-emptive defensive stuff.</div></div><hr />

And with GoD and AA's for Shaman  to get crits on DoT's they seem to have found that DoT crits do generate even more aggro , unless its been changed since release.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haladan</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My bet would be that a warrior would have 1/1 max possible non crit dmg/agro, while a wiz would have 1/x&lt;1 max possible non crit dmg/agro.  Diff agro modifier for each class.  Even different spells might have different agro modifiers counting dmg vs agro.  Would be a pain to check/parse tho..<br />
<br />
Haladan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can chain cast doi average 800dd with focus till you blue in the face and not over agro 1 holy might from distance or in melee range. as long as the person who cast holy might is meleeing. should that person die or somehow get removed from the list you will be #1 with a feverent passion unless you concuss below the next guy on the list.<br />
<br />
and melee agro is in the library. i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On my wizard I can chain cast Ancient: Destruction of Ice and Ice Spear of the Soloist, both focused with Iceflame and ID4 from the mob being at 98% to dead and never pull aggro.<br />
<br />
However one Strike of Solusek will pull aggro at 75% easily and almost always.<br />
<br />
There seems to be built in hate numbers for each seperate spell, not just based on the amount of DD being done.  I don't have any proof, just my own experience and speculation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely.  Necros using Pyrocuror will very seldom pull aggro, but one envenomed bolt will get ya killed every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Envenomed Bolt<br />
1: Increase Poison Counter by 10<br />
2: Decrease HP when cast by 110<br />
3: Decrease Hitpoints by 146 per tick<br />
<br />
Pyrocruor<br />
1: Decrease Hitpoints by 111 per tick<br />
<br />
Well one has counters on it, maybe that can effect hate to some degree. Another spell with counters is Blood of Thule, does it have a lotta agro?<br />
<br />
Phantron I'm not entirely sure about that, 1/3 seems a bit much but I do like the class theory from Haladan. With my wizard I used to have the worst time with agro, I gave up all together on the big nukes and went with the draughts in xp groups. Wizards are meant to solo. I think one thing that isn't being concidered is spell casting subtlety. I doubt there is a single wizard that has White Fire and doesn't have SCS. Also concussion is a wizards life saver, just a lil bit of mana and all is well.<br />
<br />
So basically there is no real data on these boards about hate from procs/nukes/dots? I seen the info on weapons and it was quite nice but unrelated. In this case I might pull out my unused 65s and do some checking myself. Like someone here said it takes a lot to find this stuff out so I was checking here first.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;----- WARNING: Ignore the stuff below unless you are one of my 'helpful critics' on manners. I don't wanna post it, you don't wanna read it -----&gt;<br />
I refuse to make any more comments that are unrelated to the subject of this post, so those that got something offensive to say to me stfu. I am not part of your sewing circle so leave me a lone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm telling ya dude, if you don't ask for it, it won't happen.  And you're asking for it, and keep asking for it every post.<br />
<br />
Now, yes, poison and disease counters add aggro, in fact that's the reason for the aggro.  Tash + all player casted slows also add counters, which is why they pull aggro the way they do and why they needed to be adjusted for aggro.  It was a necessary evil tho to make the spells curable.</div></div><hr />

You should feel lucky people are being as nice as they are. They're helpful until you provoke them - and yes, you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in my experience each spell has its own agro value. dmg that spell actually done has no effect on that value because even spells that are fully resited generate same ammount of hate. This is based purely on my game experience without any backup.</div></div><hr />
