<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For me, finding NPCs in the 18-20 level range is kind of problematic.   Wandering around land of the lost in Skyway gets tedious and talos seems just a wee too high to solo well in this level range.<br />
<br />
But I've found a good place to go.  The back part of boomtown has got an ample supply of clockworks in the 18-20 range in large groups.  Easy to solo if you're an invul tanker and reasonably careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you hit 21 - depending on which contacts you get a nice spot to solo as an invul tanker is in IP around the tram station. Multiple contacts to refresh your inspirations from (Dr Cheng, Laura Pennington, a couple of others I can't remember off hand atm), a store to sell your DOs to and loads of nazis and family with only a few tsoo. Zone exit and tram station close by so if you get into trouble you can beat a hasty exit :)</div></div><hr />

21 opens a lot of doors.  A fair chunk of talos island and IP are both now soloable.  It's the bridge from 18 to 21 that is kind of difficult.  Basically because talos and IP don't have many mobs in the 20 or slightly less range.  Most are 21 and above. <br />

This is my third tanker to go through the teens. :)</div></div><hr />
