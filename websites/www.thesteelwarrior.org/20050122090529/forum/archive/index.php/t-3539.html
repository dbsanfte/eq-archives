AC70 HP210 00ATK  36Saves<br />
<br />
Well LDoN was more promissing, the 50atk are nice but not monstrous.<br />
Others stats dont matter and are useless.<br />
<br />
Still LDoN &gt;&gt; AHR (even uder its current Ac70 hp160 20ATK)<br />
Simply because it wont cost you a shitload of DKP. (or use a loot right).<br />
<br />
Go for LDoN. AHR aint worth it.<br />
Try to get Earring/Gloves (skip gloves if u can get a cheap orb of the sky)<br />
<br />
The earring is GODLY, GODLY, Even deep in Time you will not replace it.<br />
Awesome ac, awesome saves, nice atk.<br />
<br />
PoP Masks = common as hell (but worse than AHR since crappy ac)<br />
<br />
 GET AHR EARRING ABOVE ALL (and a call of XX series)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically gave up my rights from looting the earring today, still want gloves as the sky orb is only 10 mins lasting and takes 10 secs to recast :x<br />
<br />
If I could i'd have taken the bp in a heartbeat, same with seru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you could have 1 AHR loot what would it be ?<br />
(Exept the very coveted neck)<br />
<br />
Probably Gloves or Earring.<br />
<br />
The BP while &quot;Ooooh Aahhh Uhhhhh&quot; looses some of its sheer<br />
power with the LDoN series.<br />
<br />
The earring is awesome, and there isnt one that can compete<br />
with it exept maybe Coirnav (plz dont tell me 20hp = 10ac for PoEB)<br />
<br />
While the gloves remain godly even in time. (Fake + Agro).<br />
But will have to go when in EP.<br />
<br />
Get all of them if you can of course :) <br />
<br />
But imo the BP shouldnt be your priority since you can get one<br />
slightly inferior with 1 group by grinding for ever.<br />
Gloves &amp; Earring arent accessible with 1 group grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally? Gloves were always #1. Missed out on our first aten kill and they went cheap (400 with 5 war present), since then nothing but bp's and monk legs :x. I guess you could stay gloves are still #1, will see how the luck goes in the future. CoFire on the war who has them is some nice taunt when he doesn't bother to click them off while in dps mode heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atilette</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still prefere Seru BP over the AHR one.<br />
<br />
105 saves &gt; 5 ac IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">on my deathembracers the legs got a slot 7 changed to 1,1,7 but the bp remained 1,1,3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the drops we got from seru (more than a dozen kills) i guess bp no longer drops (intended as sarcasm, go go shoulders and SoW boots).<br />
AHR loot<br />
3 AHR masks <br />
1 earring<br />
3 mails of judgement<br />
2 or 3 monk legs<br />
1 bp<br />
1 gloves<br />
<br />
If you can grab gloves get them, orb of sky is similar agro, but<br />
with the low duration of the buff and a 10 second cast time its very limited for day to day use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is just random.  I have killed seru about 10x and have seen the BP as the most common drop, with maybe the except of the horse.  I have seen maybe 5-6 BPs in the last 10 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RNG can kiss my ass.  <br />
<br />
We killed Seru ~35 times with my old guild.  Got 1 BBB.  My guild broke up, I switched servers, some of the old members merged with another guild and rebuilt, now they're up to Seru level and bitching about how they get nothing but swords, and how they're running twinks in to loot them now.<br />
<br />
I have been on lots of cursed runs and never seen a bloodfrenzy drop.  3 kills ago my cable went down for an hour right after exiled and I missed the cursed who of course dropped a bloodfrenzy.  Since then the guild has done the cursed two more times when I couldn't be there due to RL stuff, and both of them have dropped bloodfrenzies as well.  That's right, 3x bloodfrenzy in a row and I missed all of them.  Now me and a brand new recruit are the only warriors in the guild without a bloodfrenzy.  <br />
<br />
,,!,, RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah RNG bites, keep getting mnk / bst legs from aten usually :x</div></div><hr />
