Payn proposes a formula for the effective delay of a hasted weapon of (delay - ((delay / 2) * (haste/100))).  Editor: this formula results in an effective delay of zero at 200% haste; the correct formula (delay / (1 + (haste/100)) gives a delay of 1/3 the original delay, as expected.<br />

Wandor says: Strafing is when you use CRTL+right/left arrow to move sideways, or in the case of tanking, use CRTL+right/left arrow while moving forward or backwards to move diagonally. Due to the way EQ code works, when you are snared you can still strafe at full speed.<br />

Wandor proposes a test for HoT spells giving aggro to their caster when they heal you: get a HoT cast on you, aggro a mob, wait for the HoT spell to heal you, zone out.  See if the mob goes after the healer.  Editor: Great idea!  Now someone go do it, and make sure that the HoT actually heals you at least once before you zone.<br />

Stonewall is good for single groups (no offensive decrease), but Defensive is better for raids.  Strafing while in Stonewall moves at full speed, so there's a good work-around.  Stonewall is good against mobs that snare you anyway, and bad against mobs that do a knockback.  <br />

The success of Kick at stunning mobs is more visible when they are casting or running.  It is generally agreed that a Kick that lands will almost always stun a stunnable mob.  Bash is better, it is theorized, not because it is more likely to stun when it lands, but because it is more likely to land (higher skill cap).<br />

Tiejinnie reports that if a HoT spell (cast on you before you aggro a mob) actually heals any hit points on you (that is, you took damage, and the HoT heals some of it), this will aggro the mob on the caster of the HoT spell.  The simple presence of an HoT spell does not give aggro to the HoT spell's caster, but the action of the HoT spell does.  Editor: thus an HoT spell can put a cleric on the Rampage list.<br />
