<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DennyDarksavior</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are a list of things that I see that could benefit the warrior class overall and wont &quot;destroy&quot; the balance of the game.<br />
<br />
1) Beserker Fury - I believe that one of the most original and oldschool skills in this game that could use some tinkering with. I believe that at level 50 the life percent in which this skill kicks in should scale upward.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Level 50 - 28% Life remaining..<br />
Level 51 - 30%<br />
Level 52 - 33%<br />
Level 53 - 35%<br />
Level 54 - 37%<br />
Level 55 - 40%<br />
Level 56 - 42%<br />
Level 57 - 45%<br />
Level 58 - 47%<br />
Level 59 - 50%<br />
Level 60 - 52%<br />
Level 61 - 55%<br />
Level 62 - 57%<br />
Level 63 - 60%<br />
Level 64 - 62%<br />
Level 65 - 65%<br />
<br />
That way we could get some damage output from our higher ATK and crippling blows. After playing a while i noticed when i do exp groups, my hp rarely ever reaches to the point where i go into my Beserker Fury, even if i do i usually get healed the next second.<br />
<br />
2) To help with the Itemization and the HP difference, I say SOE should relook the balance of the PoP armors. The Warrior armors should all recieve at least 10HP more on each piece and around 2 more AC a piece. That way we dont get a drastic increase in armor quality compared to other classes but still take the lead with our main stats.<br />
<br />
3) Weapon itemization, i believe needs also a bit of a boost. A viable option i see that SOE can do is add some Warrior only weapons. Since we are the masters of armed combat, we should be given some weapons the other classes just dont have skill for just like how Monks do.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Aggro Issues... this one is a hard one. I know most of us want some kind of aggro lock in the begining of a battle, BUT not so powerful enough to rape paladin aggro. I believe on of the options that SOE should consider in doing is making the the &quot;Taunt&quot; skill longer range, say about 100 Range worth of a bow. To help with the complaints of other classes saying we dont taunt, a viable way to end this would be give the warrior a YES or NO msg if the taunt landed or not. Like...<br />
<br />
Failure:<br />
&quot;You have taunted at a (Target), and he ignores you&quot;<br />
Success:<br />
&quot;You have taunted at a (Target), and looks angry&quot;<br />
<br />
The catch is, the msg for both will show on the warrior's screen, but the success will broadcast to the group just like the tradeskill spam.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think we'll see a lot of new Warrior only weapons added to the game and here's why.  There are too many other classes that raid or hunt as well and who want upgrades.  If you make things overly class specific, then you remove a portion of the motivation for people who aren't that class to be involved.</div></div><hr />

There's tons of knight only weapons<br />
There's insane amounts of Mnk/Bst weapons<br />
<br />
I think there needs to be more rogue, ranger, bard, and warrior specific weapons out there. I think weapon itemization is biased in favor of casters/knights/monk/bst as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're probably right but I'm doubtful it's going to happen.  For some reason SoE has decided it's perfectly okay to drop a ton of superior PAL/SHD only weapons but won't do the same for the other classes.  I think it goes back the thought that the PAL/SHD classes used to be hurting so badly in the DPS department that they needed the extra bonus of weapons just for their class.  This isn't really as true any more, yet you typically will see far more PAL/SHD restricted weapons than WAR only and so forth.</div></div><hr />

but that never got through very well... because.. well.. they suck at what they do.<br />
So instead theyre compensating by making tons of weapons drop off mobs....<br />
in PoP there's about 0.5 paladin only weapons on EVERY boss mob encounter, in average.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're great. Seriously. <br />
<br />
If you've ever looked after PSU, the gap between decent weapons is horrible. Next upgrade after my Fist of Rock is going to cost me at least 5-6k.</div></div><hr />

I'll shut up now =/</div></div><hr />

but can we get a real fix before we worry about that? :p<br />
<br />
This will, by no means, ever be a fix.<br />
It'll be a nice way however, to easily notice how retarded Taunt actually IS atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe -- BSTs are possibly the single most over-powered class there is. I see BSTs easily putting out 150dps, AND slow, AND offtanking, etc. And BST gear seems plenty common to me. <br />
<br />
The BST cause is in terrific shape from where I sit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the thing about bl/monk weapons is when you make that jump you won't need to jump for awhile. especially with their good dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How bout:<br />
<br />
Lower failure on taunt by about 2/3rds. Instead of a 40% failure rate, make it 15%. Along with that, double the reuse time on the taunt skill.<br />
<br />
Using the taunt skill would require a bit more judgement than it does now simply because a poorly timed time will leave the button greyed out longer, but would have a much greater chance of success when you do use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the taunt skill would require a bit more judgement than it does now simply because a poorly timed time will leave the button greyed out longer, but would have a much greater chance of success when you do use it.<br />
<br />
This sounds reasonable, if they also coupled this with a change to Paladin stuns so only one stun could be memorized at a time and it's refresh time was also 12 seconds.   That way using stuns to hold aggro would require a bit more judgement than it does now simply because a poorly timed stun would leave the spell unuseable for longer.  And you would still have the same much greater chance of success when you used it as you do now.<br />
<br />
And the Paladin could still use the taunt button once while he waited on his stun to refresh.<br />
<br />
Okay, this was said with some irony.  But I hope you get the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks so far in PoP have gotten royally screwed on weaponry.  It is why they are ~= to warrior damage now.<br />
<br />
Best 1h monk wep is 21dam/19del,  best warrior 1h wep is 34dam/31del<br />
<br />
Best 2h monk wep is 60dam/38del, best warrior 2h is same 60dam/38del<br />
<br />
Monks have comepletely lost any weapon advantage they had in the end game of PoP.  Warriors get flurry, and monks get higher damage tables.  I would bet with equal atk ratings, that monks and warriors with these weapons are within a few percentage points of each other in DPS.<br />
<br />
If anything, monks need some serious end game upgrades for weaponry, and/or some new end-game utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
last I looked, both Knight classes have it and thus would improve them in relationship to Warriors as well, correct?  If so, not sure how much it gains us...I was so looking forward to that new Copper Hammer with it's proc, then I realized I was looking forward to a proc that pallies get to cast at will.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh...and just to add some more whine regarding that nice new weapon...it's all/all with at least 35 mana on it, so it is a very nice upgrade for any plate class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just take taunt away from them since they get agro gain from everything else anyways........<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you want to improve taunt, you could do it, just dont let it take effect untill above the cap of the half breeds. They cap a little lower then us, so this would allow us to get the improvement while excluding them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um yeah if your twinklord is gimp and only uses h2h skill, they can use piercing and blunt weapons too you know :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and there needs to be more class specific gear, and for crissakes give monks and beastlords their own separate weapons finally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnaus</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To give my thoughts...<br />
Berzeker mode... hum yes, fun but it think not very strong. we are not a DPS class, it's rog, rangers, monks work, our goal is to take damages and to control the mobs when we are tanking, we need to be more efficient in damages when we are not tanking.<br />
-- If we want a warrior to be only a big part of meat with aggroing capacity, all will be good BUT ! that want to say 1 or 2 wars not more are needed in a raid (others are useless because no dps and no others abilities)<br />
-- If we want a DPS warrior more than a one who can control his aggro, we will walk on DPS toes and won't be in our room.<br />
-- As we are Weapons masters, we must be abble to do both, of course we cannot be better than the one who are made for this : We need to be THE tanking class. to make a real hole between us and Palys SK in the tanking thing. be abble to get more hits, with various diciplines (some spell dodges, unlinked dis, protective skills like udgrading the /shield command.....) Ti improve our aggro capacity not the average aggro but a controled one (cf juice) and at least an alternative option in aggressive mode (with less aggro) , to be usefull even if we are not the MA/MT. <br />
As we are master in weapons and in fight discipline we must be abble to adapt ourselves to the combat conditions, bring protection to the weaks, bring damages (but not walking on the rangers, rog work) in battle when not tanking and of course be again The one we want to tank this uggly big God/dragon/giant/dog/cat/mouse/bug ;)</div></div><hr />
