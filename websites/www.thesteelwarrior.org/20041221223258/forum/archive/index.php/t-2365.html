<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hear a lot of wars saying &quot;learn to play your class better&quot; and, well, I am a 65 warrior but certainly don't know everything (hell, Kildace posted about using AE Taunt and disc /furious in emergencies to buy camp time and I hadn't thought of that).<br />
<br />
So... if ya have some gems of wisdom let's hear them.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing I have found is EQ Watcher ( eqwatcher.com ).  It runs in the background and with the MS text to voice it TELLS me when to taunt.  I don't have to watch a sep text window now while fighting to look for slows, this sexy fem voice says &quot;A Jord Militis has been slowed&quot; (yes, it recognizes slows, yawns, and &quot;loses its fighting edge&quot; - Beastlord slow).  In playing around with it I have set voice commands now for &quot;A Jord Militis has been crippled&quot; and have messages for Tash and the druid Ro debuff line.  You can set it up with messages like &quot;A jord Profet is attempting to gate&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
It is a handy tool.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just a log parser, so it should be legal, although it might not be something you'd want to broadcast around that you use.<br />
<br />
Don't take my word for it though, because I don't work for SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just went and checked it out, the website claims it doesn't violate the EULA.  And looks very cool, can't wait to get home after work and check this out to see if it works as advertised.  Thanks for posting this one Buun<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I originally downloaded this to parse DPS on different weapon setups. I later discovered that it gives an audio notification upon mobs being slowed, or when they start to gate, or when invis begins to fade. I now consider this a valuable tool. Unfortunately it's pretty crappy for parsing dps/total damage, etc.<br />
<br />
Man, HOW did you set it up for audio notification on cripple, etc.? I would like to customize it a bit so i can hear when tash, cripple, malo, snare are landing. Yeah it might be more information then I need, but I'll probably turn some of the extra's off. I've been looking for information to customize this for weeks.<br />
<br />
Oh, and do you know of anyway to make it STOP making noise on /say, /tell, /gu. etc. without retyping /note &lt;channel&gt; sound off every time?<br />
<br />
EQW doesn't effect anything in game fyi. You just toggle /log on and as you fight it reads your log and certain text &quot;cues&quot; set off different sounds. It also tallys various damage totals and reads them to you...which is sub-par imo.<br />
<br />
Ex.) &quot;%T slows down&quot; triggers a &quot;slow noise&quot;<br />
<br />
It definitely helps me to be more aware of what is going on without missing anything. If you want more info on what's happening and when during a fight, it's worth a try.<br />
