<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone posted data on average aggro weapon proc rate per hour?<br />
<br />
I have no idea how hard this would be to accomplish.  It's obvious you'd have to subtract all time where auto attack is turned off, cannot see target, or out of range.<br />
<br />
The weapons i'm actually most interested in comparing _at the moment_ are CHoS, Frostbringer, GSoT, Bloodworn, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that if this data does exist, the data would be based on 305 dex.<br />
<br />
I haven't found this data on these boards.  Have I missed it?  Is it impossible to determine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would think it would be hard if not impossible to get that info since the same weapons will proc more or less times for people. I could be wrong but that's what I think at least :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most weapons proc 2 times a minute in your mainhand and 1 time a minute in you off.  There are a few exceptions like bloodfrenzy but about 90% or more of the weapons out there follow the 2 proc a minute rule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was using Swift like Wind and Cloak of Crystalline Waters for haste so my haste was 96%. My DEX was buffed to about 230.<br />
<br />
I had Copper Hammer of Striking on main hand and Sword of the Bloodsworn on secondary hand.<br />
<br />
As you can see, CHoS procced 186+21 = 207 times (hit + resist) and SotB procced 88+9 = 97 times.<br />
<br />
The total combined fight time was 2:09:19 hours so with my stats, CHoS was proccing 207/2.15=96 times per hour and SotB was proccing 97/2.15 = 45 times per hour.<br />
<br />
Maybe a better measurement would be procs per swing because that will eliminate weapon speed, haste and primary / offhand from the equation.<br />
<br />
CHoS swung 6,733+4,956 = 11,689 times so it procced every 11,689/207 = 56 swings.<br />
<br />
SotB swung 5,622+4,138 = 9,760 times so it procced every 9,760/97 = 101 swings.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to re-do my test and switch the weapons. Maybe weapon proc is not tied to swings after all.<br />
<br />
(Sorry about the small table, I was going to post HTML table, but apparantly HTML has been disabled here. I'll try to post the HTML table as an attachment, but it looks like HTML is not valid file extension either so I'm not sure it will work either)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is interesting that your results contradict the general wisdom of &quot;2 procs per minute mainhand, 1 proc per minute offhand&quot;.<br />
<br />
It always felt to me that those two weapons proc somewhat less often than most other proccing weapons, even when the other weapons have the same proc effect.  For example, CHOS vs. GBOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">seems proc per hour would be a little hard to get unless you were fighting nonstop for an hour.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EQ Companion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">seems proc per hour would be a little hard to get unless you were fighting nonstop for an hour. <br />
<br />
When you combine fights in EQ Companion, it only considers actual fighting time. The total playing time in my example was about 4.5 hours but actual fighting time was the quoted 2:09 hours. Calculating procs per hour is easy.<br />
<br />
I don't think proc per hour is something to look for, though as it varies depending on your haste. Swings per proc seems better measurement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you have it backwards.  Procs over time is what should be looked at, as that stat is NOT effected by haste/slows, where proc rate per swing is.   <br />
<br />
While not having looked at those numbes too close *my head starting hurting and my eyes spinning after about 3 minutes of numbers*, I find it strange that weapons seemed to have the same innate proc rate.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure I got it correct. Reading that Shaman's Crucible article, they said:<br />
Proc rate does scale to delay. Hastes and slows have a great impact on proc rate.<br />
What that means to me is the more haste you have, the more procs you will get. If you are calculating pure procs per hour, you will get more procs per hour but if you are calculating swings per proc, it should stay constant.<br />
<br />
I am going to run my test again this weekend, using no haste at all. I also want to do another test swapping the weapons. I am really interested in seeing if the CHoS really procs that much more frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually that's pretty much the inverse. If anything hastes have an inverse affect on proc rates while slows are the opposite. Just ask Remf or any other warrior who asked for Turgur before firing off Rampage with an Earthshaker.<br />
<br />
This is, of course, observational and not empirical, so take it for what it's worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thaak, thank you big guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Will be interesting to see your 2nd round of test results, I'm also in the camp that feels that haste doesn't affect proc rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Iskandar is right -- haste *reduces* proc rate per swing. Procs are time controlled, not swing controlled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That is so weird, but i do undrestand.<br />
<br />
To confirm my understanding...  If I'm hasted, if i'm slowed, or if i have no attack delay modifications at all, my weapon will be most likely to proc the same number of times regarless (per unit time).<br />
<br />
EDIT: restating for clarity, the above is hard to derive meaning from due to word order.<br />
<br />
It matters not whether  a warrior has chanter haste, no haste, or is slowed.  In all three circumstances the weapon in question will proc the same number of times (more than likely at least) in any given amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That is correct as far as we can tell, and from my own parsings. I proc ~3 times per minute with BF in my DPS comparison logs with self haste(71%). And I proc ~3 times per minute with BF with enchanter haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That implies that proc rate is determined on a  ?? Second per Second Basis ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>EQ Companion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I stand corrected, Zito. I ran my second test last night and indeed haste did not have any effect on my weapon's proc per hour rate. <br />
<br />
I had always been under the impression that when your weapon swings, there is a chance for it to proc but this indeed seems to be incorrect. Weapons seem to proc independent of swings and also it seems that the weapon proc rate is halved if the weapon is in off-hand.<br />
<br />
I ran 2 tests, first I fought using Copper Hammer of Striking in primary and Sword of the Bloodsworn in secondary and I removed my haste cloak and I did not use Swift like Wind either. I ran this test for about 3 hours and the total fight time ended up being 1 hour and 27 minutes.<br />
<br />
The second test I put my haste cloak on again and was using Swift like Wind all the time so I had 96% haste on all the time. I swapped the weapons so primary was Sword of the Bloodsworn and secondary was Copper Hammer of Striking. This test was to verify the 'proc rate is halved if in off hand' theory.<br />
<br />
In first test CHoS procced 133+8 = 141 times (hit+resist) so it procced 141/1.45 = 97 procs per hour which is darn close to the last test's 96 times per hour when I was using 96% haste.<br />
<br />
In the first test SotB procced 56+5 = 61 times so it procced 61/1.45 = 42 times per hour which is pretty close to the last test's 45 times per hour with 96% haste rate.<br />
<br />
In the second test where I swapped the weapons and used 96% haste again the total fight time was 2 hours and 7 minutes (about 4.5 hours play time).<br />
<br />
The primary weapon, SotB procced 215+23 = 238 times so the proc rate was 238/2.12 = 112 procs per hour.<br />
<br />
The secondary weapon, CHoS procced 90+10=100 times so the proc rate was 100/2.12= 47 procs per hour.<br />
<br />
I think to get a more accurate proc test, you should have at least 1000 procs in the sample, but that would mean about 10 hours or effective fighting time for primary weapon and 20 hours for secondary weapon.<br />
<br />
I think that this small sample gives good enough indication that at least haste does not do anything to weapon's proc per hour rate and also that weapon's proc rate is about half of the normal if wielded in the secondary hand.<br />
<br />
Here is the details from the first test where I had CHoS + SotB and 0% haste:<br />
