<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have some first hand info on this aug?<br />
<br />
any parse info or even some exp with them would be helpful...<br />
<br />
dont want to blow 760 points on a useless thing... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't remember who it was, but someone here did some fairly extensives parses and it came to show that the aug is basically not worth it.  I'm fairly certain it was this aug, hope that helps alittle even tho I got half of no idea what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
Zan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Make the math by your own. Dodge is around 5 % of the hits.<br />
<br />
So 8 % of this 5 % are ....<br />
<br />
hm<br />
<br />
<br />
hm<br />
<br />
<br />
indeed not very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">not much the 5% would prolly be a better buy and you wouldn't feel bad loosing just 150 points when you upgraded the item you put it on. unless you bought one of the high point cost items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">its useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very much useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's a waste, I have one :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is that really more useless than a 10 AC aug ? 8% of 5% is about 0,45% dps decrease, not really uber, but about the equivalent of 40hp on a 10khp tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the difference +8% is one shot you cant add more with hp ac veng you can and get a greater effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe someone posted a skill mod log on the old boards.  It was like a parry or a riposte aug or something, and altho it did increase it's particular skill, it decreased one of the others, so that you ended up avoiding the same exact amount with the aug as without, just distributed differently.<br />
<br />
So yes, the aug is completely, 100%, totally worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The aug is completly worthless.  All it will do is raise your skill in dodge 8%; so if you have 190skill you get approx 205.  Does it matter . . . definetly NOT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Isn't dodge capped at 240?<br />
<br />
So wouldn't this put your dodge at the hardcap for number coding (8 percent added to 240 dodge, brings it out to 256? Which would cap at 255, then)?<br />
<br />
Not much of an improvement, yes, I know. But it takes your dodge higher than it's technically possible to do, without an modifier of some sort.<br />
<br />
And just one extra dodge in a fight is DPS reduced.<br />
<br />
Like someone above said, is it really all that much worse than 40 more hit points or 10 more AC if what it is you dodged just ONE extra time was a 1400 point attack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My max at Dodge is 190, not 240. I dunno which is the highest Cap (like Taunt, higher skill than 230 does nothing), if the cap is above 190, that 5 or 8% should be working. I got the 5% one cause it was cheap and I cant have enough avoidance, even tho it might be worthless, every bit helps I guess, and it was that or a See Invis :p<br />
Personally, I prefer to think it helps somehow on my tanking, but that might just be me :)</div></div><hr />
