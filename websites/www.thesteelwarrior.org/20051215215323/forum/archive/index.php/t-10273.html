Bleh for long, involved quests with a busted ending.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, did this one a while ago.  You have to hack the guy out of the pod, and you channel when you do it.... so it'll interrupt if you move.  Thats the only thing I can think of unless they broke it.<br />
<br />
The other thing is, it wasn't shareable (much like those stupid homing robot quests) so you'll have to do it once for each person (even if everyone has the quests.)</div></div><hr />

I did it with a Pally, and I didn't talk to the NPC after we hacked him out, so I had to redo it.</div></div><hr />

Third time worked.  I didn't do anything differently any of those times and there was no one else in the area on track (i.e., it wasn't that the NPC was already out walking).  My thinking is that it just bugs sometimes. <br />

Thanks, Yoda, on the sig =)  Figured it was time to actually put poor Vig to rest.</div></div><hr />

I love the Persian feel...not sure if its the colors, the feeling of movement, or the heiroglyphics.  Very cool.</div></div><hr />
