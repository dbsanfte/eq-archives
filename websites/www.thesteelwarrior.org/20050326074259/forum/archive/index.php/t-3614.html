Not bad for our first go I guess. Wondering if anyone can give me some details on how we would handle her. The Gargoyles are what did us in, we were kiting them away, but anyone who got below 50% or so health aggroed them and died.<br />
<br />
Any info is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

We usually kite the gargs.  We assign a druid/ranger to each of them, and once they go live the kite them outside of TTs area.  I think that will prevent them from aggroing your low health folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you could have a knight/warrior set up in front of each of the 4 of them before they become targetable, and a secondary healer on each and just control/kill them as they become targetable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they hit too hard to be offtanked by just 1 tank + 1 healer, for a guild that has trouble with TT that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt say we had a problem with her, it was Gargoyles that cramped us. Had no problem at all up to that point, just trying to find out how best to handle the Gargoyles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaoraEci</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We would have any warriors or paladins offtank the 4 gargs, druids or any clerics available would be assisgned to heal tanks NW, SW, NE, SE (i think thats the setup been a while). Also our warrior wouldnt turn on defensive until she cast her AoE dispell. Our casters would then cast mgb haste, virtue.  This ensures that you need less healing on the MT for when the gargs spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the gargs are fully slowable which helps in the offtanking of them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khiloor</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assign a pally and shaman who's only purpose is to TM the guards and have them all target'd before engaging TT.  When the defilers spawn, have everyone assist the SA killing them and casters AE them while keeping the MA on TT.  Once they are all dead, have the raid continue on Terris.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my guild has 4 knights assigned to the gargoyles, they hit for 1000 max i think, so offtanking isnt very smart. typicall what we do is once they are active, the pallies and SK unload on their gargoyle with all those spells that get them all the ranged agro that we hate =P. after that agro is pretty tight, even after we've killed TT is takes a while to get them off our knights. anyhoo, once they have agro they kite their mobs, with sow mind you, around the premiter, and in the same direction, of the inside part of TTs area until she's dead, at which point the raid leader will call &quot;knight01 to center&quot; where we kill the gargoyle while the other 3 continus to kite, rinse and repeat until they are all dead. rangers, in my oppinion, are better used on DPS for TT since she's in the open for the entire fight anyway, knights can agro faster/better and usually survive a few hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the 4 gargs combined HP is more than TT herself and they all hit harder than TT so not sure why anyone would offtank them while she is up still. Don't make it complicated just have dedicated kiters waiting on them to pop, snare and pull them out of Terris Henge to kite. Don't kite all the way around her lair though or you agro outside guards, there is room to kite without getting near them though. Once she drops everyone assist the MA and burn them down fast. Good luck to you.<br />
<br />
If that aspect of the fight was the only part you had trouble with I would say you win the next time, just be more prepaired for the kites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you kite the Gargoyles be prepared to deal with a few Knights of Nightmare that will aggro through the wall most likely.<br />
<br />
Offtanking works too and is probably safer, but requires more healing of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">had paladins kiting them since the kiter classes had better things to do.   boy was I surprised to be whacked for 1k while i was kiting the gargoyles.  SKs i felt were better off doing damage/HT to TT.  The druids are better off on heals and nukes rather than leaving all that mana on the run.  Rangers are better off doing damage than kiting gargoyles that hit so hard.  <br />
<br />
I dont remember mobs agroing through walls and mind you this was kind of a long raid since the majority died(~35ish, i remember seeing less than 10 in the zone after the near wipe), I was barely able to drag and rez a cleric while i was kiting (3 gargoyles on me), but not everyone got their flags in time before NPC despawned :(.  TT herself wasnt the problem imo, it was the gargoyles. I think TT hit me for 250ish</div></div><hr />

This is Essentially the Core Strat used by everyone.<br />
<br />
Only real thing I hate about this encounter is getting people to Lair of Therris Thule from plane of Nightmare.<br />
<br />
Because as we all know Someone tells the raid, Oh we need to do the hedge maze First?</div></div><hr />
