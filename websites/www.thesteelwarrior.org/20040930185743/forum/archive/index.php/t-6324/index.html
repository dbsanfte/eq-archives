Getting stuck on every tiny rock or sharp rise is silly. Almost died twice making the run to Yxxta last night(you can now get stuck on steps), not to mention not being able to use horse to make the run thru Natimbi anymore because all it does is get stuck on corners and hillsides. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL what sucks in Plane of Disease you cant run up the rocks to get to zone out.  You have to jump over each rock to make it up the hill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow. This thread actually makes me want to fire up EQ for a few minutes. Just to see how bad this collision thing really is. The game wasn't designed for collisions. And to add them now? Wow, that's one ballsy, or stupid, decision on the design team's part.<br />
<br />
Good luck to the poor saps that have to fix that mess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The game wasn't designed for collisions. <br />
WTF? Do you remember running into a wall or door ever? Perhaps walking on the ground? Hitting a tree? Those are the same collisions that are in the game now. They just tried to make them more detailed and screwed it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm.<br />
<br />
Guess that explains the problems i had tryin to climb the ladders in Guk the other day...<br />
<br />
Had to do a total shrink to climb out of a hole in lower guk too.<br />
<br />
*sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bard speed or faster horses are a godsend in GoD zones (no play on words intended) but with the chances of getting stuck on  a rock or piece of terrain as high as it is, the chances of getting aggro on a see invis mob, a train of mobs chasing you, then getting stuck and beaten to a pulp is pretty high.  It's already tough enough to travel through these zones safely but now it's just worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">they should make a new sound for when a collision is detected, like &quot;OW!&quot; or &quot;D'OH!&quot; or &quot;S**T!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If they added sounds on collision detection, it would sound like a scratched record at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;WTF? Do you remember running into a wall or door ever? Perhaps walking on the ground?

<br />
Nah, everquest wasn't designed with collisions in mind. <br />
<br />
Doors, walls and trees are your evidence that collisions were intended? I remember running through quite a few bits of foliage that I should never have been able to run through.<br />
<br />
I remember running through solid objects like boxes, crates and barrels.<br />
<br />
I remember running through entire monsters like they weren't there.<br />
<br />
I remember running through and jumping through rocks, and entire sections of walls.<br />
<br />
Everquest was certainly not designed to have collisions be a major function of gameplay.<br />
<br />
And to add it in now is only flirting with disaster. The disaster of bad coding and hundreds and hundreds of bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ranger guildie was complaining of higher death rate in Velks now.<br />

Namely his death rate. :/<br />
<br />
Can't say he's thrilled with the changes obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You want a fun collision system story?<br />
<br />
We were in Droga, very deep, awesome screwed pull, mobs all over, me, 65shammy, 65wizzy and 57 druid, we evacced to the entrance.<br />
I zone in first, then the rest on top of me... now, since the patch, when I got near some place I could get stuck, I was auto-pushed forward for some reason... well, they zoned on top of me, the collision system thought I was stuck and BAM, I was moved back to my last place before getting stuck... yes, the room full of mobs :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ouch that had to be fun Ealsur,  I didn't play since this new patch came out did they correct the collision issues</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They added a button on the Options window to turn off the Auto-Duck, I still didnt get stuck in geometry, but  this Auto-rewind-to-the-last-spot-before-you-almost-got-stuck will kill ppl, believe me.<br />

Pally in my guild sees like 10 horse heads in front of him while running.  While sitting on mine I have no issue, but if I move, my camera moves to inside my body.  My camera stays level, however my body moves as if both my body and my horse are on extremely strong crack.  Occasionally my camera will even go completely behind my body.  So much fun not being able to see in front of me at all.</div></div><hr />

I had same thing happen to a ranger in my group yesterday. Were doing king room area. Bad pull (yes my fault) slow resist 2 twice so healer and slower dead. Wizard evacs me ranger and her. Ranger zones first and takes on step forward and poof back in king room. I will give him credit he lasted almost 45 secs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">maybe your horse is riding a skateboard or something hussar :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In PoV I kept running into trees and rocks on the way from the GY to the outer caves (since not all servers name things the same, its the cave with the fungals where you sit outside on the grassy hill and pull to there).  It was really annoying and I was wondering if anyone else has been to PoV lately and had this same problem.  It was on Sunday and havent been on since.</div></div><hr />

Good God I loved that game....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">When you gallop it jumps all the way ahead now on a slow computer. Nothing like the back of your own head blocking your view of the pebble you're about to get stuck on.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes when you summon a horse, you warp up/down on the z axis.  It'll warp you back to where you summoned the horse if you wait a moment but if you start moving right after the horse is summoned, the screen goes wacko.  I was warping up on top of buildings and hills and getting stuck :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Switch to chase mode if you use a horse in first person view and that will solve your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Atila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ive been having the problem that when i zone on my horse it ports me to the middle of the zone then when i take my first step it ports me back to the zone line.  Then the forward momentum from that 1 step pulls me into the zone i just came from.<br />
<br />
Rather annoying getting off horse and re summoning at every zone<br />
<br />
Atila</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Atila, I am having the same problems. When I zone into EC from Freeport I am almost at the tunnel. <br />
<br />
As for running up rocks with horses, It's better now. <br />
<br />
The first person view on horseback is horrible. I use to think it was bad with the ears, but now it's even worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">horses let you walk through walls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Charnondall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The thing where you find yourself ported half way across the zone when you zone into EC say, just a camera bug. If you were to hold in the Down key after u zoned in and apperared to be somewhere else, u just zone back.<br />
<br />
Fun when zoning to OT from PoK ;) your camera warps over to the bit pit where howling stones is, like 300 feet in the air and you think &quot;oh shit!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">ROFL, that is a good one.  Getting auto-rewound after an evac to right where you were before evac.  Good thing it was someplace like Droga where nothing sees invis and CR's are a piece of cake and not deep in Chardok or Sebilis or someplace like that....<br />
<br />
I can't stand this collision detection system.  I oftentimes solo mobs in tight quarters with my wizard, so at times I have to back up against a wall or into a corner to avoid being hit by a rooted mob.  Well now I go to back up and I collide with the wall or corner and it pushes me out right into the mobs melee range.  Or it pushes me out into the aggro range of another mob.  This is just stupidly annoying...  EQ has been fine for years, now it's totally screwed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What is kind of cool though is running around corners where you hit the corner, get bounced back, go forward and hit the corner again, then get bounced back, and do that several times before finally going past it.</div></div><hr />
