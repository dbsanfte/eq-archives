My only question is this...Is it REALLY worth the $300k it costs?  I mean, thats gonna break the bank for many moons to come.  I am currently using GsoT augged with anger 3 and I just switched out my SotB for a Velium Gemed Longsword that is basically augmentless atm.  If I was to find a way to scratch up the $300k, the GsoT would go into offhand and the anger aug into the BoC.  My question is that is a hate producing weapon worth going beyond broke when there are anger augs out there to be added to a much less priced weapon?  I believe the BoC is 15/20 with 1 aug slot and the innate anger proc.  What makes it THAT much better than the GsoT at 14/19 with the innate 175dd anger stun and anger aug?   Im a sword player and while that does limit me, I dont see changing my view on what type of weapon to use.  My opinion the 1hb and piercers just dont do it for me.  <br />
<br />
I will admit the BoC + GsoT is a superior combo but is it THAT superior to break oneself?  Im not a pay for plat person so $300k is a big deal for me.  My guild is a family type guild and AoW is a bit much right now due to lack of talent in the guild.<br />

First of all, you look like you've got your acronyms confused and you really mean GBoS all the times you said GSoT.<br />
<br />
Second of all, you look like a non raider.  You play alot obviously, and have a decent bank account, but you don't look like you're going to be taking down any raid targets in the near future.<br />
<br />
Based upon that (Feel free to correct the above if it is incorrect), no, the blade of carnage is not worth the money.  Your greatblade of storms is more than adequate for the LDoN that you appear to enjoy doing, and you'll basically be spending 300k to lower your DPS.  That's not what you want, trust me.<br />
<br />
People are going to come here and tell you to buy it because it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  But think about it for a minute.  These are people who are killing raid targets 5 nites a week and they are people who need every ounce of aggro they can get.  Yours is sufficient for your purposes, and spending 300k on a minor aggro upgrade is not going to be the best use of your money.<br />
<br />
I had a blade of carnage.  Used it, bagged it, banked it, sold it.  There was no reason for me to own one. I went back to Sceptre of Destruction/Copper Hammer and still don't regret it to this day.</div></div><hr />

Plus, if she joins a raiding guild or does pickup raids or whatever, the extra 450 hate proc in offhand couldn't hurt. Which brings up the question, if you need to raid xana to prepare yourself for joining a raiding guild, then how do you raid xana in the first place? hmmm. lol, i must be way tired. oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A BOC is not worth the money if you're comparing relative aggro to pp.If you're playing with friends and you want to use an auged velium longsword and it works for ya go ahead.I know a warrior who tanked well through ep's with auged 1hs dps weapons.Whatever works.<br />
<br />
Personally,I'd use whatever gave me more aggro.That rules out the longsword and any dps 1hander(that you can get) without a proc if you have a SOTB.The CHSD would be a good offhander to swing along with the GBOS,although, its a big kewl looking hammer imo.I mainhanded one tanking through luclin and low pop until I got my BF and it worked well.For me there's not much I want before aggro and I would buy the BOC hehe.Thats just a personal thing tho and a GBOS will serve you very well.I would put something with an aggro proc in your offhand(even the SOTB) and aug it though.Still,if you keep aggro well for the people you play with then no biggie.Have fun hehe. :)<br />
<br />
PS.Nek...You go farm up a droga combo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMHO when the time comes that someone 'needs' a BoC they 'should' be at the stage of the game where they could actually kill the AoW yourselves. Sure; bottomfeeding and contested spawns puts a damper on it though and makes it the price it sells for.<br />
<br />
Hell; i've tanked ToVN with weapons a newb would scoff at ( BBoT and a Praetor Blade ). A BoC would have been nice but 300K would have gone a HELL of a lot farther for upgrades than the ol' BoC...and besides i was 299K short :D<br />
<br />
Although if you got money to burn; a BoC ain't going to dissapoint the owner. Solid weapon for sure but to buy one and sell the farm is lunacy to the common person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeh, I'm a newb and got lucky hehe.The droga weapons came out right as we began to raid velious and pog and stuff.A lot better than many wars had back in the day I'm sure. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;and I just switched out my SotB for a Velium Gemed Longsword&quot;<br />
<br />
Baby jesus cries for you ... perhaps you should rethink that decision.<br />
<br />
Spend 300k on other things ... you'll get more bang for your buck.  Get your SoTB back ... leave the VGL for melee classes.  Go find an anger3 augment and put it on the SoTB once you get it back.  That combo should give you more aggro than you will ever need.<br />
<br />
People have done amazing things with a lot less than you have now.  Unless you've exhausted all possible purchasable upgrades, i'd leave the BoC alone for now.  With your stats you can probably tank AoW pretty easily, so i'd be better to try to coordinate the raid yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The BoC is &quot;worth&quot; 300k in the sense that there is no better weapon that can be bought with platinum.  And when you're ready for a BoC, there is probably not much in any other slot that you could buy, either.  (Items like Helmet of RZ, Stonewood Bow, Thulian Visage, Scalecracker should not be much of an upgrade for you if you're contemplating a 300k BoC.)<br />
<br />
Shikarii's post gives some good perspective on the &quot;need&quot; for a BoC.<br />
<br />
For those without 300k, the GBOS is their BoC.  The GBOS is 90% of a BoC, and is the best weapon you'll get without actually going out and killing Avatar of War or a Ssra boss or Rallos Zek yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Going from a BoC to a GBoS would be a small aggro upgrade and a small loss of DPS.  Not worth breaking the bank for imo.  I would trade the velium gemmed longsword for a copper hammer though, a weapon with no innate aggro proc is just gimping yourself unnecessarily IMO, and the dps difference in your offhand will probably be mostly made up by the copper hammer proc damage.  GBoS/copper hammer with Anger 3 in both will last you a long time.</div></div><hr />

Well my problem is that Bazaar wise, there really isnt any upgrades except maybe boots for me.  I dont get to raid very often with my schedule so joining a raiding guild really isnt possible.  I will need the agro for the hard ldons and the god zones when my friends and I can do them.  I can aug the gemmed longsword with a ykesha aug from ldon for some agro if Im gonna keep it.  The big question is IF.<br />

Im a 2 sword type of girl.  Call me foolish but ya gotta have style!  I dont do well with the makeshift gear so no 1hb or piercers for me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You'd be happier with a SoBS + yak than VGL + yak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Copper Hammer of Striking is the way to go imo. (I've never been a huge SoD fan, the rarity makes them way more expensive than they should be)<br />
<br />
If you're dead set on having a 1hs, ANYTHING you put an anger 3 on will be fine. For off hand you're not gonna do much better than Sword of the Bloodsworn, Vellium gemed longsword, hell, for your purposes even split blade of destruction with anger 3 would be more than adequate.<br />
<br />
Anything with anger 3 will work out. (and since you can move augs now there's no reason to stress over it too much)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">But then how does the non raider improve?<br />
<br />
1. LDoN points for gear and augments/drops<br />
2. bazaar profits<br />
3. open raids.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately; without a solid raiding guild; your gear is limited basically to whatever zones you can get to and/or drops for bazaar.<br />
<br />
Overall; your gear ain't that bad at all. LDoN will help it out and somewhere there is a magelo linked here at TSW that shows a Warrior with all droppable/LDoN content and it's definately achievable by a non-raider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have the Droga pair, anger 3 augs on both and WA2. While people can steal agro from be (a BL friend of mine loves doing it in easy LDoNs) its hard. And, having XPed in Ferubi yesterday, the shaman was slowing on incoming (before I got any agro what so ever) and rarely took more than a round...and often not even that. Slam, attack, taunt then incite is very good for getting agro. <br />
<br />
Once the fight was going for a bit I could easily retreat out of range and have the mob follow me instead of beating on the DPS types. <br />
<br />
I would also make AE taunt a priority--above WA2. You by yourself can save a adv from ugly pulls with a quick use of AET + Furious--the time of no melee damage is usually enough for the rest of the group to start controling the mobs and the delay in the cleric having to heal you (for AETing) means that AET is no longer a good way to get your cleric killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Have used sotb/chos/chsd/gbos/boc/bf....<br />
<br />
IMO once you have the droga combo w/Anger3 make sure you work on armor.<br />
<br />
If there's nothing else you need to buy, sure save for a BoC and try to get<br />
a GBOS.  Those two with anger3 work well and were a noticable gain for me in<br />
aggro over the droga combo w/WA5.<br />
<br />
After that if you are a heavy raider, or are turning into one, try for Bloodfrenzy and<br />
the Gloves of the Crimson Sigil.  BF mainhand and BoC offhand w/Gloves were<br />
again a noticable gain for me.  I assume BBotE is very good too.<br />
<br />
I do not know if I will bid for BBotE to replace the BoC if it ever drops for us.<br />
The greater chance of an earlier proc weighed against its lesser hp and assumed<br />
less aggro on the proc... /sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah,people will always be able to steal aggro from you especially early in a fight it's just our lot.Like I said above the BOC is not worth the pp/aggro ratio and you'd have more fun dropping one for yourself.However,has you move up the scale of buyable upgrades you often pay a lot for fractional improvements.Atm a BOC is the best thing you can mainhand without the help of a raid force.So if you're at that point that you want to improve at whatever cost get it.Besides it'll look nice mainhanded next to your GBOS hehe.<br />
<br />
Level 70,OOW and GOD gear will probably see smaller forces of casual players taking down old luclin raid targets for aggro weapons.Stuff like HG,BBOTE,BF and pop weapons like OSOW may not be too far around the corner.Sooner or later it's likely to happen...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">save the 300k and wait and see if something better is available in the oow expansion. its entirely possible the new expansion will deliver a better weapon thats a common drop. the boc is so marginally better than some of the other equipment out there that its in high danger of being made obsolete by the next expansion. and 300k is a LOT of money. i have 800k burning a hole in my bank and even i wont touch the boc with a ten foot pole for the reason given.</div></div><hr />

endquote:<br />
<br />
Well you have a conflict.  It's harder to &quot;improve&quot; if you're willing to sacrifice stats for style.  Now I'm a fashion horse myself, so I can sympathize, but if swords are more important than your aggro, why worry about the aggro enough to post with the weapons you already have? <br />
<br />
I was gonna say get a great staff of the 4 winds and anger aug it, and some other advice, in fact, Haas is right on with the SoD and the Copper hammer idea.   If you wanted to be symmetrical you could even dual wield SoDs with anger 3 augs (or ykesha stun augs, which with WA5 gets amusing).<br />
<br />
If you only want *swords*, and/or will wield a gemmed longsword or bloodsword etc for fashion reasons then you have motivations that make it much more of a personal choice, and your benefits to posting here decline rapidly.<br />
<br />
I found the weapon i wanted to look pretty in (SEWS), and now I wield it, and it's the only weapon on my person.  I might move to something else around Time, but until then I'm content.</div></div><hr />

I did notice a decrease in agro last night.  Purhaps it is time to bank the VGS and go back to the SotB for now.  I can yak the SotB pretty easily so it would have 2 procs.  I have WA1 atm and I guess I just dont remember seeing the offhand proc message that much.  Maybe Im wrong.<br />
<br />
The comment about saving for the next expansion makes sense.  I was thinking of that in the back of my mind.  Makes sense and I think I will do that.  Who knows what will come out of the new expansion although methinks Verant is leaning a lot more toward no drop items so bazaar upgrades may become a thing of the past.<br />

I thank you all for your time in posting.  Your suggestions definately made a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are incorrect...<br />
With the advent of WA aa and LDON augs dualwielding has become relatively stronger and in vogue again.Generally,1handers of good aggro quality are easier to get pre rz/ep/time.Then 2handers tend to stand out until DBOTW and GOD raid drop weapons.It is the weapons themselves including ratio ,proc and contributing aa  that determine aggro quality.There are many good 1handers and some good 2handers as well.I still hold aggro as well as any warrior in my guild with my 2hander and all notable 1handers pre DBOTW are well represented.<br />
<br />
Aye,your mainhand when dualwielding contributes a much higher proportion of your aggro over your offhand.However,that offhand aggro is still important when dualwielding.Get the second best aggro 1hander you can use in the offhand and keep it there for tanking hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Side point:<br />
<br />
With WA5 I have noticed that there is measurable difference in the BoC and GBoS agro...whether its worth 300k is a whole other story though  :D</div></div><hr />
