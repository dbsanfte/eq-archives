<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok check this out, a Giant spiral ramp made of Ice going downwards. you know like some stadiums have or some parking lots? its a ramp that goes in circles.<br />
<br />
K so like when you zone there is a flat area like 25 x 25 before the ramp starts. then the ramp goes down, no walls just a ice ramp like 10-15 feet wide the circles around and around all the way to the bottom.  the would be plateus every now and then for when you have to go afk or something or med break. but other then that its just a giant spiral ramp going down.<br />
<br />
oh and levi and /follow will be disabled.<br />
<br />
could you imagine the fun of fighting on a ice ramp that goes on and on hehe.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
k so we have a giant ice ramp spiraling down...Im talking giant. and surouding the spial ice ramp is a maze of water tubes with no walls. sort of like the 2 water spouts near the zone in of upper guk, but bigger.<br />
<br />
ok it would look something like, you know that sceen saver you have for windows that has those tubes that grow over and over? well like that but water tubes with a giant spiral ice ramp right in the middle. <br />
<br />
well what you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Skidding on the ice near Yelinak bugs the shit out of me, so I doubt that would be much better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Only one question Akla.<br />
<br />
How does one ZONE OUT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heyas-<br />
<br />
I've always wondered why thurga a/b, kael, or skyshrine didn't have a big &quot;skating rink&quot; area for players to mess around on, kinda like Yelinak's lair w/o the big nasty dragon in the middle of it.  There's also a couple spots in NTOV that are fun, but they are  also infested with big nasty dragons...  making a big icy arena a PVP area woulda been a hoot. :/<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actualy I wanted a totaly invible dungeon. all you can see are monsters nothing else. :) maybe give the rogue the ability to see part of the dungeon or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes! a dungeon full of invisibleness except for mobs...<br />
AND have all the walls as Mirrors!!<br />
<br />
/feedback :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Akla's got a future in the upcoming game, City of Heroes.<br />
<br />
He will be added to the staff, once they realize the potential of such a move, to be the VILLAIN MASTERMIND THAT DEVISES THE WICKED DEATH TRAPS.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah. <br />
<br />
Definitely a future for Akla I see.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh ..... someone falls off the Ice Spiral and goes &quot;thud&quot; and a message like this is broadcasted zonewide :<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone fell to the death and was hit by ridiculous amounts of non-Melee damage. His gear is scattered all over the floor for the next 2 minutes - go get it &quot;<br />
<br />
Offcourse, the bottom would be a very small area indeed and if you get hit by someone falling, you go &quot;squish&quot; and people could pick up your treasure as well.<br />
<br />
That would be the thing on a PvP server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A dungeon with 10 possible zone outs, but 9 lead to certain death!!!!...muahahahha<br />
<br />
and of course the real ZO changes every hour.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, since we are talking about weird fantasy zones, here are some really weird ideas I have had over the past couple of years that might or might not make good EQ zones:<br />
<br />
I want a dungeon where you can walk on any surface.  I have seen movies where people were in rooms and you could walk on the ceiling and walls and on the bottoms of stairs, etc.  Gravity would not be always the same way.  Objects could exert forces on you also--if you walked to close you could be pushed away from or towards certain objects.<br />
<br />
There could be alice in wonderland-like zones where people look shrunk or distorted as they move around in them (example: you are twice as tall on the left side as the right side).  If you stand too close to a wall, you might set off a root trap that makes you stick to it for a while (kind of like those flowers in echo cavens) or perhaps just debuffs you or dispells you.  There could be electrified walls or objects that do a small amount of damage like a damage sheild if you get too close to them or try to pick them up off the ground.<br />
<br />
Another idea would be a zone shaped like the inside of a huge donut.  Using toroidal (donut) coordinates, you could make the direction of &quot;down&quot; be the nearest surface and you could look up to see people standing on the ceiling way above you.  Also if you walked far enough in any direction in a straight line, you would come back to your starting point.  Zone outs could be fixed objects like in pop or they could be moving objects that randomly wander around and you have to find them.  The donut could even be twisted around so that eventually it meets itself, kind of like a huge snake eating its own tail but while all coiled up.<br />
<br />
Another cool zone would be a water zone inside a cave (kind of like plane of water but not as high level) where there are huge tides and wind everywhere and if you get into one of the streams of water or air, you could move very fast along it.  Mobs could sit inside giant whilpools or tornadoes and your raid would literally revolve around them really fast as you fight them.  There could be waterfalls to fall off and geyser traps that blow you way up into the air.  There could be air pockets and places in the floor that would break if too many people stand on them too close together and flood the compartment or make everyone fall to a lower level.</div></div><hr />
