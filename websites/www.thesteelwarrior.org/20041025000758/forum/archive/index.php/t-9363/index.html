<br />
I did a search and found threads on this item, which sounds awesome by the way, but I didn't see what type of group you need for the fights. I'll list my normal group below, are we capable on paper at least, or are we going to be putting my cleric's 96% rez to use.<br />
<br />
58 Warrior &amp; 58 Cleric - Two boxed by me<br />
56 Chanter &amp; 56 SK - Two boxed by friend.<br />
52 Shammy &amp; 52 Cleric - If his wife is two boxing Otherwise 52 Shammy &amp; 59 Ranger.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only hard part is testing your patience on waiting for Heratious to spawn, kill him and fight Valdanov who flurries for ~300 and has a 1k lifetap. He was really easy at level 65. Think I only had to CH 3 times and all we had was 65 pally, me, 62 clr and 65 druid. He just has an assload of hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah Valdanov is the only hard fight, we did shade and his 3 adds other night with 2 65 warriors and a monk but a 65 war could almost solo it, add any healer and its trivial.<br />
<br />
    Valdanov I have done with me, Shaman and a 65 Pally, just takes a while as he does have a lot of HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your capable. Use Vampbane weapons and be ready for a long fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a quest in FM for a decent Vampire Bane Piercer, and you can kill a couple gaurds for some shitty 1hb bane's. When I did this I had 65 Warrior/Shaman (me), 65 Ranger/Cleric (roommate), and a 65 Mage. Was an easy fight, just get bane weapons for the pet too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did the entire quest either solo at 65, or with a boxxed 65 shammy. Vampyre bane weapons were key for Heratio/Vald; however the camp sucks hardcore. I killed the PH over 20 times, and only saw the named twice. One time, I lagged and died, and he was gone, and the other time I killed him and his corpse poofed. I ended up buying ashes for 10k.<br />
<br />
I saw another thread that raised the question of the possibility of the vampyre section of the quest is broken by the pally 1.5. Not sure though, check it yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the vampyre portion of the quest is NOT broken.  i was the originator of the post you mention and, even still, I am now sporting my shield.<br />
<br />
the 1 handed piercer mentioned is  Johanius Stake of Slaying (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7616) .  *easily* soloed in TM for a lvl 65 war.  for you, i would consider boxing your cleric.  these wpns are your best bet.  they are lore but NOT no drop.  only problem is johanius is on something like a four hour spawn time =(<br />
<br />
the bane weapon I would recommend are phosphorous torches (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7441)  which can be gotten in exhange for 4 acrylian phosphates (farmed in netherbian layer off of netherbians or baz purchased).   These aren't as good as the stake but are easy to get, and neither lore nor no drop.<br />
<br />
bare in mind that vampyres have a negative FR because they're...well they're vampires.  the + fire damage should land 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
there is a good 2hs pally only bane wpn as well, but it's a pain to get and you didn't mention a pally in your regular group anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darkmoose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just wanted to say thanks for all the information you've provided, I'll work on the bane weapons and see how far I can get with my cleric, and then get the group involved.<br />
