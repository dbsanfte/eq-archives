<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>terminator24h</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on this quest for a couple days now and I've gathered all the easily gotten parts and the vendor buyable parts.  All that remains is the Reet Crown and the 4x Velium Mastodon Furs which then need to be fashioned into the cloak.  Yesterday I tried my hand at killing reets with a little group of friends - we had a lot of fun, but no success because we got sidetracked into killing Tolapumj.<br />
<br />
However, later on, one of my guildmates offered me an MQ of the crown when he heard that I was planning on going to Sebilis to get one.  So, all I need is the faction and the Furs.  I have two questions: what is the easiest way to get furs?  I don't have enough money to pay 3k which is what people are asking for them on my server.  I need to farm WW, which is just as well because I need Guardian Kozzalym for my Strength of the Elements.  Are there any tips to farming other than just bringing a tracker buddy?<br />
<br />
Then, are there any good ways to get faction besides hunting in seb and/or AEing all of Lower Guk dead side?  I need to get faction for the MQer as well as myself.<br />

Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

Hi Terminator,<br />
<br />
Best way to get furs is to actually hunt. Hunt Hunt Hunt there, bring a tracker to get mastadons easier and one day you'll get lucky with the guardian spawn. For the factioning side, if you are feeling omfg this is boring in guk, you can hunt in sebilis too.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as the furs go, I can't really help ya, I was able to find them in the bazaar for 700 each, so I snagged those up real fast.  As far as the faction goes ... well, it goes slow.  For me, a combination of hunting fabled (AEing the zone during downtime), a little soloing in lower guk (maybe 3 hours) and a couple friends and I going to OS a few nights in a row for fun and maybe the chance at a $$ drop (ended up getting a Runebranded Girdle =D) did the trick.<br />
<br />
Edit: Those are the only ways I've heard of to raise faction there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just shakerpage guk, so something boring and tedious gets a fun touch.<br />
<br />
for the furs, i went to ww (helps to be nonkos with cov heh) and ran around. round and round ... in the end i got 2 and bought the other 2 in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
got a tantor's tusk out of the afternoon as well, plus guardian kozzalym aggro'd on me and bit it.</div></div><hr />

I haven't checked my faction yet but I'm hoping that will help.</div></div><hr />

Buy one then, there's one for 185k right now, but HURRY!</div></div><hr />
