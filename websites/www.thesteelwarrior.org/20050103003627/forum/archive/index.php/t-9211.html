<br />
Is it the level of the mob that makes a difference, or is it the level difference between you and the mob?  Like would a level 60mob always give 600agro (completly fabricated number used just for an example) from a stun, or would it give less agro if I was level 70 instead of 65?<br />
<br />
I know an answer is prolly posted somehwere in one of the two posts on the subject but was hoping someone could quickly answer my question.<br />
<br />
Can ingore this post now, i stopped being lazy and read to completion</div></div><hr />

Just because a casted stun scales doesn't mean that a stun proc scales the same way though.  Same with other spell effects.  <br />
<br />
I'm not doing any reproduceable tests but I do have my offhand auged with the 125 DD ykesha and the aggro on it is quite noticeable.  At the beginning of any xp group fight if any of my 3 main procs fire off (Anger, Anger 3, or ykesha) I get aggro and never lose it.  Call of Fire seems to be noticeably less aggro but still significant.  IMO the aggro difference between Anger 3 and Ykesha is small enough for high level mobs that the difference is insignificant.</div></div><hr />
