<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhagulim</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm interested in asking my guild to take down Captain Rockbelly in Dulak's Harbor to get a barnacle covered axe.  Any info/advice/strategy on the zone or captain?  I haven't been to DH yet and since it's a pretty new zone not alot of info is out there on it yet.  Does he drop the axe each time?  Also my other main weapon is a frosty - would the bca be better in the main or off hand?  Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild recently camped near Dulak's Harbor to get some charms and spell components for our Druids and our Beastlords....sadly nothing was to show after 2 hours of camping. To help cheer us up, our leader, Sammray, decided to start pulling off the boat to get the Captain. She eventually did, and we killed him with relative ease with a 52 beastlord, 50 shaman, 55(?) druid, and a 49 ranger, and me, 33 monk who just tagged along because I was bored. I believe that he does drop the axe every time, but I lost the roll for it. =( grrr</div></div><hr />

<br />
He can also drop http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=40194 Rust Encrusted Leggings.  Supposedly he also drops a Rust Encrusted Tunic, as well, but after a dozen kills, I've gotten one set of leggings, and 11 axes.  (Of course, he's a rare spawn - a dozen kills over two and a half months.)<br />
The axes PC on Xegony for 1kish, down from 3500 a few weeks ago.</div></div><hr />
