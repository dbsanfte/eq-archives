<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its a bit of a read, and written from a ranger perspective, but I figure I'd give you guys the option, since I've stolen such a wealth of knowledge from the warrior community in the past/present and will continue to for ages to come :)<br />

The fact that I love seeing my sig doesn't have anything to do with me posting.  I was mega tired when I wrote it, so please keep that in mind if you want to flame.  Oh ya... the druid list is a must read... hilarious</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SincroFashad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At least it would appear that your class had the right list submitted.  If you look at the rogue board, our rep submitted the *wrong list*.<br />
<br />
The one which was supposed to be submitted was a lil better, and dropped both the totally ridiculous off-hand backstab suggestion, and the only slightly less ridiculous please give us snare on demand request.<br />
<br />
For the record, virtually zero actual raiding rogues wanted off-hand backstab because a) it ties all rogues to 2 piercers and b) it would just flat out be overpowering, unless they did it in some lame way like triple (thanks for working under 10% of the time with max AAs) backstab.</div></div><hr />
