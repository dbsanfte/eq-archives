<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(I ran a search and didn't find anything on this specific topic, but if something exists, feel free to link and I'll get all embarassed and then read it)<br />
<br />
My warrior has been out of comission for about 18 months. I retired Vigdis just before all the new fangled warrior changes.  Recently I've started playing her again.   I will not be using her in EP or above content, although I may bring her out for the first five GoD trials.   I seriously doubt any of her gear will be upgraded past what it is now unless I buy gear from LDON or win items in hard LDON or GoD trials.   I WILL be main tanking for low-ish velious, luclin, pop content (Grieg, Xanamech, IV, AoW).  <br />
<br />
I'm trying to start working on the quickest AA bang for my buck.  When I left Vig, she had most of her defensive AA (nd3,ca3,cs3,pe,pp5,pd3,lr5) and a lot of her offensive AA.  The only thing I didn't get around to was ID. <br />
<br />
Now that I've returned there are all these goddamn GoD AA I need to work on, but I'm not sure if I should do ID or start my sturd.  What is the prevailing philosophy on this?  If you recommend sturd, how many levels would you recommend before going back to ID since the cost scales so quickly? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.  And its good to be back =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would recommend doing Sturdiness 1 (4 AAs for 100 hps is well worth it), then do all your ID.  Weapon Affinity 1 and 2 should probably also be a priority.  Check out THIS (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6806)  thread for a good run-down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assuming youre not getting 1 rounded by the stuff you tank or your healers cannot be efficient due to you having low hps ... ID is a much better buy.  Period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My recent experience is that HP is great, but being able to miss an entire hit that is for 1k of damage or mitigating it down to less than 500 HP is going to make things a lot easier on your healer than an extra 100 HP.  Also, Sturdiness grows costly quickly, 4, 8, 12, etc.<br />
<br />
I should add that I do not have Sturd 1 as of yet, but recently went through a similar conundrum with regards to AA progression.<br />

Obviously for much of the old world content, you won't need any more AA.  However, don't underestimate GoD sewer mobs or Hard LdoN's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sturdy 1 is a great deal.  ID are incredibly valuable as well.  If you're having agro issues, WA is huge.  I have WA4 and its like &quot;whoa&quot; good.<br />
<br />
For what you're tanking though, you shouldn't have problems with getting smished for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info guys. I actually hadn't known about WA at all.  I'm so outta touch!  :o   I haven't had problems with aggro and I'm finishing up points for Anger3 augs so I'll probably go Sturd1, ID5, WA2 and then..go from there, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree.  After sturdy 1 or maybe even 2, ID is the better value for the AA spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This all depends on if your coming back to be a hard core raider  or just a softy (ie ldon type of warrior) the AAs you need are listed.  There really are no short cuts. Exp grinding and work hard on them.</div></div><hr />

 :p As I mentioned in my first post, I will not be using Vig in Time or GoD - for all intents and purposes she is my &quot;alt&quot; and it is my main who will be &quot;hard core raiding&quot; those zones.  Vig will be raiding but only small targets that I can take down with some friends and, yes, in LDoNs and low-level GoD trials.  I don't plan to shortcut, as I'd hope is clear from the AA's I had earned up almost 2 years ago.  I just needed to know the wisest path now given the new GoD AAs sprung up during the long break I'd taken.  I think I have it figured out. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">low-level GoD trials<br />
<br />
There is no such thing!  Unless you are a hard-core raider.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ID is better for the AA cost and overall help. i also did WA before sturdiness as the increase in aggro from WA offsets the increase in hp from studiness. also sturdiness costs a ton and WA doesnt cost nearly as much.</div></div><hr />

100% agree with BC on this too.  WA is a super AA.  Maxing that out before I even consider Sturdy 2 3 4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I split mine...I did WA1 and 2, then Sturdy 1, then WA3 (now I'm off to other stuff for a bit  ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The first couple ranks in WA and Sturdiness are a great return for the AA. Then... well, it really goes downhill fast. From what ya posted, I think you definitely do have it down, though I'd recommend WA2 before ID. 20% more procs for 6AA is amazing, especially for a double augmented DW setup. You can look forward to proccing 1.2 more procs per minute with just WA2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the additional thoughts.  I may change my plans to incorporate WA now. I had a few AA banked, and after exping for a couple more days purchased Sturd2.  WA is the next goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">if not having agro issues I suggest going with defensive AAs myself, less damage taken is nice to your helpful healers. If having agro issues yes invest in WA, but I definatly suggest ID5 before Sturdy 2-5(sturdy 1 is best buy in GoD). Thats my own personal opinion take it or leave it</div></div><hr />
