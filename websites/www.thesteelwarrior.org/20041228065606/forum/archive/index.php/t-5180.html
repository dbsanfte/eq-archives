Incite upgrade(20% higher initial hate and pr tick hate, but they are still tinkering with it, so probably not set in stone):<br />

1:  Increase Hate by 480 <br />
2:  Increase Modify Hate by 84<br />

Lets hope it wont be as hard to get as the Ancient spells from VT/Vulaak/Seru was (still a few people missing those even today hehe, since we stopped killing those mobs).</div></div><hr />

I sometimes auctioned this before LDON came out<br />
&quot;wtb warriror spells&quot; always got a few laughs</div></div><hr />

would suck ass.<br />

I wouldn't have a problem with them being as rare as specs or something. But who knows, maybe we'll have to buy them with some new confounded sort of currency. This game has more kinds of points than my brother-in-law's driving record. ^.^</div></div><hr />

Appears to be the lvl 65 upgrade to incite.  With Ancient Chaos Cry being a special one designed to be uncommon or rare.</div></div><hr />

They currently have same stats but I'd assume that's just because they only copy &amp; pasted the spell when they made it Ancient.<br />
<br />
The level 65 upgrade looks pretty reasonable.</div></div><hr />
