<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rookz</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So my main's a 56 shaman, and after playing for quite some time, and learning alot about the caster side of things, I really felt I didn't know enough about the melee side... so I rolled a Warrior.  Our guild is slowly working our way into PoP and we are sorely hurting on good tanks, and since we have too many shaman, and I have the funds to really equip a warrior well, I'm probably going to be one of our MT's in the long run...  So I was really hopping to shoot around a couple of questions I had...<br />
<br />
<br />
1)  Are my only real agro tools incite and weapon procs?  I understand I'll get a bit of agro from my DPS, and some added agro from damage bonuses, but for the most part is my weapon procs really the main way to keep a mob locked on me? (I know taunt is for getting it back... but at the moment I'm worried about keeping it.)<br />
<br />
2)  If so, then I guess good weaps are one of the most important parts to being a warrior...  So I had this question... does anyone use 2hs or 2hb weapons to keep agro?  It appears I could get more procs off by duel-weilding, so are there many weaps in the game along the 2hs and 2hb line that are honestly of value to a warrior?  (I will keep capping those skills anyway as I have a sick affinity for capping everything... but I was curious to know).<br />
<br />
3)  On the noobie side of life...  I rummaged through the library and got a pretty solid list of good agro weapons (BoC, Sword of the Bloodsword, Frostbringer, Wavecrasher, Barnacle covered axe, fleshgrinder, snowchipper, scepter of destruction, copper hammer of striking, and anklesmasher for all the 1handed weaps), but I noticed only one of them procs before level 40, and even that doesn't proc till 35 (barnacle covered axe).  What weapons should I use as a youngin to keep agro?  I ask this because I really don't want to be know as a bad tank by all those that I group with, until I hit 40 and can start using the weaps.<br />
<br />
4) of that list listed above (BoC, Sword of the Bloodsword, Frostbringer, Wavecrasher, Barnacle covered axe, fleshgrinder, snowchipper, scepter of destruction, copper hammer of striking, and anklesmasher for all the 1handed weaps) which weapons do you think make for a really effective agro combo (please keep in mind that I probably can't afford a BoC hehe)?  Or are there any other weaps that I'm missing that makes for a good combo in your opinion  (I left out all the no-drop weaps, as I won't have access to them for quite a while... I'll need to be a solid tank before my guild can go anywhere to help me get better weaps.)<br />
<br />
5) is the kick skill usefull?  As of yet I noticed Slaming to do more damage and land more frequently then kick.  Does this trend continue indefinately?  If so, should I just not worry about skilling up kick and stick with slam?<br />
<br />
6)  I read word of a AC &quot;softcap&quot; in the library.  Is it still generally accepted that the mitigation returns from AC start teetering off somewhere between 1150 and 1200 AC?  If so, should I start sacraficing AC for HPs at that point in time?  (I do understand that later highend gear will have a solid amount of both, so this might end up being a non-issue).<br />
<br />
7)  Are there any &quot;must have&quot; items that I might be overlooking as a warrior?  things like essential clickable items, or weapons that proc usefull effects that are good to have in the bag, etc<br />
<br />
8)  After I have solid gear, a good set of resist gear, and Good agro weapons, what separates a bad warrior from a good warrior?  What kind of tricks, or tactics do you employ frequently that you feel sets you above the &quot;average warrior&quot;.  Basically, what I'm looking for here is any advice you can give, after the gearing is said and done, that would help me do my job more effectively.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry to come across as such a noob, but I felt it was more important to get these things answered then end up looking like a fool ingame.  I appreciate any help you can give, and if you only have an answer for one or two of the questions please drop it anyway =).  Any little bit helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Yes<br />
<br />
2. Yes, tho 2h weapons are somewhat rarer than decent 1h.<br />
<br />
3. Before 40 you can keep aggro thru DPS.  A high ratio 2h or a wurmslayer will end up serving your purpose just fine.  Aside from that fact, if what you say is true, then there's very little chance you're gonna spend any time at all below 40 anyway.  Be not concerned with it.<br />
<br />
4. Pick 2 and you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
5.  Slam will always be better than kick.  The only reason to care is if you use illusions extensively.<br />
<br />
6.  AC softcap applies to what you're fighting.  It's 1250 up until Velious/luclin content.  After then, you're gonna start needing more.<br />
<br />
7. Any &quot;must have's&quot; only make your life easier.  If you don't mind depending on everything else for everything, then there is no must haves.  There are a fair amount of utility items that will make your life easier should you acquire them tho.<br />
<br />
8.  Experience.  Just stick around awhile and pay attention, you'll pick up on what's important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass is correct, but I want to throw in a few things also.<br />
<br />
2.  Dps does decent aggro with 2handed weapons.  However you still should go for proc first.  But it's the 2handed dps that lets 2handers work as aggro weapons also.  Though for bazaarable stuff, stick to 2 1handers imo.<br />
<br />
4.  Copper hammer of striking and Sword of the bloodsworn are fairly cheap and effective aggro weapons once they start procing.  They should last well until you start getting things like GBoS / BoC.<br />
<br />
6.  The softcap is between 1200 - 1300 for Velious and Luclin.  There is no easily obtainable softcap for PoP really.  Ac is underestimated post PoP imo.<br />
<br />
7.  Nothing is really must have, if you don't mind relying on others for things.  There are a lot of clicks and procs that can help you be more self sufficient, and some things that might help the group even.  I have a crap load of utility stuff in my inventory on my magelo if you want some ideas.<br />
<br />
8.  Experience definately.  Also paying attention to everything is huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoC, Sword of the Bloodsword, Frostbringer, Wavecrasher, Barnacle covered axe, fleshgrinder, snowchipper, scepter of destruction, copper hammer of striking, and anklesmasher for all the 1handed weaps<br />
<br />
I would take Fleshgrinder and Snowchipper out of the agro list. Both proc a DD, 75 (I think) on the FG and 120 on the SC, which are not really good solid agro.<br />
<br />
I think Slam has the same skill cap than Bash (Not sure since Im a small race), but if so, it should be better than Kick.<br />
<br />
I recently started to use a 2hs for groups, just the 2hs Epic auged with Anger, the ratio is not a big thing, but the procs seem to fire enough for me not to worry about agro, even with elemental rogues on the mob's ass.<br />
<br />
And answering to 1), you can also add other's agro, even if it sounds silly, Taunt is for piggy-backing on someone's agro, BST pets or Mage pets build some big agro with their stun procs, their agro can be beneficial for you if you Taunt to get their agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">since the previous posters answered well ill address just one question of yours:<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;what separates a bad warrior from a good warrior? &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
same thing that separates all good characters. humility and a constant drive to figure out a better way. i think some of the worst players out there are those who refuse to take advice refuse to watch others to see what they do refuse to admit they blew it in their group that day refuse to admit they have anything to learn and love to blame everyone EXCEPT themselves when things go badly. such players never improve. they dont need to. they are without fault already ... or so they seem to think. we all know them. they exist in every class and every level.<br />
<br />
ive had days when i positively STUNK. days when i was THE reason for the wipeout or the lost mission. i would say very few players could say with integrity that they never fit that description at all. but taking ownership of your own mistakes will improve you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some other tips for the new warrior be to avoid the beg and disarm myths for aggro.<br />
<br />
Although disarm doesnt really hurt, it is a distraction.<br />
Beg can actually harm aggro by briefly turning off attack to do it with no aggro gain.<br />
<br />
As for the taunt button, use it when you need it.<br />
If you have aggro, you dont need it.<br />
If the mob turns away from you, THEN click it.<br />
<br />
Only mash it when like Ealsur said, piggybacking aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BolarGimack</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can add a lil bit that wasn't. As for good proc'n aggro grabbers for low lvls. Get you a couple Wakizashi's of the frozen skie's  Them bugga's are decent proc's cheap as all get out and if memory servers me. (Don't quote me on it.) they proc at lvl 27. Its a low lvl proc and comes in handy. Also I dunno when they takin the skellies out of the game but the sword off them proc's at lvl 1.<br />
<br />
You really won't need a proc'n weap till ya get into the 20's anyway I don't think specially nowadays that folks go from 1 to 20 in a solid 6 to 8 hours in pc. (Again dun quote me I never used this method.)<br />

Everyone has summed the rest up purdy good here.<br />

While you don't necessarily &quot;must have&quot; them, they do allow a Warrior to partially make-up for the absence of three important services.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your guild is doing early PoP then you should be able to get together enough people to get some nice free 1 handers out of UP. Radiir/Spirit of Radiir drops a 11/17 dagger (Shadowheart) that has no level cap and there is a 12/18ish 1hs out (Mithril Short Sword or somehting similar) there as well that can be done with a group or 2 depending on level. Not very heavily camped at least on my server. Will last you easily until you get to the recommended proc level for all the standard agro weaps. Also a couple decent 2 handers out there. all free :)<br />
<br />
From level 20 until 45ish something like a Reaver (40/40 2hs) would be great main weap too. No level limit, and great damage will give you all the agro you should really need.<br />
<br />
Also, get to level 20 fast and then use the 41 percent tribute haste if you don't already have a good haste item. At lower levels you often are without a haster and having 41% haste can make things nice for you.<br />
<br />
Finally, not sure how far along you are with your war, but i'd make sure it is a diety that can wear Fierce Heraldic or Helanic Tundra armor.  For anyone that doesn't have access to good amounts of plat or a guild that get them ornate level equip with ease there are very few readily available upgrades to these 2 cultural armors. Most people correctly say that &quot;end-game&quot; this is not an issue, but you have a lot of dirt to chew before you get to that point and it will make your life easier till then.</div></div><hr />

Procs a stun+DD at 35, maybe something you can look up to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just about everything above is correct.<br />
My thoughts on a couple issues:<br />
1. YOu have five main avenues of managing agro: the speed/ratio of your weapons, the proc of your weapons, the incite (provoke) line, taunt, and your brain. Early in your career, procs are the least important of these, because A) most weapons that have good procs you can't use yet and B) your procs are in part based on your DEX, so you might only proc once a minute. Sometimes the proc will happen early in the fight, but really before a minute goes by on old-world mobs, either the mob is dead or you and your cleric are dead. Later in the game, with top-end weapons and the right AAs, procs become progressively more important. <br />
1. A. You might look at gearing your warrior for four phases: pre-mid 40s, 40s-55ish, 55 on, and Endgame. You mention having enough pp to outfit a warrior, but you should seriously check the prices on ornate molds (&quot;55 on&quot;) before you say that. I'd be inclined to avoid buying really expensive twink weapons for your warrior pre-40s, for two reasons. One, you won't use the weapons long, and two, nothing, and I mean nothing, helps you figure out how to hold agro like having trouble holding agro. There are weapons around that are so good that your pre-40 warrior would need to do little other than get in melee range and hit autoattack. If you don't have those weapons, you have to work on all the other things that help hold agro.<br />
1. B. Get and use a bow. Pull with it when you're a puller, tag incoming mobs when you aren't. You'll be surprised how helpful it is to tag the incoming mob with an arrow for getting initial aggro. Use your incite/provoke. If both taunt and provoke are up at the same time and you're trying to get the mob off someone else, hit taunt then provoke/incite--in that order, but almost at the same time. <br />
1. C. Practice all your weapon skills. Yes, there are some 2-hand weapons you can use to hold aggro at level 55-on, some of them are cheap, and some of them will fall into your hands without warning.<br />
<br />
5. Kick is good because every once in a while you'll have the option of being turned into some bear or wolf or somesuch. This will increase your stats, but (even if you're a large race) remove your ability to slam (what Haass was talking about). Kick will stun mobs after you reach 55, too. That said, for large races slam has a higher skill cap and will generally be more useful. I pretty much mash the slam key, but pay attention to caster mobs and try to time your slam to interrupt them. If you are fighting a mob that runs at low health, time your slam to that it's up when the mob turns to run. Slam stuns the mob for a round or two, so stopping the running mob for a bit is good.<br />
<br />
Some general things:<br />
1. Learn how to use /shield.<br />
2. I recently pl'd a shaman from level 10 through level 21 in about five hours in PC and then M Seru. Then I spent two days methodically casting trivial spells in an attempt to plug the enormous skill holes that had developed in my toon. It's very tempting to pl, but if you really want to learn how to play a warrior and melee is new to you, I'd avoid too much pl'ing. Nowadays leveling early on is so easy that your toon will advance faster than your own ability to play an unfamiliar class will.<br />
3. As MT you decide certain things: where will the mob be fought? What order will the mobs be fought? What direction will the mob be facing? You should know the answers to these questions, and have reasons for those answers.<br />
4. Warriors have a deep hp pool and excellent mitigation, and these things are useful to a group primarily because they save healers mana and they reduce the risk others in the group face. A good tank always seeks to reduce risk to the rest of the group and answers the questions in #3 above in such a way that the group fights most efficiently. Your ability to do damage yourself is trivial compared to the amount of extra damage a group can do fighting behind a good tank rather than an ignorant tank.<br />
5. Communicate with your group. You're a shaman, so you know how difficult it is to time all the buffs you throw out there. Update your casters on your buff situation, and let them decide how to manage their mana. Figure out who calls &quot;run&quot; in tough situations (probably either you or the main healer). You'd be surprised how many needless deaths occur because people don't follow simple orders, or don't know who is supposed to make a decision. When to run is just one example, but: pick someone, and if &quot;run&quot; is called, everybody by god run. Some casters like to be the last to zone, but in my groups, I'm the last to zone (assuming I'm still alive). If raid leader says stand still, stand still. If raid/group leader says move up, move up. Etc. If casters are LoM in a group, don't be afraid to call a med break--always vote with your cleric.<br />
6. Know things: which mobs are casters? Which are higher levels? What is the re-spawn rate? What is their aggro radius? Where are your group members and what is their condition (that is, if your cleric's hitpoints start to fall, you should know immediately why, and if you need to pull a mob off him, you should know where he is so you can run right to him)? Where are the adds? What are the pathing characteristics of the mobs you are facing? <br />
7. Some nice things to have: By the time you reach level 50, I'd be carrying: stat bonus food and drink, Everfrost gate potion (even ifyou are an evil race: Everfrost gate drops you in a spot fairly close to the PoK book and there are never ever any guards between you and the book, and Everfrost gate potions are cheaper than gate-to-bind-point potions), some ability to SoW myself, some extra gear to bump up resists. I also carried stinging wort potions, which saved me on a late heal a couple of times, and I carried a couple of peridots on me to give to casters if they needed them.<br />
8. Before lvl 55, in normal experience groups, the number of times your healer has died before you have died should be fewer than the number of fingers on one hand. The number of times your healer has died and you lived should approach zero. You should be extremely embarrassed if a skilled caster dies in the course of doing his job and you live. (Stupid casters can actually do things that make it impossible to save them, but when a good caster dies and you lived, you almost certainly made an error.)<br />
9. It's all really simple: Mobs do the dying, you do the killing. Don't get them mixed up, and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The major things have been covered (referring to #8 on the original post)...here area a couple additions:<br />
<br />
1.  if grouping with pet classes, spin the mobs back to the group or, if in a static camp, make sure everyone knows where you are pulling to so they can park their pets to get the mobs back.  Pet classes lose a ton of dps if they have to reposition their pets (dont worry about rogues...they can move themselves  ;) )<br />
<br />
2.  already said, but well worth repeating...communicate!  Communicate about everything...setup for pulls, when to slow, handling of adds, if you lose agro, etc.  Also, pretty much every time I lose agro we figure out what went wrong ASAP and make changes as needed...casters don't last long if they get agro :) .<br />
<br />
3.  at 55 get a GSoT.  Same agro as the Droga wpns for only 100 plat.  (the agro will vary based on zone and mob...and sometimes the Droga wpns are better, sometimes the GSoT...so it's worth having both)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doobs72</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of people overlook, don't know about, forgot about, or don't care about root aggro. Whoever is closest to a rooted mob is the one getting hit.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I like root aggro, but when the druid roots it, or the mage pet roots it, it's good to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you find yourself going LD frequently, a Gate potion is a real lifesaver.  I try to keep one on my toons at all time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Add in situational awareness to your bag of tricks.  Process what is going on around you in game in terms of the group, respawn, other groups etc.  <br />
<br />
In addition, as you play, pay attention to what your group mates are doing in terms of position, casting, etc.  The more you know about your own class and others and how it all fits in together the more you can adapt.   Remember, while each class has &quot;class defining abilities&quot; there are also lesser known abilities that are very handy and can be used to make a successful  and fun group.  <br />
<br />
Lastly, learn how to judge the group's abilities.   This means communication within the group to see how folks are doing on mana, position etc.  It may mean slowing down the pulls or even moving to a different area if someone can't keep up.  There is a difference between challenging yourself and setting yourself up for a train wreck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Tarnia<br />
<br />
Pay attention to whats going on around you.  The fight (quite literally) revolves around the tank.  We decide specifically where fights happen.  A lot of times, it doesn't matter.  Other times, simple little things like being the first one on mobs, positioning pets behind mobs where you can, making sure fights don't move into bad places can make a difference.</div></div><hr />
