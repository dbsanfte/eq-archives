<br />
That's the problem Gir. The way they &quot;fixed&quot; the BP was so that you couldn't stack three HP augs into it, well you couldn't stack them like BEFORE.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know before the patches you could bump it up to 210 hp.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that's what they addressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vengeance 4 is only 20 attack,&quot;<br />
<br />
Giraan, Giraan, Giraan.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Every ounce of my monk-ness is saddened by that comment.<br />
<br />
:-(<br />
<br />
&quot;there's other ways of getting ultravis/see invis,&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course there are. But then again I could say the same thing to YOU about there being other ways to get 40 percent haste other than getting it on your BREASTPLATE like you did. (Like boots, back, waist, ear or even range).<br />
<br />
If it's a BP you know you're gonna use, you know you're NOT gonna replace for a long time and you know that they now &quot;fixed&quot; (or nerfed) your ability to stack HPs on it like before ... why not put Enduring Breath on it? Or see invis? or whatever effect it is that gives you the most trouble?<br />
<br />
I mean really, say you're still swapping in a Fishbone Earring ... and you have to say, replace a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement with this fishbone earring ... what would the harm be in augmenting your 100 hp BP with, say 40 hit points, 25 hit points and Enduring Breath, instead of a type 1 aug, like the 6 STA or the dinky 12 hp one from the adventure drops?<br />
<br />
&quot;regen 5 won't do ya much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regen 5 does a whole lot if you tank LDoN adventures.<br />
<br />
BUT if you must consider the MAXIMUM amount of hit points you could shove into this thing ...<br />
<br />
It'd probably be a 40 hit point aug ... a 30 hp aug ... and shove a type 1/all aug like 6 STA or 12 hit points into the type 3 slot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i have all vendors unlocked to 1492 and looked into this last night for you.  THEY SCREWED UP and I sure hope they freaking fix it soon.<br />
<br />
I'm normally pretty understanding when it comes to making changes when they are needed.  I do agree that some of the changes were needed with the LDON armour BUT.....<br />
<br />
They put slot one on the ldon armor insted of slot 7... their are a total of 0 slot 1 augments curently available on vendors.<br />
<br />
Anyone who purchased augments and planed to put them on items they were going to buy are now sitting with augments that they can't use and they can't get a refund.(example I purchased a 20/20 slot 2 augment and now with the changes the ring AND the earing are crap and I can't get a refund)<br />
<br />
If making drastic changes allow people to get refunds for their augments they have on their characters.  You changed everything and only offered refunds on augments that were not used anymore.<br />
<br />
The fix was not very well thought out if it were they wouldn't have had to kill all the vendors the day of the patch.  I could list examples of items that were worth spending 5000 points on before but since the piss poor job of bandaiding the problem we can add this to another patch blunder.<br />
<br />
Change all slot 1 to slot 7 on items and you still have only 2 slots available to put HP and/ or mana augments.  I really think that was the intention but someone forgot that slot 1 was already being changed to slot 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sooo.... currently<br />
<br />
Put nothing in slot 1 and hope they fix this pice of crap maybe a 12 or 15hp any if you can find some.  Put a 40 from takish in slot 2.  slot 3 is the slot where an effect item can go and you can put in vengance or what ever is needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">10 cha?<br />
<br />
not a good answer, but there are plus 10 to stat augments which go to any slot sold by the merchants now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you buy the bp pre patch or past ?<br />
The ones bought before patch are still 2 times slot type 2 and one slot type 3.<br />
Best path IMO, 40 hp augment from nro, 30 hp augment from sro, 10 ac augment from BB.<br />
Much harder to answer for those bought past patch as only one hp augment is possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got a Question for you Brutall ...<br />
<br />
Looked around at PR loot site, and found only ONE Type8 aug<br />
That could actually be of some interest.<br />
<br />
TAKISH<br />
Radient Pebble of Perfection <br />
<br />
NO DROP AUGMENTATION<br />
Augmentation Type: 8<br />
WT: 0.0 Size: TINY<br />
HP: +20 MANA: +20<br />
<br />
Restrictions -<br />
Slot: EAR FACE NECK SHOULDERS BACK RANGE PRIMARY<br />
SECONDARY FINGERS WAIST<br />
Recommended level of 65.<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you confirm this is really the case ?<br />
I was hoping for some 25hp or 25mana augs.<br />
For classes that want to specialise, 1150AP for 20hp kinda pisses me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">10ac aug from MM for 510 points is still alright for the other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm maybe im an idiot but the posts are rather confusing. <br />
<br />
Type is more interesting than slot. Slot is just a number indicating the amount of augments available it seemt to me. when an armor has slot 1, 2, 3 it means that there are 3 available slots. <br />
<br />
The same armor f.eks. tak bp would be slot 1-type 2, slot2-type 2, slot3 - type 3. <br />
<br />
normal non ldon armor seem to be only having 1 slot and now being. Slot 1 - type 7. <br />
<br />
So everyone in the post talking about slots dosnt seem very relevant. Plz correct me if im wrong.<br />
<br />
P.S of course im a noob and didnt think about the type changes in the tak armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the new BP has:<br />
<br />
slot 1: type 1<br />
slot 2: type 2<br />
slot: type 3<br />
<br />
it used to have <br />
slot 1: type 2<br />
slot 2: type 2<br />
slot 3: type 3<br />
<br />
With the changes to type AND the lack of decent type 1's that can be added to it this is one heck of a nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
For myself: As type 3 and 7 (i.e I can add Veng 4/AOB/etc to my existing BP) are basically a wash now I see the incremental value of this BP not to be worth my time over the Ornate I currently have.  Paying 1492 + aug costs for a type 1/type2 just isnt worth it IMHO.<br />
<br />
Thanks alot SoE ;-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pre-nerf BP is balanced just about perfect. It is still good enough that a Time geared warrior would wear one until Raex's as an alternative the other heavy hitters and it is better than anything available to a casual player.<br />
<br />
Switching the augments to 1+2+3 just sucks unless some decent type 1 augments start showing up on the vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this change really pissed me off.  Now, the only reason to buy LDoN armor is if it would be an upgrade to what you are currently wearing.  Previously, you could spend a ton of points for a LDoN piece that was about equivalent to your current piece (ornate for example), and then turbo-charge it with augs.  Take the breastplate for instance.  It is about equivalent to an ornate breastplate.  Now, you can't make it 210 hps, you can't make it even 170 hps, you can only make it 140 hps.  Ornate bp goes to 155 how with 40hp aug.  They basically just made the LDoN useless to alot of people.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'll still buy one bracer, with a 40hp aug, and 8% dodge aug. . .and, uh, i guess 6 or 10 cha.  :P  I have a feeling the other platemail classes will have alot more use for the armor than warriors, due to the mana and higher hp/ac than they typically see (compared to warriors).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please show me a 40 hp aug that goes in an aug type 7... not denying (completely) that there is one out there... just very dubious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And i am in agreement.  Probably will get 1 or 2 plate pieces for the 8 percent dodge and the 36 percent haste with decent AC / hps (helm) but after that, shrug, im now not at all liking the slot 1 augments for the armors.</div></div><hr />
