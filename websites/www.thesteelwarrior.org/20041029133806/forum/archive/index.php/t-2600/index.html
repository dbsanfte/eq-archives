<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hear people actually try to fight him in his lair ? we pull him out with bards and DA never heard of fighting in lair. Wouldnt his AE put you in lava ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, some people fight in his lair, yes the AE will eventually put you in the lava, yes someone will get lost and die in the lava if you are trying to get an entire raid in there, yes it is much easier to pull him out of his lair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We fought him in his lair for a long time, and it's a lot easier to fight him outside of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">His shadow step is no thx....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We have a great spot to fight him. Long pull though. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We pull to the back side of castle 1 and take him down there lots of room to work with and only one spawn at the end of the steps..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Almost any spot besides the lair is fine to fight him.  Healers can't exactly heal when they're burning in lava for 100/second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you have good pullers, they can get every mob to 1st castle in few minutes.<br />
<br />
arch mage is little trickier with los, but they still manage to do it. firetail is always a pain if he warps the puller the wrong direction, easy for him to get hung up or out run him too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We've had the pullers pull Firetail to Fennin's throne before, don't ask me how they do it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">from what i hear in our monk channel is they pull named and use invis potions, nothing assists nameds. We usually pull all to the 1st castle bird area</div></div><hr />

Just a tidbit, but shadowstep (at least the PC cast version) ONLY sends you level or down slope,  never up.  If you could find a nice low spot surrounded by higher elevation, it shouldn't be an issue... haven't tried that named yet cause euro/asians have em permakilled, but it should work...<br />
<br />
Turns out knowing that little tidbit about shadowstep can be pretty useful for PVP as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We pull him to castle 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pulled him to castle 1, worked fine:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">pull to castle1. works like a charm. nice wide open area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">quav to castle one, everything else to castle 2 imo</div></div><hr />
