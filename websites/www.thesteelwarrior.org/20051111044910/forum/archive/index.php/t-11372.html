On Bleeding Hollow, TM is basically now Alliance territory.  Only killed a handful of people last night, but racked up 163 Honorable Kills, go figure.<br />
<br />
Lag was unbearable, they should have really fixed the raid cluster lag issue before putting this in.  That or upgrading the servers to the hardware of the test server.  You had 200+ people raids on the test server and little lag.</div></div><hr />

The lag on Kil'Jaeden was unbearable, at times dropping everybody after massive highs and then lows in latency. Everybody had it, at least everywhere I went, until I finally got fed up and logged out.<br />
<br />
And yet its still fun. I imagine things will cool down once the excitement of the whole thing hits a lull. Despite the difficulties that they've hit, Blizzard still manages to roll over these obstacles while still maintaining the integrity of the game, something that other companies have notoriously failed to do in the past.</div></div><hr />

I disagree.  Killing greys just became a total waste of time, and once the first tally is made and people start gauging what they need to do to advance, we'll see even less of it.<br />
<br />
Right now it seems like all of the tards are sitting in Hillsbrad AE'ing the fuck out of everything in their giant raids, which is fine by me.  I've seen a few people already with 500+ honor kills, but i suspect they are raid tags and not solo kills.  And if Honor is divided like XP is, like they've suggested, those people aren't going to be getting dick for points when the tally comes.<br />
<br />
We'll see.</div></div><hr />

You can be the most dishonorable ass, but because you kill some people that are green or yellow to you, then according to the game you are still &quot;honorable&quot;.  If they're not going to really implement dishonor then they should just have a PvP ranking system based on green or better kills.  Calling it an &quot;honor&quot; system cheapens the word honor.</div></div><hr />

I think number 6 is what they mean.</div></div><hr />

This is war man.  All out, racial war.  If I'm level 60, and a level 40 attacks me, killing him would technically give me a dishonorable kill if we implemented the system that way.  All you would be doing is changing the griefers from high level, to low level.  And trust me, it's WAY better to have level 60's be able to grief people than it is to have every idiot who can roll up a new level 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">04-20-2005, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I did some PVP for a bit by TM... got owned lots. Respawn timers are way too long. They need to be shorter and proportional to the populations. I spent more time waiting to rez than anything, really. And once had to way for my PVP timer to expire before rezing as the Alliance had wiped everything in TM and was  killing as people rezed in the GY. <br />
<br />
At the same time as TM was owned I stoned to Ogrimarr and found about 30 more allinance at the front gate. <br />
<br />
ANd I can not charge. It lags me horribly. So I am a warrior who can not close.<br />
<br />
If this is tested I will eat my hat.</div></div><hr />

That's why they need to change it where if a low level attacks first, they're fair game.  Bingo, problem solved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would work, but honestly, i'm in favor of less rules.<br />
<br />
If people choose to go around killing greys all day long, so be it.  They're not earning anything for it, and they're only falling farther behind the people who are playing by the rules and earning points for their actions.<br />
<br />
Actually, I HOPE that I see some of the same pieces of shit who ganked me when I was 30, (who are still level 55 btw) still being pieces of shit after I'm scaling the ranks.  It will make victory much sweeter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the AE classes ... when they AE the enemy they hit lots of lowbies who are hidden between the big ones and so they get lots of bad kills.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think about is to stop damagedealing to someone who is grey and to stop this one to make damage to you. But then you'll have some immortal healers/rezzers which is also not the way it schould go.</div></div><hr />
