<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good group of guildies wanted to help a guildy cleric get some easy exp, so we headed to PoV (with ldon pop is deserted at times), we got to IC and lone and behold there is The Sleep Walker.  We decided to one group him so we buffed with a 65 war, 65 shm, 65 rang, 65 shadow, 62 mage and 58 cleric.  The battle went fine but we wiped to starting without full mana.  We then came back, used a pocket cleric for HoV and proceeded to decimate him (TS was back up on the ranger, huge dps difference). <br />
<br />
My question comes from the fact that when defensive wore off the max hit the mob did with Temperance on me was roughly 964.  With Virtue the mobs max hit was 897.  I am over the 1200 old world soft cap unbuffed, cs3, and pe, and wondered if the drop of over 50 pts/1000 is normal in pop for an ac increase as low as the difference between temp and virt (not that its small, but its less then unbuffed and buffed for example).<br />
<br />
Anyhow figured, I would share a bit of infor of the number crunchers to have fun with.  Good hunting all.<br />

However, a change of 50AC could have certainly meant that in the second fight the mod didn't hit for max at any time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you.  When I said max hit, you are quite correct, I did not parse the log.  However during the fight I just watched (not like I had much else to do but kick).  The highest number I saw (and repeated I might add, quite frequently, grrr) was 964, then on the second one 897.  Got to learn something new every day....today I have learned that AC shifts the hump in the hit distribution bell curve, it doest not lower the whole thing.  Anyhow, thank you for the reply, answers my curiocity.<br />
