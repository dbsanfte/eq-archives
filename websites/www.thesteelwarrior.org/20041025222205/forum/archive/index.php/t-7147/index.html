<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got this from a friend it is a bit of a long read but please take a minute.<br />
<br />
(The following story was written by Lori Kimble, a 31 year old teacher <br />
and proud military wife. Mrs Kimble, a California native, currently <br />
lives in Alabama.) <br />
  <br />
I was sitting alone in one of those loud, casual steak houses that you <br />
find all over the country. You know the type--a bucket of peanuts on <br />
every table, shells littering the floor, and a bunch of perky college <br />
kids racing around with longneck beers and sizzling platters. <br />
  <br />
Taking a sip of my iced tea, I studied the crowd over the rim of my <br />
glass. My gaze lingered on a group enjoying their meal. They wore no <br />
uniform to identify their branch of service, but they were definitely <br />
&quot;military:&quot; clean shaven, cropped haircut, and that &quot;squared away&quot; look <br />
that comes <br />
with pride. <br />
  <br />
Smiling sadly, I glanced across my table to the empty seat where my <br />
husband usually sat. It had only been a few months since we sat in this <br />
very booth, talking about his upcoming deployment to the Middle East. <br />
That was when he made me promise to get a sitter for the kids, come back <br />
to this <br />
restaurant once a month and treat myself to a nice steak. In turn he <br />
would treasure the thought of me being here, thinking about him until <br />
he returned home. I fingered the little flag pin I constantly wear and <br />
wondered where he was at this very moment. Was he safe and warm? Was his <br />
cold any better? <br />
Were my letters getting through to him? As I pondered these thoughts, <br />
high pitched female voices from the next booth broke into my thoughts. <br />
  <br />
&quot;I don't know what Bush is thinking about. Invading Iraq. You'd think <br />
that man would learn from his old man's mistakes. Good lord. What an <br />
idiot! I can't believe he <br />
is even in office. You do know, he stole the election.&quot; <br />
  <br />
I cut into my steak and tried to ignore them, as they began an endless <br />
tirade running down our president. I thought about the last night I <br />
spent with my husband, <br />
as he prepared to deploy. He had just returned from getting his <br />
smallpox and anthrax shots. The image of him standing in our kitchen <br />
packing his gas mask still gives me chills. <br />
  <br />
Once again the women's voices invaded my thoughts. &quot;It is all about <br />
oil, you know. Our soldiers will go in and rape and steal all the oil <br />
they can in the name of 'freedom'. Hmph! <br />
I wonder how many innocent people they'll kill without giving it a <br />
thought? It's pure greed, you know.&quot; <br />
  <br />
My chest tightened as I stared at my wedding ring. I could still see <br />
how handsome my husband looked in his &quot;mess dress&quot; the day he slipped it <br />
on my finger. I wondered what he <br />
was wearing now. Probably his desert uniform, affectionately dubbed <br />
&quot;coffee stains&quot; with a heavy bulletproof vest over it. <br />
  <br />
&quot;You know, we should just leave Iraq alone. I don't think they are <br />
hiding any weapons. In fact, I bet it's all a big act just to increase <br />
the president's popularity. That's all it is, padding the military <br />
budget at the expense of our social security and education. And, you <br />
know what else? We're just asking for another 9-ll. I can't say when it <br />
happens again that we didn't deserve it.&quot; <br />
  <br />
Their words brought to mind the war protesters I had watched gathering <br />
outside our base. Did no one appreciate the sacrifice of brave men and <br />
women, who leave their homes and family to ensure our freedom? Do they <br />
even know what &quot;freedom&quot; is? <br />
  <br />
I glanced at the table where the young men were sitting, and saw their <br />
courageous faces change. They had stopped eating and looked at each <br />
other dejectedly, listening to the women talking. <br />
  <br />
&quot;Well, I, for one, think it's just deplorable to invade Iraq, and I am <br />
certainly sick of our tax dollars going to train professional <br />
baby-killers we call a military.&quot; <br />
  <br />
Professional baby-killers? I thought about what a wonderful father my <br />
husband is, and of how long it would be before he would see our children <br />
again. <br />
  <br />
That's it! Indignation rose up inside me. Normally reserved, pride in <br />
my husband gave me a brassy boldness I never realized I had. Tonight one <br />
voice will answer on behalf of our military, <br />
and let her pride in our troops be known. <br />
  <br />
Sliding out of my booth, I walked around to the adjoining booth and <br />
placed my hands flat on their table. Lowering myself to eye level with <br />
them, smilingly said, &quot;I couldn't help overhearing <br />
your conversation. You see, I'm sitting here trying to enjoy my dinner <br />
alone. And, do you know why? Because my husband, whom I love with all my <br />
heart, is halfway around the world defending your right to say rotten <br />
things about him.&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes, you have the right to your opinion, and what you think is none of <br />
my business. However, what you say in public is something else, and I <br />
will not sit by and listen to you ridicule MY country, MY president, MY <br />
husband, and all the other fine American men and women who put their <br />
lives on the line, just so you can have the &quot;freedom&quot; to complain.. <br />
Freedom is an <br />
expensive commodity, ladies. Don't let your actions cheapen it.&quot; <br />
  <br />
I must have been louder that I meant to be, because the manager came <br />
over to inquire if everything was all right. &quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; I <br />
replied. Then, turning back to the women, I said, &quot;Enjoy the rest of <br />
your meal&quot; <br />
  <br />
As I returned to my booth applause broke out. I was embarrassed for <br />
making a scene, and went back to my half eaten steak. The women picked <br />
up their check and scurried away. <br />
  <br />
After finishing my meal, and while waiting for my check, the manager <br />
returned with a huge apple cobbler ala mode. &quot;Compliments of those <br />
soldiers,&quot; he said. He also smiled and said the ladies tried to pay for <br />
my dinner, but that another couple had beaten them to it. When I asked <br />
who, the manager said they had already left, but that the gentleman was <br />
a veteran, and wanted to take care of the wife of &quot;one of our boys.&quot; <br />
  <br />
With a lump in my throat, I gratefully turned to the soldiers and <br />
thanked them for the cobbler. Grinning from ear to ear, they came over <br />
and surrounded the booth. &quot;We just wanted to thank you, ma'am. You know <br />
we can't get into confrontations with civilians, so we appreciate what <br />
you did.&quot; <br />
  <br />
As I drove home, for the first time since my husband's deployment, I <br />
didn't feel quite so alone. My heart was filled with the warmth of the <br />
other diners who stopped by my table, to relate how they, too, were <br />
proud of my husband, and would keep him in their prayers. I knew their <br />
flags would fly a little higher the next day. <br />
Perhaps they would look for more tangible ways to show their pride in <br />
our country, and the military who protect her. And maybe, just maybe, <br />
the two women who were railing against our country, would pause for a <br />
minute to appreciate all the freedom America offers, and the price it <br />
pays to maintain it's freedom. <br />
As for me, I have learned that one voice CAN make a difference. Maybe <br />
the next time protesters gather outside the gates of the base where I <br />
live, I will proudly stand on the opposite side with a sign of my own. <br />
It will simply say, &quot;Thank You!&quot; To those who fought for our Nation: <br />
Freedom has a flavor the protected will never know. GOD BLESS AMERICA!</div></div><hr />

It truely makes me sad that people feel differently about our freedoms. Freedoms that so many american military men and women have died for, in countless wars since the conseption of our great nation, for everyone to have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That is my point exactly Lady Tarnia thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I mouth off about the military, it's about questionable conduct, whether inside the military or in the people commanding it, not that we have one nor that it's worthless (because it isn't).<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hello, thinking that Bush has got it wrong and has abused his authority and misrepresented the facts to the American people does not mean that people are disparaging the commitment and sacrafices of members of our armed services.  In fact, just the opposite.  It distresses people to think that brave men and women are going off to a foreign land and dying in gross lots simply because of the pig headed determination of one man and his administration to invade.<br />
<br />
It is not a question of &quot;support Bush or you're disrespecting our troops.&quot;  And if that was the case, then you are making the basic arguement that whenever a war is declared, rightly or wrongly, that all disagreement must cease.  So those rights American troops are supposedly dying for, the rights that that really have nothing to do with Iraq, but that certainly previous generations have died for in any case, are to be immediately surrendered once the fighting starts?  I don't think so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Being willing to fight for your country doesn't give you the right to silence all those who might not see it your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well put.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh the truth/fictionalness of the story is up to conjecture.<br />
<br />
However, just because someone is opposed to pointlessly invading Iraq to detract attention from the fact that we couldn't catch Osama Bin Laden... doesn't mean they don't support our troops.<br />
<br />
One of my best friends is over there right now.  I wished him well, and I pray for him every day.  Just because I don't believe in what he's fighting for doesn't mean I don't believe in him.  If our roles were reversed, I would not go.  I do not believe in G.W. Bush, nor his phony wars.  And even though he would want me to go, just as I wish he hadn't, he would support my decision also.  That's called respect.<br />
<br />
You want to be a true patriot?  Respect the opinions of the others.  This is a country that (supposably) thrives on diversity, yet anyone who wants to think differently from the &quot;popular&quot; opinion is beaten down for it.  I respect your opinion, you need to respect mine.  Then we'll be living in America again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is best accomplished hunting down and killing every Al-Queda operative, planner and other SoB in the world and killing them (I have very strong thoughts on this subject post-9/11).  This is not accomplished with a poorly thought out Iraq occupation that serves as a maget for escalation and creates more danger for the US.<br />
<br />
If this story is true (seems to melodramatic for my RL sniff test) I can understand why I'd be unhappy as that lady.  I know a few 30 something Dad's who are over there serving...I am proud that most our troops are the best in the world and are solid people.  However, the american public MUST practice the restraint to UNDERSTAND that the troops are != policy.  Policy can and must be questioned when it is so badly implemented that it increases danger to this country.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree Glatius<br />
<br />
As a non-American, I am still trying to figure out what invading Iraq has to do with protecting the security and freedom of American citizens. My country (Canada) supported and continues to support the actions in Afghanistan. We supported and continue to believe in the United States' right to apprehend OBL and make him answer for his crimes. <br />
<br />
Iraq is something entirely different: your government trumped up charges, invented &quot;evidence&quot; and then invaded a sovereign nation, calling into question the judgement and decency of everyone who chose not to support this action (and please do not mistake me: Saddam Hussein is a vile disgusting cockroach who I hope burns in whatever hell he believes in for all eternity). Instead of fighting terrorism in Iraq, the US invasion has created a hotbed of resentment that is the environment terrorist groups spring from. Is that really preferable to the existence of a stable albeit antagonistic government?<br />
<br />
Grats Bush family: its 10+ years later but you got that bastard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I read that post, and essentially don't care either  way, as everyone is entitled to an opinion. However, one must ask what the united states are defending - when they actually invade a country which has shown no aggression towards it. <br />
<br />
If someone attacks your country, and you fight them off, that is defending. When you invade another country, it can only be seen as an offensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It is not a question of &quot;support Bush or you're disrespecting our troops.&quot;  <br />
<br />
That is a tactic, no more.  Certain people are trying to paint those opposed to the war as unpatriotic and against our troops.  Generally, the opposite is true.  I personally have my SASM(Southeast Asia Service Medal, awarded during the first gulf war) with 2 stars, and support out troops whole heartedly and without question.  Nothing pisses me off more than to be told that I am 'unpaitriotic' because I fail to support this misguided war that is throwing away the lives of the good people in our service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarhl_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">First, the original story sounds a bit to contrived to me.<br />
 <br />
Second....<br />
/agree Glatius<br />
 your government trumped up charges, invented &quot;evidence&quot; and then invaded a sovereign nation.<br />
<br />
The charges were not trumped up. Intelligence is never 100%, we deal in possibles and probables, not certainties - it's the nature of intelligence. One of the things most prominent in Powell's presentation was the &quot;mobile labs&quot;. We actually found two them while I was there. It took the experts a cpl months of actually working hands on with the labs to figure out what they did (so it's not surprising intelligence on them was misleading) - in the end it turned out they were not for making chemical weapons; however, alot of the equipment in the trailers could be used for various thing including weapons. <br />
<br />
Another contributing factor was that not only was there an elaborate &quot;denial and deception&quot; plan directed towards the U.N. inspectors and the international community, but there was also an unspoken internal &quot;denial and deception&quot; plan that overstated their own capabilities. The Scientists led Sadam to beleive they were farther along than they actually were and had capabilities the didn't quite have. The price for failure and showing no progress was severe and was frequently directed not at the scientists but at their families, many of which lived in walled compounds were the &quot;securtiy guards&quot; faced in.<br />
<br />
We also know that some stuff disappeared across the borders into Iran and Syria after the combat forces rolled thru but before the exploitation teams rolled in (I blame the &quot;gung ho&quot; ground commanders for loosing sight of the overall mission and leaving key sites ungaurded - but that is just my opinion) .  We found alot of indicators, not a real smoking gun, more like gun parts and bullet parts - litterally, and THAT is a scary thing if you know how the &quot;little boy&quot; was contructed. Unfortuantely, at this point I don't think the media would give an honest objective look at the evidence and indicators we did find. Sadam's regime did have weapons programs, they did train terrorist - they probably trained some al queda members. Thier intelligence service did participate in international terrorism. They did use chemical weapons on Iranians and on kurds killing 10's of thousands - all this is fairly well documented.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, during Sadam's rise to power he suspended the Iraqi consitution and established the revolutionary council that superceded their parliament. As &quot;chairman&quot; of the revolutionary council he held full executive power, essentially by his own decree. So that is the &quot;sovereign&quot; nation we invaded, it was not a &quot;popular&quot; government by any sense of the word. <br />
<br />
Should we invade sovereign nations like Iraq and Afghanistan? I'm not sure. I think it is an excellent question, one that needs to be asked; however, I would like to think that if our president as Commander-in-Chief used a pretense to daclare martial law, then suspended our consitution and superceded our congress, and then ruled as an iron-fisted despot, whose sons kidnapped our 13-year-old daughters for their harems, made people dissappear, and otherwise terrorised us for 30 years, that eventually some other country out there that supposedly stood for freedom would have the balls to come in and kill and/or otherwise remove the dictatorial bastard and his sons and give us another chance at self-determination - again just my opinion.<br />
<br />
I was there, went to weapons sites, I saw documents, I spoke to scientists, and I spoke to everyday people - I never met an Iraqi who wasn't glad we came and booted Sadam (I'm sure there are some, and I'm sure there are alot of &quot;foreign fighters' there as well who came in after the war just to cause trouble). Never-the-less were the situation reversed and they came to our rescue I'm sure we would want our &quot;liberators&quot; to leave as soon as possible and let us get back to running our own lives - I can sympathize.<br />
<br />
So, if you think this was all staged and contrived, I'm sorry, go back to watching reruns of X-files. I've been in the government/military for a long time and, believe me, it's not coordinated enough nor &quot;leak-proof&quot; enough (note prison scandal) to conspire to do anything.<br />
<br />
that's my 2cp... thanks to all of you for expressing yours - after all that is why I serve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
though the reason given (weapons of mass destruction) may have been largely erroneous in the end we did not start this war.<br />
<br />
iraq has never renounced its state of perpetual war with either us or israel our ally. therefore a state of war has existed with iraq for several decades. invading them was our priveledge to be done at our discretion.<br />
<br />
do i agree with the decision to invade? ive always been undecided on the issue of whether we should have but suppor the decision once it was made because it was a reasonable decision that reasonable men might make.<br />
<br />
as for the story that lead this off. this talk about bush going in there to steal all the oil etc. such accusations are so wildly off base and beyond defense that such people could only have made the charges because of a personal vendetta against the administration and were willing to discredit our military (who are under his command) to accomplish this agenda.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps trumped up and contrived are slightly inaccurate.  I'd say more like the charges were overblown.   George Bush, to me, gave every indication of having his own agenda.  And while much of what you say is probably true about Saddam, I believe that dictators such as Adee Amean (spelling I'm sure) in africa were just as evil, vile, and worthy of contempt, but no one, not America, nor any other nation did anything about it.<br />
<br />
It seems that when the US has goals to achieve that we &quot;drap ourselves in the flag&quot;.  It's for freedom, liberty, democracy, and so forth.  But when looked at closely, sometimes, even many times, there seems to be other motivations involved.  How many countries in the world could use a little freedom from their own leadership?  Shall we invade them all?  If not, how do we justify singling out Iraq?  Violation of UN resolutions?  We haven't invaded the countries that violate UN resolutions.  Human rights violations?  Lots of countries get passed over on that count.  WMDs?  How about Korea, no one is suggesting we invade there and they claim to have nuke capability.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of our leadership bullshtting us about their motives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My goodness. From the phony evidence of the Maine blowing up in Havana harbor to the faked events leading to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution administrations have relied on &quot;intellegence&quot; failures, trumped up evidence and outright lies to start a war when that's what they wanted.<br />
<br />
On the other hand with satillite and U2 photos of missile sites in Cuba in hand, administrations have avoided war with irrutable evidence in hand if that was what they wanted.<br />

We may never get a goverment that levels with us - but we can make the cost sooo high when there's an &quot;intellegence&quot; failure that administrations will generally be unwilling to pay it.<br />

Your argument would have more creedance IF the economic beneficiaries of the war were not ALL american firms with previous ties to the current administration.  Please correct me if there are major US firms w/o past conections to Cheney/Bush/Rice  who have large contracts running in Iraq.<br />
<br />
I have voted Republican in the past (and independant in the case of Perot).  I have developed a disgust with this adminstration only because it has taken an event (9/11) and used it as a distoration/excuse/mandate to curtail american civil rights and invade another sovereign country w/o a damn good reason.<br />
<br />
Not sure at what point you will understand that condemnation/disgust at this corrupt administration is NOT equal to critism of our troops.  I'm proud of the job they do and sacrifices they make.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Cliff notes:<br />
<br />
In 1898 (me thinks that was the year)...the american batteleship Maine was blown up in Havana harbor.  It was attributed to the Spainish as an act of sabotage or aggresion and the US declared war on Spain (the Spainish-American war). As the result of a fairly on-sided war the US aquired both Cuba and the Philipines as &quot;colonies&quot; (this was during the pre-WW1 colony scramble by European powers in Africa and China/asia).  To-be president Teddy Roosevelt also distinguished himself as a cavalry commnader at the battle of San Juan hill.<br />
<br />
It turns out that the Maine was destroyed by a faulty boiler (there was a cool forensic thing on the History channel outlining this).  But politicians of the time justified war based on the very popular slogan of the day: REMEMBER THE MAINE!  Then as now the US primary motives were; regional power (in this case Cuba being of paramount importance to enforce the Monroe doctrine) and $$$ (colonies being an advantage as certain raw materials were at a premium).</div></div><hr />

As oneperson said troops = policy. I still can disagree with the policy, without disrespecting men who follow orders with no say and may be doing it with risk on their life. That is why I personally cant join the military.

Bzzzzt. Wrong answer sunshine. You went on a nice little tangent about the mobile labs but you never said anything noteworthy to prove your assertion.<br />
<br />
FACT - G.W. Bush justified the forming of this &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; and subsequent invasion of Iraq by claiming that Iraq had WMD and they presented a danger to the United States and other nations. <br />
<br />
FACT - No WMD have been discovered. Some materials that can be used in the manufacturing of nerve agents were discovered, but these same chemicals are also used as fertilizers, etc.<br />
<br />
FACT - The Iraqi nuclear program and the assertion that they were obtaining nuclear material from African sources WAS disproven.<br />
<br />
The US intelligence community, at the very least,  gave Bush the answer he wanted to hear, with regards to the &quot;threat&quot; status of Iraq. And thousands are dead because of it, but i guess collateral damage is acceptable if they're not Americans...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wulfran and Glautius, Iraq was in violation of UN resolutions and decrees that ended the first Gulf war.  The UN should have enforced these violations but did not.  This fact leads to some other issues such as the power/will of the UN.  The Bush Admin chose to act on these and other reasons as their justification.<br />
<br />
Something else to think about, GW is only the latest president to send the troops in.  During Clinton's era in office we saw deployments rise approx tenfold and his reasons were just as suspect.  The main difference between the two is that Clinton had us spread all over the place and Bush has us relatively consolidated.</div></div><hr />

As for the woman standing up and reminding those idiot ladies about a few things, you will notice she held her tounge until they started bringing up the vietnam-esque baby killer army comments. Yes Georgia, thats right, our military is comprised entirely of people trained to murder helpless babies. We take great pleasure in killing babies, in fact, we get a pay bonus when we bring in some tiny human skulls. What a group of retards, the army fought an enemy army, not many babies are tossed onto the front lines with an m16 last I checked, (not that id put it past Sadaam to try hiding behind an orphanage or something else like that. In fact I think he tried that with a hospital a couple times.)<br />

If violation of U.N. resolutions are sufficient to justify an invasion, perhaps the U.S. should be invading Israel?  Below is a link listing their numerous violations of U.N. resolutions.  If we're going to play world cop, shouldn't we be enforcing the &quot;law&quot; equally?  If we're not going to be playing world cop, then what business do we have in Iraq?<br />

I'm trying to recall when during the Clinton era we launched an independent invasion of a foreign power, could you refresh my memory for me, I don't seem to be able to remember that.  Yes, we deployed troops for some peace keeping efforts, Serbia in particular comes to mind, but as I recall that was with the blessings and support of the U.N.  Are we on an independent path now to react to anything we consider provactive?<br />
<br />
The main difference between the two is that Clinton had us spread all over the place and Bush has us relatively consolidated.<br />
<br />
So the fact that we've invaded two countries, Afghanstan and Iraq, rather than having a hand full of troops here and there makes it all better?</div></div><hr />

Dobbanz, no one doubts that Iraq had some limited quantities of WMDs they weren't supposed to have.  In fact, the US sold some of them to Iraq before they became a regional threat with the invasion of Kuwait.  Two shells with chemical agents in them do not a world threat make.<br />
<br />
The justification for the invasion of Iraq was, at the time, Iraq is a potential threat to the world because it has huge stockpiles of WMDs and the potential to make an almost limitless supply of more WMDs on demand.  What was found to be the case was that Iraq had no real capability to make large quantities of WMDs, no significant stockpiles, and even the raw materials that could have been used to make WMDs could also have just as easily been used for other purposes.<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;smoking gun&quot;.  There are some parts to a gun lying around that could, possibly, have been a gun at some point, or could, possibly, be turned into a gun with enough time and determination.  But that's not what we were told.  We were told there is a &quot;smoking gun&quot;.  Which has turned out to be either a gross exaggeration, a huge embellishment, or an out right fabrication.  Which it is depends on your personal point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This is a point of view from a South American person.<br />
<br />
I agree totally with Glatius.<br />
<br />
Im telling you how me and many from down here see it... Saddam was a &quot;bad&quot; guy, we agree there... but I dont know how this makes Bush be the... &quot;good&quot; guy??... I really dont know who is worse to the world! Im terrified that the next thing I know is that, for economical reasons, somehow, the place I live in has Massive Destruction Weapons! Bush political view of the world frightens me... <br />
<br />
I get so sad... so sad, to see all those men and women dying everyday, both North American and Iraqee (sp?)... I know some people that went to Iraq or will be going soon... I respect em and their ideals... but I cant agree with something that is killing them, for no logical reason... I cant agree with this invasion... <br />
<br />
therefore a state of war has existed with iraq for several decades. invading them was our priveledge to be done at our discretion.<br />
<br />
Priviledge?? Your discretion?? I... cant really see how you can think that... if the death of so many people, for an unexisting reason, is your Priviledge... wow.... if you think you can just go around the world invading nations you think are &quot;dangerous&quot; to your economical goals err... world safety..., taking unilateral actions, and ignoring the UN (and you are one of the most important members of it)... Im sorry, but its so full of BS.</div></div><hr />

Actually both shell heads were handled by American military personnel who had no idea what they were handling until they started showing &quot;flu like symptoms&quot;.  Only post-incident forensics showed they HAD contained chemical agents (only residue remained in them).  It was also stated that these shells looked exactly like normal artillary shells.  <br />
<br />
Personally I think these were left over from the Iraq/Iran war and thrown in an old stockpile somewhere empty but with some residue left in them where some local guys looking for scrap metal stumbled on them.  This isnt WMB evidence...this is old WMD trash.</div></div><hr />

Ealsur,  if war has been declared and the conflict has never been resolved, even if the declaration of war was made a decade ago and there has been no aggression from either side for most of that length of time, no further justification or formal declaration is needed to continue hostility.  At least that is my understanding of how that works.  So, the statement you quoted has nothing to do with it being the privilege of the U.S. to go around invading any country we think is &quot;dangerous&quot;, it is just a statement that the previous gulf war was never formally ended.  I can't recal whether it is a true statement or not, but that is the reasoning behind the statement as best I can tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I dunno, I guess that if you didnt take on any military actions for more than 10 years, my logic tells me you have no reason for it anymore, and the war is over. If you suddenly, after 10 years, decide that Saddam is a bad person and not a good ruler, and you strangely didnt realize during those 10 years, or maybe, it was economically more beneficial not to realize, then on my eyes, its hipocrital (sp?).<br />
Bush raised the &quot;They are a World Threat&quot; flag when he charged forward, I didnt see any &quot;We are continuing our gulf war now, we were taking a break&quot; anywhere, so as far as I know, this is something different, again, on my eyes. So I back up my statement, I dont think it was the continuing of the gulf war, it was an invasion with a nonexistant cause, with a President playing Crusader Against Evil, and the sad loss of so many lives because of it. And like I said, I would not be able to tell which is more evil, if you stand him by Hussein.</div></div><hr />
