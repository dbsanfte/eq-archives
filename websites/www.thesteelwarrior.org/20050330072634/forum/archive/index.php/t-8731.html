<br />
I've never seen this guy up, and don't even know where to find him, etc.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any info on this guy/ event?<br />
<br />
I'd really like to give him a run if he's one/2 group able.  In particular, I'd who/what/where/ how hard?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's like free loot every 12 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korgo</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it trackable or what?  Not asking for leet strats on taking him down.  No matter what I'm gonna be tryin him with the same group of 6-8 people who are online at 8am that  I always work with. If we can't do him we're done for any how.  What i AM looking for help on is  just trying to figure out how to start the event and do the event.<br />
<br />
Would be something fun to do rather than the usual check ikk's and then on to north animals in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta clear to the back spot of the first temple. THere is a pile of bones to the left of the horse back there. Open them up and he will spawn with his guards. If the respawn is not up he will spawn as Pixtt Dire Summoner instead and won't drop loot. I have no clue if you can figure out whether he is up or not without going through the process of clearing to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can send a rogue back to search for the pile of bones.  Or, you can use any of the various tracking methods~<br />
<br />
There is no way to tell if you'll be able to spawn the loot dropping version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yah my usual group is bard, cleric, me, shm, druid *plus X* classes.  Usually whoever is online at 8am est hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I'm intrigued how this is done with 1 group. The attempt I did we had 2 groups but ran out of time on the guards, although we had no specialist pullers so used rangers who died a lot :P Any hints? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Revise your strategy, as clearly, it isn't working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt you'll find much in the way of tactic hints, as those who do know how farm this relentlessly for themselves and won't be privy to give up much more then 'try harder' responces. Just they way things go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gave him a pretty good hint as to do it.  If I said anymore, I'd give it away, and where is the fun in reading strats from a board to kill a mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LUMMP</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree. Hell half the fun is pushing your limits, figuring out strats to kill tougher and tougher mobs with one group. We have killed this 3 of us 2boxing its a good challenge but quite doable with a talented grp.<br />

<br />
Clear the temple of all mobs along the first room and last room where pile of bones is found.<br />
<br />
Walk up to the pile of bones, type Open.  If the loot dropping version is up, a Pixxt Priest Summoner will spawn + 4 Pixxt Temple Guardians, otherwise, a Pixxt DIRE Summoner + 4 Pixxt Temple Guardians will spawn.  The Priest/Dire summoner is inactive while the 4 Temple Guardians are alive, split them and pull them to camp, they are all mezzable and fully slowable.<br />
<br />
After all 4 are dead, pull the Priest to camp - he is unslowable, and puts out rather high DPS but has almost no HP, stonewall, then defensive, and enjoy the loot.<br />
<br />
For us, the shoulders have been by far and away the most common loot.</div></div><hr />
