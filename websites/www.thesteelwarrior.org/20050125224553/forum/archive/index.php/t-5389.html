<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
LEVEL     HP     AC<br />
  20      1200   600<br />
  40      2500   900<br />
  50      4000   1100<br />
  60      6000   1400<br />
<br />
I am currently 42 with 3990 with cleric buffs and shm sta buff (pretty much fully buffed as it gets at 42.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

You need less hp and ac in a luclin zone because not much hits for more than 300.  If you have the gear to deal with a kriger smacking you for 700 a pop, go for it.  If you don't, don't.<br />
<br />
I got to 65 with a load of crap that makes me shudder to think about it, but I got by because I knew what I could do and I was smart.  Playing smart and knowing your limits is usually better than some formula of what you have at some arbitrary point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lauthar</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All im asking for is a rough guide to what you should be aiming for at which levels, I am pretty sure that my gear is way above my level and will probably do me until I hit the mid 50's to 60s when I may upgrade some peices to ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">about 8k seems right for 65. 1400 ac is what i have at the moment buffed at 65.<br />
<br />
i got 7500hp without ND3 yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 65 with 5k unbuffed and 1250 ac...that's fine for most tanking I do (including mini-named in bot.)  <br />
<br />
As Hyardgune said, remember there is a lot more to tanking then stats.  Mob positioning, group/raid communication, knowing when to use discs, how to hold agro (GSoT), etc. are just, if not more, important then base stats.  (at least for tier 3 - non-flag named - and below)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">something I've heard before which is roughly right is you should aim for 20ac per level.<br />
<br />
This will put you at 1000AC at level 50, 1200AC at level 60 (which was about right during luclin) and 1300AC at level 65 which would be fine for tanking BoT type mobs.<br />
<br />
More is always better, especially once you start raiding in PoP zones, but for XP groups 20ac/level should see you right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamce</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where you should be at for HP/AC depends alot on: What type of guild you are in - raiding vs. casual?  How often you play?  Those above have provided some good insight to these types of play and what HP/AC is suggested.<br />
<br />
Whenever you read the advice in these forumes, keep the following in mind:<br />
<br />
Many of us suffer from the RL syndrome and will never be able to achieve fantasy uberness. However, we still enjoy playing the game and our answers will reflect this style of play.<br />
<br />
Others have an uncanny knack of avoiding the RL syndrome or have immunity to it, so they are able to put the play time in that is necessary to acquire the items that put them in the uber or near uber category.  These player responses will reflect their style of play.<br />
<br />
Because in the end the more time you are able to play, the more chances you will have at getting the upgrades you need to reach the goals you set.<br />
<br />
That is enough babbling from me for one day.  So off I go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if your not in a raiding guild of any kind, then just normal exp and bazaar farming, you should be able to hit and aim for  5-5.5 k reasonably easily at 65 with ND3. that would be about 1200-1300 ac. if you put a bit more effort and LDON, theres no reason you cant push past that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vick</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been a while but when i got my warrior to 65 wearing like cultural (Fulvous Darkscale l33t yellow look before dyes came out) i had like 5500 ish with ND 3. Good Gear helps but in most situations a 5500 ish hp unbuffed tank with 200 aa will tank better than a 7k unbuffed tank with 0 aa. so you should really set your goals to aa's instead of gear. while exping you will hopefully get a few sellable loots or even upgrades that will help u along the way. But most importantly have fun its a game dont put urself down if you feel that your not &quot;uber.&quot; if you cant play alot then what u have is more than enough if you play smart. if you play alot you might can set your goals higher. Having fun and meeting friends ect is far greater than having good gear so above all dont trash someone down to advance yourself (I.E. leaving a guild because they arent good enough.)</div></div><hr />
