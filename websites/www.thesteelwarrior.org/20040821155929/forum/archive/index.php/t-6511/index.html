<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TheHuzMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that we have our own mana bar (&quot;endurance&quot;) do we really need timers anymore? While I was grouping in BoT this weekend we were getting a lot of adds. When we got an add two pulls in a row, I couldn't kick in stonewall on the second pull because of the timer. This is despite the fact that I'd have 50% of my endurance left.<br />
<br />
I don't think being able to use stonewall 2 pulls in a row would be &quot;unbalancing&quot;. After all, I'd be close to &quot;Out OF Endurance (OOE)&quot; at the end of the second pull. So I'd have to rest before trying that trick again on the third pull. The bottom line? You'd still only use discs when really necessary because you wouldn't want to cause extra &quot;med time&quot; for the group.<br />
<br />
SOE is also missing a good chance at giving Shammy's a treat by giving them an &quot;endurance regen&quot; spell similar to KEI. <br />
<br />
These are the things we really should be asking out of the Devs. We should also not be rolling over and letting them ignore their promise to us. Anybody who wants a &quot;melee part 2&quot; respond to this post with a &quot;Hell ya!&quot;</div></div><hr />

1) It takes up another buff slot.<br />
2) Discs arn't that expensive endurance wise.<br />
3) Endurance already regens pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
As for chaining discs, you need to think of a raid like situation too. 2 or 3 Rangers chain trueshotting will be a hell of a lot more dps then before. Warriors would be able to chain furious/fortitude. Same with rangers and weaponshield<br />
<br />
And not to mention, the re-use times really arn't that bad.  It's a hell of a lot better then it was before Melee part 1.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I'm all for part 2.. but I don't care if its a little ways away, just as long as they work the bugs out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why yes, we might be able to chain Furious/Fortitude 2 or maybe 3 times before we run out of &quot;mana&quot;. You have to remember though, the reason we mass petitioned for these changes is because we've fallen so unbelievably behind in the DPS department. Not only have we fallen behind the casters, but classes like the beastlord also contribute twice as much DPS as well.<br />
<br />
This would give us the opportunity to bridge the DPS gap at &quot;crunch time&quot; without being at that level &quot;all the time&quot;. Would it make some &quot;old school&quot; raids easier? Sure, but I don't think SOE should be tuning me around &quot;just what it takes to do Naggy&quot; anymore! <br />
<br />
Bottom line: in Time raids and GoD, chaining furious wouldn't make that much of a difference. It will make even less difference in future expansions.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to assume you think this is bad. What your telling me is that you'd rather screw yourself out of an upgrade to keep a temporary advantage over knights. What I'm telling you is, switching to a &quot;mana&quot; based model for our discs will be better for us in the long haul. <br />
<br />
Casters get new spells every expansion. If Sony wants to sell me an expansion, a sure fire way is to say &quot;we've got new toys for Huzy!&quot; Hell, I'd buy an expansion with no zones, no new content and no new AA's or levels if I could just get some class balance. I have not yet purchased GoD.<br />
<br />
Honestly, looking at the classes right now, it just seems like Sony understands how to balance a caster better than a melee type. I have a 59 druid I'd say was just about perfectly balanced. All of the &quot;pure&quot; melee classes are way underpowered. I wouldn't even think about making a rogue or a monk. So maybe keep the disc timers on a ranger, but we &quot;pure&quot; melee need some help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh? since when is a ranger a knight?<br />
<br />
Your forgetting 1 thing, when you run out of endurance your still gunna have to wait to use a disc and then you might have no endurance when a disc would save the day.<br />
<br />
At this point in time warriors are fine. Im happy with what we got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rogues and warriors are in a very good spot atm.  Monks do need some help.  Discs are very powerful in nature, too powerful to be able to use repeatedly.  Can you use life burn / SotW / Arbi / etc repeatedly?  Nope, because they are very powerful, and need a reuse time.<br />
<br />
What your telling me is that you'd rather screw yourself out of an upgrade to keep a temporary advantage over knights <br />
<br />
I'd rather have balance instead of demigod mode.  What you are suggesting would give us a much larger advantage over knights.  Multiple furious discs would be very powerful.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: in Time raids and GoD, chaining furious wouldn't make that much of a difference <br />
<br />
Probably not in Time raids, but it'd make a huge difference in GoD trials.  Especially if you have multiple people who can use dodge / riposte discs.  Have a rogue, ranger, and warrior, and you will take zero damage from some of the bosses.  If only pure melee got the ability to chain, you would still take almost no damage from those same fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sylas was talking about using Ranger/Knight combo to get around the &quot;necessary&quot; warrior in GoD trials. That's how rangers got into the discussion. The only other thing I can say about your post is that your standards are low. Apparently being a second class citizen is just fine for you and that's &quot;OK&quot;. <br />
<br />
Being a second class citizen is not OK with me. I'm pretty surprised at how many of you are just going to lay down and do nothing about this unacceptable situation. I really would have expected more of a fight from people who call themselves &quot;warriors&quot;!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lol you cant be serious, warriors are in great shape these days and you want to be even more powerful?<br />

Your post in rediculous. Your a 2nd class citizen because your a moron.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Personally, I never run ooe. That means that getting additional endurance items is basically useless to me, as would endurance regen. For them to be useful, and especially anywhere comparable to mana regen, would require disc's to no longer have timers. If they removed all timers/refresh on disciplines, I could (and would) burn through my endurance constantly. If they just had all disciplines with an initial startup cost, and then a cost per second with the freedom to change disciplines at any time, I think we could be more strategic. The original discipline timers were designed with no cost other than the timers themselves and I feel like they're outdated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What unacceptable situation?  WE ARE BALANCED.  We have innate mitigation over knights.  Just because we don't want god mode doesn't mean we are second class citizens.  You're sounding like a knight thats asking for defensive.  I fought for melee rebalancing, like most others on this board, to insult me by saying I'm laying down to a made up situation you have is sad.  Even if this isn't the outhouse, I have to agree with Korinn here.  Did you miss the part of my post where I said that if this went through, you could do a trial boss with ZERO heals?  That is OVERPOWERED.  Don't make us sound like whiners by asking for a diablo game with godmode.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>TheHuzMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok I realize that it was my challenging tone that brought on some of the flames against me. Some of the name calling was just downright uncalled for. If you want to disagree with me thats fine, but please don't mistake &quot;We're fine and you suck&quot; as some kind of valid argument that proves that everything I say is total BS.<br />
<br />
I agree that melee part 1 is the best thing to happen to warriors since I started playing this game (February 2002). Why yes it is much easier to get a group now that we have an aggro bomb, thank you SOE. Like a lot of you, I also enjoy being the MA at a raid. You have to remember though that the majority of our &quot;online life&quot;, we're in a group, not a raid. I suggested this change because things could still be better for us in that department. I flew off the handle and &quot;challenged&quot; you guys because I know without serious urging, SOE will ignore us. A lot of you have stated that warriors are &quot;Ok&quot;, however, there are classes that have it better. True, there are classes out there that have it worse, but I'm just here to be an advocate for the warrior. Since there are classes that have it better than us, why should we be content with just Ok?<br />
<br />
Since there are so many classes that have double our DPS now, I'd have to disagree with those that say we'd be &quot;demigods&quot; and the game would be &quot;unbalanced&quot; if we chain our offensive discs. If you don't want to lose the timers, how about we ask SOE to shorten them? Ten minutes instead of 30 for some of the more powerful offensive discs. Or how about leaving timers for offensive discs and lose the ones for defensive discs. Then we're just harder to kill on a more consistent basis, which is our job.<br />
<br />
All I ask is that before you punch the flame button, read this post carefully and actually consider some of these ideas. Then if you still disagree, state your reasons where &quot;your an inbred moron&quot; would normally go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if we chain our offensive discs <br />
<br />
You are missing the point.  Chaining riposte is the issue.  Riposte is used at the begining of bosses for Trials (not raiding, a one group thing).  The mobs only last 50 seconds to a little over a minute in my groups.  With the way things are now, 12 seconds of that goes without getting hit.  If it could be used just twice in a row, that would be 24 seconds out of 60 with no damage taken.  Say you have a ranger in your group.  Weapon shield lasts 24 seconds.  If you aetaunt off a ranger when WS is low.  Then throw in just 2 furious.  Thats 48 seconds out of about 60 seconds of a fight.  Dodge disc's are very powerful atm.  The good thing is most classes that can use dodge disc's don't hold aggro well, and it's difficult to switch to most classes.<br />
<br />
As for shortening them.  Furious should stay decently long.  While it'd be nice to not have to wait for it as often, it is a very powerful disc.  Most of the others I don't really care about.  Def / Evasive / Stonewall are all fairly short reuse.  Our damage discs aren't that long either.  Only 25 mins for Fellstrike.  Personally, I find the endurance cost to be the issue for me with this disc, and would prefer it's cost go down instead of timer, but that is just me.  Overall I think they did pretty good with them.  My main issue with this though is the riposte disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Since there are so many classes that have double our DPS now  <br />
<br />
Care to name these so many classes that do double our dps? Btw we're not a dps class...<br />
<br />
<br />
 A lot of you have stated that warriors are &quot;Ok&quot;, however, there are classes that have it better.  <br />
<br />
 why should we be content with just Ok? <br />
<br />
<br />
We havent been saying that we are ok, we are saying warriors are in great shape. At this particular point in time we do our job as good as if not better than any other class does theirs. We aren't conent we are ok, we are happy we are balanced.<br />
<br />
We are excellent tanks. <br />
<br />
Read that again...<br />
<br />
WE ARE EXCELLENT TANKS<br />
<br />
Thats our job, our only job and we do it damn well.<br />
<br />
Another reason other than us piggybacking off of rangers WS is this, by changing the disc timers you devalue the decision making process when it comes to whether or not to use a disc. Atm you must weigh up if using a disc is worth it or not or if it must be saved for that one moment when experience and competency says to use it. By changing timers you make things too easy when things would normally be challenging. OOPS i made a mistake, ill just /disc furious again to get myself out of it... and again you learn nothing ... we learn by by our mistakes, i dont want a get a of jail free card either. If i screw up i wanna be stung enough to know not to do it again.<br />
<br />
The games been dumbed down enough already, doesnt need to be made easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I suck then.  I am elemental with 9k hp buffed with max stats on str/sta/agi/dex and 115 AA or so.<br />
<br />
I have plus 1200 in endurance items, but I can't do a ldon or PoF/PoE exp group without running OOE from incite.<br />
<br />
I have WA1, and BoC/Xana hammer and can't keep agro from 90 percent of the slowers that I have every had in group.<br />
<br />
I just totally suck then, because I have to constantly apologize for not being able to get or hold agro so often in the first 20 seconds of combat.  I have basically resigned myself to allowing the chanter to tank the first 20 seconds, since there isnt anything I can do about it short of killing the king in warrens a few hundred times for his insta click 10 charge snare to get initial agro on exp mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am not elemental equiped, but use Bellow of the Mastruq on practically all mobs without running out of endurance in places like Kod'Taz / Ikkinz / Yxtta. Really, I think rationing your end would be more effective, once per mob max / skipping in LDoN easy occasionally. Also, aggro isn't all on the warrior. There are occasional mishaps, but if they are constantly stealing aggro, then that is an issue they need to work on.  As warriors we take the blame for that often, but it is something other people need to learn.  Which is why I think the End cost of incite and reuse are how they should be; EQ shouldn't be balanced on groups that don't know how to control their aggro.  Incite + 1 round of melee should hold if done before first tash, if the chanter can hold back slowing for a few, I would bet that he would get hit less.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Rewording some as I realized some came out rude towards someone who I didn't mean to be.  Sorry if it seemed that way =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can understand you going ooe in an ldon group if you incite on inc for every mob, ( I do this also) mobs in ldon have low hp meaning there is a high turnover of fresh mobs but mobs in PoF/PoE have alot more hp and the amount you need to incite slows down. How often you do you incite mobs?<br />
<br />
Not every warrior has a great taunt weapon, in that case its not just up to you to control agro, its up to the group. <br />
<br />
When i first entered the elementals i used a Basalt Greatsword of the Protector 45/35 procs boiling blood, and never had too much trouble with taunt and your setup is better than mine at the time. That was also pre incite.<br />
<br />
You running ooe from just incite another reason why the original posters suggestion is poor, if you, an elementally flagged warrior runs ooe from just incite, how much faster will you run ooe if you do back to back furious?<br />
<br />
Lokkok altho my gear is considerably better it is nowhere near the best around, and i go ooe sometimes. A finite endurance bar means we cant just hit incite whenever it pops, learning to use and control that part of the game makes us better and more experienced tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As to the original post…<br />
<br />
1.  We are not a dps class.  Our job is to take a beating so the rest of the group can take out the mob.<br />
<br />
2.  We are very good at tanking already.  The ability to chain discs (especially if they added an end regen type spell) would trivialize much of the harder content.<br />
<br />
3.  The game is already trivialized enough…I don’t want it any easier tactically.  (I could do away with some of the grinding aspects, but that’s a completely different topic ;) )<br />
<br />
4.  I agree other classes are overpowered in specific instances (chanter charming, cleric CH, etc.), but I don’t want the fix to be to make every class overpowered – this would trivialize the tactical aspect of the game even more.<br />
<br />
5.  I do not think asking SoE to make warriors (or any other class) extremely powerful helps.  In fact, I think it hurts because the next time someone comes up with a reasonable solution it will be ignored because “it’s just &lt;insert class here&gt; whining again.&quot;<br />

If I were you, I'd talk to your group mates about agro control.  I'm not elemental geared, I don’t have WA AA’s, I use either GSoT or the Droga wpns (no augments on any of my wpns either), and I rarely have agro issues in LdoN (or anywhere else for that matter.)  My regular group had problems initially with the chanter sitting immediately after slowing so he stopped sitting so quickly and it's been fine since then (and a fast slow by itself does not normally take agro from me.)  Also, we normally have a mage so he debuffs the mobs, which splits the agro between the mage and chanter.  (tash + slow is a lot of agro)<br />
<br />
If you're not pulling, that's one thing you might try.  I normally pull (I'll call for paci if it's more than 2 or 3), and I think this helps alot with agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I almost always pull.  I have (and often do) caution people in group that my agro sucks, and this very often fixes the problem.<br />
<br />
The problem is almost everyone has played with paladins.  This makes them very used to never needing to even think about agro.<br />
<br />
The other problem is I almost never group outside the guild.  I have some of the lowest AA counts in the guild.  With my two 1h weapons, I have several monks I can't hold agro from them without constantly inciting.  I guess I need to go WA5 before Sturdiness 1-5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Does anyone really see a huge problem with being able to keep defensive/stonewall/evasive up longer? How about offensive discs? I think having the extra endurance that EP+ melee have should do us some good, instead of pretty much just going to waste. If nothing more is coming that uses endurance, then virtually no one will get endurance regen AAs or really care about endurance augs. Removing the timers and changing the way disciplines last would be a good way of dealing with it, imo. With high initial costs, you would still have to be tactical in the way you choose your disciplines.</div></div><hr />

I'm not EP yet, but I am 65 with about 100 AA's and if I don't have any problem blowing through my End pool in a fast paced xp group.  So, I'm already interested in endurance regen aa's and spells  ;) .<br />
<br />
Yes, I see a problem with keeping defensive up longer - the current encounters are built around the existing timers and it will make things that much easier if we can effectively be defensive constantly.  I like the challenge of long raid fights that require tank switches and having to decide in xp groups if I should burn defensive on this pull or risk it in case the next pull is worse.  :p</div></div><hr />

No, this concept is 100% WRONG, and I hear it all the time. The players, WILL and HAVE just gotten Paladins, who easily have near aggro lock, and just won't group with a Warrior at all! They will NOT modify the way they play but modify the tank they use instead!</div></div><hr />

 Killa1, do relaize that you said &quot;no&quot; then basicly said the same thing that you said no to?<br />

Less time trying to talk big and more time removeing the 10+ lore items in you bogus magelo please.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to PoP!  The rest of us have moved past then, and to current times.  I suggest you do the same, thanks.<br />

Lets try not balancing EQ around dumbfucks, ok?  With incite, 5% mitigation, availability of anger3 augs, availability of droga weapons / GSoT, and our ability to use discs more often, I think that warrior / knight balance is quite fine (except in certain GoD places).  The only time aggro becomes a huge enough issue that they replace you with a knight, is when they are idiots.  Warriors do bring a decent amount to the table, and can hold aggro pretty decently.</div></div><hr />

I can't remove them, it is someone else's magelo, LOL. They sure the hell fux0red it up and you are the only one who noticed!<br />

Also &quot;move past PoP&quot; umm don't we all exp there? While the Knights cry about KUNARK, when was the last time you exp in Kunark compared to last exp in PoP?</div></div><hr />

When someone refers to what things were like in an expansion, they are talking about what things were like when that was the newest expansion.  Unless you can't use incite, have unlinked discs, or all the other stuff available whenever you zone into PoP.  There is a huge difference between exping there and what the game was like back then.   The point is, when PoP was big, I would have fully agreed with you.  However, the times have changed.  What the game was like in PoP is not what the game is like now with all the changes that have happened.<br />
<br />
When knights cry kunark, they aren't talking about exping in kunark.  They are talking about what the game was like when kunark was first out.  Back then they were underpowered.  If they go back to kunark now, it's not the issue it was when kunark first came out.  They don't suddenly transform into an under powered class upon zoning to kunark.<br />
<br />
Oh, and no we don't all exp there.  Personally I dislike exping anywhere other than GoD.  Though LDoN isn't that bad.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Well, I suck then. I am elemental with 9k hp buffed with max stats on str/sta/agi/dex and 115 AA or so.<br />

I have plus 1200 in endurance items, but I can't do a ldon or PoF/PoE exp group without running OOE from incite.<br />
<br />
I have WA1, and BoC/Xana hammer and can't keep agro from 90 percent of the slowers that I have every had in group.<br />
<br />
<br />
In a fast paced group it's not at all uncommon to run out of endurance through only the use of Incite.  I don't remember who did the calculation but there was a past thread awhile ago where someone calculated that the standard endurance regen without Heightened Endurance works out to be equivalent to using Incite every 42 seconds or something.  So if you're Inciting every mob on incoming and are killing a mob every 41 seconds or faster then you will eventually run out of endurance.<br />
<br />
I used to run out of endurance for that reason myself on many occasions.  The only real remedy is to either get the Heightened Endurance AAs, or wait til the mob is in camp and taunt it before you decide to Incite it.  If your taunt is successful then don't Incite.<br />
<br />
As for your aggro problems, I don't know what to tell you.  If you haven't augmented your weapons with Anger 3 then you should either aug them with Anger 3 or get a BOW or SEWS ASAP and aug that with Anger 3.  Despite the crappy RNG Anger augs will make a huge difference to your aggro control.  If you don't have WA 5 yet, get it.  That also makes a big difference.  About the only other thing you could do to improve aggro would be to get Gloves of the Crimson Sigil if you ever hit VT or look into getting that Symbol of the Planesmaster or whatever it's called from Time once you get to time.  Call of Fire seemed to provide more of an aggro boost than the EB proc on BOC to me because it proc'd more often.<br />
<br />
Before I upgraded to SEWS, I used BoC/Blackout as my aggro combo which is pretty comparable to what you're using and I was not satisfied with the aggro from that either.  I don't know if putting Anger 3 on both of those would have made enough of a difference for me, I decided to wait until I got BOW or SEWS.  Even with SEWS + Anger 3 + Call of Fire I wasn't satisfied with my aggro until they added Incite.  I have WA 5 now as well and I consider aggro to be a non issue now unless I'm fighting a mob that slows me or memblurs.  I imagine with Raex BP and time weapons the aggro control must be nearly unshakeable.</div></div><hr />
