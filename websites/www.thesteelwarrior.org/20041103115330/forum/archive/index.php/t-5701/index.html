<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kruscher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well to start out with, here is my magelo:<br />
<br />

<br />
The primary goal i was working towards was to break 5k hp.  Last week, however, I finally acquired enough LDON points to upgrade my belt and haste (replaced rbg), and acquired a stonewood compound (replaced bow of gloaming).  The extra hp and sta put me right at 4985 hp, so I said screw it and aa'd till i got nd2 done. This now puts me at 5131 hp.  In light of this I have several questions.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of getting 64, then aa'ing till i get nd 3, then 65, then AET.  Would this be a good progression for me or would i be better served getting some avoidance/mitigation aa?<br />
<br />
My ac is pretty low I think, I plan on auging my belt with a 10 ac aug, but beyond Ldon augs, I don't see any reasonable manner of improving my ac.  I would get more ornate, but as I have fierce heraldric the upgrade would be minimal, and expensive.  As a non-raiding warrior with minimal funds (17k in bank) should I try to stick in ldon for upgrades, or should I go cash farm for x-object that may be mentioned?<br />

Thank you for your time, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why not just get 65?  No point in being 64 to get AAs IMO.  If you enjoy LDoN, then keep farming away at the points to get what you need out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i stopped at 60 and got a bunch of AA out of the way but that was before they opened the zones, i had just gotten POS and POV flagged and teh AA xp was great so i got a bunch then did xp til 65.  If the zones were opened at the time i prolly would have gone to 65 before getting AA</div></div><hr />

always<br />
<br />
you'll get groups faster, people will take you more seriously, you will take hits better, you will put out more dps (more aggro in a small way).  the most important thing is, tho, if you hit 65 before doing aa, you will ultimately end up much farther along then if you do aa;s before leveling.  aa's at 65 are easier than aa's sub-65.<br />
<br />
the only exception i can think of is maybe rangers with archery mastery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should take a look at getting an ornate helm, possibly. Helms tend to sell for alot less than any other ornate. Other than that, keep an eye out for underpriced items from GoD. Do you ever do hard missions? There will be some very nice upgrades via drops in those. Other than that, just keep cranking out LDoN points for upgrades. <br />
<br />
  As said above, get 65 unless you have a very pressing reason not to. It really is worth it, there have been a million discussions on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Helms sell for less?  Tactics must be the overcamped zone on your server, because the last helm I saw for sale is the one I've been wearing since before the drop rate nerf.<br />
<br />
BoT stuff sells for the least on CT.  Helms fetch a pretty penny if you can even find them.</div></div><hr />

this may seem odd but you could prolly lose some sta mainly the shooulders and go for a higher ac/hp piece. since your smacking your limit unbuffed.</div></div><hr />
