The whole point is to make &quot;....unmatched in the ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; untrue for as many named high DI mobs as Knights can't handle.<br />
<br />
Hopefully SoE will realize that this more than undoes the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change put in the game espressly because our survivability gap was too small. It's amazing someone would sell that to the Warrior community as more fair than 1000 HPs and then two months later think 50% of Defensive (about -5 DI) would look nice on Paladins in PoTime and beyond. Nice net gain.<br />

<br />
A dozen or so PoN posters disagree.<br />
<br />
The main disagreement is the fact that there is no sch thing as &quot;other types&quot; from here on out. EVERY single mob in GoD has an obscene db/di (wtth the possible exception of the 504 max hitters in one of the instanced qinimi trials, who have a min hit of ~36, which is still an incredibly stupid db/di when compared to numbers of other max 504 mobs gamewide)... and you cannot revert to a high db/low di without changing quite a lot of foci (nerfing shielding, nerfing avoidance, ect)</div></div><hr />

If Paladins can reliably MT most current content named mobs in the game and have a spellbook, why would anyone want to play a Warrior? - Battleblade <br />
I suggest you look up unmatched before providing a definition. Unmatched means not matched. For our purposes it doesn't mean never matchable - Knights MTing PoTime makes that much clear.<br />
<br />
Paladins are already getting these flags, they just can not match our reliability. Look Warriors in the eye (like you did on the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change - do I ever feel used on that one) and say such a change is intended to move full-PoTime equipped Paladin success rate from 50% to 75% and you've got an argument. But while Paladins with minimal PoTime gear are discussing the difficulty of the Kod'taz trials in posts on PoN, I claim you don't.<br />
<br />
The &quot;-1 DI&quot; change was put in the game to distance Warrior survivability from other classes. I just paid 60AA for 500 HPS to augment my survivability.<br />
<br />
What are those things worth if Paladins get &quot;-5 DI&quot; when it matters, when tanking current content named high DI mobs in GoD with the goal of matching Warrior reliability?<br />
<br />
I really never expected to debate a Warrior over what &quot;unmatched&quot; means and see a responce that looks like it was written by a PoN poster. Is that where you get your one-line retorts now? Can we expect to see Disiplines are a spellbook from you next?<br />
--------<br />
The run of the mill GoD mobs do not hit like Mack trucks. I don't use Defensive on each and every mob. I use Defensive on named mobs. Nothing new there.<br />
<br />
Look at the trials as if they were PoFire. How many named in PoFire? Did Paladins tank them? Heck how about BoT named? Did Paladins start tanking those from day one?<br />
<br />
Let's not pretend no one has ever played this game before. Warriors tank the most brutal battles. Those battles are by definition high DI mobs - Defensive acting on DI is how it is done. Tanking these mobs IS a Warrior exclusive until end expansion equipment (or at a minimum full previous content (PoTime) equipment) and familiarity allows others to tank them too - but not with the reliability of a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Defensive - an ability Knights don't get. Heals, LoH, Root, stun, Res, etc. - abilities Warriors don't get.<br />
<br />
Paladins can MT in normal experiance groups.<br />
Paladins get flagged (even though most flags aren't mandatory).<br />
Paladins are equipping the augs from the named mobs.<br />
If Paladins can reliably MT most current content named mobs in the game and have a spellbook, why would anyone want to play a Warrior? - Battleblade <br />

<br />
Meanwhile, Deamonwynd is *banned* for saying the word &quot;knightemization&quot;, Shadowfrost *banned* for, well, I don't know for what. For disagreeing I guess; I watched all that unfold, and the labored accusations of him &quot;trolling&quot; were both sad and funny. And now Battleblade is warned for suggesting Soulfire's use -- which is not only a valid suggestion, but has subsequently been discussed. (edit: forgot Landrain, &quot;warned&quot; for no good reason)<br />
<br />
But &quot;Baghdad Bob&quot;, snide trolling, naked class hatred, and obscenities are okay. Right.</div></div><hr />

VT geared knights could, and did...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually Barraind, I expect you are exagerating just a little. BoT was not a walk in zone when the expansion went live. When I first got there, groups prefered Warirors because of Kriegers, much less named, to say nothing of Tower named. And they still right up to the present prefer Warriors.<br />
<br />
Check out EQRankings and go down the list. Spot check the #200 Paladin - full PoTime? Not really. Read the guilds for the first 70 or so Paladins - AO, Conquest, Triton, Township Rebellion, etc. Do you think those Paladins are flagged enough to join their guilds in raids? I assure you the great majority of the active ones are.<br />
<br />
Look at your Magelo and then click your Eventually link. Pretty big differance. That's the differance IMO between being ready to dive into new harder content and being confined to farming the easier trials.<br />
<br />
Look at the Magelos of the posters on PoN that are arguing for what amounts to a Warrior specialization discipline (those that will include a Magelo link). They are not and in many cases their guilds are not ready for harder advanced content. They are getting so far in GoD and no further. The trials might not be &quot;fair&quot;, but they are working.<br />
<br />
Now if you want to get all exercised because Warriors with inferior equipment can succeed in these trials, lets remember they had inferior equipment when they first MT'd an EP mob, a Planar boss, and PoTime. That's what the ability to do leading edge high DI boss mobs is all about. And without a well-equipped guild, they aren't going very far either.<br />
<br />
BTW, has anyone else noticed Paladins don't put screenshots of their SU/Holy Forge &quot;eyecandy&quot; in their sigs anymore? Best to keep such things hidden I suspect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BB,<br />
<br />
There's a number of things we don't see eye to eye on, but for the most part, we agree on a lot of things as well, which makes talking with you quite fun.<br />
<br />
There happens to be some realities though that you're not acknowledging.    There's a rather interesting question that you bring up, the &quot;Why use a warrior?&quot; one.  <br />
<br />
The only time I can see that that is valid is when survivability is a given and there's a &quot;special&quot; circumstance.   For instance, if a mob does a large portion of his damage via lure-type spells, or a lure based fear, or some sort of slow.  The answer to your hypothetical question is... Because he's still got significantly more survivability, and provides enough additional benefits than there's no offsetting ability which would motivate us NOT to use him.<br />
<br />
The fact is though, that I'm not all that much better equipped than Barraind, if at all.   I have some slots better than him, he has some that are better than me.   How come... our standards for success are so dramatically different?   How come it's ok to use me and not him?  How come aggro is not so squirmy that it doesn't REQUIRE Auged DW/EoE/Symbol/Raex BP?   I mean why the double standard?   How come Full Time + LDoN should be required for a Pally or SK but not the same for me?<br />
<br />
What I'm most interested in here is fairness and balance.   I don't believe that state currently exists.   I dont' believe that that state would be threatened with the proposed disc either, and until someone can actually give CLEAR and detailed reasons, I'll continue to support it, regardless what little digs are thrown my way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your idea of fairness is that, if you're equally equipped (meaning same level of progression) a knight should tank as well as a warrior?  Give Knights the ability to tank just as well as warriors with the same level of gear, and you toss out the whole point in having a warrior class at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No, that's not my position at all.   My position is that an equally equipped paladin should be able to survive in any content that's numerically limited that is *necessary* for their advancement.   Not &quot;as well&quot;, just to the point of survivability.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, the proposal I support has knights taking approximately 2k more damage per max round than an equally geared warrior.   This isn't tanking &quot;as well&quot;, it's tanking just enough to survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Haha, the Seventhsword thing irritates me to no end because I got warned for trying to get him to admit his identity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Again, show me where the knights are unable to survive.  Is it harder for them?  Yes.  Is it undoable for them?  No.  Is that how it should be?  Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If the mob dies and the risk isn't  substatially higher the number doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
The facto of the matter is I can not heal, buff, res, etc like a Paladin. THAT is why they can not tank like me.<br />
<br />
The proposed change is one-half of Defensive. In otherwords &quot;-5 DI&quot;. Concidering the Phase 1 Melee Update that widened the ridiculously narrow survivablity gap was &quot;-1 DI&quot; that's undoing that &quot;needed&quot; change in spades.<br />
<br />
Frodlin, you supported that &quot;-1 DI&quot; change now you are working narrow the survivability gap when it matters in the other direction a net &quot;-4 DI&quot; change the wrong way!!<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, my gear is better than Barraind's, my class is intended to have advantages vs. high DI mobs. He can cast group heals, buy aggro for 100pp (my gear would be better yet except I spent DKP on aggro and DPS weapons), and off tank - I'll MT, thank you very much - if y'all leave anything on the list.<br />

<br />
It's clear to me that based on the crusade you've embarked on (3 different bulletin boards, and 2 different &quot;show of hands&quot; threads&quot;) that you've not &quot;shown your peace&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Can the rhetoric, can the little political catch phrases that would make even Al Gore blush (50% defensive giveaway) and get to the meat of it.<br />
<br />
I support it as it stands.<br />
<br />
Tome dropped in Ikkinz 2<br />
25% mitigation bonus<br />
35% damage output penalty<br />
25% negative spell haste <br />
3 min duration<br />
40 min refresh<br />
<br />
- No effect on ANY lower end raid content (must be able to get into AND defeat Ikk 2 to even get).   <br />
<br />
- Still half the effectiveness of Defensive<br />
<br />
This would enable knights to do 2 things.  First, to be able to *reliably* expect a VERY skilled group to succeed that's NOT based on the RNG (I thought we spent the last fuggin YEAR proclaiming that depending on the RNG for success was BAD), second to be able to differentiate knights from other classes in EQ when it comes to tanking, which they SHOULD be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hybrids and the trials are fine.<br />
<br />
As Rytan has said, he's gotten a filled mailbox with representatives of ten different classes, all clamoring for attention, each and every one of them claiming that their class us utterly broken.<br />
<br />
And, again, to give hybrids defensive, you must also give warriors the same kind of utility that hybrids receive via spells. Anything else is unbalancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 The point of survivability = 'as well'. Tanking is a binary, you can or you cannot. There should be content as guaranteed for a Warrior as there is content guaranteed for a Knight. Giving them defensive obviates this. Especially in the case of Shadowknights, who will bring superior DPS and functionally equivalent survivability PLUS the spellbook.

<br />
Survivability isn't &quot;as well&quot;, and while beyond a given point tanking is &quot;binary&quot;, the point of guaranteed survivability is still WELL into the warrior camp.   <br />
<br />
For example, some knights have tanked these trials, and succeeded because of lucky rolls on the RNG.   Does that mean that they've hit our side of the &quot;binary&quot; function and that warriors are obsolete?  <br />

<br />
Actually, you're way off, warriors outDPS SK's while tanking.    The only time SK's outDPS warriors is when they aren't tanking AND can bring up their pets AND don't use their aggro spells, but damage spells.<br />
<br />
Warrior offensive AA's ensure that warriors while tanking are numero uno.</div></div><hr />

The only time SK's outDPS warriors is when they aren't tanking AND can bring up their pets AND don't use their aggro spells, but damage spells. <br />
<br />
 Using the theoretical 3 minute fight as your baseline, SK's can deliver a HT of up to around, what, 8k to start? Add into that lifetaps, melee damage, and even the pet (Because with raid mobs with high DI, you're going to want every bit of DPS you can get), and I don't think it's a slamdunk on the Warrior's side. And if, as you claim, you can wait for /furious and /stonewall to refresh before the boss mobs in these trials, they can sure as hell wait long enough for the SK to cast a pet and buff it.<br />
<br />
For example, some knights have tanked these trials, and succeeded because of lucky rolls on the RNG. Does that mean that they've hit our side of the &quot;binary&quot; function and that warriors are obsolete?  <br />
<br />
 Warriors are the preferred tanks in the opening 'gatekeepers' of content because of /defensive. After the 'gatekeepers' are defeated and content past them is farmed, Knights absolutely get on 'our side' of the binary function. Giving them a mini defensive only decreases the time between Warriors breaking the content and Knights being the equivalent against it. And I'm sorry, Frod, but there is NO compelling argument that says that Knights should equal Warriors within the first month of a new expansion against 'gatekeeper' content WITHOUT passing it and farming past it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Partha, while I understand and empathize with your point about knghts historically not being able to tank gateway mobs until post-content farming, I would like to know how much post-content farming would be sufficient?  I haven't seen anything from GoD that would enable this to occur with any reliability.  No item or combination thereof that would remove RNG luck from success or failure.  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry if it sounds harsh but I cannot see anytyhing other than hypocracy in the notion that it's ok to make them rely on good luck with the RNG for success, while it wasn't ok for us with aggro, which was a MUCH more manageable issue.</div></div><hr />

Reality is, warriors while tanking outDPS Shadowknights while tanking, they will have higher melee DPS than SK's under ANY circumstance when there's not a huge weapon disparity (and GBoC vs. Vanazir is not a huge disparity, GBoC is better but not by a huge margin) due to higher skillcaps, which lead to both greater atk and greater accuracy.  Warriors also have inherent triple attack and flurry+ ranging flurry.  Sk's have the ability to use a pet and have a good amount of spell damage that they can do, which is what puts them over the top if they're not tanking, but if they're tanking, they use a different spell lineup completely.<br />

ROFL, Battleblade has &quot;banished&quot; me for daring to disagree with him even though he changes his position more often than his underwear.<br />
<br />
The SK doesn't appear to be using a DPS aug. His attack seems quite low.<br />
<br />
His atk is maxed from items, but because of lower skill caps, his atk is ALWAYS going to be lower.  I suppose they didn't teach you that in rhetoric school eh Battleblade?   I suppose you just wanted something to cling on to without actually realizing that it was by class design that this was the case.<br />
<br />
Separate from the parses. In a short duration fight it's pretty reasonable to include a big DoT, a mob debuff by the SK, and a pet.<br />
<br />
Actually, it's pretty fucking stupid to include a big dot in a short fight, why not piss the mana down the toilet and cut out the middleman?   Where you're getting &quot;reason&quot; out of casting a spell that won't run it's full extent is beyond me.  For those reasons, Asystole and Ignite are moronic to use, the ONLY reasonable short duration dot they have is Blood of Hate, an 800 point dot that takes 36 seconds to land for max.   That's.... less than 3 extra hits from a warrior using a BoW during the fight.    <br />
<br />

DO you use your shield of strife during these trials on nameds?  I sure wont' do ANYTHING that represents a cutback in DPS.   The sooner the mob dies, the safer for the group overall.   <br />

<br />
Or if a handful of mobs should be adjusted<br />
<br />
Incidentally, which Battleblade am I speaking to?   Am I speaking to the one who said this?<br />
<br />
<br />
I've suggested things like a lesser version of Defensive at perhaps half the mitigation and duration but also half the reuse timer. I've suggested Improved Root which would help in a CC/off tank role.<br />
<br />
We've also seen countless suggestions like really fast moderate sized heals and /shield for Paladins to give them more of a Combat Medic role.<br />
<br />
I think an offensive and a defensive discipline, a couple of heals not taken from the Cleric spellbook, stun fixes including spells that are effective on any mob not tagged as immune, and a general melee DPS increase would polish Paladins up pretty nicely.<br />
<br />
Oh, I see, you only believed it when it DIDNT MATTER, is that it?   Of course, perhaps I'm speaking to the battleblade that said THIS!<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe all three classes should be effective Tanks. That means at least enough survivability and aggro control to get the job done to their group's satisfaction.<br />
<br />
In principle I think if any of the three classes can not achieve 80% (number pulled out of a hat) of the best survivability and aggro of the other two it's not viable.<br />
<br />
I believe that beyond the two fundamental Tanking characteristics are the differences that should distinguish one class from the other. These differences should encourage stackability and a raid role while not giving any one class dominence.<br />
<br />
While they should have aggro control at least 80% as good as the other two Tank classes, Warriors should have limited ability to manipulate aggro. They should be able to exchange DPS and defense at will with only something like Defensive being their hallmark ability and having a long refresh. In a group or raid where they aren't MTing Warriors should be able to select greater melee DPS output. They should have little &quot;utility&quot;. In exchange for this, Warriors should have a substantial survivability advantage. &quot;Beef&quot; should be the Warrior's distinguishing characteristic.<br />
<br />
Knights should excell at utility - they have spellbooks.<br />
<br />
In my view Paladins are very very well constructed. The only thing I can think of to give them is a short duration (1 minute?) self buff with a long refresh (20 minutes?) that gives them Defensive and a simular group buff that increases their group's melee DPS with a refresh limiting it to every 2nd or 3rd fight - maybe a three minute refresh. A better heal, falling far short of CH, would also be useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in other words, you &quot;support&quot; things that will not affect you, and once they WILL, then you'll change tune quicker than a cat in heat.   I mean, half-defensive wasn't MY idea, hell you came up with it almsot 4 months ago.   The only difference being that both of yours are much more powerful than the one I support... <br />
<br />
Hmm, I'm pretty sure that it was because you didn't forsee a time when it would actually be desired again.   Otherwise, hell, you wouldn't have been put into this rather embarrassing situation where you are arguing against your own position now would you?</div></div><hr />

 Dead Shadowknights have no mana anyways - why not put as much DPS on the mob as you can while you're still alive? You can't preach maximum DPS for one class in a trial and preach that another class has to be prevented from maximum DPS in the same trial, m'man.<br />

I agree that it is reasonable for a SK to refresh his HT between the 2 bosses.   It's not reasonable for an SK to use a pet and his big dots while tanking though.    Only when in a non-tanking role.  Mind you, I've stated several times on the various threads around this issue that I believe that SK's are a lot further ahead in terms of value while not tanking than Paladins are at this point.<br />

No, knights need a disc that is a DI modifier in order to have a reasonable chance to survive these without gimping down the encounters.   That can be a tome that drops in Ikk 2, and has a turnin NPC in PoTime, ensuring that the thing can't be sploit looted and ensuring that it won't affect content prior to Ikkinz for the ill prepared.</div></div><hr />

This would, of course, automatically scale upward to include even harder mobs in the future.<br />
<br />
So let me see if I have this straight...cause I'm really confused.<br />
<br />
It's been said over and over that knights can tank these although it relies on a lot of luck of the RNG (and you respond with Raparm, a mob who's neither numerically limited, nor related to progression in any way whatsoever aside from dropping an elemental mold and a staff, which is hardly &quot;progression&quot;),  yet you're not &quot;opposed&quot; even though the mobs can be killed in 3 minutes or less, as long as the knights have a real risk associated with them (even though you don't favor increasing of reward to compensate for the risk associated with a knight tanking) to comfortably assure you a spot on this content.   <br />
<br />
You would be opposed to a &quot;discipline&quot; but not gear, even though the discipline tome that would enable this would meet ALL of the requirements stated (allowing knights to tank it after the content has been conquered with warrior tanking) because we all know that gear isn't really available which would enable this anyhow, so it's easy to say &quot;They should farm the gear&quot; in the same way you were once totally in favor of knights getting defensive... because it's not likely to happen... period.<br />
<br />
The levels of hypocracy here are fucking astounding.    In essence, you want to be &quot;reasonable&quot; as long as the &quot;reasonable&quot; solution isnt' likely to actually exist.  <br />
<br />
Oh, incidentally, how long has the expansion been out now, 5 weeks?  When exactly will the &quot;content is new&quot; crutch expire?   First it was &quot;2 weeks&quot;, then &quot;less than a month&quot;, now we're up to 5 weeks and counting, and there's STILL no change in the foreseeable future.   I'm wondering when the &quot;Content is new&quot; excuse will pass and we'll be realistic about our condition in terms of balance, and our cush little stranglehold on Kod+ tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 So if gear drops past the trials that is an improvement over Time loot, will we see a retraction from you on the need for Knight upgrades and/or trials retuning? (Of course, by then the damage will be done, but at least we'll have the sight of you eating crow pie to get us by.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Responding to a previous post;<br />
<br />
Reparm is exactly the same type of mob fight. A tough battle where the RNG can bite ya.<br />
<br />
Paladins can tank high DI mobs less effectively than Warriors by design intent - both Defensive and &quot;-1 DI&quot; when Defensive is not active insures this is the case. As you well know this Warrior DI manipulating mechanism is not available to Knights. It both provides the advantage (mitigation of the DI potion of melee damage for 3 minutes in the case of Defensive) and the limitations (has little effect on normal experiance mobs, does not mitigate non-melee damage).<br />
<br />
This often results in a higher failure rate vs. high DI mobs for Knights - as it has since Kunnark. End expansion equipment, greater support (Vie/Rune chains, more healers), special mob vulnerabilities (mob can be stunned, mob fears), special tactics, use of Knight spells, etc. modifies this risk.<br />
<br />
I am not opposed to Paladins receiving a Vie like spell to help with mitigation since stuns can't do so with most high level mobs (requiring one or the other). I am not oposed to Weaponshield. I am not oposed to changing the mobs.<br />
<br />
I am adamently opposed to giving Knights Defensive since it is intended to make Warriors by default The Primary Tank vs. any high DI mob unless SoE intentionally insures the mob is &quot;special&quot;. I particularly object to it being intended to affect high DI mobs ANYWHERE and that it will scale upward in the future.<br />
<br />
So let's try to overcome some of my objections:<br />
1. GoD only.<br />
2. Not usable in raids.<br />
3. LoH put on the same timer<br />
4. Reduces mana pool to 200 (to avoid this from being combined with healing vs mobs that produce significant non-melee damage)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I am still very opposed to Knights receiving a Central Warrior Defining Ability.<br />

He's already addressed this point anyways and the answer to your question is how far to you have to progress for Knights to tank?  It's certainly not Kod'Taz/Ikkinz raids, it's not Yxtta either, Uqua maybe? Qvic? Txveu?  How far do you have to go before its reasonable?  And when you reach that point does it even matter anymore if a Knight can tank it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">It's not reasonable for an SK to use a pet and his big dots while tanking though. <br />
<br />
 And why not? Because YOU say it's not? If maximum DPS will allow the SK to live because you're dropping the mob faster, why on earth would he NOT want maximum DPS? Saying it's not reasonable is like saying it's not reasonable for Warriors to use Stonewall instead of Defensive! My experience tells me if I have to get something done fast, I'm going to want maximum DPS, not to self gimp myself to prove a point for Frodlin. (Which is what I meant by preventing maximum DPS, but you didn't parse my sentence correctly.)<br />
<br />
No, knights need a disc that is a DI modifier in order to have a reasonable chance to survive these without gimping down the encounters. That can be a tome that drops in Ikk 2, and has a turnin NPC in PoTime, ensuring that the thing can't be sploit looted and ensuring that it won't affect content prior to Ikkinz for the ill prepared. <br />
<br />
 If you wish to call a Weaponshield/Deftdance disc a DI modifier disc, then I can go along with that. Give 'em a 40 second WS, and with current Knight survivability on these trials, that's MORE than enough to defeat a mob that takes less than 192 seconds to kill, without farming out one of the last unique Warrior abilities to Paladins who SHOULD be equipped with spell based mitigation and SK who theoretically have no business tanking as well as Paladins.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, the vast majority of crap being dished out is by people who won't even USE these zones. <br />
<br />
 You're absolutely right. Of course, this whole argument has been carried forward by Knights who for the most part aren't geared well enough with Time loot, some who aren't even Time flagged, and in the case of at least ONE mod over in PoN (to rerail this thing), isn't even 65 yet. And yet, THEIR opinions carry greater weight with you than the Warriors, Paladins, and SK's who HAVE been through it and who HAVE proclaimed that 'it's not that bad if you're geared for it'.<br />
<br />
 Amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Reparm even tho its semi similiar, isnt a great comparision because the loss of the tank on Reparm has far far far less impact on sucess of raid then in Ikkinz Single Group Trials...<br />

<br />
Actually, SK's should theoretically tank as well as Paladins on unstunable mobs, our melee abilities are identical our spell lineups to give us help tanking are comparable (actually they favor SK's on non stunnable stuff), our aggro is higher than Paladin aggro, the difference is in healing and buffing capabilities, Paladins have good healing which can be used on themselves and others plus buffs, SK's have lesser self only ones.  Unless your defination of Paladins tanking better is standing up without a healer easier then we're basically equal and thats by design it seems since theres been tons of opportunities to change it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think depending on the mob the answer lies somewhere between &quot;not a chance in the world&quot; and &quot;exactly the same&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unless Knights are totally indistinquishable from Warriors, it is SoE's mob and encounter design that determines just how &quot;viable&quot; Knights are.<br />
<br />
The Knight Defensive proposal is intended to make the the 3 tanks functionally indistinquishable for mobs with certain characteristics. Essentially this is intended to circumvent SoE's mob and encounter design.<br />
<br />
And that is what is fundimentally flawed with the appoach (going at the wrong end of the problem) and the solution (trying to make the 3 tanks indistinguishable for a class of mobs where this was not the prior condition).<br />

Being able to survive doesn't mean we're indistingusihable.  You would be taking less dps, less dmg spikes, putting out more dps (while tanking), have higher hp, and be capable of using your tanking discs on more than a handful of mobs in the encounter.

Unless my lower damage spikes, DPS, etc. result in a greater success rate there is no meaningful difference and no particular reason to prefer a Warrior who is supposed to be more effective in tanking high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
You suggest a reasonable chance to survive, however the definition of reasonable can vary among reasonable people. I think if I can manage only a 90% success rate vs. a high DI mob, then for you (not intended to be a specialist vs. high DI mobs) a success rate of 50% is extraordinarily reasonable.<br />

A song dedicated to Paladins that continue beating the dead horse. We all used to wonder how you had so much time to play EQ, now we know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">50% is about twice what I have now, I would be very suprised if any Warrior with 2 healers and the same degree of gear I have (plus the aa's to back it up) is capable of dying while disced with flawless healing a Knight on the other hand is extremly capable of it with top gear.<br />

Edit, just read the complaints about PoN boards... lack of moderation is bliss.</div></div><hr />
