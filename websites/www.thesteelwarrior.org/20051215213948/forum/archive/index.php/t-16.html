For those of you asking what armor you should get next this should help you to find what you are looking for.  <br />
<br />
Note 1: I am not listing every set, just some of the more common ones people have been using at different levels.<br />
<br />
Note 2: Someone else is going to have to make up a Guide for Lizards who cannot wear some of the plate armors.<br />
<br />
Armor progreshion:<br />
<br />
Newbie quests: These quests are spiffy for those of you who are just starting out in EQ. Your guild trainers will give you information on how to do them if your race has them. I wish I had them back in the day when I started out.<br />
<br />
Crafted/Crusty: Almost the same thing. Some slots of crusty being better ( ie. greaves ) and some crafted being better( ie. breastplate ). Crafted armor is the result of Old World quest and nowadays it is cheaper to buy the armor than quest for it. Crusty or Crustacean Shell is dropped off of Othmirs in Cobalt scar, and again you are probably going to end up buying it from farmers.<br />
<br />
Barbed ringmail: This armor comes from Velketor's Labyrinth. You again will more likely buy this armor rather than win it nowadays. Most notable is the Breastplate which is a nice step up from crafted/crusty and also lizard useable.<br />
<br />
Hate Armor: This armor comes from the Plane of Hate ( duh  )off of the mummy looking monks named A Kiraikuei. There is a set for Lizards ( Legionnaire Scale ) and a Set for normal warriors ( Indicolite ) available here. This Armor is no-drop on most servers so you will have to kill for it ( finally, thank god some action  ) There is a quest in the plane of knowledge that allows you to turn in this armor for gems and a bit of EXP when you grow out of it, well for the normal set at least.<br />
<br />
Cobalt/Berserker's/Champions:The next step has three options ( well two for Lizards ).<br />
<br />
Cobalt  armorcomes from the Dungeons of Kunark but can be acquired from the bazaar as well. The most notable thing about this armor is the higher AC ( than the other two sets at this level anyway ) and the right click effects. The Breastplate can heal you and the Greaves can turn people invisible. The bracer can shrink people the boots give you more strength. The helm grants you Infravision. The arms shield you, and finally the gloves have a crappy buff that I used the scare newbies with. Lizards cannot use this armor<br />
<br />
Champion’s  armor is the lowest level of the Velious quest armors. Think Cobalt with less ac and no clicks ( well all but the breastplate) but much better stats. To get Champs or thurg quest gear, you need to have good faction with The coldain dwarves, kill in Kael for corroded plate armor, and find three gems from the frozen lands. This armor is No-Drop and but can be multi-quested.<br />
<br />
Berserker's Armor comes from the Plane of Growth. Has similar stats to Champions armor but no gems necessary. one Note about PoG, killing in PoG makes Elves hate you. Not too much of a problem nowadays however. This armor is No-drop and is not a quest so the only way to get it is to piss off Tunare.<br />
<br />
Next step and the Last one I will cover for now: Myrmidon/Warlord/Tradeskill<br />
<br />
Myrmidonarmor is the result of the Dragon quests in Velious. Much hp on this set of armor to gain this armor you need to kill in the Halls of Testing and return three gems along with unadorned plate to Skyshrine. This armor is Multi-questable but you need ally faction before you can think about getting this armor.<br />
<br />
Warlord armor is the result of the Giant quests in Velious. This armor is nice for people who dream about AC all night long. To get this armor you need to kill in the ToV. and turn in the ancient tarnished armor with three gems in Kael. This armor is Multi-questable but you need ally faction.<br />
<br />
Trade skill armor is where things get a bit touchy. Stats on these armor sets are comparable to the other sets at this level and in some instances better than the other two. For the full lowdown on these armors look at EQ Traders under the Cultural and Cazic Thule recipes.<br />
<br />
Well that is it for now. Hope you have found something useful from all of this.<br />
<br />
PS: I recall an armor comparison chart that was made and for some reason I want to say Radbarsh made it. If anyone still has the link it would be a help.<br />

Here are the correct stats:<br />
<br />
Moktor Boots  +21 AC +10 Sta +2 Wis +15 vsMg +15 vsFire<br />
Moktor Bracer  +13 AC +4 Str +4 Dex +1 Wis +4 vsCold<br />
Moktor Breastplate  +36 AC +15 Str +15 Sta +6 Wis +15 HP<br />
Moktor Gauntlets  +17 AC +5 Str +5 Dex +1 Wis +5 vsDis<br />
Moktor Greaves  +21 AC +10 Str +10 Sta +6 Wis +15 HP <br />
Moktor Helm  +21 AC +5 Sta +4 Wis +8 vsFire +10 HP<br />
Moktor Vambraces  +21 AC +5 Str +5 Dex +3 Wis +10 HP</div></div><hr />
