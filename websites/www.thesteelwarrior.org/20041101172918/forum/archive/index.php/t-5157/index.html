<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, a quick brief question about my dilmea.  My guild has been farming Velious for quit a long time.  We are a small guild and skipping ssra/vt(due to time restraints of being cst/pst)  So, as you already know by reading this we are going to try some POP events.<br />
<br />
Now my question is should I stick with Driver from xanamech along with my dagarn's tail or go with Gaudralek, Sword of the Sky  ?  I have all my defensive AAs and now working on flurry AA.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Goyan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depends whether your looking for an aggro or dps set up.<br />
but for aggro you can try and pick up the GBoS from tower mobs in BoT and pair that with ur xana hammer. add a couple of anger procs and your gtg.<br />
<br />
as for dps, gaudralek is decent, but you can also shoot for the GS04W from bot. not sure which parses out higher, probably the PoP one i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sword of the Sky has both good DPS, and surprisingly good aggro...been using mine in Plane of Earth A the last week in xp groups. Coupled with the incite line of skills, I haven't had anyone die on me due to aggro loss (1 puller killed themselves when a tree snared them then beat them to a bloody pulp heheh)...So if you're gonna skip Ssra which has some nice EB weapons, then the 2hs sword should do you well...also 2hs = less ripostes...which was the main reason I played around with it in PoE...awaiting my BoW hehe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Would it be possible to use Sword of the Sky all the way to Elemental?  I am considering using that over all 1hs combos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I remember right Gaudralek was not so bad for aggro the 179 unresistable DD with knockback had a nice potion of aggro.<br />
<br />
Its not EB but near the Rune of the BBB .. .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My perspective of a Guadralek.... I totally love it for the following reasons.<br />
<br />
DPS is pretty decent<br />
AC = 50 totally owns making it a very good tanking weapon<br />
Effect is unresistable 179 DD + knockback 1 = enough to aggro<br />
HP = 100<br />
<br />
Even with no stats other than HPs and AC my stats are maxxed anyhow with buffs. The 50 AC actually is around 75 AC when equipped.<br />
<br />
I used mine unaugmented and loved it, and then augmented and I love it even more. I also have a BoC unaugmented, and for aggro the augmented Gaudralek is the winner(I'm needing a couple EF adventures to augment my BoC).<br />
<br />
You won't go wrong with this sword - also the graphic is very nice.<br />
<br />
Edit: Using this sword till elementals? I would say yes. Augment that thing with Anger 3 and you should have no problems.</div></div><hr />
