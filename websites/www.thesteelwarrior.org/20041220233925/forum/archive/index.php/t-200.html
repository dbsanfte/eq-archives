consisting of a 51 Shaman, 44 Cleric, 51 Ranger, and either a 55 wizard, 51 Druid, or others from the guild around same lvls <br />
<br />
<br />
useing Silken Whip and Barnacle Covered Axe as main aggro weapons, and an Argent Protector as my 2 hander<br />
<br />
have been through most the usual weapons, Defenders Light Blade, Wurmslayer, Centi LS etc through the 40's either owning or trying them out from a friend<br />
<br />
atm most my moneys put back for armor upgrades, the girlfreind's cleric is at 201 smithing so were getting close to starting FH combines sooner or later, and farming the parts while still get exp is always a nice bonus<br />
<br />
question is with what I have, would I be ok until can reach some zones with better drops, via quests or raids, or are there weapons I should look for to upgrade these ?<br />

Barney axe is working OK for me at the moment, but what worked well for you tough old geezers when you were 50ish?</div></div><hr />

I hear Short Sword of Ykesha used to be the cat's pajamas back then.<br />
<br />
It's still a great proc for aggro. Only thing holding it back these days is the DPS hasn't been able to keep up with all the expansions/mudflation.<br />
<br />
But the troll smithed Ykesha upgrade makes for a nifty rennaissaince of the skulls.<br />
<br />
I also hear tell that the Blade of the BLACK Dragon Eye used to be something to behold, aggro wise.<br />
<br />
And wasn't the twig really good before it got nerfed to secondary only?<br />
<br />
I dunno. I grew up in the times where good aggro weapons pre-Epic were Frostbringer, Black Blade of Tormenting, Snare Whip, anything with a stun on it (even Gnoll Hide Lariats!) and what not.</div></div><hr />

The good thing about Praetor's (assuming you're a good race, or you do the faction work as an evil race) is that it's a free weapon.  BBoT is like 500p or less now also, not expensive at all.</div></div><hr />

Frosty Main, Trochillic's Skean off (never underestimate the aggro power of an 18 second stun, even if the DPS sucks)</div></div><hr />
