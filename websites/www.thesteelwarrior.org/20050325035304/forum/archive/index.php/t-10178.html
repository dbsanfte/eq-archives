<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I keep seeing posts from back in the day where people talk about getting 20min AA's at PoF tables, or 20 min AA's in Kt. Then the same people talk about getting even BETTER XP in MPG. <br />
<br />
I've been watching my AA bar move in 'xp' groups  a bunch recently, and I've come to the conclusion that any time I come out of the group averaging 1 aa/hour i'm doing damn fine. If I don't have a chanter pulling and parking mobs in MPG, I'm unlikely to get anywhere near that.<br />
<br />
Am I missing out on something here, or are these fabled 20minute AA's just  the fastest AA somebody ever saw go buy, rather than actually 6AA in 2 hours?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yiktin Voxbane</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently did a 5 aa in 2.5 hr session in NW caves in WoS. Pulls were not frenetic to start with but once everyone hit the comfort zone, we rocked that place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I consider 30 minute AA's exceptional, but not terribly uncommon.  MPG is good AA exp per kill, but with mob spacing, you are not going to get awesome exp there usually.  If I want to all out grind AA's, best 2 places in OoW I have found is RS(but needs to be a very good group or downtime kills it) and RCoD catacombs instince(fast fast pulls and fast kills = fast exp...and great if you are still working on faction).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People claiming to get 20 minute AAs are probably exaggerating, but fast experience is about having a lot of DPS and having it turned on all the time.  Chain-pullling, zero downtime, and tons of DPS is optimal.  MPG doesn't work for it because the mobs are just too spaced out even if you could kill them that fast, you can't pull them fast enough.  1 AA/hour is excellent experience, and you won't do much better than that without a perfect group in a perfect spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrok</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was doing 28 min aa's in POE over a 6 hour period right before OOW came out.  It was a good day.  KT was about every 33 mins or so, would of been faster if they did have to rez me every 3 mobs, was only 8k hps and 1600 ac fully buffed at the time.  In both cases we probly would of gotten aa's faster but do to lack of mobs we had to wait for repops or pull from the other side of zone.  Only way you will see 20 min aa's is high dps and lots of mobs.  If you can get a puller to have a mob there in camp when the last mob is at 10 to 5% (or the ench/bard who will keep a mob mezed in camp at all times) and you switch targets to build agro while everyone else including the puller finished off the last mob then the wiz and others can tear up the next mob for you have had time to build good agro.  Mobs in RS give 5% per kill but have alot more hps.  <br />
<br />
So if you can get a high dps group and can hold agro while they all let loose on the mobs then the aa's will poor in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baam</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The word 'comfort zone' is actually really good.<br />
<br />
When you reach that state, then you start increasing the effectiveness of the group. A bit all the time and then you end up with a killer group doing it's best.... or you end up wiping if you over do :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, even though the group does it's best and really do some prof work, then there are still limitations.<br />
<br />
Some factors already listed:<br />
The Zone.. exp each mob?<br />
The Camp.. many mobs and easy to pull?<br />
Do you have the aa?<br />
Do you have the leader aa to max dps?<br />
Tribute ?<br />
<br />
What gear do you have..<br />
Focus effects?<br />
attk effects?<br />
Accuracy and strikethrough?<br />
Cleave effects?<br />
Improved duel wield effect?<br />
Mana regen<br />
<br />
buffs..<br />
all attk buffs?<br />
your click attk buffs for high dps classes?<br />
the best mana regen<br />
..<br />
..<br />
<br />
Spells..<br />
The best GoD or oow dmg spells?<br />
<br />
And at last the combination of classes in your group.<br />
<br />
This should give some indication of most of the things that play a role. There are a  lot of factors. Some people will have an easier time maxing our these factors than others and some will never be able to reach that level.<br />
<br />
However personally, I would find my own goal for aa each hour and aim for that. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im about the same as you Bardeil. If I can sustain an AA an hour im feeling great about it.  If they go any faser than that its usually because we have a dps bot hanging around.  I suspect that some of the miraculous aa times you hear about benefit from dps bots as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i just wish i could find 1 hour yellow groups. :D<br />
<br />
best i ever did ( with the shikarii ) was an AA's in 45 minutes when he was level 63, hunting in Drunder waiting for piglet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breako</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides RS (haven't gotten a group there yet) I would have to say that PoF Tower is the fastest exp. There are alot of mobs in lower tower to clear can kill fast and pull even faster. Have been there the last 2 nights for about total of 5 hours and have gotten 7 AA's. <br />
<br />
Pull the room from the middle carpet then pull the courtyard center area then from the buildings bought the time you get to the buildings the room should start poping. As tank you pull room and after room down have puller start bringing the others. Is also a great plae to grind out the LVL's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
C2/Reparm in Fire<br />
I've been apart of a few groups that pulled off 20 minutes. I've even been apart of groups that have gotten AA faster than 20 minutes, but ofcourse, I'd say there was 2-3 alts logged on for outside DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">C2/Reparm in Fire<br />

<br />
Now that I believe hehe.  Was in a group last night in MPG with 2 mage bots out of group with an already pretty decent DPS group and I was taking 1 CH per mob, which is amazing for MPG hehe.  Even with slow pulling it was great exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Outside the group DPS def needs to be taken into consideration.<br />
<br />
Fastest AA exp with a 6 member party I have recieved is def. MPG near the RS zone in.  We had 2 rogues and a monk that didnt bother with melee, just pulled and made sure we always had a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">C2 was the best I have found so far.<br />
Another good place we found was chain pulling the Bowlord camp in RCoD to that non-aggro gnome.<br />
<br />
We initially went there for upgrades.<br />
It became our new AA spot.<br />
Still isnt a real C2 replacement though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best AAXP you'll ever find is probably inside Riftseekers Sanctum.<br />
Doing the Pyrileen Rifsteeker Cycle &amp; One adjacent room.<br />
<br />
3+ AA per hour was quite easy (6+1) the bot beeing a chanter.<br />
However you need a really badass group (Qvic+).<br />
<br />
Fire Castle1 / Castle 2 are probably the best xp out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was in a double named group at the edge of the see-invis line yesterday in MPG for some pretty hot xp.  Odi/Bh or something like that (not familiar with the new names yet)<br />
<br />
Bard Rog Rog War Cleric Beastlord<br />
<br />
Got 6 aa's in about 3.5 hours of xping.  Used to be i could grind out an aa a little bit faster at 65 in EP's, but this was the fastest i've seen it since Omens and level 70.  I've found a fast MPG group to be much better xp than any RSS group simply because mobs have far fewer hps and a good chain puller can work much quicker in MPG.<br />
<br />
Still, though, those 70hp ear/finger augments and 4 25ac augments look pretty nice.  I'll have to head down there in the next week or 2 for farm sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont forget the AC20 augs too.<br />
When we cant find a bard for resists, we go Ice side and pull Girplan over and over till a bard comes online.<br />
<br />
All those augs add up.<br />
(But it makes your magelo look kinda silly. 2100 AC, 8K HP hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yesterday at that lovely camp i also managed to pick up a Warclasp earring (+ 35hp 2ac and stats/saves) and a 20ac aug now fitted in my ear  :D .  Today I camp the Kuaan Infantry legs from MPG.<br />
<br />
All in all it was a good day ... i finished up sturdiness 4 and 5 (loving the new reduced prices) for a net gain of 200 + 35 (raw/gear) hp and 20 raw ac.<br />
<br />
Next stop for me is the set of four 70hp augs that go in earring/rings from RSS, as well as the four 25ac augs for wrist/bp/legs, as well as some random loot drops from that particular zone.  When time permits and my usual group is on, i'll also be pumping out some trials for a few pieces of time level gear.<br />
<br />
So far I'm in candyland.  The xp is great (not the best but still top-notch) and i can get precious augs and gear at a quicker, more exiciting rate than with LDoN.<br />
<br />
Btw 8k hps and 2100 ac unbuffed is just dandy with me.  As a non-raiding warrior, the ability to buff out to more than 12k is not high on my list of priorities.  Being able to mitigate the damage i take like a hoss, on the other hand, is right up my alley.  My clerics these days are tossing me partial cheals regularly (lands for full but doesnt take me to 100%), so i'm not concerned.</div></div><hr />
