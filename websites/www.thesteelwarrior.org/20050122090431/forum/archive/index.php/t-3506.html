Same as last time, attacking Bella helsin in Katta from behind.  No buffs of any kind.  Time for bed now, can draw conclusions in the morning.  Nice to see somebody else did a parse as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change in BoC proc rate from mainhand to secondary is dramatic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are we looking at the same data?<br />
<br />
SoD did not come out on top.  It's statistical variation.  Your mainhand procs more than your offhand, it's how it works.  You'll also notice that mainhand, the BoC did proc more than the SoD did mainhand for Brutul.<br />
<br />
They're the same (allowing for margin of error from RNG randomness in a short period of time), just like we've been saying all along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...<br />
<br />
Like people have been saying all along?  Half the threads on this board insist that BoC is 'utter shit' because it has an incredibly crappy proc ratio - now someone actually parsed the numbers and show that within the same statistical error the BoC and SoD both proc the exact same amount of time<br />
<br />
Brutul's point is that they do proc the exact same amount, and that nobody in their right mind would argue that Anarchy is more aggro than Enraging Blow, and DPS with BoC main handed is superior to SoD (though I could imagine on incredibly high AC mobs SoD would outdps it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did a 45 minute parse myself on the banker and these are my results. I had 170 DEX, 36 percent haste, and 0 offensive AAs (except punishing blade :p):<br />
<br />
Blasephemous Blade of the Exiled - 109 procs = 2.42 procs per minute<br />
Blade of Carnage - 22 procs = 0.49 procs per minute<br />
Call of Fire (from Gloves of the Crimson Sigil) - 46 = 1.02 procs per minute<br />
Icicle Strike (on Blasphemous Blade) - 74 = 1.64 procs per minute<br />
Heated Blade (on Blade of Carnage) - 31 = 0.69 procs per minute<br />
<br />
Conclusion - Blade of Carnage should proc a lot more than once every 2 minutes in the offhand :(. I don't have EQ Companion installed yet since I reformatted my hard drive, and as a result I don't have a DPS figure at this time. However, procs from my mainhand weapon accounted for 5 DPS or so (including the Icicle Strike aug :p).<br />
<br />
Going to do a parse with my primal warsword in my offhand to see how much it affects my proc rate of my mainhand weapon having 90 extra dex up (I lose 10 dex when I swap my BoC for my Primal Warsword).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brutul's point is that they do proc the exact same amount, and that nobody in their right mind would argue that Anarchy is more aggro than Enraging Blow, and DPS with BoC main handed is superior to SoD (though I could imagine on incredibly high AC mobs SoD would outdps it) <br />
<br />
I think you went a step overboard here.  They do proc the same, but that's not really why everyone says the proc rate sucks.  People who say the BoC proc rate sucks are using a bloodfrenzy, which has been proven to proc more, which is why they say it sucks.<br />
<br />
Second, there are plenty of people who argued that Anarchy was superior to EB, and they have been doing so since Velious.  Fact of the matter is that until we know exactly how much hate is generated by a stun component spell, we'll never know the exact answer.  I can say with certainty that it's not a huge difference.  1 EB proc will lock that mob on me thru a slow, but so will an Anarchy and so will a Force Shock.  I would hardly call the argument that EB is superior conclusive. (for the record, i'm not saying that EB isn't superior, i'm saying that stun hate value is an unknown variable, and until we know that, no one can say one way or the other)  I can say that Anarchy is more than sufficient for 90% of EQ players however.  If EB is superior, it's already more aggro than you need.<br />
<br />
Third, I don't know if EQCompanion includes procs in their DPS figures, to be quite honest, I don't know if I trust them, but with Ingenuity 3, I throw out some fuckin nice DPS with SoD mainhand getting 576 blasts every other fight or so.  BoC is only weapon DPS.  On anything other than total MR mobs, the SoD has to outdamage the BoC.  I just can't believe it doesn't.  2 procs per minute with an SoD is an extra 576 damage, which equates to almost 10dps.  BoC ratio doesn't beat SoD by 10dps, no way, no how.<br />
<br />
Is the BoC &quot;Utter shit?&quot;  I don't know.  I can definitely tell you that it's not worth the price tag it carries to me tho, and I've used one, so I know what i'm talking about.<br />
<br />
The thing that really shocks me in Brutul's, Gerald's and my parsings is that putting a weapon in your offhand essentially fuckin kills it's proc rate.   Do we really only dual wield 50% of the time, even with Ambidex (me only)?  That seems really low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think BoC vs SoD dps can be plotted as two curves and as a function of (ATK / mob AC) on the x-axis and DPS on y-axis.<br />
<br />
On mobs like Creator, I am positive an SoD will destroy a BoC due to Creator's insane AC plus his AC debuff, however in a place like a LDoN group with a moderately buffed ATK (avatar &amp; grim aura + a few random pieces of ATK from gear) a BoC will handily outparse it.<br />
<br />
A bigger portion of SoD's DPS comes from its proc damage which doesn't scale with improved attack and lower mob AC.<br />
<br />
About the aggro from the two procs, every warrior in my guild except our main tank uses BoC + GBoS and has a GSo4W for DPS.  While doing a LDoN hard adventure, the aggro difference was very noticable between the one warrior who used GBoS/BoC vs the warrior using BoC/GBoS (although admittedly that is a HUGE simplification).<br />
<br />
As a nuker class with no means to reduce my aggro, I am of the firm beliefe that a enraging blow proc allows me to nuke harder, although I cannot exactly quantify how much harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone parse a HG?  I'm quite sure it procs more than BoC.<br />
<br />
In reply to the quote about Anarchy vs EB... I would argue that Anarchy is better aggro than EB :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If we want to know exactly what the proc rate is then yea a longer log would be better.  But I think these are long enough to show that's there's not much difference between the two, and the BoC doesn't &quot;suck&quot;.<br />
<br />
I could run a longer log, but I have no idea how to parse it.  I'm pretty sure EQcompanion can't handle a 50,000 hit fight, and I couldn't see any way to get it to count procs so I had to do that manually using the 'find' utility in notepad.  No way I can do that on an 8 hour log.<br />
<br />
I am an eqcompanion rookie mostly, but I think procs are included in it's dps parse.  Mearis has a good point though, that a weapon that does proc DPS would shine on a fight with higher level, higher AC mobs while tanking.  This parse was done on a green con attacking from the back, so that may skew the numbers somewhat toward the better ratio weapon.  Of course your procs could get resisted more often as well.<br />
<br />
Edit:  If anyone that is a better parser wants to check my logs out, PM me with your email address.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ Companion can parse some pretty big log files if you set it up correctly.  And it depends on how much RAM you have.<br />
<br />
Also EQ Companion lists DD procs, but doesn't count EB.  MS Word works for counting procs.  Just do a 'Find' and have it find all.  Then it'll give you the # of matches found.  I used this for the riposte parses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having a Hategiver, BoC and Sod, I&quot;ve always felt that the SoD was at best on par with the BoC for procs and I eat more riposte damage when I mainhand it.  Normally I mainhand Hategiver and offhand Boc, and either my Hategiver procs a ton (which I doubt) or my BoC procs at pretty much the results parsed here.<br />
<br />
I use Eqcompanion for parses: http://home.inreach.com/kai/EQCompanion/Main.html<br />
<br />
but you could also open your log file with a text editor and manually scan through it.<br />
<br />
The mobs you fight, magic resistant or not, will not effect how many procs you get.  Perhaps there are some zones where proc rates are modifed; Sony admitted to monks there are zones where they will fail FD more often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These tests are too short.  The Safehouse melee tests were done for 8 hours if I recall (god I wish those were still available to read now), and they found that the offhand procs about a quarter as often as the mainhand.  It was pretty clear from those results that the offhand has a built-in penalty to its proc rate.  Gerald's data appears to support that too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uggh, you're grasping at straws man.  You're wrong, deal with it.<br />
<br />
No, your proc rate is not dependant on the mob you are fighting.  You don't have to hit to proc, therefore mob level/type is irrelevant. <br />
<br />
You also didn't go an hour without a BoC proc.  Even offhand, it's impossible.  2 fights, sure, an hour, no.<br />
<br />
Enraging blow is unresistable, no resist check in the world saves anything from an EB proc, it happens, period.<br />
<br />
Move on man, you got owned, time to salvage what's left of your dignity, live and learn, and just don't make the same mistake next time.  It happens to all of us.</div></div><hr />

I respect Haas for i have read many of his posts and I accept that he knows what he is talking about.<br />
Just seems that far too many people jump at the chance to argue with me simply because I had a &quot;weird&quot; experience in this game.<br />
I claim that my BOC doesnt work.<br />
All I am hearing is &quot;you are wrong blah blah blah&quot;<br />
It is like taking a bite from apple pie and saying it tastes funny, then having the entire community saying that can not be right because they have all eaten apple pie and post data on how their Pie tastes good.<br />
Yet the pie in my mouth is still yucky.<br />
Instead of asking here I will talk to some of my friends on the parsing thing and i will post my data.<br />
Perhaps once I see the actual data and can count the number of BOC procs I get over time I will actually see that I am in fact wrong. Once that happens I will gladly come here and say &quot;hey you guys, you are right this sword does still work!&quot;<br />
Or if I find that My BOC only procs 5 times an hour and I am proven right and post my data for all to see will I then just be accused of falsifying my information?<br />
It is a waste of time, and it is simpler to just let this go, sell my BOC while it is still worth something and move on.<br />

Ya know, it's funny how a lot of the times I knock heads with people, we end up with sort of a grudging respect for each other down the line when we find out we have more in common with each other than we think.

The proc rate on the BoC is a completely objective subject.  If you don't like the taste of pie, then don't eat it.  But what you're telling me is that it's not pie, even though I can look at it and tell that it is.  If you want to sell your BoC then by all means do it, but you came here with no data, posted something that was quickly disproven by people *with* data, and here you are still talking.<br />
<br />
Either post the data or quit talking about it.  We don't want people posting misinformation on a board that many people come to for information and advice.  I know that you don't understand this concept, but that doesn't change the fact that we want real information here and not &quot;jokes&quot; or whatever you want to call your posts after they are debunked.  <br />

<br />
...<br />
<br />
Last night i used my BoC for 4 hours and watched my text screen very carefully and counted the number of procs and got less than 20. That is 5 procs an hour, 1 every 12 minutes.<br />
It USED to be more like your data posted.<br />

You keep digging yourself a hole, and it's like that simpsons episode where they go &quot;Uh oh, how are we gonna get out?  I know, we'll dig our way out!   No no...dig up, stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching your chat screen isn't a parse.  Handing your BoC to a ranger isn't scientific data.  Gut feelings aren't hard facts.  Turn on your log, put your BoC mainhand for awhile and search for your procs in wordpad.  You're wrong, and you have the ability to prove to yourself that you're wrong, but for some reason you keep talking, and you keep digging.  Stop now, and start digging up.  You're only making yourself look worse when you're trying to argue against facts with nothing.</div></div><hr />

Camp out and open up Windows explorer. Find your EQ folder, it will likely be in /program files/Everquest<br />
<br />
Look for a file named Naralli_SERVERNAME.txt<br />
<br />
At this point, open the file in Wordpad or MS Word and do a search and replace for &quot;Face contorts with Rage&quot;, then look for the number of times the term was replaced. That is the number of procs over the course of your log. You can look at the time stamp of the first entry and subract it from the time stamp on the last entry to get an accurate amoun of time you recorded in your log.<br />
<br />
If you don't feel comfortable parsing the log yourself, feel free to e-mail it to me at wandor@bfdesigns.net and I will parse it for you.</div></div><hr />

Each parse will be a little over 3 hours.  I dont believe myself that you got less then 20procs in 4 hours.

I'll have results of 4 combos of the weapons in the next 10hrs or so. i'll post them here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the real world, my mother in law bakes a kick ass apple pie, that totally smokes my moms pies.  <br />
<br />
But this is a digital game.  The same code that is on your BoC is the code on every other BoC in the game, period.  It theoretically cannot be broke.<br />
<br />
No matter the results of your parse, you percieve agro issues with your BoC, so I dont think a parse is going to change that.  My suggestion would be to sell it no matter what, and find something you feel comfortable with, because a parse telling you it proced 1 per minute isnt going to change your situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did a 386 minute (about 6 and a half hours) parse with EQ Companion and these are my results. There is an increase in proc rate compared to my previous parse of 45 minutes. This is with 36 percent haste, 197 Dex, Blasphemous Blade mainhand, Blade of Carnage offhand:<br />
<br />
Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled - 1047 procs = 2.71 procs per minute<br />
Blade of Carnage - 323 procs = 0.84 procs per minute<br />
Icicle Strike (aug on mainhand) - 626 procs = 1.62 procs per minute<br />
Heated Blade (aug on offhand) - 310 procs = 0.80 procs per minute<br />
<br />
DPS including DD procs was 78.30. DD procs accounted for 6.82 DPS.</div></div><hr />

So your result = 2,71 = around 40 % better procrate = the same the BF has in some tests in the past.<br />
<br />
For Offhandprocs there were rumors that they are fixed on the base of 80 dex so its irrelevant which dex you have they will always proc as if you have 80 dex.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone with 80 dex should make a mainhandtest and look if he will also have then 1 Proc / Minute with a normal proccing weapon.<br />
<br />
When I looked at your other parses I noticed that the augment on the BBotE has only a normal proc rate. Did this happen also in your last long parse ? That would documentate that the proc rate of augments is not a question of the weapon in which they would be done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay the following in HoH.<br />
<br />
Mobs were Level 62-63<br />
SoD/SoD proc rate parse <br />
65 warrior, offensive AAs, 70% haste, 290 dex<br />
<br />
Parse 1: SoD mainhand, SoD offhand<br />
<br />
40 minutes<br />
<br />
&quot;World dissolves into anarchy&quot; procs: 58 (1.45/minute)<br />
<br />
Some of these were 576 damage spell crit blasts also (ingenuity 3)<br />
<br />
Average DPS: 83.40<br />
<br />
But the Sod/Sod still produces more aggro than the BoC/Sod.<br />
1.  You have twice as much chance to interrupt stun.<br />
2.  You have more damage produced from procs.<br />
3.  You have more aggro from both the above 2 at same time.<br />
<br />
Also before I got this second SoD with one SoD in a group in LDoN with 2 wizards and a ranger all casting or throwing large crits at the mob I held the aggro.  With 2 its beautiful aggro on me. <br />
<br />
Look at aggro in a different context for a sec.  I view aggro in the following order outside of uber casters.<br />
<br />
Snare<br />
Slow<br />
Stun<br />
Hate<br />
<br />
Procs on weapons the same way. Snare, Slow, Stun, Hate Aggro Type.<br />
<br />
If you can't generate equal to more than 700 hate without a BoC anyway you are missing some AA points somewhere.<br />
<br />
And what does the SoD have that the BoC doesn't?<br />
<br />
0 sec interrupt stun and large amounts of spell proc damage if you have the right Offensive AA to help the weapon proc a lot and most important if you have the Defensive AA to stay alive until the Healer can heal ya.<br />
<br />
And whats the BoC have over the SoD outside of aggro?<br />
HP a bit more and dex and str a bit more.  By time you reach 65 your dex and str and sta will be maxed out so this isn't an issue so we are talking about what? 50hp?<br />
<br />
Anyway just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And whats the BoC have over the SoD outside of aggro? <br />
<br />
1) BoC has a better ratio 15/20 vs 12/18<br />
<br />
2) BoC has more hps as you said in your post<br />
<br />
3) Most importantly BoC LOOKS LIKE A SWORD NOT A CHICKEN LEG!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
A slight increase in DPS from procs might be nice for multi-boxing or when you are the source of DPS, but when it matters, the group/raid is going to have a MUCH larger increase in DPS from the MT getting better agro than you might get from the procs.<br />
<br />
given the choice between 2x SoD and BoC+CHSD I would take the latter every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
63 warrior<br />
191 dex, no offensive AAs, 36% haste<br />
BoC main hand, GBoS offhand<br />
<br />
Log start: Mon Oct 20 04:19:49 2003<br />
Log end: Mon Oct 20 18:41:51 2003<br />
Total log time: 14:22:02 (862 minutes)<br />
EB procs: 1360<br />
EB Procs/min: 1.57<br />
Force strike procs: 664<br />
Force strike procs/min: .77<br />
Combined procs/min: 2.34<br />
Melee damage: 3273064 (62.28 dps)<br />
Spell damage: 118856 (2.30 dps)<br />
Total damage: 3391920 (65.58 dps)<br />
<br />
Overall, the results are as expected. Here is a summary of main hand proc rates of several weapons from different people:<br />
<br />
BoC - 1.57 proc/min (Wandor, 14 hr parse)<br />
SoDx2 - 1.45 proc/min (Gigantuous, 40 min parse)**<br />
BBoE - 2.71 proc/min (Gerald, 6.5 hr parse)<br />
BoC - 1.39 proc/min (Brutul, 10 hr parse)<br />
BoC - 1.71 proc/min (Brutul, 45 min parse)<br />
SoD - 1.48 proc/min (Brutul, 46 min parse)<br />
BBoE - 2.42 proc/min (Gerald, 45 min parse)<br />
<br />
** This parse would probably have to be thrown out, that proc rate does not seem to match what one would expect for dual weilding SoDs. With the length of the parse, the margin of error would be pretty large, but that parse is a good illustration of the streaky nature of the RNG. I would imagine if that parse would have continued another 3-4 hours, the combined proc rate of 2x SoD would probably be closer to 2.25-2.5 proc/min (1.5 mainhand + .75 offhand).</div></div><hr />

<br />
PPM=Procs Per Minute<br />
<br />
<br />
Two Hander = 2ppm<br />
<br />
Single Hand Weapons<br />
<br />
One Hander alone or as part of duel wield set up = 1.5ppm<br />
Off Hander in duel wield set up = .75ppm<br />
Total 2.25ppm<br />
<br />
<br />
DPS:<br />
<br />
2Hander<br />
((damage X 2) plus bonus)) / delay = modal hit<br />
<br />
1Hander in main hand only no offhand<br />
((damage X 2) plus bonus)) / delay = modal hit<br />
<br />
1Hander in main hand and one in off hand<br />
MainHand DPS: (((damage X 2) plus bonus)) / delay) X 2/3 <br />
Offhand DPS: ((damage X 2) / delay) X 1/3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously the above, as to DPS, is incorrect as the duel wield does less DPS then just using a 1Hander weapon with no offhand weapon. What did I do wrong there?<br />
<br />
Are the above correct &quot;rules of thumb&quot;? I know htey are not accurate in all situations (i.e. some weapons proc more then others) but are they good for rough fast comparisons?</div></div><hr />

I find it strange that you guys only get 1.45 and 1.7 etc for SoD/BoC.  They 'should' be around 2.0 also.  Obviously a BF, HG, BBoE will be higher than 2.0.<br />

There are so many factors that will affect your DPS that you are wasting your time trying to guess how much damage a weapon will do in a real game situation. Something as simple where you are attacking from (front or back) can have a dramatic effect on the damage you do.</div></div><hr />

If weapon A and Weapon B prove superior to weapon C and Weapon D without augs, then adding the SAME AUGS to both sets of weapons will result in the same result.  It's simple algebra.<br />
<br />
If A + B &gt; C + D, then Ax +Bx &gt; Cx +Dx.<br />
