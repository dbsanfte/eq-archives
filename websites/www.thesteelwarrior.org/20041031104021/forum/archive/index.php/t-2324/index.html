I have bought a bunch of new items for my warrior and I am really enjoying him. here is my link. I am still looking for more items that are tradeable as he is only 32. <br />

Seriously, though...you really think the proc'ing of your copper hammer makes up for the horrible ratio at your level? I can appreciate an interest in impressing others with how great your gear is, but have some sense about it. And if you say it's for aggro purposes....I hardly recall aggro even being a consideration pre-50. <br />
<br />
Whatever. Just seems absurd to buy level restricted stuff well before you're able to use it, considering how quickly the prices collapse on things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">got the hammer very cheap and yes I really love the added proc. I hit harder with the hammer at 32 than I was when I had a frostbringer in offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TearsumRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about lvl 60 so that the majority of your gear will actually benefit you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that's about all that's left too...get to 60 so it actually does something for ya</div></div><hr />

Earring, get another BSEE atleast<br />
<br />
Face, Frightforged mask comes to mind<br />
<br />
Neck, Clattering Bone Necklace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">go after helm and gloves, dump the cobalt, get +HP, Myrmidons would be fine, or FH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">doh i forgot to add the new earrings i have had for a bit to my profile. thanks for the advice I will check into that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get some weapons that will actually do some damage at your level.  9/19 and 7/20 aren't really damaging weapons for you.  By the time you get that POS in your onhand to proc you could have had the mob killed and the slow would be unecessary.  And if you say you need aggro you should be hung upside down by your toenails.  At 32 your warrior with his gear should be soloing but even grouped you could hold aggro with a rusty spoon at that level.<br />
<br />
I think a Blade of Carnage and Scepter of Destruction should be the weapons you shoot for.  Good damage and aggro at your level, best of both worlds.</div></div><hr />
