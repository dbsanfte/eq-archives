<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys just had a quick question for anyone that wants to answer.  I don't remember the exact video card I got now but whenever I turn on new models it always shows that race without a BP.  Would that just be that I need a few video card that causes the problem or something else.  If I need a new card plus suggest a good one that works for you thanks :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try downloading the newest drivers for your video card.  To find out what video card you have go to:<br />
<br />
My Computer<br />
  Control Panel<br />
     System<br />
        Hardware Tab<br />
           from the hardware window click on Device Manager from there you will see of list of all you hardware installed on your computer.  Click on the Sound, video and game controllers and you Video Card should be there<br />
<br />
Just remeber to  uninstall the old video card drivers that you have first this can be done by going to Add/Remove software under the control panel.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this works or not</div></div><hr />

Luclin models + velious textures = invisible armor parts, usually the BP.</div></div><hr />

Let us know if this works or not Out of my curious nature, I went ahead and did this, seeing as how I'd been having some video card problems myself... and my video card wasn't listed there. edit: scratch that, it's listed under &quot;Display Adapters&quot; instead. dunno if that means anything but there ya go.<br />
<br />
 I have been having some problems with my brand new 128mb GeForce FX 5600 Ultra. Sometimes (it's brandnew, I don't know exactly when it happens yet, but it happened for the first time right after I installed it and was booting up for the first time and now, which is the second or third time (I'm pretty sure it's the second)). Anyway, what happened was that the monitor display was garbled with what looked like static except that I could still make out portions of the display. Also it restarted itself a few times until I logged in when it got to the login screen (I reached over from bed and hit the power button as I usually do then rolled back for a few min more of sleep but got up after I heard it restart itself 3 times). When I logged in, it was on 640x480 resolution with 4 bit color and wouldn't let me change that. At the suggestion of the troubleshooter (and I was gonna do this much anyway..) I went to nvidia.com and updated the driver, also I turned &quot;Normal Startup&quot; on by running &quot;msconfig&quot; (and now there's a million extra programs running hogging my CPU). The only suggestion I saw that I haven't tried is updating the BIOS for my motherboard. I have no idea how to do this and am a little worried about doing it because it says explicitly that nvidia won't be responsible for damages caused by flashing the BIOS. (p.s. what is &quot;flashing the BIOS&quot;?)<br />

My computer is a stock eMachines T4155. It came with 256mb RAM which I upgraded to 512. It used to have (came with) a 32mb GeForce 2 MX 200 and now it has the 128mb GeForce FX 5600 Ultra.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You might want to go into your bios and and see what the AGP apariture size is set at. I'm willing to be that its still set to 32mb. From my experience, and what I've read this number should be set to 2x the video card ram. Which in your case would be 256mb. I've had my 64mb card set to 128mb in the bios since I got it and have had 0 problems. If this doesn't fix it, there could be a whole host of other things going on like a bad AGP slot or video card. Sometimes they can be shipped defectively.<br />

You can run selective startup then go under the startup tab and click off the ones you know you don't want until you can trace down the one it seems to need. Look for ones that have Nv in the description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Firth.. now how exactly do I go about changing that setting in BIOS? I know it's something like F10 during boot up..<br />
<br />
I had taken most of those programs off of startup but one of the troubleshooting hints was using Normal Startup, so I did. Once I seem to get the problem figured out (hopefully with this BIOS thing) I'll go back to a selective startup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here is a problem I am having...<br />
<br />
EQ keeps crashing on me. The screen will lock up, such that even ctrl-alt-del wont work. It started when I  installed a gforce xfx 5200. <br />
<br />
since then..<br />
<br />
Reformatted x2<br />
Reinstalled Win XP<br />
downloaded all Win XP updates<br />
downloaded all current drivers for Sound and video.<br />
downloaded direct x 9.b<br />
updated the agp driver for amd 751 chipset<br />
<br />
i have a Gigabyte MB 7iex4<br />
athlon 1000<br />
768 mb ram<br />
60 GB hd<br />
SB Live<br />
<br />
This started with the xfx 5200, since then I have tried a two different gforce 2's and a geforce 4 mx440. All of them have the problems with locking up. Its completely random, can occur on character select or after 14hrs of gameplay. Sometimes can use ctrl-alt-del to get that stupid eq crash window, mostly I have to hard boot the computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">very old / weak power supply?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">350 watt power supply... <br />
<br />
the problem is that it didnt do this Before the new card and now it DOES with the old card..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks Firth.. now how exactly do I go about changing that setting in BIOS? I know it's something like F10 during boot up.. <br />
<br />
That's how to get to a DoS prompt in Win98- and doesn't work with XP. To get to your bios mash delete during the beginning part of the start-up.<br />

Landrain:<br />
Have you uninstalled the new video drivers before swapping back to your old card? There can be a conflict with the newer driver and your system bios. When was the last time you flashed/updated the bios? Other than that it could also be heat that causes the random lock-ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i increased the agp aperture.. 7 hrs no lock up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Baadan go to the forums at www.pcmech.com they can help you out more than I can.  How recently did you upgrade your RAM</div></div><hr />
