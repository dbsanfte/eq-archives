<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I currently have a hategiver in main and epic in offhand.  Me and my friends have a really nice group but not doing the guild thing much anymore.  Are there any nice aggro weapons that drop off one groupable named that are actually killable with a single well balanced group and not with charm or any such tactic.  Thank you for your replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you read any of the other posts about weapons you'll notive a trend of Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn. Both drop in Droga and are one groupable. They both proc dd/stun and are excellent for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I guess I was hoping for something a little better then bazzar sold 10k weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What makes you think that just because they're bazaar sold 10k weapons they must not be good?  Until recently the GSoT was buyable for 50pp in the bazaar, and it's arguably a better aggro weapon than the 2h epic.  Droga weapons are better than the 1h epic.  If you want 1 groupable aggro weapons, they're about as good as it gets.  Anger aug them and they're really, really good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wish there were a variety of weapons that were similar to those two, so that warriors were more unique in the weapons they use, but the reality is those two weapons are the best single groupable weapons you can get.  There are some decent drops in BoT, the disemboweler is essentially a 15/20 (+3 magic dmg), which makes it a better ratio than the SotB or CHoS, but it has no proc, which makes it inferior aggro.  The wind-worn handblade is also a better ratio at 12/18 and has a proc, but the proc is a dd and therefore is not good aggro.  However, if you really want to be different you could get one of those two weapons and anger aug them, but....  they are also 10-20k bazaar weapons, just not quite as common.  I saw a 16/20 recently, gemmed velium sword or some such, but no idea where it comes from...  that is a very nice ratio and with an anger proc would rock, but no idea where it comes from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never said they werent good.  I just said I was hoping for better.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe I'll save up and get a BoC for offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only real alternative for a single group encounter would be to get the really nice LDoN weapons and fully aug them.  Would take a while, but at least you'd be somewhat unique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I should have mentioned that the Avatar of War has been 1-grouped on Prexus, so you could get a BoC if you find talented enough people.</div></div><hr />

Velium Gemmed Long Sword (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=58898) is one of the new player smithed weapons (GoD recipe (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=11561&amp;menustr=080100320040)).  Very pretty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Einride could be one grouped in BoT, Great Blade of Storms I think will be about as good as you can get one grouped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i agree on GBoS. that's probably the best you can get, but you may want to consider taking more than 1 group to make it run smoother. only other options i can think of would be the club of the mad researcher (15/20) or that sword from mistmore (14/19, cant remember the name). both can be boosted with the +2 damage aug, a proc, and a type 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Curse Smelted Long Blade, and it's from Guk, not MMC.  1150 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the GBoS is very good for aggro, it is the only agro weapon i have atm ... am working on getting anger 3.  i off hand a shortblade of lightning with a 75 DD proc from EF.  though not the best agro combo, i have no problems holding agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EQLiquidslow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">GBoS can be one grouped by ele geared people... or I know on many servers towers are raided by pickups. GBoS is a great weapon, arguably better agro than BoC, and stick an anger aug on there and it'll be all you need. Also could consider a Cord Hilted Spike Driver... off xana. Xana can be killed by a small raid and is very easy. Once again an anger aug on it plus your hategiver will be more than enough.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">GBoS. can be done with 1-2 groups. not sure on drop rate but it's not horrible. would be cool to see a ornate bp there too. gbos easily the best bet</div></div><hr />

one groupable in veksar. if you want to be different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">wow, that weapon had endur added to it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">maybe the database has been updated. didn't think it had it last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Malkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks for the great replies.    We are going to try to get the GBoS most likely.</div></div><hr />
