<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think I messed up!  Tell me, is the bind wound AA worth it?  I mean the lvl 51 version.<br />
<br />
I'm level 52 and I spent a point in it over the weekend.  I'm regretting the investment.<br />
<br />
Reason why I did this was that I solo in CC a lot just gathering materials for my thurgadin gate potions.  So, after many a moment sitting in CC wishing I could bind wound past 50% got to me and I turned on alt exp again, gained a level, and dumped that point into bindwound.<br />
<br />
Now that the clarity of the work week has hit me, I'm thinking I made a mistake.<br />
<br />
1.) both the thurgadin and ss quest breatplates pretty much make bind wound obsolete, right?  I intend to get both, or at least champ bp.  Doesn't the invigorate right click make bind wound a thing of the past?  Couldn't I always tote the BP around in my rallic pack and throw it on when I need to heal if I one day get something better than the camp bp?<br />
<br />
2.) I just found out that, at lvl 57, we get the ability to bind wound to 70% with the advent of 201 skill.  You also, or so I've heard, heal for 80 hp per bandage with 201 skill.  No AA required, just skill and level 57.<br />
<br />
So, I'm sitting here thinking I just wasted an AA point and a weekend of EXP grinding.  Is this the case?  Any input is appreciated. Thanks for setting me straight!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you spend alot of time soloing, then there is no reason to think that you wasted a point. <br />
<br />
Yes you will be able to bind wound to 70% with 201 skill, but did you consider that it is cumulative? Now with 201 skill and 1 AA you can bind to 80%<br />
<br />
Another thing, have you seen the casting time on the BP's? I don't know, but with alot of AA you can heal more then 100Hp a bandaid easy, combined with an embalmer's skinning knife to proc bandages, and you can solo on your own merits very nicely.<br />
<br />
At my current level (38) I know I don't have any experience with AA, but I can tell you that soloing in EW would not be possible without bind wound (currently 174) as I woudl go insane from the boredom of sitting there waiting on HP to regen. With my Embalmer's skinning knife, I never have to worry about running out of bandages either.<br />
<br />
A few thoughts from an otherwise tired halfling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you get 201 skill in BW yes you can bandage up to 70% and it does about 80 some points with the skill maxed. I think this happens at 57 but I cant remember right now. <br />
<br />
Is putting the AA into BW worth it? It depends on how much you solo and what youre fighting. If youre killing greenies to farm stuff I dont see the need to put it into BW, youre probably better off going with regen since the mobs wont really be hitting you too hard. I know I was farming HHK guards before Regen3 and after Regen3 and I noticed much less downtime. If youre xping then yes BW is probably the way to go to eliminate downtime and give you less risk of death in the long run. Personally I dont solo to often so BW wasnt the best choice of AA for me so I went with Run3 and Regen3 like everyone else. <br />
<br />
If you have a Velious BP then there really isnt a need to invest in general BW AA. Just BW up to max then heal yourself the rest of the way. However, I did read somewhere that bandages heal more over time than a Velious BP.<br />
<br />
So it really just depends on how you spend majorty of your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zethallon</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Responding to Molgar's original questions:<br />
<br />
1)  I have a BP that has the ability to heal and I hardly use it.  The reuse time on the spell is so ridiculous that it's not even worth the effort.  <br />
<br />
2)  Even at level 52, if you have your bind wound maxed for your level, you will still get in several bw's long before your timer resets to cast the bp heal.  I have 210 bind would skill and heal about 88 hitpoints a bind (more if the person is sitting down with a good regen). <br />
<br />
Although I personally would recommend Run before the First Aid skill, it's basically down to whatever you want.  Since you've been utilizing the skill while in CC, it sounds like you put in a place where you're getting the use for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check out Regens also.  If you solo all the time, a good regen would help you along nicely.<br />
<br />
You can get Regen up to lvl 3, and also invest in some sort of regen BP.  Fungi might be too expensive, but an Iksar Regen BP would help you greatly.  <br />
<br />
With Bind Wound skill Max, Regen 3, Bind Wound 3, and wearing a regen BP you would regain HP's in a snap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used the bind wound AAs to help me solo alot when I was 60 pre-pop.  Here is an added tip -- while you are binding wounds, put on a regen BP (fungi if you can find one).  BTW:  Even when you can bind to 100% (I can do this), you tend not to -- it isn't overly efficient to bind to 100% if you can fight at 90% or 80% and not die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I don't feel so bad now.  MY attitude has been to do only run3 until lvl 65.   I did my run three at the very beginning of 51, then turned back to regular exp.<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure about the regen ability.  I mean, come on, 3hp more per tick?  Is that really worth it?  I don't see it reducing my downtime all that much.  I must not understand regen3.<br />
<br />
I really don't solo that much.  I mostly play with my wife who is a cleric.  I don't particularly care about having 'Baron' in front of my name, either.<br />
<br />
I don't solo for exp unless I'm waiting on my wife to run back to where we are fighting.  The only thing I really do solo is CC for the velium.  So all of this fretting, for me, is over the darned gate potions, really.  Hehe.<br />
<br />
The cast time on the campion BP is 14.  Bind wound takes what, 8 or 9 seconds?  So close.  The reuse time on the bp was news to me though.  Does anyone know if, other than the 14 second cast time, is there any other limitations to the bp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took BindWound as my aa choice after Run3, and I have not regretted it.  Regen 3 gives you 3 per tick... which helps how much?  True, you aren't constantly binding wounds like you do regen, but when you do, with max skill you BW 60 per tick... it helps a lot recovering after rezzes if the cleric doesn't have to heal everyone and can just med.  I have a gauze press, carry around batteries to recharge it, and always have 60ish bandages on hand... because you never know when you will have to recover from a group wipe, and not having to cast half a dozen heals will definately help get back on your feet faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cast time on the campion BP is 14.

<br />
No, BP cast doesn't have a recast time, so it can be chained.  You basically gain 100hp every 14 seconds.  It's nice, but it's not as nice as I thought it would be when I was your level.<br />
<br />
As soon as I got my bind wound to 201 and could bind to 70%, I rarely used my BP...only to get from 70-100%.  Bind wound time is either 10 or 12 seconds, but at 210 I believe you heal 84hp per bandage.  I was also constantly wearing my fungi tunic...so 15hpx2 + 84hp per bandage is 114hp in 10 or 12 seconds or so, compared to 100 with an invigorate BP.<br />
<br />
So yes, bind wound is always useful, and you did not waste a point.</div></div><hr />

Though, you might become like me, I basically got too lazy to bind wound and just use my bp full time =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You made a good choice IMO dont lose any sleep over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont think 3 poitns is not worth it. 3 points of regen means your always regenning that little bit extra - sitting standing fighting etc. it helps in downtime, it can help over the course of longish fights. and its always there. no need to buy bandages etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not really replying to original poster but since ppl are bashing regen AA I have to step up. It hands down AA if you are a troll or iksar regening 40-50 hp a tick is great. Plus regen works while you are fighting so lets say during 1 minute fight its like having extra 30 hp - 1 halas meat pie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, i'm not bashing regen AA, not by any means.  I actually have 4 points of regen AA because it does add up and it 1hp/tick is 1hp/tick.  Over the course of a minute long fight, 3 AA of regen is an extra 30hp.  That's 3 extra HP that you're getting every tick that you're not full health.  Is it huge?  No.  Does it help?  Yes.  <br />
<br />
The question really was &quot;Is first aid useful?&quot; and the answer to that is yes too.  Just because first aid is useful doesn't make regen not useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyMT</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i maxed the class bandage wound skill and i plan on getting both levels of the pop ability one too.  its just one of those things that winds up handy.<br />
<br />
with the medic pouch (+10% bind wound) i get around 140hp per bandaid.  its easily better than invigorate bp, especially when i use fungi bp.<br />
<br />
one thing i never got around to getting was the +10% bind wound chloroplast heart thing from fungus grove.  anyone know if it even still drops?  would love to get it for two-fisted bandaging action :p<br />
<br />
edit: without the medic pouch its around 130hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks everyone!  The input has been digested and very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
As an aside (sorry in advance for derailing) I'd like to say I'm very pleased with the attitude of my warrior brothers.  I found that the wizard community, although active as well, tended to whine and flame at any excuse they could find.  I hate to make blanket generalizations like that, but I can't help but to notice how different the warrior community is.  Truly helpful, calm, collected, and willing to give sound advice lacking the typical self centered spin I would normally see in the wizard forum I used to frequent (graffe's).  Thank you again for all the help you've given!<br />
<br />
EDIT: I was discribing this difference to a RL friend who plays EQ as well, and his was response was &quot;what do you expect, they are warriors, they don't needlessly bitch and whine as much as other classes,&quot; lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dandolo1</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was a Bind Wound Warrior back in my mid-50's too.  If you partner with a shammy alot, it really aids with their mana pool = more kills = more exp.<br />
<br />
Toss in the fact that these Shammies will wub you for slapping bandages during downtime, and you'll never have to look far for exp again.<br />
<br />
Plus, you can roll into newbie zones, bind these guys to 100% and have them oooh and aaaah over your *mad skillz*, haha.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bridgecrusher</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing that's very useful with the bind wounds AA (I have first aid 3 and bandage wounds 1) is during recovery from a wipeout or close call on raids.<br />
<br />
Normally as a warrior you'd be sitting around twiddling your thumbs.  With this AA you can either patch up folks who are low on health, or better yet help out casters who convert hp -&gt; mana.<br />
<br />
Shamans were suggested earlier as good candidates, but necros will really love you for it.  A necro with their best lich type spell up, perhaps bard song, and you patching their health can twitch all the time.  Its pretty insane mana regen.</div></div><hr />

I have been at 199 for awhile now, and was wondering if 199 was max for this level, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best advantage of bandaging over the bp effect is that you can heal others with the bandages, where the bp is self only.  Both are useful, it is just a matter of preference.  I usually use the bp on myself, but use bandages on others in the group if it is called for, however being the puller most of the time, I am usually out pulling while they are doing their thing so neither method gets used too often.</div></div><hr />
