<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksign</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a parsable difference to shown AC from mitigation vs shown ac from avoidance?<br />
<br />
For example.<br />
<br />
Test 1<br />
<br />
AGI is brought down to 75 or so<br />
Items are manipulated to get shown AC of X<br />
Fight<br />
Parse<br />
<br />
Test 2<br />
<br />
AGI is brought up to 305 or so<br />
Items are manipulated to get shown AC of X (exactly the same shown as Test 1, may take some finagaling)<br />
Fight<br />
Parse<br />
<br />
(common sense would dictate that for Test 2, if AC shown was same, then mitigation total of items would have to fall)<br />
<br />
Would you get hit alot less often? How much more would you get hit for on average? Would your defense skills fire more often? Would the mobs DPS be lower, same or higher?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only problem I see with this is that you are assuming that the only Avoidance checks are based on agility. This is not the case at all - in fact, the effects of AGI on your displayed AC value are quite small.<br />
<br />
When you equip a piece of armor (say raw AC 10 for argument's sake), your displayed AC goes up by more than just 10. If I remember correctly, the raw 10 AC is added to your mitigation, and the extra value is avoidance (which is why monks gain more displayed AC for equipping an item with the same raw ac stat). How much AC you gain in avoidance is determined by your class and Defense skill.<br />
<br />
In theory, if you did manage to tweak your numbers so you got the same displayed AC with different levels of avoidance and mitigation, it should average out to be nearly identical in terms of damage taken over time. That's why they simplified the displayed value in the first place.</div></div><hr />

This was before AA and gear that max all stats, so a orge would have a big hp advantage but still a wood elf would win.</div></div><hr />
