<br />
There is a post somewhere stating that he will respawn if we keep the guardian up. the only problem is as soon as a mob dropped, no matter where we were on the island, the guardian just up and aggroed.<br />
<br />
Any idea's on keeping the guardian up and unaggroed to get a second shot at the Spiroc lord without looking foreward to going there 15 separate times?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Camp out to clear aggro from the guardian.  Every time it happens.  Someone will probably have to be the sacrificial lamb each time you do this.<br />
<br />
Your people must be prepared to die a lot, or there is no point in visiting this island.<br />
<br />
Keeping a rezzer camped out is a nice safety measure, especially with a smaller force.<br />
<br />
I've heard that pacification worked to prevent guardian aggro.  But I've also head that pacification was disabled in this entire zone.  So I'm not sure if this tool will be of any help today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently (early january) went to Sky and farmed spiroc blades for our guild and had no problems with agroing the guardian.  We probably killed him about 20 times this way, and the guardian on the other side of the island never agroed during the lord, or any other bird pull/kill.  We were constantly moving our camp between two different locations too, because Sirran would always be at one of them and we did not want to agro him on the next pull, and both the spots we pulled to were free of guardian argo.  Maybe your base spots were too close to the guardian, or maybe some kind of chain-agro got to him, or maybe they changed it since I was there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylexis</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was considering a sacrifical tank and memblur, during clearing I had him off tanked for about 5 minutes until he was the last mob, i was going to mem blur and then die once I was the only one with aggro, but it was already past 1am.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if he is in fact mem blurable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did this last month with my old guild to get wingblades for a couple of warriors. I died like 10 times or better.. no biggie with a cleric there to rez. <br />
<br />
Placement is important. And camping out worked well for us to clear agro.  The coolest thing was, you could tell if the Spiroc Lord was holding the wingblade. It's a fat sword in his hand.  We had to kill him several times for it to drop. At least 2 DT's on each fight, sometimes 3 or 4. I would take the second one and have him to around 50-60%. <br />
<br />
Now that you keep the island keys, it's a lot of fun for a couple of high end/non-elemental groups. We had 2 groups in a mix of 50/50 level 65 and level 55-65's.  Enchanter's a must have there.</div></div><hr />

You don't lose the keys when you zone out anymore?<br />
<br />
It would be great if you could just invis all the way to island 5.</div></div><hr />

And hey!  I wanna go too, for the obvious reason.  It's the very very last thing I have to do, and maybe I can drag along a person or two to help as well.<br />

<br />
I visited Sky again a few days ago, (2/27) and using just VoQ and a mount, I was able to recast Pacification on the Guardian every 20 seconds and kept him unaggroed for the duration of the clearing.  We tried using a bard, but he got resisted fairly soon, and I had to take over.<br />
<br />
Also, for Sirran, just pull Lord a good ways back the first time.  Once Sirran pops, appoint a &quot;lucky&quot; monk to pull him away.  This also worked beautifully.  Once Sirran is over near the clearing camp, he's not a problem.  Then kill Lord a bit closer to his camp (since his actual aggro range is tiny, this is safe.  It's the assist range thats bad)<br />
<br />
We forgot to do it, but I've heard that if you have someone hail Sirran, it resets his 20 min despawn timer, so have someone run over and hail him after each fight, and he's safely out of your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you get to keep the keys now. They are taking up space in my bank.. ;p<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you can use the key for Isle 5 on the first teleporter and get to Isle 5, but that would be pretty awesome.<br />
I imagine with PoSky being the time-sink it once was, they are trying to make it so you only have to work your way through the isles once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Azaracks don't see invis, so if you have the keys, you can just run up to island 5.  I am not sure whether spirocs see invis (I think the lord is close to the next portal pad so this could be an issue), but I recall that bee island doesn't see invis.  Nice change, especially for mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this a years ago, so I'm not sure if it will still work out the same way.  But we just killed the guardian when he came into camp... over and over again.  Just like the Spiroc Lord repopping over and over if the guardian is up, the guardian would repop over and over if any of the other birds were still alive and &quot;unaggroed&quot;.<br />
<br />
We kept killing him over and over, till we were down to one bird.  The guardian stopped respawning cause someone had aggro on that last bird out there still.  Everyone camped out and came back to clear aggro, and pop went the guardian.  Killed the final bird, and we were left with the guardian and Spiroc Lord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylexis</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats alot of camping 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wouldn't say it was a lot of camping.  We all only camped once.<br />
<br />
Camped out when there were 2 birds left on the island... the Spiroc Lord and one of the lesser birds.  The act of camping made the guardian respawn (cleared aggro someone had on that lesser bird).  We killed the lesser bird and then farmed the Spiroc Lord without any further trouble from the Guardian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylexis</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wouldn't leaving the lesser bird up cause a trio to respawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only if it was a vanquisher that was up.  His two buddies would then respawn yeah.  We had all vanquishers dead, and only had the one buddy bird and the Lord left when we camped.</div></div><hr />
