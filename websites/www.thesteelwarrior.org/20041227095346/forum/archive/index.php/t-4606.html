I guess they will have a greater cost than provoke (even at 25 provoke cost was minimal) but a greater effect.<br />
<br />
so every melee is getting a line of ability not tied to the opening system.<br />
<br />
Warrior a range aggro.<br />
Monks a pulling tool.<br />
Rogues a sneak attack.<br />
<br />
Let them tweak with those, we'll bitch on the live versions anyway :).</div></div><hr />

It's a 30sec recast at level 65, but a 10:30 recast at 25??</div></div><hr />

<br />
100 hate is just not significant.  It won't pull aggro off of anyone that has hit the mob once, even if you sit afterwards.  With that much hate it's not much more than a pulling toy, and at 100 range it's not much good for that either.  It was not the least bit overpowered in it's original form, and should go back the way it was.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ONLY reason we need something like provoke in the first place is to split up multiple mobs on the incomming.   The reason knights are so nice currently is because when the monk comes charging in with 2-3 mobs, they can get them nice and split up on the inc.   <br />
<br />
A warrior on the other hand has a hard time with this.  They run up to fight, and 2-3 mobs end up hitting them simultaneously - resulting in one dead warrior.    100 aggro is more then enough to cause the mob to bee line for the warrior, seperate from the crowd, and give the warrior a nice head start on aggro generation.<br />
<br />
People we DO NOT WANT aggro control to become completely trivial in everquest.   What knights can do is BAD for the game, not good.   Six months from now do you want to be saying &quot;Yea man, i remember when casters and healers used to have to control their aggro&quot;?</div></div><hr />

If this is all Provoke is for, the 100 range makes it damn hard to even be useful for that. I get 200+ with bow and arrow.<br />
<br />
100 agro is a joke. The only way for it to be useful is if it can outagro the first 15s of debuffing in an xp group, which would require it to be more like 200 agro up front and then another 500 agro over time.<br />
<br />
Can you still use it to pull a mob off pets? If it'll do that alone, it'll be useful for raids, but it ain't a general fix for warrior agro problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
doesnt do anymore for your initial aggro then you would <br />
<br />
have gotten from the inc bow shot and mobs still have the same <br />
<br />
likelyhood of jumping your debuffers as before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless, if you have issues gettin initial aggro, or you need to <br />
<br />
try and get aggro lock as swiftly as possible, perhaps look into <br />
<br />
getting a Featherwood bow + ykesha aug.  (of course scale down <br />
<br />
bow per level/bank account but honestly can get the cheap aug <br />
<br />
its bout the same aggro) and more often then not you will have <br />
<br />
nice aggro on incoming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">an arrow or two is not nearly enough to convince your average ldon raid mob to break out of primarily-proximity behavier.    Not to mention you often don't have that luxery of 200 range line of sight.<br />
<br />
Other than in the first 10 seconds, there IS NO warrior aggro problem.  Even at 100 hate, provoke should be enough to balance the situation.<br />
<br />
But hey, if you are in the crowd that wants shamans to be able to slow mobs on the inc, i guess we have to agree to disagree.   I am of the opinion that other classes SHOULD have to watch their aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100 hate is not enough to split up mobs.  It needs to be significantly more.  At least a stuns worth of hate. YOu get 100 hate from one miss of vanazir.  Which certainly is not enough to split mobs up.  It won't solve anything at 100 hate.  THis mostly applies to raid level mobs though.  They typically have coding which tends to give a bonus to people in their agro range.  This helps to prevent a lot of pinging around and allows clerics to heal fairly quickly and not be instagibbed as long as they are out of range of the mob.<br />
<br />
Even at 500 hate with a 30-60 second reuse you won't have the agro capabilities of a pally, and this skill will mostly be used on the incoming to seperate mobs.  If you have a mob loose in camp you are better off going knight or just use taunt to get it at that point.</div></div><hr />

^^Basically.<br />
<br />
They need to sit down around a table and talk this out. What is the purpose of Provoke?<br />
<br />
(1) It is a pulling tool.<br />
<br />
(A) At 100 range, it is not a pulling tool. 100 Range is well within the frenzy radius of MANY MANY mobs.<br />
<br />
(2) It is a tool to gain aggro and build up hate.<br />
<br />
(A) At 165 hate and 1 or 2 hate per tick for 1 minute, you would be better off using your fists to gain hate. This is not a hate tool.<br />
<br />
So, what is Provoke supposed to be then? What's the purpose of the ability? Currently, at 100 range and 165 hate, it has no purpose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then it must be deleted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been raiding with it all weekend and it is definitely not enough to split mobs off of the puller (most of the time), or to pull an undead mob through a group of people...hell half the time even a non undead mob won't pass somebody sitting down after being &quot;provoked&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am still using it some for pulling, but really, it's hardly worth greying out my other abilities for a minute.  Furor is exactly right, if it's a pulling tool, they should make it 200 range.  If it's an aggro tool they should make it at least 250 hate.  I hardly thing 40% of an EB proc every 30 seconds is overpowered...even if they made it cost a third of your endurance bar it would be better than it is now.<br />
<br />
It's a great idea, but it's really too weak to be very useful in the level 65 game at least.  I was very excited about it when I first trained it, but after using it for a few days, it is very underwhelming.</div></div><hr />

First of all, that's not how it works. Taunt and Provoke have two totally different functions.<br />
<br />
If you successfully taunt a messed mob, you aren't going to need Provoke. Additionally, at 165 hate every 30 seconds, one thing you won't be doing by using Provoke is aggro locking. That much hate is negligible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">YOu guys are underselling yourselves. What would be so imabalancing for a warrior to generate the hate of one stun or terror of terris every 30 seconds on demand?<br />
<br />
It should be 500-700 hate.  Range of 100 is fine.  That much hate still isn't more than 15-20% of what a warrior can generate on his own each minute.  This won't trivialize anything.  Anything that needs defensive to tank is easy to establish agro on.  Anything that doesn't need defensive a knight can tank just as well as a warrior and they get to throw high taunt spells around like there is no tomorrow.  500-700 hate isn't going to break a damn thing.  It won't give you agro lock on mezzed mobs, you are still going to need a taunt.  While a knight can taunt, then stun/fear, then break mez and the next stun/fear will get the mob off of whoever.  A warrior will only have one provoke to use so they will still have to rely on taunt.<br />
<br />
If they are all that worried about increasing long term hate generation of a warrior they could give it a splurt like deagro effect.  1000 initial agro decaying to 300 agro over 30 seconds. Slow at first and faster at the end.<br />
<br />
But I don't think they are that worried about long term agro generation of a warrior.  500-700 hate every 30 seconds isn't anymore than a hate proc on the primary weapon would give you.</div></div><hr />

What game are you playing in?  Pallys have instant agro for slows on incomming and no drawbacks to go with that.  If we can't get instant agro on incomming, we will not get groups.  Double my DPS and the cleric, shammy, wizard will still take the &quot;safe&quot; pally tank.  I think classes should have to control their own agro, but Sony doesn't and has already broken the game.  I just wanna be able to do my job.<br />

<br />
That used to be the balance of warriors. We had enough of a tanking advantage that it was worth going with our reduced agro abilities.<br />
<br />
Today, mudflation has made the tanking advantage minimal and increased agro a requirement. If Sony had upgraded our agro abilities as they upgraded the nukes and dots in the game, and had kept our HP advantage at a fixed percentage, there likely would be no problem.</div></div><hr />

Actually, there is a long thread on this board on the subject of how taunt works, which can found here: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=1811&amp;highlight=taunt<br />
The gist of it all appeared to be that agro = hate + something else, where that something else was a combination of the rampage list, proximity, etc. In other words a successfull taunt might not put you at the top of the agro list even though it puts you at the top of the hate list. Brutul started the thread, perhaps he could comment further on it - I haven't been following the thread lately - perhaps they have come to different conclusions now. Now, assuming that the tests in the thread are valid, the implication is that when you are breaking mez by hitting the mob, with the sorts of weapons that you and I have, a successful strike will usually overcome that difference, so it wouldn't be something thats particularly important to us. But, if you are level 20, which is the level this ability is first used, things would be very different since there would be a good chance that you might not hit hard enough on the first strike to overcome that &quot;something else&quot;.<br />
<br />
As to the use of the ability in general, I think it is intended as a move of finesse - a subtle thing you do at the appropriate time to swing things in the direction you want. Those with skill will find uses for it. Not everything has to be a sledgehammer to work you know :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
