<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you were going to 3 box GoD content and had time geared characters with 400+ aa's  what would be the best in your opinion? <br />
<br />
I'm stuck between<br />
<br />
warrior, cleric, druid<br />
warrior, cleric, shaman<br />
warrior, cleric, beastlord<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for those with any input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd Say shaman hands down.  Haste, Slow, Dots, and Buffs will combine with the warrior and Cleric VERY nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am not in GoD content by far. But I have 3 boxed my war and shaman along with my wife's alt cleric. This is a very nice combo. DPS is a bit low but for makes for nice steady exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman or BL<br />
<br />
BL can do plenty of slows, decent buffs, and most importantly good dps.<br />
<br />
Shaman is nice for better buffs, but I believe lower dps. However, can backup heal very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why not an enchanter? I do my enchanter,cleric, and warrior. Charm a DC pet. Nice to have crowd control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd go with Warrior, Cleric and Chanter....<br />
<br />
Then toss in 3 wizards for dps.<br />
<br />
Then you'd have the same set up as me heh... (cept my guys are like 200AA bazzar gear...doh)<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate color cloud (8 second pbaoe stun up to level 65 mobs) that is a solid spell fro chanters in GoD. Also the ability to mez on over pulls, and the speed of vallon to up yur warrior dps, and rune of zeb can be like a heal sometimes. And naturally voq to help the cleric mana. And charm pookas! AND overwhelming speldor makes yur DI go off more in yur warrior or cleric AND you can pacify without much risk of the mobs attacking on failure (cause chanter Charisma is usually maxed unlike cleric).... Chanters bring a lot to the table. And can nuke also...... and slow, and dc charm...</div></div><hr />
