Can anyone give me some info on where he stands compared to some mobs? For example, Telk or Gozz. Or if you can do mob_001 you can do the veksar dragon.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help, looked at alla and all it said was &quot;yeah we killed him with ## last night!&quot; blah blah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had some friends do him, they compared him to rage.  Dunno how acruate that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya might want to ask the folks from MoKB. They took him down last Friday with the help of some Faed folks, but that was after they wiped trying him both Wed and Thurs nights.<br />
<br />
But he seems to have some nice loot, Dardori got a 25 AC, like 80 HP and a bunch of other stats range item from him and dont know what else he dropped. From all I have heard the hardest part of him seems to be his Melee range box is the size of a small skeleton and ya have to be in melee range to land spells. So most folks spend a good part of the fight looking at out of range messages, or having spells resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard he's kinda like Trak, a little tougher, and with disease DoTs or something I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would also appreciate a little assistance on where the items drop to start the quest.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I am just going in on Monday to check it out, either way, so dont spoil if you dont want to...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">could a guild that does vindi,ds,rc and SoL take this guy out with 18-24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">24 yes :)<br />
<br />
Have you killed Trak for the Undead Bard portion of Bard Epic?<br />
<br />
This guy is apparently hitting for 990 (Trak 700+) and he is casting an AE disease dot that is 100 hps per tick.<br />
<br />
He has more hps than Trak Apparently. So bring that 65 MGB cleric you talked about in the POI dragon thread, and have him MGB the appropriate heals about a minute or two into the fight.<br />
<br />
Keep the Aggro on the Main Assist.<br />
<br />
The Dragon is slowable, as well.<br />
<br />
Then just work the boy down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hackhuis</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed him last night, had about 20 folks, level 65, no VT or Elemental gear.<br />
<br />
Quad 990 without defensive but very few maximum hits...most around 700 or so. We couldnt get him slowed but didnt have a shaman so maybe its possible. Have everyone max shrink and find a corner and lock him down, casters also in melee range so getting him locked into corner helped us alot. He has an ae for 650dd and 100per tick I think, cold-based, I resisted most with CoS and bard song. Tons of hps but with decent healing and good MT agro its a pretty straightforward fight.<br />
<br />
He dropped 2 pairs of the 42ac 70hp leggings for us.</div></div><hr />
