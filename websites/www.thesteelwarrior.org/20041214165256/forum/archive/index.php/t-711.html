<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I was wondering if anyone had a link or maybe has done some research on this themselves?  <br />
<br />
What I am looking for is how many HP's you get for each point of stamina under the following conditions....<br />
Level 65 <br />
<br />
======================================<br />
Conditions               HP per 1 Sta<br />
======================================<br />
No AA's                  6.36 <br />
ND1                      6.5<br />
ND2                      6.68<br />
ND3                      7<br />
ND3, PE                  7.12<br />
ND3, PD1                 7.08<br />
ND3, PD2                 7.18<br />
ND3, PD3                 7.3<br />
ND3, PD1, PE             7.2<br />
ND3, PD2, PE             7.32<br />
ND3, PD3, PE             7.42<br />
<br />
Mainly looking for someone to confirm my numbers, as they are only based from Magelo by changing the AA's and remocing/adding a 50 Sta item (Katana of Pain).  I figured the best way to see every change accurately was to change the HP as much as possible, and being the item with the most Sta in the game it fit the bill =)<br />
<br />
Also on a side note WTF  is up with these GD VBcodes..i follow thier rules and my center and indent tags aren't working....why can't these people just fuggin use HTML? Well I am sure I am missing some fundamental piece of info as to why my code is broken. Someone plz drop a line here as to how retarded I am thx =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulfur</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious where you found rules for the Indent and Center tags. In the help page these 2 are not listed, so I would assume they are not defined for this forum, also you can only indent whole paragraphs (like with the Quote tag), it is not the same as tab.<br />
<br />
seems the best way to add this kind of tabulated data is just to use the 'code' tag and copy the preformated text from a text editor like word or notepad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">mmm afaik 1 sta, without AA, at lvl 60+ for wariors = lvl/10 hps... based on the formula Magelo uses.<br />
<br />
so in your table, it should be 6.5 hp per sta without AA <br />
<br />
besides that ...<br />
ND1 = +2% , ND2= +5% ; ND3=+10% , PE = +2% ( ie 12% with ND3 ), ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, IIRC, the formula for HP per Sta point changes when sta &gt; 255?<br />
<br />
From memory, it was 6.5 hp per sta pre 255, and 4 hp per sta post 255?<br />
<br />
Please give my statement the maximiun sceptism you have, as I never actually tested this myself to see. I do know that with Draconic Paldrons (12sta, 0 HP), raid buffed, i have 280 sta (capped for now...) and that then, Legionnerre Scale Paldrons (0sta, 35hp) I have 275 sta and more HP. Which shouldn't be the case if the formula doesn't change post 255.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the 6.5 and 4 number I quoted were from someone elses post I read when I was level 60, and that was many beers ago, so I may misremember, and even if I remember correct, I don't know they are right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh , yeah , forgot that one too : <br />
1 sta over 255 = half a sta point under 255<br />
<br />
that mean when u reach 255, return for sta become half what it was.... so lvl/20 for warriors 60+ without AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went out to the site that hosts these boards, and thats where I found the center and indent codes =/  I think the problem is that these two codes have not been enabled on this board.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a chart with the accurate Sta to HP for 65 wars?  Or maybe a formula? hehe thx for the help....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tamener : the formula i gave to ya for warriors over lvl 60 is based on Magelo formula for total HP calculation( if i did my math correctly at least :) )<br />
so i repeat : lvl/10 hp per sta for warriors 60+, not counting the  the AA multiplier, and considering sta under 255. each sta over 255 grants only half the value, so only lvl / 20 hp per sta.</div></div><hr />
