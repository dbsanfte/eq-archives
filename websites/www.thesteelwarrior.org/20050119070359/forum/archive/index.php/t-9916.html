<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-04-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well keep in mind that was the total for 6 toons. He said that if I won the raffel I could pick one slot on one guy to upgrade and that was all I would get, and I said fine that is more then fair. So I picked the warrior primary and requested an upgrade to the BoC.... heh. On the other hand someone won two items by themselves, but fair and square so ... <br />
<br />
On the warrior channel someone said that on their server someone else was also given a choice of BF and some other rare warrior items when they won so apparently it was common yesterday.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly though, even with the BF I was not able to move to my 3400ish nuke from my spark (about 13000) and chain it. Still got summoned. But no question at all that with the spark I will almost never lose agro, and I held last night not only through my 3 wizards and chanter but a level 70 sk (although he was not trying to take agro) and a Shaman healing/slowing etc. <br />
<br />
Actually I did get summoned with spark a very few times but thats still a lot of damage well over 240dps on each wizard, and purly chaining it. Figure like 1500 with crits and focus every 5 seconds or so probably closer to 300 dps actually.</div></div><hr />

Nice that SZ gets content you were supposed to pay $40 bucks a month for. Shows how screwed up Customer Support is. They have employees just do what ever they want as far as providing content...hey I think I'll log on to SZ and give away free items like people pay for on legends....<br />
<br />
see thats why i hate eq management... they do whatever they friggen want with no regard to fairness... people get mad at auctions on ebay? easy fix...just say you are against it then let auctions go on without problems at playerauctions....you know who owns players auctions? ebay bought them out like 2 years ago.... <br />
<br />
players scammed again...tell them we stop auctions on ebay and let them go on players auctions which is ebay! that way the auction people are happy and you can tell others you try to stop it.<br />
<br />
hey I think ill give my friend an epic today...hey thanks GM. stupid game. so do all legends people get a refund now that they are giving away legends content for 13 bucks a month instead of 40? *<br />
 i dont really give a crap about the other stuff this guys cojmpaining about but .....  is bloodfrenzy really legends only? ( sorry for long quote)</div></div><hr />

It was quite bullshit and no real way of winning for the bard he picked was the best geared on server.  Gave him ancient mez before the event started, after he killed 5 ppl 1 on 1 , the gm awarded him a quarm ring..  /shrug, I dunno what gm's are up to anymore these days</div></div><hr />
