<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AhtiTS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, it's my first post here in the forum :) <br />
<br />
I tried to do search but all I got was tips for lvl 60+ with hundred of thousands of pp's so I decided to make my own thread.<br />
<br />
I have a question considering my weapons. It's obvious my current slashers: Defender's Lightblade and Elite Steelslave Stone Blade aren't making my job keeping the aggro on me easy at all. <br />
<br />
But now - I have savings over 11kpp (11,000 platinum) so I'm asking here - What would you recommend? What sort of weapon should I start looking for in bazaar?<br />
<br />
I'm a human warrior of 51st level.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)<br />

Here are the links for my weps:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CHoS and SoTB are the weapons of choice for you. Check my magelo for them if you want to. You should be able to get both of them for that price. They will be good till 65 for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hinedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">beware of ChoS, some guilds, my new guild included do not allow CHoS b/c of its knockback on raids. I love my CHoS but im not allowed to use it on raids. Tis a great weapon for normal grouping etc tho.<br />

LEVEL 55 get s GSoT for your 2hb pleasures</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm. When does the CHoS proc? If it's not until lvl 56, it's not going to be an upgrade at the moment over the ESSB he's got.<br />
I think the Frostbringer and the snowchipper would proc at your level. If you bought them, though, you'd have to immediately start saving again for the CHoS.<br />
I kind of think that the levels from about 48 to the point that the great staff of thunder and then the CHoS begin to proc became a lot mroe problematic since the recommended level &quot;bug&quot; was fixed.<br />
Additionally, finding a proc weapon at lvl 51 doesn't actually solve all your problems, because until the weapon procs, it's apt to generate less aggro than your current set up. And with, say 150-180 dex, which I imagine few lvl 51 warriors exceed by much, relying on a proc for aggro is, well, unreliable.<br />
<br />
Who are you losing aggro to and under what conditions?</div></div><hr />

hmmm not so sure about around 11k. every server is different, but on Povar that combo would run him around 15-16k if he could get each item on the cheap side. =/ But depends on the mudflation of your server.<br />
<br />
At your level/guild you might be able to go camp the CHoS yourself though with a group :)<br />
<br />
wep wise though that combo does work well. I just recently abandoned my CHoS in favor of my SoTB/Honorable Longsword combo. the HL is slower but the damage makes up for it.<br />
<br />
at your level...hmm what was I using? oh yeah I had dual centi longs .. LMAO and held aggro just fine... where are you losing aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CHoS procs starting at level 50.<br />
<br />
At 51 I was using Frosty mainhand and a Guard Captain's Mallet offhand before Droga revamp and with no Provoke/Incite line. Held agro fair, but not spectacularly, but the Copper Hammer/Sword of the Bloodsworn is the accepted standard for dropable DW weapons because it is the best at that level.</div></div><hr />
