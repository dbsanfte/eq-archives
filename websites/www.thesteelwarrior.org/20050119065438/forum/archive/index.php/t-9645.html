<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a look at my magelo, I am the guild main tank. <br />
<br />
We were killing up to Saryn but we had a bit of a falling out after the founding members left EQ. So far we have killed small time stuff, vindi, xanamech, had a few successful hedge runs, nothing big, but our members are wanting to push for VT and EP's, so we need a better way to gear up.  <br />
<br />
BoT Towers are somewhat out of the question due to the number of level 55-60 members we have raiding, and due to the fact that we are a social/casual-raiding bunch we cant leave people behind. <br />
<br />
Xanamech wasnt exactly a stretch for us, he dropped without a single death, and my disc had some 3min 30sec left on it when he died. We had about 24 people. Snagged a hammer for one of our warriors, yay! anyhow..<br />
<br />
I have heard ferubi is a great zone to bring a small guild to farm misc bits,  and I'd love to check it out. Would it be worth taking 3-4 groups there and killing everything but the raid encounters?  We are planning on doing Vindi/statue/idol/aow as soon as we can find the buggers but we seem to have a problem tracking them. Can a ranger track for vindi/statue from WL zone in or would we have to park him in arena?<br />
<br />
Oh, and are there any other zones we can kill the hell out of to farm decent loot? We're nowhere near ready to start VT yet and I'm looking for an alternate route until most of our members are 62+ for BoT.  Avoiding ToV like the plague as half of us are KoS, besides the loot is very  medeocre.<br />
<br />
Any tips? Thanks as always guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would raid PoS and flag people for BoT (remember you need PoJ trials as well).  The BoT key is needed for EP access as well.   <br />
<br />
After most of the guild is flagged you can 85% those who aren't, and raid BoT towers.<br />
<br />
Consider doing the Lords in PoS.  I think they can be fairly difficult, never done them myself, but they're in an open zone.<br />
<br />
Farm Xanamech and farm the whatsits in the Factory in PoI.  Forgot what they're called but they drop some decent stuff for the level.<br />
<br />
Park your ranger bots in Ssra.  Farm Comm1/2 and get ppl keys to go up to the upstairs named.  Then try your hand at doing the Rhag cycle.  If you have enough, and feel you can, try Arch Lich, XTC, High Priest, and Cursed (roughly in order of difficulty).  Farm bane weapons for VT, but decide now whether to skip VT and progress straight to EP (it can be done).<br />
<br />
Don't forget the smaller bosses in Luclin.  Burrower Beast in the Deep drops some decent items.  <br />
<br />
Also don't discount doing the smaller quests for PoP progression -- the alternate quest to get Tactics flagged can lead to your guild attempting VZ, which drops decent loot and isn't terribly hard with smaller  numbers.<br />
<br />
As for Statue I don't think a ranger can track him from outside of the Arena but I could be wrong. <br />
<br />
Good luck with farming and progression.  The important thing is to try and keep a good attitude.  You can kill a lot of stuff out there with only a few groups, and sometimes guilds/people play better with their backs against the wall.</div></div><hr />

We were actually going to start farming armor bits for OoW teir1 armor and working on  both planar progression and VT.</div></div><hr />

If you could dig that up it would give you some good ideas.  <br />
<br />
Are you planning on doing ToV since you have so many under 60 who I assume need gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hates</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might want to look up some other luclin mobs, IV, Shei, Doomshade, RC (kinda 1-2groupable but drops a decent caster robe), grieg, servitor of luclin, seru (if you have 4-5 or so clerics and a lot caster dps for him), etc. If you do this and raid BoT towers you shouldn't have a problem starting in SSRA. Then once you start farming SSRA you can start looking into PoP progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Variety of targets are nice, but as you know, you cant please everyone with guild progress (been there, done that).<br />
<br />
In addition to the above:<br />
<br />
Mujaki event - 4 groups<br />
Vhakis - add onto a Hedge run<br />
PoFear - epic 1.0 bits and mass murder mayhem is always fun :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Luclin- SSRA,Greig,SHei, IV, RC, DS, THO, BB(all pretty decent loot, left out Seru, because he can be a bastard)<br />
<br />
PoP-Hedge,Xanamech,Grummus,Paffa,Terris,MB,PoS Minis(Flag those pre-62 for BoT),etc.<br />
<br />
Do some random Epic 1.5 raids, Guardian of the Seal is always fun, etc. Once everyone gets their levels, you should do alright!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can track Statue using a level 8 mage with Eye of Zomm.  Have to plant him behind the ice wall, right up in the south west corner of the area where the bridge back to the statue starts.  Eye of Zomm can JUST reach the Statue.  You may be able to do this with a level one Ogre worshipper of RZ, but certain mobs in there are KoS to all and I don't know of a totally safe spot.   <br />
<br />
Guardian of the Seal is a nice and easy quick mob using Corpse of the Hero.  There's no aggro down there.  A divined cleric can make the jump off the ledge in Paineel and land alive at the feet of the GotS.  You can sometimes land in the water there and live, and have survived the fall myself by looking up as soon as I zone (falling with less lag makes you more likely to live as it turns out).  Bard DA song can get a group down w/o dying too, but you gotta jump the second the song hits.  Either way, as long as you get a live cleric down there and no nimrods run out in the hall and aggro the gargoyles, you can dive bomb in a raid force, rez 'em up and off you go.  <br />
<br />
If you have the inclination I recommend doing the progression.  Do the VT keys then move into PoP.  Maybe do the occaisional PoP raid to get a few keys and break up the monotony of VT farming.  Ssra and the rest of luclin will kit out your casters very well.  Then when you show up to PoP mobs with lower numbers than a hard core raiding guild all your healers have mana oozing out their ears.  Plus you've seen whats to be seen in Luclin.  <br />
<br />
My guild is a pipe-hittin family guild which sounds like it may describe yours as well.  Stuff just takes longer to get done.  Whatever.  We don't view it as a race.  Its the journey, not the destiination, grasshopper.</div></div><hr />

Yeah can get Vindi this way, but not the Statue</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to be crazy to not want NToV for a fledgling guild. you get around 20 - 30 loot on a clear of 3 hours. Name me a zone other than VT that you can get that kind of loot...... Not only that but NToV and Ssra ARE the resist zones for lower end guilds. You get tons of resist gear in these two zones, but as i stated before NToV has much more bang for the buck.<br />
<br />
1) NToV has probably one of the BEST warrior back items in the game till elem/time Cloak of Thorns is nothing to shy away from. Also has great AC gear for other toons. <br />
<br />
2) if you can kill aryonare (Sp*) you can clear the zone.. Period. <br />
<br />
3) make sure you let all your casters know that on named dragons that are tetherd you must be in melee range to nuke. <br />
<br />
We did NToV before we did Ssra, and when we got newer guildies in that needed to be geared up fast to help us in VT we did a few runs in NToV.  Now after 3 or so months in VT we did a push on elem and got there with little problems. RZtW being the only real hard script. <br />
<br />
soo remember <br />
NToV -&gt; Ssra -&gt; VT -&gt; Elem<br />
<br />
you can start mixing PoP in during the Ssra -&gt; VT part. By the time you are ready for LMM/RZtW you'll have been in VT about 2 - 2 1/2 months. Make sure you choose your VT gear wisely. Lots of gear has either awesome AC and low hp. or good AC and medium hp. or LOW ac and HIGH hp. As a warrior you might want to go with the middle and aug your gear with LDoN ac augs, as the middle gear most times has the best resist on it. <br />
<br />
AHR neck item for your casters. Best caster neck item pre-time. Warriors get a better ac item in elem i believe. OR just get a Gorget of Superiority and stick with the 38ac/41% haste on it. <br />
<br />
But the most important warrior item in VT is the BP off aten ha Ra. save and get it.<br />
<br />
Also try and farm agro weapons for your warriors, BoC, Bloodfrenzy. AoW also drops a killer 30ac Ring of Destruction. (lost out on that item to a cleric heh.) <br />
Its All/all so will be highly contested. <br />
<br />
Most important thing is to mix in succeses with a failure. Keeps moral high and a sence of accomplishment. <br />
<br />
Oh and as someone above said TBB and THO in the Deep, Great FT gear for your clerics/shaman. A must have when hitting PoP. Think FT FT then Plate plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">see my raid goals magelo profile,<br />
also, NToV may have a lot of loot, but it absolutely pales in comparison to what you can get nowadays in a WoS+ xp group in OoW. the cloak of thorns is killer but i dont see bringing an entire raid force to tov for a lot of medeocre drops and a few nice ones that only a few classes will use. we've mostly already been through ToV in previous guilds and are just not interested in backtracking.</div></div><hr />
