<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So what was the final decision ?  Did they go ahead and have mobs sense<br />
when a paladin was tanking and go into &quot;pussy'' mode  or did they nerf all mob<br />
hits ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its unknown atm, the best guess, which is highly probably is that they lowered the atk of the mobs so high AC has even more of an effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm thinking the atk method too, as that is the most simplistic method.  Although I would have seriously loved it if they had created a different encounter depending on if you had a warrior/pal/sk in your group.  Damaging AEs for paladins for group heals and quick heals, and perhaps mana-drains and atk debuffs for SKs to counter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still say its +bane damage on all classes but knights.. they already have that for rangers.. why else would they die so much?</div></div><hr />
