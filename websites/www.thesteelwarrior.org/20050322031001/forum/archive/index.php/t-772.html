For past year? 2hs is apparently better, /shrug. Anyway, is this true still of warriors with baned weapons? For example, should warriors be suing 2 1hs seru or ssra baned weapons, or 2hd'ers for these two mobs? Or maybe a 1hs bane weapon and a procing weapon or boc?<br />

I know some people did it with Bloodfrenzy/BoC and totally relied on procs.  Actually Seru has a lot of proximity aggro, so probably a lot of things would work.<br />
<br />
The 2-hand vs 1-hand was mostly to cut ripostes on hard-hitting PoP mobs.  Seru's melee isn't much worse than vindicator, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.</div></div><hr />

I usually used BF primary/bane secondary; others I know used a sod/bane or BoC/bane combo with essentially equivalent results.  If your tank has problems getting/holding aggro, have him pick up a fungus gland or two, or a sceptre of the forlorn (both 10 ch of snare).  They won't stick, but they WILL generate enough aggro to lock seru on him.  <br />
<br />
I don't seem to remember seru's ripostes being too bad, so going 2hs probably wouldn't be a big win unless you were really on the edge for healing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a BIG fan of 2handers.<br />
<br />
PoV at 60, a cleric once told me &quot;WTF, you are dropping like a ranger&quot;<br />
<br />
Reading the board and on advice of some other warriors, I used 2hander, and died a lot slower.<br />
<br />
I was using Epic 2hander and epic 1handers at the time.<br />
<br />
Reading the boards, I've HEARD, but cannot confirm, that riposte rate was lowered. That's a RUMOUR.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, I used BoC mainhand when tanking, and Ancient Prismatic Hammer/Red Epic offhand, switching back and forth. Sometimes I feel Red Epic offers more aggro, sometimes I feel making certain I have avatar all the time gives me more aggro. At 65, with massive amounts of AA, I feel that any riposte rate increase from Dual Wielding is more then compensated for by increased aggro.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I still use Epic or TSBS for 2hander... if you have a BoW or something might find it different.<br />
<br />
Also, before I got BoC, I found Epic or TSBS held aggro fairly well in PoP, but mainly just in PoP. IMO, 2handslash generates more aggro in a pop zone. I have ZERO hard evidence to back me up.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm saying go with what you have good aggro weapons for, but outside of PoP, seriously consider Dual Wield.<br />
<br />
I'm also drunk, but that last paragraph should sum it up.</div></div><hr />

Though one thing I agree with, 2handed doesn't seem to aggro as well outside of PoP (just in my experience), although I'm sure a BoW or equivalant will easily, but dps 2handers I have a bit more of an issue with outside of PoP.  Could be just random luck or whatever though /shrug</div></div><hr />
