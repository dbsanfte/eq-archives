No.  It only &quot;glows&quot; on bashes, not spells or procs.  And yes, it's every bit as useless as it sounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i still dont fully understand Furious Bash, and it doesn't sound useless at all, how much hate does it generate? and also sometimes Bash can stun so thats another 400 hate...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Using a shield isn't worth the loss of aggro from a 2nd weapon if you dual wield.  I used to have a FB shield and was extremely underwealmed.</div></div><hr />

I'm not even convinced it generates any.  If, in fact, it does anything, it's not much... and I'm guessing I use a shield to bash a good deal more than most warriors.<br />
<br />
It would be a great effect it worked on procs or spells(though severely overpowered on high-end shields), but bash aggro is negligible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was under the impression that a shield with furious bash was sort of useful in these scenarios:<br />
<br />
a)  Warrior tanking mob w/ defensive, it runs out, mob is still alive, switching from duel wield to a high AC shield might help with mitigating damage increase due to defensive wearing out.<br />
<br />
b)  Warrior going to tank a mob with really high riposte rates and high damage hits.  Warrior pulls with incite + furious discipline.  As soon as it wears off, he/she switches to defensive and the shield with furious bash and uses that combo to mitigate damage and retain agro.<br />
<br />
I must point out, I don't have one of these shields as of yet, so these are only theories...that I think I've read about in various posts here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A bash will generate almost zero agro.<br />
<br />
OMG OMG HOW LEET !<br />
<br />
Furious Bash 4 = +40% of &quot;Almost Zero Agro&quot;<br />
<br />
I now have the UBER 1.4 x &quot;Almost Zero Agro&quot;<br />
<br />
Useless.</div></div><hr />

Those are situations where shields in general might be nice.  The advantage would be the extra ac, hp, slightly-reduced risk of the mob riposting your offhand(I assume?  not something I have to worry about), and/or +shielding mods on high-end shields, not the Furious Bash focus itself.<br />
<br />
Read the last four words of my previous post.  Read EmiliaEQ's reply.  A very small number(bash aggro) increased by 40%, or even 70% on Time+ shields, is still a very small number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mathas, my response had your response quoted simply because that was the default thing this site does, my intent was simply to inform people of the only plausible uses I have heard of for a shield with furious bash.  <br />
<br />
Basically, I think the entire reason SOE added shields like these, was to entice some warriors into wanting a shield, even if it was only situational.  I have never used a shield with furious bash, and thus, cannot say whether it produces any agro.  Myself, I am currently a fan of the dual wield...however, all my 2 handers are crappy and I am not usually in a situation where I routinely tank mobs that can riposte for 1 - 3k of damage yet.<br />
<br />
Just in case anyone missed it...I have NOT used a shield with furious bash (nor any shield in a long, long, long time...since I learned dual wield skill), so I cannot say from experience if they or even normal shields, produce any serious amount of agro.  In fact, I don't even know if shields have a type 4 slot that you could put an agro proc into or not, lol.  I was simply stating the only situations I knew of that such a shield *might* be desirable.  And yeah, I have thought about getting one to try for raid mobs that do hit in the up to 3k range for the second option I noted above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're offtanking something that people are not yet exerting aggro upon or possibly after disc drops(generally rather call for max dps) if aggro is solid i could see a shield being used to advantage.<br />
<br />
Time/god stuff may be better,but,up to ep's all i've seen is a loss in aggro too substancial to give up an offhander for.Good for offtanking for some people I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Notice : I did not say a shield was useless, on the contrary i look myself foward to using one.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Notice : I did not say a shield was useless, on the contrary i look myself foward to using one.<br />
<br />
I said Furious Bash = USELESS<br />
<br />
I hadn't looked at it that way.  :)  Actually, I did something silly, I looked at the Alla's link provided above.  Learned the following:<br />
<br />
1.  Shields have slot type 7/8 like normal armor (nope, no agro procs).<br />
2.  The 40% hate increaser applies to spells and procs.<br />
2a. Only spells warriors have are clickies = almost useless<br />
2b. 40% hate increase on a BoC, might be nice, especially with hate augment...only problem is that is only helpful retaining agro, rather than establishing it since it cuts your chances of procing in half (roughly).<br />
<br />
So, Furious Bash looks better for Knights, but if you use it in the second scenario I described, it might be slightly more useful than useless, only if you would consider equiping a shield in that situation anyway.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Thought of one other *possible* use, but I can't imagine too many warriors wanting to deal with the hassle.  Equiping the shield while using a bow with 2 procs (it does have a aug proc, right?) would possibly increase your initial agro if you're pulling with bow and arrow, when your bow actually procs.  So, perhaps with WA5, maybe it'd be worth it?  I don't know, only got WA1 and way too many defensive/hp aa's to go before spending more on WA atm.</div></div><hr />

The 40% hate increaser applies to spells and procs.The hate increaser applies only to procs that are equivalent to spells in your spellbook.

 <br />
If Sony simply made furious bash affect procs, then many warriors would use it.</div></div><hr />

Oh?  I didn't see that information on Alla's or Lucy's.  If that is the case, it would be useless.  My only question is, why do they have a warrior only shield with that effect, if that is the case?</div></div><hr />

That hits it right on the nose ^^) specially good in the Zoo ring in Qvic when you gotta tank 3 , 1500' flurry hitters at the same time, quite good to have that extra 100ac and shielding for when Defensive fades.</div></div><hr />

For the love of god people, FB does NOT affect spells or procs. FB only affects bash hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know Lucy is now run by Alla's...but does that mean this is incorrect?  How can you know whether it adds more hate without being a developer?  Short of doing taunt testing...which has proven to be somewhat trickier than originally suggested by some people here, would you please support your statement with something substantial?  Why do you think it only affects bash, contrary to otherwise posted evidence on Alla's &amp; Lucy's (albeit, both places now managed by same parent company now)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When focus effects work, they 'glow'.<br />

<br />
Thank you...it is nice to hear the reason(s) behind a claim.  :)<br />
<br />
So, does that mean Lucy's info is wrong or that it is correct, but only for knights since they can have spells in their spellbook as someone else said earlier in this thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why do you think it only affects bash, contrary to otherwise posted evidence on Alla's &amp; Lucy's (albeit, both places now managed by same parent company now)?<br />
<br />
Because it does only affect bash.  Example:<br />
<br />
FB working:<br />
[Sun May 16 19:51:48 2004] Your Blackstone Buckler glows red.<br />
[Sun May 16 19:51:48 2004] You strike through your opponent's defenses!<br />
[Sun May 16 19:51:48 2004] You bash Innoruuk for 113 points of damage.<br />
<br />
FB on any spell I've cast in months:<br />
[Sun May 16 19:51:05 2004] You begin casting Clinging Darkness.<br />
[Sun May 16 19:51:06 2004] You regain your concentration and continue your casting.<br />
[Sun May 16 19:51:06 2004] Your target is immune to changes in its run speed.<br />
[Sun May 16 19:51:06 2004] Your target resisted the Clinging Darkness spell.<br />
[Sun May 16 19:51:06 2004] Your Grimror's Boots of the Plagues flickers with a pale light.<br />
(note the lack of glowing shield)<br />
<br />
It doesn't affect procs because of the way focus items and procs work together.  As Sassinak pointed out, a focus item will only affect a proc if you can scribe and cast the spell being procced(proc'd? whatever).  For example, when I used to use a Heavy Bludgeoner (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22889), the proc was affected by my improved damage focus, because Siphon Life is a spell I can cast.  Since warriors obviously cannot cast any spells, none of their procs can be focused.  Furious Bash used to go off on spells, but it was changed quite a while ago.<br />
<br />
For like the third time this thread, Furious Bash is useless.  If a shield is worth using, it will be because of the stats, not the lame effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tineren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It is the second line in the lucy listing:<br />
2: Limit: Effect(Unknown(999) allowed) <br />
This means the focus will only work for effect unknown 999 (presumably bash)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The effect is indeed working correctly. It only fires off for every activation of the bash key. There are no other effects or attacks that Furious Bash augments. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">There's something else that I believe bears repeating, focus effects do not work on spells that you cannot cast (see cleric hammers).  Warriors are not listed under any spells that are procs, so therefor focus effects like Furious Bash will not affect it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am pretty sure this was changed, I have a FB shield and it only glows when I bash not when I cast.  I think this was nerfed shortly after it came out to make sure that FB was worthless to any class and not just warriors.</div></div><hr />

I tanked all 3 animals consequtively, they are chain linked in aggro, once you attack 1 or 2 of them and taunt all 3 will be locked on you, best advice for tanking them (1500 hitters + Flurry is not nice x 3 lol) is to keep them all facing you though hard to do due to their size, but better chances of survival :)- I survived so you can too!<br />
<br />
Havent had any warping issues since the last patch that fixed more cornering and walling bugs.<br />
<br />
As for funky aggro, in the beginning I had 1 and a paladin somehow got aggro on one, so I merely attacked that one that was on the paladin must have been ranged aggro since he was closer and I had no engaged it, and than when the 3rd one came it rushed right for me, so it may take a few seconds for them to all aggro lock on their target in the beginning, I take that as a good thing though allows for less suprise suddenly than burst DPS all on one person at once if they come in 2's and than the 3rd jumps in after 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Emilia I'm pretty sure the animals have some prox agro until they go after the one tank.</div></div><hr />
