Can someone give me an idea of which GoD trials to try first. Looking to get an idea if our group could possibly handle some of the first trials. I just have no idea which ones are considered to be easier than others. Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of the 4 sewers one, Plant is the hardest one, and it's also the first one, and you can't do it out of order if you're doing it for progression.  Plant is hard mobs with a boss at the end.  Creamatory is pretty easy but the final turn in requires a trick or two.  I never did Lair, and Pool is easy but takes forever to finish if you're clearing the way.<br />
<br />
For mountain, Tipt is harder than Vxed, but both can be trivialized by having a pet.  Even if you're completely incapable of tanking the mobs there, you can just keep throwing Pookas at mobs and one of these days you'll win just because you've a 1000 DPS pet on your side.  Of course, if you're doing the mountain trials without a pet, then they will really challenge your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arny</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a general rule of thumb, if you can handle Ldon hards with relative ease then you should have no problems in the first 4 trials at least.<br />
<br />
Not sure I agree that trial 1 is the hardest although it does have the hardest hitting mobs, but if you can handle those then it is probably the simplest to complete.<br />
<br />
Iirc the other 3 trials you are up against a timer which can be a pain, but none are too difficult and the creative use of an sos rogue can speed them up greatly.</div></div><hr />

We were in vxed the other night, and rolling right along.  Everything was going great on the way to the end.  We're splitting the snake people who bring their S&amp;M dogs, when one of the dogs resisted mez 5 times!  Chanter was quickly pasted, cleric next, the mob I was on gated, summoned and the ass beat was fainalized in a pile of wet dwarf bits.<br />
<br />
Just one little thing will get your ass beat =)  One extra mob, a broken invis, resisted mez, or unexpected add = big mess.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't dumb it down ever though.  GoD has been so much fun for me.  No, I don't have stacks of sweet elemental gear, nor do I have millions of adventure points and sweet augments.  My friends and I have had a ball in the trials, even if we get our ass handed to us.  I hope that GoD will remain that way.  Challening and fun.</div></div><hr />

What is the best way to get into A GoD trial and what rewards do they have (I.E. AAs everybody get loot..).  Sorry for asking so many questions but nobody in my guild is all that familiar with GoD.  We are still working on getting Elementaly flagged (please no &quot;OMG  :eek: your not EP flagged? Don't even think about GoD&quot;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And only the first one, Plant, is even remotely difficult.   <br />
<br />
The only &quot;hard&quot; part that I qould comment on is running 6 people invis across 3 zones to the Sewer entrance and the time that these actually take &quot;doing&quot; the trials.  One of these takes ALLOT of moving around especially if you don't take an evac / succor.<br />
<br />
The mobs in Plant at the deepest area past the swim down pipe near the stonemites are the hardest hitting mobs with hits up too 1100.  But they are fully slowable.  If you can pass Plant and have ALLOT of time at one sitting then you can finish the other 3 without a sweat.  The last two, Furnace and Pool are BORINGLY easy mobs, like a LDON 65 normal.<br />

Those walking rats past the water are naughty!  It must be those teeth.  I kept thinking I was missing a buff or that they had a big proc when I almost died the first few times we pulled them.  :)<br />
<br />
I'd also add that the third (or maybe it's the second) has a lot of roamers and a quicker respawn rate than the plant (first trial).  So if you have a high dps group and are having problems handling the damage from the plant mobs, try 2nd or 3rd trial.  Conversely, if your dps is a bit low, but you can handle the 1kish (pre-slow, pre-cripple, low mitigation aa) hits, go for the plant.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen and read, to some degree, there are potentially drops for all classes in any given trial...especially with the change to spell drops.  Of course, the only warrior drop I've seen first hand are the Pitted Vambraces that I foolishly let my wife's cleric loot thinking I'd take the next pair (haven't gotten 'em to drop again as of yet).<br />
<br />
And as mentioned above, travel through these zones can be bad if someone dies enroute.  There are fewer see invis mobs now, but you still have to be careful and of course hope the random invis timer doesn't drop in the middle of a few mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidor</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My best advice is if you have a group that you play with regularly, try hard ldon's first to practice teamwork a bit. Then try farming the front room of the Plant or Lair for random drops, decent xp, and practice. Also, while you likely won't see much of it in the sewers, a lot of Gates procs seem to be prismatic and keeping the lowest resists buffed can help in Vxed/Tipt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd also suggest using a rogue for 2,3, and 4. It saves an unbelievable amount of time. Other than that, they aren't that hard as long as everyone is paying some attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A rogue for 2 and 3 (especially 3 if you have a rogue with the seal from #2) are very useful indeed.  A good bard or FD/DA class could possibly fill the same function but it would be interesting to say the least.  A rogue for trial 4 though isn't going to help all that much other than dps though imo, unless they like pulling tricks or are geared well enough to solo the cubes (which I frankly didn't even consider when I did my runs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, my bad. It's been a while. Seemed like the rogue helped in all 3 of those, but you don't need one for 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">after  glancing at your Magelo frig I would say go XP in LDON's get some good points in takish or Everfrost. BP in takish and anger 3 augs in Everfrost. If you can do hard LDON's with no death at all then you can try a trial. I have done the  sewer trial one mistake on anybodys part is a wipe and have to reclear. There are some mobs that hit for over 1K as the normal and verry verry fast and cant be slowed. We are on the verg of taking down Emp im one of the MT's and I was smacked around like I was a SK or pally's bitch. We finaly tried it again after some more gear upgrades and some more AA's got all the way to the end and wiped after we killed 3 of the 9? cant remember how many of those guys are before  the named spawns. We wiped and a bard showed up becuase cleric and SHM went LD so he went and kited the remaining mobs for us to get our flag. We also invised past alot of the stuff. The repops are so fast you have to pull nonstop or they will pop on you and your dead again. GoD is no joke its  said to be for ele - time geared guilds for a reason.<br />
   We used to just zone in and farm it for XP never making it past the entrance. I now have LR5 so I would like to try it again after I get anger 3 tho.</div></div><hr />

Cause that doesn't sound like the current sewers.   I don't agree with GoD being for the ele - time only and certainly not after we hit 70 with Oow.<br />
<br />
It doesn't hurt to try these since you pop at zone unlike Ferubi were you need rogue / summoned out on wipe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried purifying plant before and after the &quot;tune&quot; and haven't really noticed a difference.  It's still damn hard for pre-elem tanks though doable.  btw, the 1100ish hitting golem things from the GoD splash screen are unslowable.  <br />
<br />
Who's moronic idea was it to make the FIRST trial the hardest one of the four?  sigh.  That's very frustrating.  One mistake wipes you and it's a long freaking trial.<br />
<br />
We've run into horrendous pathing in a couple of places.  Let me describe and please, if someone has suggestions for pulling it, let me know.  <br />
<br />
It's usually in one of the early rooms in a trial.  I've seen it in both purifying plant and a non trial version of another sewers zone.  They're squarish rooms with watery pits in the middle and mobs swimming around the pit.  There are stairs into the pit where you enter the room and on the opposite side and a ledge all the way around.  We go around the ledge.  The puller tries to get mobs out of the water up to us on the ledge.  The mobs won't come.  They just won't.  Instead they run around the pit aggroing all their friends.  Last time we wiped 30 min in because the bard was trying to pull these, thought she'd faded aggro off, and suddenly one mob warped right onto our cleric, who took 5 hits for 1048s and died.  woot.<br />
<br />
Another time on what was otherwise a very easy non trials zone for us, we literally could not get past a room like this because we'd get too many mobs at once right there.  Again we couldn't get them to path to us.  Finally we fought them right on the stairs and decided to just deal with the roamers that aggroed.  We killed one.  I got in melee range and broke mez on another and watched it promptly take off in the opposite direction, where no player was standing, circle all the way around the pit, gather up all its friends, and come back.  wtf?  Nice pathing!  So where the heck do you pull/fight these mobs?<br />
<br />
Even if you're completely incapable of tanking the mobs there, you can just keep throwing Pookas at mobs and one of these days you'll win just because you've a 1000 DPS pet on your side. <br />
<br />
And yet according to the chanters this is not overpowered. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had the same problem with that room, think it's the one by Ansharu (sp?).  Also had similar problems where a flying insect couldn't follow me from the stairs to the ledge...it pathed around and warped up.  Anyway, onto the room in question, the first time that I successfully cleared that room was to clear the room the hard way.  Pull all the crap from the bottom first, then do the ledge.  Really screwed up since the ledge seems the best way to go in most of the other rooms.  I lucked onto the clear it through brute force (kill everything instead of just ledge mobs) because we had a named turtle spawn down there and that was the first time we made it through that room successfully.  We then went back a couple times after that and we kept dying or evacing by trying to clear the ledge only.  Unfortunately the ghost-like mobs guarding the next hallway will NOT path onto the ledge, they will path through the main room and pop up.  In one case, the mob I pulled pathed through the main room and popped up, but the mob that assisted that one never came up and the chanter couldn't see it to mez.<br />
<br />
To clarify: we fought the mobs in the room next to the water holes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I am not normally MT on our group. We have another war with 600 or so more hp and all his defensive AA's. Yes we do alot of BoT and PoTatics trying for more ornate gear. We also do some LDoN's. <br />
<br />
Question regarding hard LDoN's. I have heard pulling is the key but pacify is resisted alot. Our normal group make up is. War War Shm Wiz Cle Chan. Sometimes we replace one war with a ranger. What we would the best strat for pulling with this group ? Just mezz and pray ?<br />
<br />
All of us are 65. Chanter War(MT) and Sham (me) all have over 100 AA's rest of group varies from 30 to 80 AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on wich LDON your doing. I have seen some chanters do an awsome job pulling hard LDOn's but you need a good SHM to heal the chanter if needed. Chanter pulls with slow and shm then slows once target is made.  If chanter does not pull with slow he/she will be dead way to fast. Unless his/her gear is really nice.  If I was the MT in the group with 2 warriors I would not be so much scared of the XP death but the fact of not having enough DPS to win. Unless your second warrior had some uber DPS wepon and didnt pull agro from MT. Rangers are great DPS but we all know Roages are best. The wizard makes for some damm good DPS espicaly if he/she is high in AA's.  I would try some MM hard LDON's and hope for a cave type map and not the building type. I have found the building type can get real hard for chanters to pull in. Latly chanters have been pacy pulling but all the mobs she just pacy come anyway. Not shure why this is happening but its done it in 2 of my last LDON's with her.  GoD zones for XP are great if you can get a well balanced group. Monks are still the best puller. Do not let your cleric pull in hard LDON's unless he is a time or verry well geared ele cleric IMO~ I let my cleric pull all the normal LDON's does a great job. <br />
  Really the best thing to do is try..... rezz..... try.... rezz... try untill you find what works. Once you have that down its smooth sailing and raking in the LDON points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Find a monk (I prefer them to bards, they often pull faster).<br />
<br />
Outside that, it really depends on your theme and a person's pulling skills.  I have been pulling for 65 levels with my warrior, from old Kunark dungeons to GoD.  I trust my pulling abilities over most non-FD classes. (and over quite a few FD pullers who use FD as a crutch for sloppy pulling technique).<br />
<br />
The enchanter, ranger, and shaman should all be able to do a better job than a warrior though.   Ranger pulling with snare and root should work fairly well if there are 2-3 mobs.  If there are three, the Ranger snares, runs back to camp with adds, tank peels one add off to fight, enchanter mezzes the first add, then mezzes the snared mob when it mosies into camp.  Ranger uses WS to buy time as necessary.<br />
<br />
Shaman can use root, slow, and ae slow to pull, although I would not recommend this unless the shaman has had a lot of practice.<br />
<br />
A decent enchnater makes a pretty good puller, and I have seen some tear up Takish using AE spells.  But an average chanter usually just sucks at pulling hard.<br />
<br />
When I pull hard ldon, and the group is a bit suspect on the CC or heals or slowing, I usually pretarget the adds with a hotkey saying &quot;Please assist to Mezz %t on Inc&quot;.  If its alot of adds, sometimes I ask the people who can root/and or snare to &quot;Please assist to Root %t on Inc&quot; on the other mobs.   The whole key is to delay the mobs a bit so the chanter can lock them all down, you don't need singles, you just need to control the amount of dps on the tank at the start of the fight.  Unless both tanks are geared to the gills, I would not recommend off-tanking much because it just eats up healing mana.  Better to ghetto CC.<br />
<br />
Btw, two warriors trading off MA with defensive, and using /shield on each other before the mob is slowed, and in between defensive refreshing, can make most LDON hard trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think this is severe danger of thread derailment, but...<br />
<br />
The one hard ldon I've done so far, had an evacer with finger on the trigger at all times (in your case wizard).<br />
<br />
Anytime puller came back with more than 2 - 3 mobs, evac, don't wait.<br />
<br />
Enchanter pacifying and then pulling with either a low agro spell like annul or tash and as suggested have shaman slow asap.  Follow this for single pulls, unless they pull with annul, then have warrior take the agro quick.<br />
<br />
For doubles or triples, if it's not too common, assign an aet order, rotate between the two tanks...be sure to fire furious or defensive shortly afterward (neither will break mez) and have the second tank assist the first tank (if mez isn't landing after 6 - 10 seconds the ranger can be called on to snare kite if room til mez lands.<br />
<br />
All my suggestions are based on just one hard ldon (which was a win), so take em with a grain or two of salt.  ;)</div></div><hr />
