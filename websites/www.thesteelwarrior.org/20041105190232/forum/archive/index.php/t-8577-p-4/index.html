EXACTLY! Thank god. You are correct. I wasn't making a serious comparison. That's exactly right. <br />

&quot;Then we look at what YOU say? &quot;<br />

<br />
You're going to need to prove that one Liper. I have over 6000 posts there, so DATA shouldn't be hard to find.<br />
<br />
Then again, providing data to back up your claims has never been your strong suit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's clear non of us will agree on this. Just let the devs work it out......... You have to put your faith in something, even if it is a dead horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Let me be more clear.<br />
<br />
I'm referring to the monk push to remove their AC cap.<br />
<br />
And yes, they would still have more AC. But your very own numbers show that that AC &quot;advantage&quot; wouldn't mean as much as some would have people believe.Daemon, I have never seen any Monk, no matter how rabid, advocate the removal of any AC cap only for Monks.<br />
<br />
I've seen some advocate the removal of all Soft Caps.<br />
<br />
I've seen some advocate that Monks get the same returns after Soft Cap as Knights.<br />
<br />
I've seen some advocate that all classes get the same returns after Soft Cap.<br />
<br />
I've seen some advocate basing either or both the Soft Cap and/or the returns after Soft Cap on the Defense skill.<br />
<br />
I've never seen anyone advocate that only Monks get full value for every single AC point.  If I had, I'd have called them rather silly names.<br />
<br />
As far as what kind of an advantage &quot;my&quot; numbers show, the fact that you even admit to one refutes Pumilio's and others' claims that there would be absolutely none.  There would still be an advantage to having more AC.  That is what I tried to show.<br />
<br />
Even if Monks took the same damage over time, due to the fact that lower AC means less mitigation, Anyone that could attain higher AC than that Monk would still take damage in a smoother fashion.<br />
<br />
If you're arguing that the differences in smoothness are meaningless, I will concede that sometimes they would be.  Damage simply has to be taken in a &quot;smooth enough&quot; manner.<br />
<br />
I still doubt you'd see a Monk ( given a choice ), even with full AC point for AC point mitigation the same as a Knight, tanking anything that would make a Knight sweat, let alone a Warrior.  Because the Knight would do it better.  Smoother, harder Aggro lock, more HP, and more tanking utility in that spell book than any Monk would ever have in all his DPS and/or procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Really? Prove it.Sure:Sorry, you're not going to get away with casually throwing out mods. The fact that you attempted to as it seems to support your argument more if you do, just goes to show that you're not really interested in truth or reality (just as your last post indicated) and are only interested in what you can say to support your point of view, no matter how false it is.There's your insinuation that I had an agenda.<br />
<br />
There's your accusation that I &quot;casually threw out&quot; the Mods.<br />
<br />
I &quot;threw out&quot; the Mods because you can't find what's innate if you include them.<br />
<br />
I also included the numbers with the damn Mods.<br />
<br />
So either apologize or shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No. Not the innate advantage. The avoidance advantage period. I think you're seizing on &quot;innate&quot; to try discredit the argument, so that you yourself can avoid arguing it it's merits. In other words, using semantics instead of directly addressing it.Jeesus, Daemon.<br />
<br />
Folks here love to harp on the innate avoidance advantage of Monks.  So I used a little arithmetic to show just how large that innate advantage is.<br />
<br />
And it ain't all that.<br />
<br />
The fact that we have access to more Avoidance Mods at some level of play isn't anything innate to the class, jerk.And that state got you nerfed. Therefore, returning it to you returns you to having the very problem that happened in the first place.No, Daemon.  Rewrite history if you must, but you're wrong.<br />
<br />
What got us nerfed was the following combination:<br />
1) The existence of an AC Hardcap.  This meant that ANY class which attained it's HardCap would mitigate precisely the same as any other class which also reached it.  If the Monk HardCap was 1400 and the Warrior Hardcap was 1200, then a 1400AC Monk would mitigate exactly the same as a 1200AC Warrior.<br />
<br />
2) The attainability of that Hardcap by both Warriors and Monks.  The fact that we Monks attained that level of AC made the problem with a HardCapped system all too obvious.<br />
<br />
3) The fact that Monks have an innate avoidance advantage over every other class.  Specifically Warriors, who we were mitigating just as well as due to points 1 and 2 from above.<br />
<br />
4) And Warriors got pissed about it, specifically Furor.<br />
<br />
We were nerf'd because we took damage precisely as smoothly, took less damage over time and could hold aggro at least as well.<br />
<br />
How much of that would still be true even if we had Knight-like mitigation?<br />
<br />
Our damage will never be as smooth.<br />
At best we'd take comparable damage over time.<br />
And Warriors' ability to gain and hold aggro has seen MAJOR upgrades since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay, now that's just being wilfully blind. My reasoning was clearly posted, that people aren't going to simply NOT use melee mods if they're available. It's backed up by the parse where nearly all the melee and some non melee ALL had and used the mods. <br />
<br />
Then we look at what YOU say? You make the same assertion, but you don't even post a single word as to why my post was the same. In essence, you're guilty of the very thing you're accusing ME of being guilty of, except YOU are even worse because you didn't even bother to post any support or reasoning for it.<br />
<br />
Pot, Kettle, Black.Daemon, the point that I was trying to make is this:<br />
<br />
That without Mods, the numbers for Monks mitigating the same as Knights look pretty fair.<br />
<br />
It's the Mods that put them out of whack.<br />
<br />
So instead of keeping the class jammed because of what the Mods give us, how bout fixing the Mods and fixing the class?<br />
<br />
How could I have possibly displayed the innate differences between Monks' and Warriors' rates of Damage Taken Over Time by including the damn Mods when the Mods are not innate to the class?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if they are &quot;nobly&quot; pushing for the raising of all softcaps... the monk softcap is the only one at issue. <br />
<br />
The monk softcap is the only one that's going to make a difference in game play. Why? Because monks are the only ones that are going to make any use of this raised softcap.<br />
<br />
There's no issue with a plate softcap. Rangers and rogues, with whatever their softcap is, aren't going to care about those being raised... because they don't tank.<br />
<br />
Only monks are going to have a large difference made for them if all softcaps are raised, which coincidentally, is exactly what monks want.<br />
<br />
It's sophistry to say that monks are pushing for all softcaps being raised, because you know, and I know, and everyone knows that the softcap change is only going to really affect monks, at the end of the day, all monks really care about is having THEIR cap raised, and screw everyone else's. It just makes it look better if they can point at it and say they're not doing it just for their own benefit.<br />
<br />
After all, what has the comparisons been of through this whole thread? Not rangers, rogues, clerics, or any other class that would benefit, ONLY monks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How much of that would still be true even if we had Knight-like mitigation?<br />
<br />
at best we'd take comparable damage over time.<br />
<br />
And you take comparable damage over time as the BEST TANK IN THE GAME, as a LEATHER WEARING CLASS.<br />
<br />
You just hit on precisely why it's totally unacceptable to every single tank class in the game. You're NOT a tank, you should NOT take damage not only like a tank, but as good as the BEST of the tanks.<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to pull better, you need to find other ways to go about it.<br />
<br />
Maybe faster run speeds to outrun them. <br />
Maybe improve feign death further.<br />
Maybe increase range of your ranged attacks to increase the distance at which you can aggro.<br />
Maybe improve your lulll abilities.<br />
Maybe improve your avoidance from behind abilities.<br />
<br />
But saying you should tank like a warrior (or even close to one) is unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen a few rangers tank in KT and Yxxta with assist healing, but that's only when a real tank wasn't available.  It's touch and go too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I just don't want to get hit by that stuff.  I have no snap aggro ability per se, so if the tank dies in an XP group, the cleric's going to bite it before I do which makes the whole point moot for rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have no snap aggro ability per se,  <br />
<br />
Wait, what about instill doubt?<br />
<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER: This question is not meant to be taken SERIOUSLY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Magruda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Instill doubt does not work like you think it does. I've tested it a few times to see if i could get agro from the tank. Here's what happend.<br />
<br />
1. It takes longer for you to initiate an instil doubt that it does for your flying kick to refreash. This means after you hit the ID button your waiting about 10 sec before the ability hits the mob.<br />
<br />
2. There is a chance the instil doubt won't work, based off skill. You'll get the message 'Your not scaring anyone'<br />
<br />
3. If it does work you have to be able to hit them with a melee attack. You can miss with this, and have to start all over. <br />
<br />
4. If we were to used it to gain agro precievably we would want to get a mob off a caster. Well since you can't tell exactly when the instil doubt will go off and the caster is running around like an idiot you have to follow the mob around and hope the instil doubt goes off when your actualy within range of the mob.<br />
<br />
My advice is next time your standing around not doing anything ask a monk nearby to instil a moss snake. See how long it takes him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The more and more I read and conduct my own research, the less I feel about monk improvements to mitigation.  If Monk AC is to equal Knight AC through caps, then the developers might as well wipe out the Shadowknight class. Currently, (thats with the cap) Monks are taking less DPR (Average Damage Per Round).  Boosting the cap will place monks significantly ahead of Knights in terms of taking damage.  The HP difference is in favor of the Shadowknights by around 1400-1500 HP.  With no spell that gurantees a Complete Heal anymore, the HP difference is nothing to write home to the folks about when standing in the shadow of superior DPR. Aside from the avoidance/damage handling superiorities, monks have the benefit of a short reuse 90% DI mitigation discipline coupled with an 18-second melee-immunity discipline.  To compensate, SKs have some utility and 2 spells to aid with tanking, but these are not even coming close to rising above what monks [ability to handle damage] would be. As it stands already, monks handle damage far better than shadowknights are, giving little reason for monks to receive an all-time mitigation improvement.  This does not include aggro, merely ability to handle damage. Aggro-generation for melee is heavily dependant on what stage of the game a person is in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Boosting the cap will place monks significantly ahead of Knights in terms of taking damage.  <br />
<br />
That's where the OTHER HALF of the Monkly Business agenda comes in. Many of us monks support a boost to knight mitigation ... such as giving SK's and Paladins both a watered down form of defensive, as well as the same -1 DI bonus that only warriors currently enjoy.<br />
<br />
The superior hit point gap that warriors have as well as the better defensive disc will still mean warriors have a tanking edge. But it will help improve knight tank-ability.<br />
<br />
And, as many here have pointed out, aggro is a NON-issue here. So knight spells ... warrior incite ... whatever, it simply doesn't enter into the tank equation anymore. As Liper and Frodlin and a few others have pointed out.<br />
<br />
Which means tanking is all about damage taken ... and the hit points you have to absorb the damage.<br />
<br />
We monks don't want to out-tank knights. We simply want to take damage better than we do. More consistently. Because the mitigation is horrendously bad for the monks.<br />
<br />
We're more than happy with having the HIGHER HIT POINT HAVING knights get a mitigation boost.<br />
<br />
Of course, that would mean knights would be viable XP and Raid Tanks probably.<br />
<br />
Which means the most hypocritical among you here would have hissy fits about that.<br />
<br />
But hey, who cares anymore?</div></div><hr />

funny you mention that because the watered down form of defensive is no longer something Paladins are even asking for...<br />
<br />
What you are saying though is eroding any warrior distinctive traits...<br />
<br />

<br />
You might be right there, but comparing your selves to knights is retarded.<br />
<br />
Compare yourself to CHAIN first and then push for reform in that area, bitching and moaning because you mitigate so bad you can't tank is not what will get you a fix.</div></div><hr />

Chum you are just freaking retarded. You come here and expect warriors to consider your arguments when your aspiration is to see the only utility they have get equaled by 2 other classes so you can get an upgrade. Most of the monks here just dont understand that if you want something in this game its good to have the support of potentially affected classes. Thats why warriors got upgrades. People saw the merit of it and didnt see their role completely compromised by it.<br />

<br />
It speaks volumes that many monks have nothing to say about the suggestions I've made about helping you in pulls, just like they've said little to nothing on the other ideas presented in this thread. It shows that it's not help you want in pulls, you just want a mitigation upgrade. You're just using pulling as a convenient excuse.<br />

Go back to CoH and your Scrapper. I hear you're happy there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">&quot; is no longer something Paladins are even asking for...&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm a monk. I'm not a paladin. This is part of the plan to improve monks. If the major stumbling block to improving monk defense is that it encroaches on knights, then the solution is to boost knights in the process. Monks aren't out to encroach on knights. They're out to improve their own class. If we can improve OTHER classes as well, the more the merrier. There's nothing wrong with helping knights out.<br />
<br />
&quot;but comparing your selves to knights is retarded.&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree. Which reinforces my point about how retarded your posts are Liper. YOU brought knight tanking up. Not the monks. You.<br />
<br />
Monks simply want to improve their mitigation. That's all. You started this thread. And you brought up knights. If knights have to improve for monks to improve, well, then do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Making them raid tanks? they are already for offtanking roles for the most part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes. Make them raid tanks. They're tanks. They shouldn't be relegated to offtank duty. That's not what a REAL tank does. They wear PLATE MAIL armor. They're TANKS! You said it yourself. They're supposed to be tanks. Monks aren't. Well, part of that role of tanking is ... raid tanking.<br />
<br />
Tanking is very unbalanced right now. Instead of nerfing warriors down to knight levels, it's far better for everyone in the EQ world if they just improve knights. It's been two whole expansions and a third one is on the horizon. It's time for knights to get some melee rebalancing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your giving them unwarranted boosts.&quot;<br />
<br />
You made the case Liper. You convinced me. KNIGHTS ARE TANKS. KNIGHTS WEAR PLATE. These boosts are very warranted. What's unwarranted is that warriors have sole possession of the tanking role. That's unbalanced.<br />
<br />
&quot;You come here and expect warriors to consider your arguments when your aspiration is to see the only utility they have get equaled by 2 other classes so you can get an upgrade.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, I do. I think it's high time some of you morons saw life through a monk's perspective.<br />
<br />
Monks are a DPS class. And they get equalled and surpassed by more than 2 classes in THAT role.<br />
<br />
Monks are a pulling class. And they get equalled by 2 other classes in that capacity.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, I definitely think it's valuable for some of you to have your blinders removed. To see the EQ world through monk-like eyes. To see your so-called ROLE ... SHARED with other classes.<br />
<br />
Everyone else shares their role. You should too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the monks here just dont understand that if you want something in this game its good to have the support of potentially affected classes. &quot;<br />
<br />
Most of you seem to forget who got MONKS nerfed. Monks haven't. There was never any chance of getting support from warriors. Never will be. Doesn't matter at all to monks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Wait, what about instill doubt?<br />
<br />
Even non-seriously no one has claimed that instill doubt is &quot;snap aggro&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Pardon me if I ever brought knights up when you (monks) have said if we mitigated like a tank we'd still be too far behind tanks... so I show you how.  Wait, that's monks bringing it up first.<br />
<br />
I'm a monk. I'm not a paladin. This is part of the plan to improve monks. If the major stumbling block to improving monk defense is that it encroaches on knights, then the solution is to boost knights in the process.  <br />
<br />
yeah screw the game as a whole, it's all about monks!<br />
<br />
Hell, we should give monks right click chs, fastheals, debuffs, slows etc, so the whole game can be based around monks solely now!<br />
<br />
Monks aren't out to encroach on knights. They're out to improve their own class.  <br />
<br />
it doesn't matter what, that's all monks care about now, not everquest, going back to god mode.<br />
<br />
Monks simply want to improve their mitigation. That's all. <br />
<br />
it's so simple and reasonable when put that way, but wait there's the big picture you want to ignore as usual.  There's the issue of improving it to the point you want is totally unbalancing.  <br />
<br />
If knights have to improve for monks to improve, well, then do it. <br />
<br />
You're saying to improve monks knights have to be improved... sorry improve them too much and you're at the point that warriors have no point.<br />
<br />
Or would you then have everyone improved to the point where it's balanced, which would be right back where we are now, balanced.<br />
<br />
If you can agree on a fix that doesn't unbalance anything do it.  But this mitigation shit is just that, shit that does nothing but turn on the god mode.<br />
<br />
Yes. Make them raid tanks. They're tanks. They shouldn't be relegated to offtank duty. That's not what a REAL tank does.  <br />
<br />
you do realise it's called offtanking for a reason, you know, you need a tank  to offtank.<br />
<br />
Well, part of that role of tanking is ... raid tanking. <br />
<br />
Offtanking is part of that, but to be frank paladins have many more roles then just tanking.  so it makes sense they aren't the tanks of end game bosses. 0h n0s balance! cause beyond the first few warriors, there's not much reason for any other warrior on the raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tanking is very unbalanced right now. Instead of nerfing warriors down to knight levels, it's far better for everyone in the EQ world if they just improve knights.  <br />
<br />
Actually it's pretty balanced at the moment, some adjustments do need to be made in the knight area, but nothing needs completely changed as you want to do.<br />
<br />
You made the case Liper. You convinced me. KNIGHTS ARE TANKS. KNIGHTS WEAR PLATE. These boosts are very warranted. What's unwarranted is that warriors have sole possession of the tanking role. That's unbalanced. <br />
<br />
What are you saying that we have sole possession of? offtanking (if you know much about your raids, war/pal/sk are interchangable for this most if not all the time)<br />
For exp groups (if you group much you know any of the three work)<br />
For cutting edge/very difficult mobs? (yes got us there!)<br />
<br />
So we are the only tank for nastiest fights, oh no....<br />
<br />
Paladins are the only tank for rezing, curing and buffs.<br />
Shadowknights are the only tank that can pull, that can give mana/hp to group, and aggro buff.<br />
<br />
yeah knights need a huge fucking boost so warriors no longer need to play.<br />
<br />
Yes, I do. I think it's high time some of you morons saw life through a monk's perspective. <br />
<br />
Monks are the PRIMARY pullers, period, for a raid.<br />
Monks do more DPS then any of the other pullers.<br />
Monks take damage overall better then ANY class but tanks.<br />
<br />
yeah sounds like bieng a monk totally blows.<br />
<br />
Monks are a pulling class. And they get equalled by 2 other classes in that capacity. <br />
<br />
There is ONE class that comes close, and that's only as they have enough mana.<br />
<br />
Most of you seem to forget who got MONKS nerfed. Monks haven't. There was never any chance of getting support from warriors. Never will be. Doesn't matter at all to monks. <br />
<br />
You seem to forget who was right in that case, who was right in fixing content and not whoring out defensive, and who's right here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Oh Please, Liper. Your logic is now getting all twisted. Because you don't care about balance at all. You brought up knights. You were the one who plugged numbers into Thep's parse, to show monks versus knights. YOU. Not monks.<br />
<br />
&quot;going back to god mode.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's bullshit. There is no god mode anymore. Mobs hit too hard for god mode. Considering how many times you've said crap like &quot;It's been YEARS, get USED to it&quot; and other assorted shit like that, I find it TYPICAL that you'd backpedal now, and use that kind of argument. When it suits you. It's what you do when you troll. You simply use whatever BS argument suits you at the moment. As you once said, the game has CHANGED. When people are XPing off in the elemental planes, or in flagged zones in Gates of Discord, there is no more &quot;GOD MODE&quot; for you to fear. So when you say something like that, you're simply backpedaling, because you ran out of crap to argue about.<br />
<br />
&quot;sorry improve them too much and you're at the point that warriors have no point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not at all. We'd then be at a point where warriors would have to SHARE their role with other classes. ALL of their roles. Just like the other classes do. That's a balanced point to be at. The point we're at now isn't balanced. I can see, being a warrior, and being Liper, that you'd not be able to objectively or even constructively consider this point. Which is why I bring it up. To demonstrate how easy it is for you to circle back around when YOUR logic starts to hit you in YOUR class' role.<br />
<br />
&quot;you do realise it's called offtanking for a reason, you know, you need a tank to offtank.&quot;<br />
<br />
This one's easy to address. Imagine if your role was reversed. If KNIGHTS were the raid tanks. And WARRIORS were offtanks.<br />
<br />
Would you be happy with this?<br />
<br />
You say knights are meant to tank. You say PLATE armor is the dividing line between TANKS and NON-TANKS. But you don't mean it. You still want knights to be INFERIOR to warriors as tanks. Even though they're TANKS. Even though they wear PLATE armor. Magical plate armor. Just like warriors. But no, knights should be happy to be OFFtanks. Not REAL tanks. Not good tanks. Just INFERIOR tanks.<br />
<br />
But when a monk starts talking about getting their mitigation penalty removed, then it's time to change your BULLSHIT ... and start crusading for KNIGHTS! Now, when it's a monk simply trying to get a nerf removed ... NOW it's time to start talking about how this encroaches on knights and their tanking role. Now it's time to start talking about how this would hurt knights and unbalance tanks.<br />
<br />
That's hypocritical. But typical for you. Still, you did convince me of one thing in all of your ramblings. You did convince me that Knights are TANKS. And thus, I feel the tanking imbalance that exists needs to be removed. Knights and Warriors need to be interchangable. It's good for the game as a whole. It opens up a whole new world for knights, and eases up some of the requirements guilds are facing trying to progress through the game. And Warriors can always fall back on their UTILITY. Just like Monks. Warriors can always be a fine DPS class. Just like monks. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you saying that we have sole possession of?&quot;<br />
<br />
Boss mob tanking. That you even ask this question shows how argumentative you're trying to be here. You get so caught up in trying to be an ass, you simply skim right through the fucking obvious. WARRIORS ARE BOSS MOB TANKS. THIS IS UNBALANCED. KNIGHTS SHOULD TANK BOSSES TOO. BECAUSE PLATE MAIL ARMOR IS THE MEASURING STICK YOU CONVINCED ME OF. AND KNIGHTS WEAR IT TOO.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks are the PRIMARY pullers, period, for a raid.&quot;<br />
<br />
No. They're NOT. That's the problem with the class. And its ROLE. You are NOT a monk. You do NOT pull. You have no concept of how to pull. This is demonstrated in MUCH of what you've posted. Please, do not even begin to try and discuss this. Monks are NOT the primary pullers in this game. They SHARE that role. With BARDS.<br />
<br />
UNLIKE warriors, who do NOT share their role of BOSS MOB TANKS with anyone else in the game. There is a difference. And in the interest of balance, it's time for WARRIORS to SHARE a role.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks do more DPS then any of the other pullers.&quot;<br />
<br />
So what? That's stupid. That's like me saying Druids do more DPS than any of the other healers. Who cares?<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks take damage overall better then ANY class but tanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, this is damning with faint praise. Who gives a shit that monks take damage better overall than a freakin wizard? They certainly don't mitigate better than much of anything. And they don't spend much time TAKING damage. It'd be like me saying warriors have great mana pools. What does it matter, if it's NOT part of the role of the class ... as you are so eager to point out?<br />
<br />
You've said time and time again that monks aren't meant to tank. So, if you're right, WHO GIVES A SHIT THAT MONKS TAKE DAMAGE AT ALL? It's not their function.<br />
<br />
Monk DPS certainly isn't scale of DPS classes. It lags behind Rogues and Wizards. Comparing their DPS to bards is laughable.<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah sounds like bieng a monk totally blows.&quot;<br />
<br />
Play one and find out. They have no ROLE. They are not the best at ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is ONE class that comes close, and that's only as they have enough mana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously Liper. Stop acting like you know a damn thing about pulling or RAID pulling. You don't. There are more than one class that can adequately pull raid encounters. There are 3 classes that are best at it. Monks share the role of primary puller with TWO other classes. You really don't have the experience to dispute this shit here.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to forget who was right in that case, who was right in fixing content and not whoring out defensive, and who's right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The warrior in question who started the &quot;furor&quot; over monk rampage tanking admitted the solution was NOT RIGHT ages ago. Content wasn't fixed. And you're definitely not right about much of anything you've posted. Most certainly not right about anything you've posted regarding MONKS, PULLING, or the MONK CLASS in Everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If knights have to improve for monks to improve, well, then do it. <br />
The relative power gap between knights and warriors was just recently corrected, and can be assumed to be &quot;correct&quot; currently.  Therefore, any improvement made to knights now implies that a corresponding improvement must be made to warriors.<br />
<br />
Well, then, do it!<br />
<br />
Improve warriors so that monks can be improved.<br />
<br />
So says Wubao. :)<br />
<br />
Of course, mobs are tuned according to warrior power, not monk power...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Xainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Heh... you see this all the time in debates... if you can't argue against something, ridicule it, sometimes it works.<br />
<br />
Sorry, you'll have to come up with something better. Like how it affects ALL classes to the same amount and degree as it does monks, or even anywhere close.<br />
<br />
Is that the best you can do to refute the argument?<br />
<br />
But keep with the insinuations.  Keep with the accusations of deceit and trickery and sophistry.Whatever.  I never accused you of deceit or sophistry or trickery.<br />
<br />
I accused you of being full of shit.  Though I'm beginning to suspect deliberately obtuse may be more accurate.<br />
<br />
If you can't see how those classes furthest past the softcap would benefit most from a removal of the softcap, I'm not sure anyone could explain it to you.<br />
<br />
Besides, Daemon, you still think Monks want the HardCap removed.Weren't you the one that was talking about my being full of shit?<br />
<br />
YOUR VERY SUGGESTIONS make you take LESS average damage than a knight, in essence, tanking BETTER than knights.<br />
<br />
Yet you claim not to want such a thing.<br />
<br />
You, sir, are so full of shit, you stink.Of course, Daemon, because the ONLY thing that makes a Tank is Damage over Time.<br />
<br />
Which is precisely why monks currently outtank Knights.<br />
<br />
Moron.Why? It's a perfectly valid argument. You can't seem to form any real argument against it, except to tell me to &quot;let it the fuck go&quot;. You know what that says to me? &quot;I have no argument against it, so quit mentioning it.&quot;What it should have said to you is that it's been dismissed and refuted so many times in manners so eloquent and rational that only a fucking BRICK would still bring it up.<br />
<br />
Let me try again, just for you.<br />
<br />
50AC SILK should mitigate better than 5AC STEEL.<br />
<br />
BECAUSE THE NUMBER IS BIGGER.<br />
<br />
20AC SILK should mitigate the same as 20AC STEEL.<br />
<br />
BECAUSE THE NUMBER IS THE SAME.<br />
<br />
If you do it any other way, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF THE NUMBER?It speaks volumes that many monks have nothing to say about the suggestions I've made about helping you in pulls, just like they've said little to nothing on the other ideas presented in this thread. It shows that it's not help you want in pulls, you just want a mitigation upgrade. You're just using pulling as a convenient excuse.Based on several of your posts, Daemon, just about anything can speak volumes to you, even if nothing is said at all.<br />
<br />
Simply because I don't feel like explaining it yet again, doesn't mean I haven't already explained it.<br />
<br />
Mitigation would help us while pulling<br />
Mitigation would help us be more survivable, while taking hits.<br />
Mitigation would even help us tank better than we do now.<br />
<br />
But it would take mitigation better than what a fucking Warrior has for us to Tank better than a Warrior does, because Tanking isn't only about Damage Taken over Time.<br />
<br />
And I've not seen any Monk ask for that.Go back to CoH and your Scrapper. I hear you're happy there.Just hit lvl 26 tonight.<br />
<br />
Thanks for caring.</div></div><hr />

Yes I plugged the numbers in to PROVE how unbalancing and unreasonable it is for monks to have TANK mitigation.<br />
<br />
Yes monks didn't do the numbers, I did to shut them up, but all it did was go to show how &quot;stupid&quot; I was for doing math and showing how insanely close it was to warriors with all of our &quot;advantages&quot;.  Any similiarities were immediatly dismissed by you because YOU in all your grand wisdom are going to cap avoidance at 40, and do all sorts of other changes to existing items and systems, so your one class can be godly again.<br />
<br />
That's bullshit. There is no god mode anymore... <br />
<br />
Let me hold it there because the rest is just slanderous statments meant to discredit without giving any reason, ad hominem.<br />
<br />
You're right there is no god mode anymore and never will be, unless devs gave monks everything they are asking for.<br />
<br />
Not at all. We'd then be at a point where warriors would have to SHARE their role with other classes. <br />
<br />
Every role and facet of tanking EXCEPT for one, is done by one of the other three tanks.  The other two have equally important things they can do that a warrior can't.  That is balanced and is not unfair.<br />
<br />
This one's easy to address. Imagine if your role was reversed. If KNIGHTS were the raid tanks. And WARRIORS were offtanks.<br />
<br />
Would you be happy with this?<br />
<br />
Imagine that example as bieng retarded, would you be happy answering it? no, but I'm going to anyhow.<br />
<br />
If that's what warriors were meant to be and we excelled in something else, yes I would be happy because that's what my class is.  If my class was meant to be the raid MT and wasn't I'd be unhappy, fortunately it is, and I am.<br />
<br />
You say knights are meant to tank. You say PLATE armor is the dividing line between TANKS and NON-TANKS. But you don't mean it. You still want knights to be INFERIOR to warriors as tanks. Even though they're TANKS. Even though they wear PLATE armor. Magical plate armor. Just like warriors. But no, knights should be happy to be OFFtanks. Not REAL tanks. Not good tanks. Just INFERIOR tanks <br />
<br />
When you work in a big company, and say you're a VP of Sales, and your friend is the VP of Manufactering.<br />
<br />
You get alot more glory because you're where the money signs start coming in.  But your friend is just as important even if not as glorified.  offtank and raid tank doesn't make a tank inferior.  When a tank is inferior is when they can't even do the same content together, and this is usually if not always a issue with gear.<br />
<br />
If you want to sling the word inferior you need to say warriors while superior in tanking are inferior in ressing, healing, rooting, fding, buffing, curing....<br />
<br />
Balance amongst the tanks currently is all tanks can do EXP content anywhere and everywhere.<br />
All tanks can offtank for the most part except special occasions.<br />
One third is the only viable tank for hard hitting targets of raids...<br />
It's funny you even mention the offtanking becaues PALADINS are superior at it because of thier RANGED SNAP AGGRO.<br />
<br />
trying to insult any tank with the word inferior just because they are not MT is retarded.<br />
<br />
I've talked with the paladins over at PoN and THEY DON&quot;T think a imbalance exists so who are you to try and say they need radical changes....<br />
<br />
Trying to say I've got this twisted logic is just more rhetoric, you're running in circles saying the same BS over and over, without providing ANYTHING but attacks with no basis.<br />
<br />
Who gives a shit that monks take damage better overall than a freakin wizard? <br />
You're right, but who cares if they take better damage then a paladin or shadowknight?  the tanks do.  See you took the issue and changed it to something unrelated, again, and then tried to make it sound like that was the issue I have been presenting, more of your bullshit at work.<br />
<br />
So, if you're right, WHO GIVES A SHIT THAT MONKS TAKE DAMAGE AT ALL? It's not their function. <br />
<br />
Why do you care then if it's not your function? that's right because you want it to be your function, you want advantages more then your class should have.<br />
<br />
Play one and find out. They have no ROLE. They are not the best at ANYTHING. <br />
<br />
bullshit and totally wrong.  Monks are THE BEST at raid pulling.<br />
Monks share the role of primary puller with TWO other classes. You really don't have the experience to dispute this shit here. <br />
<br />
Ah so on all the raids monks aren't the preferred pullers it's bards? or is it SKs? no wait, they tend to have a hard time doing it as well as monks....  <br />
<br />
So since my guild does it wrong and all the guilds I know, explain to me how you can't be the best puller that these other two are somehow soo much better.<br />
<br />
The warrior in question who started the &quot;furor&quot; over monk rampage tanking admitted the solution was NOT RIGHT ages ago. Content wasn't fixed. And you're definitely not right about much of anything you've posted. Most certainly not right about anything you've posted regarding MONKS, PULLING, or the MONK CLASS in Everquest. <br />
<br />
I was talking about GoD with tanks, see that got fixed and all is happy with the three tanks, there was a problem I guess you're unaware of that when god came out knights simply couldn't tank there.<br />
<br />
Wubao I'm tired of your pedantic arguments, running around screaming how someone is sooo wrong and you NEVER provide any real fact, you just say here's his qoute on how we would be close to tanks but who cares if we tank better then wizards?....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">But it would take mitigation better than what a fucking Warrior has for us to Tank better than a Warrior does, because Tanking isn't only about Damage Taken over Time. <br />
<br />
So how would mitigation above a warrior help you tank when tanking isn't about damage taken over time (you know that thing mitigation affects)?<br />
<br />
No one will argue that monk aggro is behind warrior aggro, but it's really ignorant to claim monks would never generate the aggro to tank for a exp group (which is the issue)<br />
<br />
True a warrior in a fairly decent length fight would be lightyears ahead in aggro, the problem is 15million points of aggro doesn't mean anything more then 500pts of aggro if each person in the group only has 499pts of aggro....<br />
<br />
You get the reason why the oppostion?  Becuase you can, and more then often enough have the aggro to tank for exp groups.  Giving you the mitigation to do so is just begging to put tanks out to pasture except for raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Umm...<br />

<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
One would almost suspect you're intentionally being a dumbass.  I very clearly state that incite isn't snap aggro.  And I suggest that instill doubt combined with pull aggro might get one results similar to incite, at least initially.  Ergo it's pretty obvious that I don't consider instill doubt combined with pull aggro to be snap aggro either.  Instill doubt, regardless of what you may like to claim, will generate additional aggro when successful.  But please, feel free to yammer on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">&quot;bullshit and totally wrong. Monks are THE BEST at raid pulling.&quot;<br />
<br />
No. They're not. They share that role with bards and shadowknights. What's crazy is, monks have been sharing the role of raid pulling with SKs for a long, LONG time. I remember Plane of Fear raids a long, long time ago that used SKs over monks. Same with PoSky.<br />
<br />
&quot;So since my guild ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Your guild isn't the ONLY guild in the world. There are examples of guilds who are progressed farther than your guild who have stopped using monks to pull raid content. There are examples of guilds that progressed through the content you and your guild are CURRENTLY on who used bards and SKs to pull the exact content you are currently working on. <br />
<br />
Bards, Monks, SKs can ALL pull the exact same things in this game. And can do so just as well as each other. <br />
<br />
A monk's role is SHARED. Both a monk's RAID role. And a monk's GROUP role. That of puller.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just in case this isn't sinking in, because I don't think it's going to ... there are guilds that can pull everything YOUR guild pulls, without even having a monk on their ROSTER. Can your guild get by with monks? Yes. Can another guild get by without a monk? YES. That's the difference. The role is SHARED. Monks are NOT the best. They SHARE being best puller with two other classes. Now think about warriors. Could guilds do the same thing without warriors? DO guilds TRY to do the same thing without warriors? No.<br />
<br />
Monk DPS is definitely below DPS classes. There's nothing a monk is superior at.<br />
<br />
If you actually PLAYED a monk, you'd realize this. Instead you play an ogre warrior that trolls monk message boards.</div></div><hr />

Ive never had a &quot;problem&quot; with pulling as a monk, infact 9 times out of 10 if I performed the same pull as a warrior I would infact take much more damage before getting back to the camp then I would as a monk.<br />
<br />
Monks can, and do tank Kodtaz+ already. The very first time I took a group into Ikkinz2 (before it was nerfed and the mobs made slowable amongst other changes) we had a monk tanking the 2nd Priest. While we didnt win, the monk lived a very long time tanking this mob designed to be tanked by a warrior. Amazingly enough in this indoor environment with mobs running faster then run5, the monk was able to pull just fine, and infact tank half of the boss fight without major problems.<br />

This whole thread is simply bullshit and lies piled on top of one another until any point that anyone had was long since erased.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was your statement, without quotes. oops.<br />
<br />
If you can't see how those classes furthest past the softcap would benefit most from a removal of the softcap, I'm not sure anyone could explain it to you.<br />
<br />
Considering they don't normally even get hit... <br />
<br />
What were you saying about being deliberately obtuse? Yes. Pot, kettle, black.<br />
<br />
Besides, Daemon, you still think Monks want the HardCap removed.<br />
<br />
Prove it. Oh, wait, you're full of shit again.<br />
<br />
Which is precisely why monks currently outtank Knights.<br />
<br />
Proven by parses. Also proven by the monks that keep aggro off of me when they chose to.<br />

20AC SILK should mitigate the same as 20AC STEEL.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Bullshit. If I get punched in the chest wearing a average steel breastplate, I'm not going to care. If I get punched in the chest wearing a spider silk shirt (about the strongest silk in the world, woven right) It's going to fucking hurt like hell. That's just the way it is. The BEST silk in the world shouldn't be as good as the worst plate.<br />
<br />
Silk classes should ALWAYS mitigate worse then leather, who should mitigate worse than chain, who should mitigate worse than plate. It's called REALITY. If people can abuse the system and get high AC crap, they STILL shouldn't be able to mitigate like the class that wears the higher/stronger armour.<br />
<br />
[/quote]If you do it any other way, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF THE NUMBER?Based on several of your posts, Daemon, just about anything can speak volumes to you, even if nothing is said at all.[/quote]<br />
<br />
The point of the number is to reflect the reality that silk &lt; leather &lt; chain &lt; plate... where the AC always goes down as the armour set goes from plate to silk. Duh. Leather wearers should NOT be able to obtain the same AC as chain classes, and since itemization is such that it can happen, there must be other steps to ensure that it stays that way. Going by the fact that you wear leather, I say that the monk AC in that parse is about 300-400AC higher than it should be given the fact that you wear leather, and what the other leather wearing classes in the parse have for AC.<br />
<br />
Mitigation would help us while pulling<br />
Mitigation would help us be more survivable, while taking hits.<br />
Mitigation would even help us tank better than we do now.<br />
<br />
Exactly. You &quot;just want to tank better&quot;. <br />
<br />
You're not a fucking tank, you shouldn't be tanking like one.<br />
<br />
But it would take mitigation better than what a fucking Warrior has for us to Tank better than a Warrior does, because Tanking isn't only about Damage Taken over Time.<br />
<br />
You're right. tanking = ability to take damage + aggro control. It's not that hard for a monk to do what warriors do, look for high aggro weapons, and aug them with more aggro.<br />
<br />
Secondly, in trivialized content it's quite conceivable that a monk could be used as a tank, given the fact they can also pull for the initial aggro, plus they have better DPS than the tanks. I hear about beastlords getting used to tank LDoN's all the time.<br />
<br />
Would monks ever tank cutting edge content? Unlikely. Non cutting edge content? The content that knights usually tank? There's the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, no and more no.  <br />
<br />
Mob damage output is significantly lower in Omens than it was in Gates, you will ALREADY be able to tank in Omens without TOUCHING your mitigation, but the mob mopdel in omens has lowered DPS and longer fights, lowering the value of warriors from the getgo.  Adding other &quot;tank classes&quot; to the mix, and furthermore, with every zone but one unlocked, there's significantly more &quot;overlap&quot; than the previous 2 expansions.<br />
<br />
It's even MORE important that &quot;attack on&quot; mitigation should remain as is with this new mob model than in PoP/GoD era.  <br />
<br />
You want something to help you survive pulls?  Great!  You have my support for an &quot;attack off&quot; mitigation bonus.  Anything else is simply too much, and will hose the shit out of warriors and knights, particularly in Omens.<br />

Xainn, to answer your question.... the AC &quot;number&quot; refers to &quot;YOU&quot;.   A 50AC silk robe is more helpful than a 20AC silk robe to the silk robe wearer, and that's the only thing that really matters.    To the person who can equip something, the number means something.   There doesn't have to be an absolute relative identical benefit to AC across all classes for AC to be meaningful.<br />
<br />
The current model is FAR more logical than an &quot;across the board&quot; 1AC=1AC model.</div></div><hr />

I know it wasn't addressed to me but I have to point out that a 50AC silk robe is even more helpful to a plate tank than a 20ac steel breastplate. ( providing of course they can wear it. ) Just as a 50 ac leather tunic is more helpful to a plate class than a 20 ac steel breastplate. That shoots the theory of &quot;because it's leather&quot; right in the foot.<br />

The current system only makes sense to those upper armor types ( ie plate ) who can equip any lesser form of armor and get the same benifit regardless of the material type.</div></div><hr />

Particularly when some classes are masters at getting more out of any old club or staff in combat than other classes.  So just like a Warrior will get more out of a 30 AC leather tunic than a Monk, a Monk will get more out of a 12/20 1hand club than a Warrior.</div></div><hr />

Monks get more class weapons then anyone, certainly MANY MANY more then warriors. You get a class weapon off EP gods, warriors dont. You get 2 class weapons in Time, everyone else gets 1. In GOD is where it gets really ridiculous, monks get class weapons in Uqua, Qvic, Inktuta AND Txevu. They almost definitely also get one in Tacvi aswell but its from the north path. Thats right, class weapons from 5 zones in a row.</div></div><hr />

The tanking I was able to do was only with a shaman , druid and cleric , no real DPS so in the end very unefficiant.  Does it make me a threat?  Also we was just waiting for the tank to get there =).<br />
<br />
<br />
In my guild I tend to pull alot , and success or failure can  happen  depending on alot of things.   Hell , Ive screwed  pulls just turning away from the screen for a few seconds.  <br />
<br />
My 2 beefs with my class are surviving pulls and DPS.<br />
<br />
And honestly , In  my experiance its  how fast mobs hit , and how many  that are hitting me that  decide wiether I live or die.  From my understanding  more hits = more chances for stuns .  Stuns kill me more often than anything else because with the game as it is today , the careful, single pulling days are gone and my goal is to get the mob/mobs  there as fast as I can and FDing  a assload of times kinda screws that.<br />
<br />
So I have 2 things that , as a monk I would like. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. The ability to survive aggro and the damage that comes with it during a pull ,and maybe those odd times a tank Rage spins a mob =) <br />
<br />
2. DPS that is equal to what is expected of a class that is &quot;supposed&quot; to be at or near the top of the melee DPS ladder.  <br />
<br />
I tend to wander around in some of my comments but you get the idea.  <br />
<br />
As far as tanking mobs , well If i wanna head to a old zone like Seb or even Grieg's and solo a couple mobs every 10 minutes or so  I highly doubt  warriors are gonna fiind too much fault in that , and if there are some that do  come and watch my necro  eat through mobs faster than some groups do =) <br />

He is right, he was able to tank with no problem in the EP's WIITH the mitigation as it currently stands.   Nothing to &quot;dispute&quot; here.   <br />

I want to help him get the pulling tools he wants, and the DPS he's after, but not at the price of him being a viable tank for current content, thus the &quot;attack off&quot; mitigation bonus.<br />

Incorrect Superchum.  Your point has been repeatedly made, you want greater survivability by a mitigation change.  That's the only thing you seem to feel is an &quot;appropriate&quot; fix for what you feel the problem is.  Yet if pulling is &quot;the problem&quot; why are all other approaches to fixing it other than a mitigation improvement rejected out of hand or only given a superficial regard before moving back to mitigation?  It makes your argument lack credibility.<br />
<br />
This guy at least seems to be open to the idea that he doesn't have to be returned to &quot;super toon&quot; to be effective and would probably be open to changes that addressed his concerns without &quot;giving back Monk's old mitigation&quot; as the only possible viable solution.<br />
<br />
Edit:  And if outside the Monk board the biggest supporters for a reversal of the Monk mitigation nerf are Warriors, you're in a serious world of hurt on getting that to ever happen.  If the Druids, Shamans, Clerics, and so on aren't in your corner, I'd say your chances of making it happen are pretty remote.</div></div><hr />

From a raid perspective I can guarantee you that mitigation has absolutely nothing to do with a monk's lack of desirability on the roster.  Monks are pullers and DPS.  For pulling they are second to bards in most cases.  For DPS they are second to many classes.  That's why they're not in high demand.

Then you certainly can't claim to have a popular mandate that Monks must be returned their prenerf mitigation.  So in the end it all amounts to Monks spending the last two years bitching about what they used to have and demanding it be returned while everyone else goes merrily on about their business without any real concern.  Guess that's tough luck for the Monk class, since so many of you seem to have your heart set on something pretty pattenedly unreasonable.  It must suck to have been a near &quot;god&quot; class for so long to become mere mortals like most of the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

Not only that, but when someone pulls the goal is to not get hit in the first place.  Adding to their mitigation is only stupifying the game further because of the lack of skill some of these monks are displaying.  If someone is getting flattened by their pulls constantly, &quot;they're&quot; doing something wrong, not their class.<br />
<br />
Even a warrior would get flattened while pulling if he was stupid enough to let the crowd catch up to him.  The point of pulling is to get the mobs back to camp, not to be a punching bag the entire way, not to stand there and tank for a few seconds, nor stand there like an idiot until the mobs catch up to you before hitting feign.  A skilled monk won't have these problems, and would have absolutely no need for an increased mitigation boost while pulling.  He would never utilize it, other than those rare circumstances when he messed up... and that's his fault, not the classe's fault.  Should wizards be given a few K more HPs simply because the circumstances when a wizard can be stupid exist?  Hell no.  It's the person playing the wizard's fault he drew aggro, not his classes fault.  The skilled player knows their limitations and doesn't step over that line.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if people would learn to take advantage of their strengths, and not constantly trip over their weaknesses, instead of just giving up, proclaiming their class is broken or not big enough, or that their spellbooks are worthless.  Those of us that actually do understand how to be wicked at the classes we play will only become overpowered after the game has been stupified further for those of you that do not.</div></div><hr />

Verant said that FD pulling wasnt entended then turned around and starting in Velious  (ST is a perfect example)  and practically built it around  FD pulling.<br />
<br />
 Let me add to this a bit more so theres no confusion...<br />
<br />
You will agree that &quot;kiting&quot; is basically running in a giant circle correct?<br />
Pulling  is gathering one or more mobs and bringing them to a raid/group  in the fastest and least dangerous  way that can be done.  Last night in PoE pulling  Stone ring the Crumbling? Rubbles  couldnt be aggro except by me running up next to them .  Getting aggro and turning fast I was getting stunned and snared.  <br />
<br />
So there are examples in the game were standing far away and tossing a shrukien isnt viable.  In just that instance Im expected to  get up next to the mobs and try to bring them in  fast!  FDing is something  that I dont like to use unless I have more mobs than I think the raid/group can handle.  It just  slows things down.<br />
<br />
Im not saying that mitigation is the answer .    But coming up with  something that doesnt step on another classes toes in some form is obviously  harder  than it sounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed it is.  But let me ask you this question, just out of curiosity.  If instead of you as a Monk pulling, the puller was a Warrior, do you really believe the Warrior would die less often even with his superior mitigation?<br />
<br />
My point being that while Monks have trouble from time to time surviving pulls, Warriors have an even harder time of it under most situations that would be considered &quot;difficult&quot;.  Warriors aren't looking to move into Monk territory.  It seems that Monks should have the same courtesy and not look to be moving into Warrior territory, don't you think?  Well, apparently you do in fact think that, but a number of your fellow Monks don't seem to see the wisdom.</div></div><hr />

I'm curious if most of the monks in question are using ranged items to pull and/or have runspeed AA's.  Pretty much every pull up to Uqua for me was shoot arrow and bring mob back, no problem at all.  Anyhow provide me some information :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Pulling  is gathering one or more mobs and bringing them to a raid/group  in the fastest and least dangerous  way that can be done.

<br />
Should monks get an immunity to death touch because some mobs out there death touch, making the initial pull impossible?  No, of course not.  Some mobs are positioned such that they were purposely made unpullable.  Some encounters are meant to be charged.  Rooted mobs are another way that this has been done.  Non-rooted mobs like the Rubbles example above add to the varying difficulties in this game.  It can't always be so cut and dry, same pull every time you ever do it... that would be repeditive and boring.  The Vindicator was originally created to be troublesome to pull.  He was linked to his guards.  Pullers found a way to seperate them though, even though the mobs were said to be unsplitable, they figured out a way to do it anyway.<br />
<br />
Whether SOE pursposely meant to make the encounter than way, or it's just a bi-product of the zone design, the different difficulties add flavor reguardless.  Hell, even feign pulling itself was originally a bi-product of a set of skills given to monks that were intended for other purposes.  The player, or combination of players, need to come up with something creative.  This would be a pretty boring game if every class were given every single tool that trivializes their jobs so much so that they rarely ever fail.  Some mobs proc most of their damage through spell, rather than do straight melee.  A way to get around a warrior's natural advantages compared to other classes.  Some mobs are completely immune to magic.  A way to get around a number of other classes natural advantages over others.  Some are completely immune to slows or run speeds or any number of things.  Some are just not pullable, and should remain that way.<br />
<br />
Some people are more creative than others and will overcome certain challenges faster than other, while other people will contantly beat their heads against the wall and never truely understand it.  Grading on a curve shouldn't be the answer.  Upping the classes power, because either the person playing in question can't understand the way to conquer it through other means, or because the current encounters you may be facing were just tuned that way to be extremely tough in the first place, messes with the balance that was already in place elsewhere in the game.  The answer can't always be &quot;my class sucks, make it more powerful&quot;, which is all I've been seeing lately on these boards.  Especially since I constatly see plenty of examples through friends playing these classes who don't have these problems, or when I get to test drive one of their characters and say to myself &quot;daaaamn, I had no idea the flexability this character had over my &lt;insert one of my character classes here&gt;&quot;.<br />
<br />
So there are examples in the game were standing far away and tossing a shrukien isnt viable.<br />
<br />
Of course there are.  There should be.  I wouldn't expect anything less coming from a game with this much content and this much variety.  Every encounter can't be identical.  Every pull can't be the same.  The entire game can not revolve around pull single, slow single, tank tanks it while healer heals tank, dead mob, pull goes and gets another, rinse repeat.  If that was the entire scope of the game, the only strategy that there was available, this game would have never needed any expansions beyond original release.  They would have offered nothing new, and the game would have been boring and repeditive.<br />
<br />
In just that instance Im expected to  get up next to the mobs and try to bring them in  fast!  FDing is something  that I dont like to use unless I have more mobs than I think the raid/group can handle.  It just  slows things down.<br />
<br />
In this case I don't think you were expected to do what you felt you were forced to do.  I think an alternate means of getting those mobs to the group, possibley bringing the group to the mob instead, was needed.  Can't expect the same exact strategy to work for every single mob in the game.  I wouldn't even want it to be that way.<br />
<br />
Im not saying that mitigation is the answer .    But coming up with  something that doesnt step on another classes toes in some form is obviously  harder  than it sounds.<br />
<br />
Class balance is always hard, I agree.  But in some special cases, I don't expect every class to be able to fullfill their job.  This being a group based game, sometimes you need to look to the others in the group to help you out.  Upping the power of ones class because the old tried and true strategies don't work on some of the newer types of encounters isn't always the answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Pumilo needs to read Khumak's quote. Glatius needs to read Khumak's quote. MANY MANY of the people who've posted here need to read Khumak's quote:<br />
<br />
 From a raid perspective I can guarantee you that mitigation has absolutely nothing to do with a monk's lack of desirability on the roster. Monks are pullers and DPS.  For pulling they are second to bards in most cases. For DPS they are second to many classes.  That's why they're not in high demand. <br />
<br />
I said the class needs improvements for pulling. I said the class needs improvements for DPS. I said all of this. And got argued with for pages and pages and pages. Frodlin STILL believes that monks don't want improvements to their pulling. Frodlin REFUSES to acknowledge that monks asked YEARS ago to be given the suggestion he thinks he came up with. This has gone from funny  to twilight zone. <br />
<br />
Yeah, we asked the devs to give us the ability to not get pummelled on pulls ages ago. The ability to have some sort of faster run speed, the ability to not get smooshed as long as we're not attacking. We asked for all of this shit, back when PoP was new.<br />
<br />
It got us ... DODGE FROM BEHIND.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just read Khumak's quote. And next time you say &quot;But monks are the best pullers!&quot; Glatius, read Khumak's quote.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
Sometimes you all just want to argue. So much so, you'll argue and argue and argue, when right on your own message board, people are saying the same shit WE'VE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG.<br />
<br />
WE DO NOT WANT TO TANK. WE DO WANT TO STOP BEING FODDER ON PULLS!<br />
<br />
  If someone is getting flattened by their pulls constantly, &quot;they're&quot; doing something wrong, not their class.<br />
 <br />
<br />
That's like saying if a tank dies while fighting a boss mob, the TANK did something wrong. And that they lack SKILL as a tank. Nevermind the fact that the tank has no control over the heal chain.<br />
<br />
Monks want their pulling skills IMPROVED. And that gets right to the heart of the matter. Things can and DO go wrong during pulls. And monks want improvements to their class that will help them deal with situations where things go wrong. Times when they DO DIE.<br />
<br />
 do you really believe the Warrior would die less often even with his superior mitigation?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
 Aside from splitting multiple SoW'd mobs, I don't see how any class who can FD is having problems survivng pulls to be honest. <br />
<br />
PLAY A MONK. FIND OUT. Good lord, your post here Scal is even more insulting than most of Pumilo's posts. Pumilo, at least, you know is being malicious. And distorting things on purpose because he's bored. You, you're just stumbling into a discussion about a class you don't play, about a skill/raid role you don't do, and commenting about a skill (feign death) you don't use. What the hell?<br />
<br />
Until you've sat there in some zone, and tried to split the same stupid ass group of trash mobs for your raid, and died 4 straight times because of 4 straight feign failures because of how ASSININE the skill is because of how ASSININE the devs have been about the skill since KUNARK ... don't talk about feign death.<br />
<br />
Non-monks talking about feign death pulling. That's classic.<br />
<br />
Let me do exactly what you did with that comment, but do it for warriors instead:<br />
<br />
There is no AGGRO issue with warriors versus any other class in the game. Because they have TAUNT. And as long as taunt is working, there simply aren't any problems with warriors and maintainging aggro. So not only do they simply not need incite, they don't need enraging blow or anger augments. Because they have TAUNT. And taunt gets the aggro back on the tank.<br />
<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
Seriously, don't talk about feign death pulling warriors. It's not your area of expertise. That Bards continually replace monks on pull teams ... that Khumak is going to say bards are replacing monks ... that in your very own THREADS HERE ON TSW warriors are calling monks FODDER ... it should tip you off as to how EFFECTIVE feign death is on pulling these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Anyways, just read Khumak's quote. And next time you say &quot;But monks are the best pullers!&quot; Glatius, read Khumak's quote.<br />
<br />
Would you agree that Monks are far better pullers than Warriors even without their old mitigation?  Or are you going to claim that Monks are so totally old and busted that they couldn't pull a froglok wizard in old sebilis and survive?  The hyperbola you trot out as an &quot;arguement&quot; is amazing to behold.  Monks aren't half as broken as you'd like it believed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Glatius, you said monks were the superior pullers. The best pullers. You refused to acknowledge what your own fellow warriors were already saying about monks and pulling.<br />
<br />
So who gives a fuck? You ... Liper ... it doesn't matter. You all sit there and distort the truth.<br />
<br />
Monks want to have a ROLE. Pulling. They want to actually  have value.<br />
<br />
That you can't relate to this problem, BEING A WARRIOR and having been in this EXACT SAME POSITION LAST YEAR ... shows how full of shit you are.<br />
<br />
Monks aren't half as broken as we say they are?<br />
<br />
HOLY SHIT MAN ... People used to say that same shit about your OWN CLASS. That you'd sell that same shit, shows how dug in you are on this argument. You're simply arguing because you can no longer bring yourself to admit that maybe, JUST MAYBE, monks have a legitimate gripe about their place in the EQ hierarchy. That maybe monks ARE cannon fodder. That maybe monks DO have a problem with their ROLES in the game. That maybe monks DO need improvements.<br />
<br />
You're so far dug in to your position that monks are one change away from being SUPER-MAN in EQ, that you won't even listen to what your fellow warriors are telling you about monks. Let alone what the monks themselves have to say.<br />
<br />
Is it any wonder you won't stop by Monkly Biz, because you don't want to get flamed? Of course you're going to get flamed. You simply can't acknowledge what people already know about monks.<br />
<br />
They're not the best pullers in EQ. They're not the best DPS. And that's ALL THEY DO. They're not good at doing a damn thing in EQ.<br />
<br />
No wonder they're bitter. They got warriors who sat there and complained for years about not being the best tanks, telling them the same crap knights told those warriors for years.<br />
<br />
It's painful to read what you write Glatius. You sound like Brik talking about warriors in 2003. But it's 2004, and the name Glatius is attatched. It's amazing the 180 you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Kabthil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">So according to you Alisdahre not only should we not have the mitigation , we should also be satisfied with the way monks are and NEVER ask to have any aspect of our class changed?

<br />
<br />
WTF  do you think I try pulling a mob/mobs once and if it doesnt work just throw my hands in the air and quit?  My guild nows and appreciates the effort I put into trying to keep the mobs coming in the best way.   Immunity to DT..pfft  what a retarded comment .<br />
<br />
I couldnt check your magelo  to know were you are at in the game , but  in  &quot;most&quot; raid situations the people back at the raid could give a rats ass  about being &quot;creative&quot; . There are 6 other bosses up we wanna kill tonight .<br />
<br />
<br />
Tell ya what  Warriors = Tank and  Monk = Puller , right?  In that light  I will be 100% satisfied if I NEVER have  any skill, AA , whatever given to me to improve  just that aspect as long as you are 100% satisfied  that you NEVER  get any aggro/tanking abilities again.  Doesnt sound to great does it?<br />
<br />
Dude I dont think this is overpowering.  Asking to be able to tank a mob while it dies  is not what  I am asking for.  What I am asking for in no way  intrudes on Warrior territory so  why are so many against it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Monks want their pulling skills IMPROVED. And that gets right to the heart of the matter.

<br />
<br />
You're missing a large part of my point Superchum.  I agree that monks need their pulling ability increased.  Increasing monk mitigation will have almost ZERO effect on monk pulling ability.  Bards are not better pullers because of their uber mitigation.  They're better because they have more tools for separating mobs.  Monks have FD and lull.  That's it.  Bards have lull, mez, gate (highsun?), snare, crazy run speed, total memwipe...  Monks need more tools that increase the likelyhood of separating mobs reliably.  Increased mitigation won't accomplish this.<br />
<br />
They need to be asking for some of the same types of things that bards use to aid in pulling.  They should also be asking for DPS increases.  Rogues do way too much damage relative to monks.  As far as tanking goes, if anything monks STILL mitigate too well even after the nerf.<br />
<br />
If you want pulling upgrades, warriors and pretty much all other classes except for bards would be all for it.  If you want to tank then all 3 tank classes are going to be against it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I find it hard to believe  that monks are vastly superior to warriors in tanking ability<br />
<br />
I didn't say they are NOW.  I said they would be if their mitigation was improved enough to have an impact on pulling ability.  The only way a mitigation increase would improve pulling ability would be to increase it so much that monks could tank multiple hard hitting mobs at the same time.  Warriors can't even do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to be able to pull in a manner  that  is fast  and effective , using skills that I already have and possibly a AA, skill etc. that  wont infringe  on some other classes utilities.

<br />
<br />
I agree, and increased mitigation will not improve this ability AT ALL.  What you need is an improved ability to split mobs effectively.  This does not require you to stand there and take a beating.  You need lull, snare, mez type effects like bards have to accomplish this.  You also need a DPS upgrade.  I agree with that.  So do most other warriors.  For some reason most monks insist that the answer is more mitigation.  What we all keep pointing out is that on that particular point YOU ARE WRONG.  It won't help you at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
You will agree that &quot;kiting&quot; is basically running in a giant circle correct?<br />
Pulling  is gathering one or more mobs and bringing them to a raid/group  in the fastest and least dangerous  way that can be done.  Last night in PoE pulling  Stone ring the Crumbling? Rubbles  couldnt be aggro except by me running up next to them .  Getting aggro and turning fast I was getting stunned and snared.  <br />
<br />
<br />
A warrior would fare even worse that you do in situations like this.  More mitigation would be zero help.  You need methods to get the mobs back to camp efficiently without getting hit.  Maybe increased innate resistance to snare or a burst run speed disc that gives you bard speed or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im not saying that mitigation is the answer .    But coming up with  something that doesnt step on another classes toes in some form is obviously  harder  than it sounds.<br />
<br />
The problem is we HAVE been coming up with ideas that DO resolve your pulling problems and most monks want nothing to do with anything that doesn't make them better tanks than warriors.  The only explanation I can come up with for that viewpoint is that most monks don't give a shit about pulling.  They want to tank again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">WE DO NOT WANT TO TANK.<br />
<br />
Super, not to mean any offense, and I hope you really read my entire post and don't cut out after half of it, but don't presume that you speak for every monk in the game. Perhaps it's 100% entirely true that you don't want to tank, and you might mean that from the bottom of your heart, but that doesn't mean that others of your class share that perspective. <br />
<br />
Many of us have friends of every kind of class in game; it's integral that we as Warriors have a couple of good friends of every kind of class so we can go off and experience when we want. We're not necros or enchanters, druids or wizards, that can pass the time soloing. And just as I say that you don't speak for every monk in the game, I don't speak for every Warrior in the game, but I have more than a few monk friends that I have spoken with about this exact topic. Skilled monks; monks that can do their jobs very well, monks that were pulling in ToV with javelins back in the day (heh I never did understand the technalties of that.) But each of them has told me more or less the exact same thing; they miss being able to solo. They miss being able to toe to toe a mob, and the reason they want the mitigation nerf lifted is so they can go out and tank mobs again.<br />
<br />
Many of you have expressed the desire here that you want to be better pullers, and to do that you need better mitigation. I understand that, I understand how it would effect you. But you understand it too, so don't attempt to downplay the effects of what would happen. If you take something, and make it stronger, that's just it - it makes it stronger. If you took a wet piece of paper and reinforced it on top of a brick, it's just has a stronger quality now.<br />
<br />
One of my monk friends and I were doing a hard LDoN in NRo the other day. The Takish themes can be pretty difficult to split if you are solely relying on the monk lull disc, and we wound up with a two pull. Now we're speaking with a high level monk with nearly max AA and fully time geared, but it amazed me that not only did he toe to toe the mob as I tanked my own, but he also killed his while mine was still at a hefty 30%. The rest of the group was assist on me. After the group he showed me his SoT - auged with nothing less than a ykesha proc - and explained how he keeps that around if he needs to tank, and swaps out from his DPS setup.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is the norm, but it's in the realm of possibilities. If monks got the mitigation nerf repealed, I definitely think this sort of thing would be much higher in that same realm of possibilities. Do all monks want it? Probably not. Does it make certain things *Viable* that should not be so? Absolutely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Khumak, I'm not missing your point. I get your point. I got your point ages ago. <br />
<br />
Remember, I thought this entire thread was absurd. I've stated many many times that for monks, the idea is rooted in improvements to pulling. That improvements to their actual roles are what monks are after. Right now, these improvements, no matter WHAT those improvements may be, aren't forthcoming.<br />
<br />
We're not getting mitigation improved. BUT ... we're also not getting pulling improvements. Or DPS improvements.<br />
<br />
We've BEEN asking for aids in pulling. For two years now. They're not coming. <br />
<br />
 If you want pulling upgrades, warriors and pretty much all other classes except for bards would be all for it.  <br />
<br />
I WISH this were true. But read this thread Khumak. Look around. You've got Liper telling monks about pulling. When he has no clue about pulling. You've got Glatius agreeiing and saying monks are the best at pulling. You've got Scal wondering how monks can have problems pulling, since they have feign death. You've got Alisdahre talking about pulling. You've got Frodlin attacking monks claiming that they don't want pulling improvements they want tanking improvements, no matter how many times a monks says they want pulling improvements. Then you've got Frodlin passing off an OLD monk idea, that they came up with years ago, as something of his own and saying &quot;Why don't you ask for this?&quot; ... when we HAVE ASKED FOR EXACTLY THAT!<br />
<br />
Everytime the topic of pulling comes up, you either have someone like Liper try and distort the reality, and say monks are superior pullers. Or you've got some other warrior accuse monks of having a hidden agenda.<br />
<br />
This is when monks seek out improvements to pulling.<br />

You know SC, you're not only full of shit, but you apparently can't even get your mind off of one track.  You bitch and moan about how hopeless and worthless Monks are and how they need &quot;pulling improvements&quot; yet time and time again it comes back to wanting your old mitigation back.  I've not argued against any other change or any other suggestion except a straight across the board mitigation increaase for Monks.  And what do you do?  You get your panties all in a wad like I'm preaching against the holy scriptures or something.  <br />
<br />
If a mitigation increase is the only possible improvement you can conceive of that would improve Monk's &quot;pulling&quot; then you're not really interested in &quot;pulling&quot;, you've got another agenda.   Maybe it's that you want to solo.  Maybe it's that you want to have the flexibility to off tank adds more successfully.  Maybe it's that you want to step in when a tank isn't available and do a respectable job at tanking.  It really doesn't matter what your motivation is in the end, because these consistant &quot;claims&quot; of wanting to have improved &quot;pulling&quot; while systematically rejecting every suggestion or option as being &quot;unlikely&quot; to be implemented by SoE, while continuing to beat on the one option that is by far the most unlikely really tips your hand.   You have some secondary agenda that only a mitigation nerf reversal will satisfy.  And that is not something Warriors are going to rubber stamp for you.<br />
<br />
And frankly what you think of my opinion is of no interest to me at all.  I've been consistant in my stand and I've been rational in my reasoning.  It just so happens it doesn't mesh with your personal desires and that makes me &quot;evil&quot; in your eyes.  Oh well, life will go on after all.

A warrior would fare even worse that you do in situations like this.  More mitigation would be zero help.  You need methods to get the mobs back to camp efficiently without getting hit.  Maybe increased innate resistance to snare or a burst run speed disc that gives you bard speed or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is we HAVE been coming up with ideas that DO resolve your pulling problems and most monks want nothing to do with anything that doesn't make them better tanks than warriors.  The only explanation I can come up with for that viewpoint is that most monks don't give a shit about pulling.  They want to tank again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Somehow we keep coming back to mitigation...and  by  saying   lull (which we have ) mez , snare and burst  bard speed  your  saying we should have skills that are already the domain of other classes , to a greater degree..kinda like the mitigation arguement.  Nobody is  going to be 100% happy with a upgrade another class gets that even looks like it might effect them.<br />
<br />
 Mitigation  or no mitigation  , avoidance increase or not  monks are never again going to equal or better a warrior in tanking.  In the end all you really have to do is look at  SoE track record and realise that however they eventually do it  will put (insert class here) above and beyond were  they meant to  be.<br />
<br />
Hopefully  in the case of monks the ones that feel the urge to troll other class sites and gloat  will pass on that urge.</div></div><hr />

The 10% is recently of which is when my guild started getting into upper level Gates.  Our monks did a more than fine job when I came back from my Hiatus that I did not see a need to return to being puller.  With the exception of SoL, (where I took a break when it launched to around the time Emp was being changed) I have been at the forefront of raiding in this game we call Everquest.  I'm going to be blunt and say that I know a lot more about pulling than you do.  It is much more difficult to split mobs as a class that must cast a FD than it is to as one that can hotkey FD, afterall it is meant to be that way (and should).<br />

Hardly if bothered to read this whole pile of steaming s888 you would see that almost all warriors are for consideration of dps upgrades and additional pulling tools. But the monks who have been here for 50+ pages want mitigation and only mitigation. And you wonder why warriors wonder about them.<br />

GD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Somehow we keep coming back to mitigation...<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what boggles my mind.  After all the suggestions put forth that would actually HELP monks pull better.  Monks keep coming back to mitigation which WON'T.<br />
<br />
<br />
and  by  saying   lull (which we have ) mez , snare and burst  bard speed  your  saying we should have skills that are already the domain of other classes , to a greater degree..kinda like the mitigation arguement.

<br />
<br />
Those are just examples of skills that would actually help with pulling.  Mitigation on the other hand is an example of a skill which will not help with pulling.  It helps with tanking, which is apparently all monks want to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I'm going to be blunt and say that I know a lot more about pulling than you do. <br />
<br />
Oooooh. <br />
<br />
I guess I can be blunt and say I know more about feign splitting than you do and ever will know. Because, as you yourself state, it's a monk thing.<br />
<br />
So what is it you're trying to say Scal?<br />
<br />
I say SKs and bards can function as MAIN PULLERS for their guild, meaning monks have to SHARE their role with others. Yet people argue about this and try and convince us monks that no, we monks are the best pullers and we're NOT being pushed aside as second rate.<br />
<br />
You then decide to post this:<br />
<br />
  I have been the main (and pretty much sole) puller in my guild(s) for 90% of my raiding career.  <br />
<br />
So, what's that prove? That your class CAN replace a monk as main puller? Or ... well, what is it you're trying to say about monks?<br />
<br />
 It is much more difficult to split mobs as a class that must cast a FD than it is to as one that can hotkey FD, afterall it is meant to be that way (and should).<br />
 <br />
<br />
Again, this is where experience with monk feign death splitting helps. But hey, thanks for trying! That you spent 90 percent of your career as the MAIN puller certainly says something about monk pulling SUPERIORITY doesn't it?<br />
<br />
I could shoot back and say it's much more difficult for a monk with such crappy mitigation and low hit points to survive pulls SKs can survive. I could shoot back and say I've seen the pet trick, and I've seen it used on RAID CONTENT. Cutting edge, challenging raid content at the time. I could shoot back and say I've seen the circlet of shadows in action. <br />
<br />
But why? Because you've already proven MY POINT with your OWN NONSENSE Scal.<br />
<br />
You spent your entire career as the main puller for your guild.<br />
<br />
That'd be like me, a monk, saying I main tank for my guild. Which I don't. And can't.<br />
<br />
Monks are supposed to be the top pullers in EQ? But they're not. Monks are supposed to be great DPS. But they're not.<br />
<br />
 Now I'm going to ask you again, what zones are decent monks having problems pulling?<br />
 <br />
<br />
PICK A ZONE. PICK AN ENCOUNTER. Most of the content in this game can be pulled by someone else. Like you.</div></div><hr />

It's sad cause just about every warrior on the thread has said 'Hey, we're all for a non-mitigation, or limited mitigation based pulling survival upgrade'.   How anyone can come to the conclusion that we're somehow opposed to monk upgrades is beyond me.  What we're opposed to is having the class that takes the 2nd least damage over time get a mitigation upgrade under the pretense that it's a &quot;pulling aid&quot;, when it's a VERY VERY weak &quot;pulling aid&quot;, and also has the potential undesirable side effect of having a negative impact on warriors.<br />
<br />
If this is about pulling, then a full time &quot;mitigation upgrade&quot; is the weakest possible tool you could ask for, PLUS having the biggest potential negative side effect on our class (and the other 2 TANKING classes).  We want you to have pull survival tools, but you don't need attack on to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">They're not the best pullers in EQ. They're not the best DPS. And that's ALL THEY DO.  <br />
<br />
I &lt;3 you wubao, I really do....<br />
<br />
So let's tack on tanking in your eyes! <br />
Bards are great pullers with FM, but they RUN OUT OF MANA doing that constantly for a raid, you usually won't waste a divine rez on a bard during a raid.<br />
<br />
I've said this before, the closer your mitigation gets to warrior, and tanking ability the lower and lower your DPS will be.<br />
<br />
EQ is balanced around Tanking, Healing, Utility, and DPS<br />
The more you have of one the less you'll have of any other.<br />
<br />
Guess why rogues are the highest DPS? and have little to no tanking ability, no healing, and very small utility.</div></div><hr />

Yes, exactly. Monks do share a role with other classes. I can't think of a class that doesn't share a role.  <br />
<br />
What is it I'm trying to say? I believe you so confidently stated<br />
<br />
PLAY A MONK. FIND OUT. Good lord, your post here Scal is even more insulting than most of Pumilo's posts. Pumilo, at least, you know is being malicious. And distorting things on purpose because he's bored. You, you're just stumbling into a discussion about a class you don't play, about a skill/raid role you don't do, and commenting about a skill (feign death) you don't use. What the hell?<br />
<br />
Until you've sat there in some zone, and tried to split the same stupid ass group of trash mobs for your raid, and died 4 straight times because of 4 straight feign failures because of how ASSININE the skill is because of how ASSININE the devs have been about the skill since KUNARK ... don't talk about feign death.<br />
<br />
Non-monks talking about feign death pulling. That's classic. <br />
<br />
And last but also least<br />
<br />
PICK A ZONE. PICK AN ENCOUNTER. Most of the content in this game can be pulled by someone else. Like you.<br />
<br />
That response does not even seem to fit the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;What zones are decent monks having problems pulling?&quot;<br />
<br />
And because this question is so challenging for you to answer, I will provide a list of zones/encounters challenging to your average player.  Almost every other zone can be pulled by someone who knows how to not glue their hands to their face.<br />
<br />
*Uqua, the Ocean God Chantry (This zone has a big learning curve for almost every class)<br />
<br />
*LDoN Raids - Timed<br />
<br />
*Monoliths before Cursecallers (seemed rough for our monks until they got the hang of it)<br />
<br />
Thats about it, if you wish to add any, be my guest. <br />

<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
Chanter:  Casts arguably the most-wanted buffs in the game, best CC in the game, and with DC pets, are parsing at somewhere over 2000 dps in GoD.  I've seen 2700 dps thrown around on their site.<br />
<br />
Mage:  Great DPS, lots of utility, and has a pet that tanks better than a monk.<br />
<br />
Beastlord:  Decent DPS, great buffs, great slow, casts a mana-regen, and has a pet that tanks better than a monk.<br />
<br />
Necro:  Outstanding DPS, decent group buffs, undead slows, and has a pet that tanks better than a monk.<br />
<br />
Paladin:  Tanks way better than a monk, far outheals a monk, buffs like a cleric, stuns that both lock aggro and lower mob dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You wanna re-think that statement, Pumilo?  Or did ya just mean it to apply to monks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Furthermore I would like to ask a simple question to the monks here -<br />
<br />
What are some ideas that would improve monk pulling (DPS evaluation of all classes is being looked at soon) that would not place monks significantly ahead of Warriors/Knights in taking damage while meleeing?<br />
<br />
I have already suggested an innate stun resist coupled with Stun Resist AAs<br />
<br />
Frodlin had suggested an auto-attack off mitigation boost.<br />

At this point we dont think that we have achieved what we wanted with Monks. Right now it seems to be having too much of an impact on Monks who arent the top 5%. Well be going back and looking into it some more. <br />
<br />
We were really happy with the projected results our internal testing had for the changes, but that just didnt pan out when it went onto the live servers. <br />
<br />
Monks wont be going back to the uber-tanks they were, but there will be more changes made to try to more accurately reflect our intent. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There's not much more I can add on this until we get a chance to look into this thing further. But we are going to look into it, and we have been reading your comments.<br />
<br />
A<br />
( Absor )<br />
<br />
It was having too much of an impact of Monks who aren't the top 5%.<br />
<br />
Anything viewed as being unfair will cause those it affects to be especially fervent in it's repeal. There was no open testing, no discussion, no options considered, just run a few models and push it live. Boom, if you got fucked deal with it. That flat out crappy attitude is what is behind this whole crusade.<br />
<br />
What just happened with the recent changes to bards?<br />
<br />
We just had our meeting. I can never remember the in-game names of the all the guys but it included design leads and code leads and a couple of other people who routinely work with the spell code &amp; planning.<br />
<br />
We talked for a bit about why the code on currently on Test is not what we want, and decided to remove it completely because - as many others have noticed - that particular solution was not a good one. <br />
<br />
We discussed the problem again to verify, again, that this is indeed something we felt needed to be changed. Everyone there agreed that the situation still had to be changed for the many reasons we've gone over before. I specifically asked about possibly delaying this until after Omens is released and the designers were adamant about the potential for abuse in new zones was too much of a risk. <br />
<br />
So we discussed the options. Went down all of the ones proposed so far and we wound up agreeing that what I'm about to describe is the best solution we can come up with that has a minimal effect on the other non-kiting uses for the songs. Hopefully most bards will agree. I think it's a pretty reasonable change given the problem we are trying to solve.<br />
<br />
After the change, the bard PBAE dots will simply not cause damage to be applied to an NPC if the NPC is moving. All other spell effects will remain active and continue to be applied to the NPC, it is only the damage that will no longer be applied. To be clear: The bard will not have to stand still, this is the NPC that has to be stationary for the damage to be applied to the NPC. In other words, an NPC that is running after a bard who is playing PBAE songs will not take damage from them. Note that this *only* applies to the unlimited target count AE songs that bards have, and all other spells will be unaffected by this. Also, there will be no changes to the range of these spells resulting from this. <br />
<br />
I sincerely hope most of you can understand the need for this change and will not be too frustrated as a result of it. Our goal is to keep the game healthy and it is difficult to make decisions like these because clearly a lot of people will disagree and think it's a bad thing for us to do this and we want players to have fun while they play EverQuest, but it is our responsibility to make these tough decisions in the hope of - and with the belief that it will result in - a better game that is more fun for everyone involved.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank those of you who took the time to read my (many) posts on this subject as we tried to find the best solution and contributed to the debates. If it weren't for everyone providing feedback we probably would have wound up implementing something that would not have been as good of a solution as I think this one is.<br />

I feel the devs themselves are in a tough spot right now with Monks. Some feel the Monks defensive abilities are lacking right now, but with such rabid biased opposition to any defensive change where Monks are concerned the potential backlash is not worth the risk.</div></div><hr />

They most certainly are not. MAYBE if an Enchanter was chain nuking, with a bard in their group, meleeing with Kelp Hilted Wand while chain nuking, and had a DC pet with full mage kit + haste then you might get CLOSE to 2000dps, but then that excludes them CCing (lack of mana) slowing (lack of mana) or buffing (lack of mana)<br />

I...dont...want...to...mitigate  better than a tank .   Most monks I personally know , in game  give jack and shit  about the mitigation .   And dude whatever you wanna say  when mobs for whatever reason catch you  and are hitting for upwards of 800-1k its not &quot;damage over time &quot; Im thinking about.  My concerns are based  around  the 15-30 seconds I am out fetching mobs. <br />
<br />
The &quot;only&quot; time I  would look at mitigation is:  many times on a pull just FDing  once I get there  often transfers aggro to the nearest  caster . Often I stand and face the mob taking  damage  so they dont.   But basically I feel  the same way alot of people do .  If they havent  returned it to the way it was by now , they are never going too. Its a dead horse that just wont go away .</div></div><hr />

Um, actually, warriors do have to share the role of raid tank.<br />
<br />
Crowd Control and MA on trash are all duties that knights do just as well at, and sometimes better that warriors.<br />
<br />
Most times, you don't have warriors doing all the MA work, as well as CC work, while still MT on named. In fact in many cases, warriors are almost solely the tanks on the named mobs, while Knights do all the rest of the tanking.<br />
<br />
Secondly, it's been demonstrated and posted that other classes can and do tank the named. Knights, AND MONKS, have both tanked named in Elemental and Time NAMED, let alone trash mobs.<br />

Heheh, was just making that the point that &quot;Pumilo's Sliding Scale&quot; of utility / dps / tanking / healing doesn't hold water anywhere but in his own mind.<br />
<br />
The melee's can't compare to ANY of the casters as far as what they're capable of solo.  I've actually been working on a Beastlord recently.  <br />
<br />
My 65 monk with 14 AA's, and some decent bazaar gear with my 59 cleric to heal, couldn't keep the Souls camp in Natimbi cleared.  But a 62 Beastlord walked in and soloed it clear before the first one repopped, and did it easily.<br />
<br />
With a wife and new baby, I don't get to play as much anymore, and if I do log on for a bit, the BL is a good combination of group / solo ability, plus she can wear all my monks gear.  Is just sad that I'm even considering this avenue, considering I've been playing Malachai since April of '99.  That's what it's coming to though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Nah I know what you mean. But that's because Sony blurs class lines. Suddenly Encs are extremely viable DPS, bards are viable pullers and arguably BETTER cc than Encs, etc etc etc...<br />
<br />
It's because the game has so many calsses, making more bastardized children of parent classes every day (how many freakin parents does a beastlord have?) and then Sony needs to find a way to accomodate all these different classes.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I hate that it's this way. Too much class bluring sucks. If classes had freaking limits...and if content was designed in a way that you could use all classes equally...you wind up in a situation where increasing the strengths of one class unintentionally allows them to interfere with the strengths of another class.<br />

Do some of us want to be more effective Group Tanks?  Sure.<br />

More effective than Warriors or Knights?  Not that I'm aware of.<br />

Even if we had Damage over Time comparable to a Warrior's, we'd still have the same size spikes to deal with that Knights have to deal with and we wouldn't have either their attainable AC nor their attainable HP, let alone their spellbooks.<br />

No, pet doesn't tank better, mages have a little bit of utility, and great dps, this balanced by the fact that thier dps isn't phenominal and they have zero tank ability.<br />
<br />
Beastlord: Decent DPS, great buffs, great slow, casts a mana-regen, and has a pet that tanks better than a monk. <br />
<br />
Again pet does not tank better then a monk, unless you're talking about a naked monk, but again beastlord tanks less then a monk, generally will do less dps then monk, thier debuffs and buffs, aren't really all that great.<br />
<br />
Necro: Outstanding DPS, decent group buffs, undead slows, and has a pet that tanks better than a monk. <br />
<br />
What buffs does a necro have? that's right zero that amount to anything, they do have some good group utility, good DPS and some utility, again though zero tankability.<br />
<br />
Paladin: Tanks way better than a monk, far outheals a monk, buffs like a cleric, stuns that both lock aggro and lower mob dps. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't go as far as to say tanks WAY better then a monk, but it is better to the point it's obvious.  a paladin tanks, heals, cures, and can cc.  but wait! craptacular DPS, and not as high a tankability.<br />
<br />
Again the balances are all there, but you want to ignore it, now we can argue just how balanced it all is, but everyone understands it and doesn't think it's horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Do some of us want to be more effective Group Tanks? Sure.<br />
<br />
More effective than Warriors or Knights? Not that I'm aware of.<br />
<br />
First, nope shouldn't be a group tank, or effective.<br />
<br />
Second, regardless of if you're aware of it or not, your changes you're asking for  leave you as a more effective tank then knights.<br />
<br />
Even if we had Damage over Time comparable to a Warrior's, we'd still have the same size spikes to deal with that Knights have to deal with and we wouldn't have either their attainable AC nor their attainable HP, let alone their spellbooks. <br />
Now back to a argument that has zero to do with pulling improvments and why you think you couldn't tank still.  Ignore the fact that certain amounts of ac are just not needed for EXP groups, nor are certain hp pools that tanks regularly exceed.<br />
<br />
And we'll always have significantly larger spikes than Warriors ever will due to DI-1, and significantly less HP to weather them with, as well as significantly less AC with which to reduce their frequency. <br />
<br />
correct, but how about when compared to a knight?  Any AC advantage is obliterated by block.<br />
<br />
But hey... We're DPS and Pullers. And while not even by large enough margin at either to be preferred or necessary in either role, that certainly precludes us from being Tank number 4, doesn't it. <br />
<br />
You're more dps then the other two pullers.  But I digress, we've all said you need a dps boost, it was brought many many months ago when war parse of dps wasn't too far from a monk parse of equal equipment.  if you don't want to be known for dps and known for tanking, keep pushing for this bullshit that won't do anything for you, because then you'll just one of the three pullers, that 2/3rds can pull and anyone but tanks out DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">You're more dps then the other two pullers.  <br />
<br />
Warriors put out more DPS than knights. But that never seemed to really affect the debate much when Warriors were pushing for changes last year.<br />
<br />
Monk DPS when compared to DPS classes is low. Monk role as a DPS class is sub-standard, or, as some TSW posters have so rightly put it ... &quot;Fodder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monk pulling skills are not superior to the other pulling classes. Monk role as puller is interchangable with the other pullers, at best. Or replacable at worst.<br />
<br />
That monks can outdamage bards has nothing to do with anything.</div></div><hr />

LOL, you a so full of shit.<br />
<br />
Monks have been asked to step aside in favor of pets of any of the primary pet classes, because... you guessed it..... they're easier to heal.  YOU don't see it, because it only happens when YOU are already dead.  Which leaves the casters, and the dps.  And the only other melee left in the group can't take damage as well as a caster pet.<br />
<br />
Way to downplay the utiliy of those other classes just to support your own idiocy.<br />
<br />
Mages - a little bit of utility?  CoH, mod rods, pet toys, focus items, damage shields.<br />
<br />
Bsts - They buff second only to Shaman, have their own mana-regen buffs, slow 5% worse than shamans, SoW, AND have a pet that procs like crazy and takes damage better than a monk.<br />
<br />
But the best..... <br />
<br />

If someone is getting flattened by their pulls constantly, &quot;they're&quot; doing something wrong, not their class.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
That's like saying if a tank dies while fighting a boss mob, the TANK did something wrong. And that they lack SKILL as a tank. Nevermind the fact that the tank has no control over the heal chain.<br />
<br />
Monks want their pulling skills IMPROVED. And that gets right to the heart of the matter. Things can and DO go wrong during pulls. And monks want improvements to their class that will help them deal with situations where things go wrong. Times when they DO DIE.<br />
<br />
<br />
The art of the analogy is completely lost to you.  That's not even close.  That's not even close to saying if a tank dies while fighting a boss mob that it's his fault.  Those are two completely different situations with two completely different outcomes.  I can't even believe anyone would be so lost on the meaning of the word &quot;analogy&quot; to even try and pass something that ridiculous off as one.  A tank tanking a boss mob is doing his job, the only job he can do, it's the healers fault if he dies.  A monk standing there and trying to take the hits from the mob he's pulling, instead of keeping his distance, is &quot;not&quot; doing his job, he just fucked up.<br />
<br />
The point of pulling is to get the mobs back to camp, not play with them solo.  Feign can fail yes, but a monk is not meant to stand up to the mob face to face taking the hits while he waits for it to recycle, he's not a tank... he gets his ass back up and avoids that mob till he can drop again.  But it seems all you want is god mode.  To just stand there, taking the hits with impunity, until you can feign again.  That's not gonna happen.  If you want everything done &quot;for&quot; you, I suggest giving Progress Quest a try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you think the class should be is apparently an interchangeable Puller ( with Bards and SKs ( which would actually be an upgrade for a lot of content ) ), reliable source of DPS ( though never as effective as a Rogue ), and have damage taking characterics inferior to a Beastlord's.<br />

Our class description certainly mentions the class's outstanding ability to solo.<br />
<br />
Unless we're standing there, toe to toe, tanking that mob while we solo it, how do you suppose we're supposed to pull that off?<br />
<br />
Shuriken Kiting, mebbe?<br />
<br />
So at least at one point in EQ, Monks certainly were designed to Tank.<br />
<br />
The problems happened when we started Rampage Tanking better than Warriors because of a stupid AC Hardcap which doesn't exist any more and access to High AC Gear ( which has been fixed since overwhelmingly these days, gear has AC more appropriate to it's &quot;type&quot; ) which allowed us to reach that Hardcap.  Even then, we were Rampage Tanking vs mobs that simply couldn't one round us because mobs didn't have the DPS back then.<br />
<br />
BTW, if a good puller never gets hit... why did they ever give us Mend or Stonestance/Earthwalk?<br />
<br />
Go back to taking head shots and quit trying to act like you know anything about pulling.<br />
<br />
Because even the best Monk puller will get hit eventually.<br />
<br />
And given that we get spiked 12 times as much as a Warrior ( on the mobs from Thep's parse ( more often from Mobs that hit harder ) ) as well as getting spiked harder ( since we don't have a DI adjustment ), we're a lot more likely to die from it.<br />
<br />
Touchless pulls are wonderful when they work.  But more often than not they rely on things other than skill, such as connection speed and machine strength.  Add in Selos speed mobs that love to warp over DX9 terrain, and you're simply showcasing your ignorance.</div></div><hr />

40 stackable stamina with 65 to resists, +atk and -sta loss<br />
A mana regenerate spell that pulls in an entire seperate fucking parent class to justify (9/tick!!!!)<br />
An awesome pet that only costs 400 mana (cheaper than most other pet spells at that level!)<br />
Regeneration spell of 15/tick<br />
50% haste<br />
A variety of DD / imbue pet DDs that hit for pretty decent damage<br />
A pet only buff that is 85% haste, 115str, 71ac, 75atc for 450 mana (which is insane)<br />
700hp between two stackable HP/atk buffs<br />
And a pet heal for 2100!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

<br />
Our class description certainly mentions the class's outstanding ability to solo.<br />
<br />
You mean that ability that the company who maintains this game purposely took away?  Class descriptions change, everyone is constantly reminded of this.<br />
<br />
Unless we're standing there, toe to toe, tanking that mob while we solo it, how do you suppose we're supposed to pull that off?<br />
<br />
What soloing?  The games producers showed your class exactly how they felt about that.  Welcome to the world of how the rest of the melee only classes have to solo.<br />
<br />
So at least at one point in EQ, Monks certainly were designed to Tank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could tank&quot; is a completely different thing than &quot;designed to tank&quot;.  And we all know how the company viewed that when the infamous &quot;patch&quot; came to be.  You &quot;could tank&quot;, which they felt was an obvious mistake, you were not &quot;designed to tank&quot;.... ever.<br />
<br />
The problems happened when we started Rampage Tanking better than Warriors because of a stupid AC Hardcap which doesn't exist any more and access to High AC Gear ( which has been fixed since overwhelmingly these days, gear has AC more appropriate to it's &quot;type&quot; ) which allowed us to reach that Hardcap.<br />
<br />
No, the problems happened when monks started full out tanking better than warriors.  Mobs such as the Avatar of War at the time of the nerf.  The problem came about when monks could stand toe to toe to most exp giving mobs, grinding solo, while other character classes with twice the HPs and AC couldn't even come close to killing &quot;green cons&quot; solo without looking for a rez.<br />
<br />
BTW, if a good puller never gets hit... why did they ever give us Mend or Stonestance/Earthwalk?<br />
<br />
Same reason warriors and rangers were given their riposte disciplines.  For smart players to have intelligent ways of taking care of the rare &quot;oops&quot; circumstances that might arise when someone messes up.  What you're asking for though isn't a way out of those &quot;oops&quot; situations, you're asking for stupifying the class so that you don't even have to think to survive.  Of course even good pullers make mistakes, and they were given a few tools to help with that.  Asking to be able to stand toe to toe with mobs, while using a non-tanking class, isn't asking for a way out of an &quot;oops&quot; situation.  You're asking for the &quot;oops&quot; situation to be taken care of for you, without lifting a finger.<br />
<br />
You're asking to be able to solo again, hoping to tank better than the actual tank classes again, you're longing for the unbalanced days that have long since passed.  The company corrected their oversight, they're not going to give you something that re-unbalances those tiers of progression once again.  The very small percentage of the end-game mobs in this game when compaired to the whole of the rest of the games exp giving content is not the total sum of this game.  Changing a small percentage of this game for the better, while overpowering the other 90someodd% at the same time, is not balance.<br />
<br />
If you feel you need another &quot;oops&quot; skill, than you should be shooting for a real one that makes sense... not one that breaks the balance between the tanks &quot;yet again&quot;, which will then force knights to be increased in power to stay ahead of the monks, which will then in turn force warriors to be increased in power to stay ahead of the knights, which will then in turn force all of the new mobs coming out to be increased in power to keep the game challenging, which will lead directly back to monks bitching that they can't tank yet again.  Then start the same stupid cycle all over again.<br />
<br />
Because even the best Monk puller will get hit eventually.<br />
<br />
Of course, and you already have skills to counter this.  Riposte disc, mend, running your own ass off, etc.  Tanking like you're a plate tank is not one of them.  SOE already made this clear by taking that ability away.<br />
<br />
Go back to taking head shots and quit trying to act like you know anything about pulling.<br />
<br />
Quit assuming you know a damned thing about pulling.  It's obvious to me that you do not.  I'm quite comfortable with my ability and understanding about how the whole thing works.  My skill is something you have no idea about, however you've demenstrated perfectly to me through writing of exactly how your skills stack up.  You die a lot it seems.<br />
<br />
Touchless pulls are wonderful when they work.<br />
<br />
Wonderful when they work?  lol, you make it sound as though you rarely ever pull this off.  You make it sound like this is something that's hard to achieve.  How much do you die while pulling, really?  I mean christ man, touchless pulls are the majority of what you should be pulling off, with a few &quot;oops&quot; in there... that's pulling 101.  Everyone I know that pulls doesn't get hit almost every time they pull.  I rarely ever get touch every time I pull.  It's not a good strategy to let the mobs catch you, you're suppose to at least &quot;try&quot; to avoid such things.  It doesn't sound like you even attempt to.  It sounds to me like you pull a group of mobs, then just stand there pushing feign while they beat the crap out of you and praying the skill check doesn't fail.  If it doesn't go off, or you're stupid enough to not utilize geometry when dealing with casters, you just die, complain your class is broken, and cry out loud for a tank's skills so that you can last long enough to push feign a second time.<br />
<br />
But more often than not they rely on things other than skill, such as connection speed and machine strength.<br />
<br />
This is even an issue now a days?  You still on dial up playing the game on a sub GHz machine?  If my computer can't handle the game I'm trying to play, I don't play it, simple as that.  What fun is it getting waxed over and over in a game because you can't even play the game properly because of old hardware?  If this is your problem, it's still &quot;your&quot; problem and not the &quot;classes&quot; problem.  You don't increase the power of a class to make up for someone's crappy hardware.  Those of us with a computer that can handle this game (i.e. most of us) will become overpowered because of your slack ass.  You can't break balance like that and grade on a curve.<br />
<br />
Add in Selos speed mobs that love to warp over DX9 terrain, and you're simply showcasing your ignorance.<br />
<br />
Hey, I'm not the one getting his ass kicked by every mob he pulls.  None of my skilled friends are either.  You've already demonstrated that you, however, are that dude.  I've got a few guildies that couldn't pull to save their lives as well.  You know what we do?  We don't let them pull... reguardless of their class.</div></div><hr />

I realize that some geometry exists in this game that makes regular pulling impossible.  I touched on that a little earlier when I was talking about &quot;how fun would this game be if...&quot;.  The same old pulling methods can't work for 100% of the encounters in this game.  It would get old fast.<br />
<br />
Still, making a non-tanking class into a tanking class is not the solution.  A solution that a number of the other monks here are constantly trying to pass off as a good idea.  There are too many other things in this game that would be out of balance by such a change.  Reasons the nerf came to be in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Chanter:  Casts arguably the most-wanted buffs in the game, best CC in the game, and with DC pets, are parsing at somewhere over 2000 dps in GoD.  I've seen 2700 dps thrown around on their site.<br />

Oh what a stack of shit. I only play 2 of the classes so I will address only those two.<br />
<br />
Chanter - most wanted buffs, haste and crack. Ok I get to be buff bitch. Best CC in the game. Sorry that is bards, something about being able to mez while kitting, SOUND FAMILIAR? Charming, JUST GOT NERFED AS OF 2pm (or whenever OoW ends up patching). And NO WAY IN HELL CAN YOU DC for 2000dps. You can charm for that with hasted GoD mobs, but guess what your whole grp is built around that. Needs ranger or pally and strong healer to work. Works only in certain spots as well. And one minor mistake = CR when that 2k dps is directed against you. DC = Dire Charm = lvl46 or less pet.<br />
<br />
Paladin:  Damage is smoother but not substantially less. Makes them better tank granted but you overstate the impact. Outheals when can cast through hits or inbetween mobs. Buffs like cleric, OMFG wake up. BSS vs Virtue/Symbol? What Bulwark or Spell haste? What about 96/100% rez? Stuns do good aggro (makes up for crappy dps by the way and why do monks care about aggro UNLESS YOU WANT TO TANK). Only lowers dps mob if stun hits and anything worth killing outside of Tier 1-3 PoP xp spots is flagged or technically immune.<br />

We want you to have pull survival tools, but you don't need attack on to pull. <br />
<br />
I doubt anyone here has any objections to monks getting some form of tools to help with pulling, and Frodlin said it quite well.<br />
<br />
I've seen knights tank Bert, CT and Inny in Time quite frequently.  I've even seen knights offtanking in Uqua.  Heck, back before they redefined the RZ script the first time, I saw knights tanking the Zeks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having pulled many high end zones myself, and having seen monks and bards do it as well (I play a rogue), I can tell you mitigation is NOT going to help at all except on a single pull.  And if you've got that, where's the problem?</div></div><hr />

Chanter - most wanted buffs, haste and crack. Ok I get to be buff bitch. Best CC in the game. Sorry that is bards, something about being able to mez while kitting, SOUND FAMILIAR? Charming, JUST GOT NERFED AS OF 2pm (or whenever OoW ends up patching). And NO WAY IN HELL CAN YOU DC for 2000dps. You can charm for that with hasted GoD mobs, but guess what your whole grp is built around that. Needs ranger or pally and strong healer to work. Works only in certain spots as well. And one minor mistake = CR when that 2k dps is directed against you. DC = Dire Charm = lvl46 or less pet.<br />
<br />
Paladin:  Damage is smoother but not substantially less. Makes them better tank granted but you overstate the impact. Outheals when can cast through hits or inbetween mobs. Buffs like cleric, OMFG wake up. BSS vs Virtue/Symbol? What Bulwark or Spell haste? What about 96/100% rez? Stuns do good aggro (makes up for crappy dps by the way and why do monks care about aggro UNLESS YOU WANT TO TANK). Only lowers dps mob if stun hits and anything worth killing outside of Tier 1-3 PoP xp spots is flagged or technically immune.<br />
<br />
<br />
NEXT<br />
<br />
GD<br />
<br />
<br />
Look up -  I already said I was off on the DC thing, but big fucking deal.... yer a buff bitch?  At least you bring something to the party.  Your DC mob STILL outdamages a monk a ton.  And you STILL have far more utility than my abililty to fall over convincingly gives me.<br />
<br />
And for the paladin comment?  ROFL is all I can say.<br />
<br />
My initial response was to Pumilo and his idiotic 'Sliding Scale of Balance'.  And that dps / tanking / healing / and utility are all somehow balanced.<br />
<br />
and true to his &quot;Village Idiot&quot; form, he said<br />
<br />
Paladin's don't tank way better than monks.....<br />
<br />
Did you read that?<br />
<br />
He said .....<br />
<br />
Paladin's don't tank way better than monks.....<br />
<br />
This is a plate-tank class that has:<br />
<br />
MORE HP<br />
MORE AC<br />
CAN STUN TO EVEN FURTHER REDUCE DAMAGE (SOMETIMES)<br />
CAN STUN TO LOCK AGGRO (ALMOST ALL THE TIME)<br />
<br />
AND......<br />
<br />
Their soft-cap / mitigation isn't gimped like monk's is.<br />
<br />
Paladins are FAR and AWAY better tanks than monks are.<br />
<br />
... and I'm not concerned about AGGRO in the slightest.  That's YOUR guys job, as tanks. <br />
<br />
I only brought up aggro in response to the Paladin's aren't WAY better tanks than monks bullshit.<br />
<br />
Because the ONLY people that think damage-over-time is the BE-ALL-END-ALL of tanking is you guys.<br />
<br />
Everyone else realizes that ...<br />
<br />
Higher HP<br />
Higher AC<br />
Taunt<br />
Aggro tools (spells / discs / Incite)<br />
and smooth, predictable damage<br />
<br />
are what make a tank.<br />

This is a common misconception. Real charmers don't even need this, as long as they are skilled.<br />
<br />
I think DC pets are being grosely overexaggerated, parses please? Note, if the pet is hasted/buffed, monk parsed against must also be. Also they must be attacking from the same angle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no dire charmable pets in any zone where monks might die while pulling. They simply dont exist, so grow a fucking brain. There isnt even mobs that REGULAR charm can land on in anywhere from Kod'Taz onwards. If you think the life of a chanter is all rainbows and puppydogs, I suggest you plan one in the GOD endgame (or POP/Luclin/Velious for that matter). The majority of all encounters have no mezzables, little CC and alot of casting madness of ikkibi.<br />
<br />
Problems with pulling exist in 1 zone, Txevu. There is no problem anywhere else, and ill give you a free clue... monks are the BEST pullers in Txevu. Im a fucking warrior and I can jump on any monk on our roster and pull Kodtaz, Yxxta, Ikkinz, Uqua, Qvic or Inktuta without a hitch. If YOU are having problems pulling any of that, I suggest you find a less demanding game, perhaps Tetris.</div></div><hr />

That is kinda funny... the monks in my guild enjoy pulling events... they in fact fight among themselves to see who gets to pull what, etc... lol And.. I know from experience.. NEVER mention that a bard should pull something to them lol.<br />
<br />
XP grinds/LDON grinds..

Warriors do share the role of raid tanks, just to a much lesser extent that monks share the role of pulling.  I should have specified roles as general roles, not subgroup categories (e.g. Druids are the only class that can cast Po9)</div></div><hr />

Enough hp is important, beyond that point extra hp is not important as you make out. Enough doesnt exist KT+ so in that area you are undoubtedly correct but even with mitigation, monks wont be tanking much of that content (hell knights often dont).<br />
<br />
Higher AC - part of whole damage combination including avoidance, AC, mitigation, shielding, etc. Two of your points are the same, ie. knight damage is smoother and more manageable (AC/mitigation) but not impossible<br />
<br />
Taunt - only needed if you lose aggro, if your grp is worth a shit you wont need it except maybe as snap initial aggro if someone debuffs or heals early<br />
<br />
Aggro tools - so long as you have enough aggro these (other than snap) are not essential. My ranger routinely offtanks and our guild warriors cant pull aggro off him after 15-20 secs without taunt. But he is way overgeared relative to them BUT the key is that the rest of the grp cant get aggro from the tank (the warrior is outside my grp in raid situation where monks likely wont tank anyways). In short so long as a monk can generate enough aggro (initial pull aggro, dps, and procs can help here) and the grp operates within normal bounds then a monk could tank with comparable mitigation. Would a monk be the best tank, as always no, but could he be a tank, yes.<br />
<br />
And dont make tanking out to be only against Quarm we are talking xp grps ranging from LDoN normals to OoW. And my ranger routinely tanks all that (actually offtanks within my box) daily. GoD sucks at times (would only do pre KT) as does EP in certain situations, but its manageable. Not ideal, but manageable, but that is all it has to be to work. And I am 6boxing which makes it a hell of a lot harder to pull of then 6 independent thinkers who can act truly simultaneously.<br />

Be honest though Kabthil, have you seen another other Monk on this thread who isn't arguing for the Monk mitigation nerf to be reversed?  You seem to be the only one willing to seriously entertain the idea that improving DPS and pershaps an additional tool or two for pulling, like increased mitigation with attack off, perhaps greater stun resistance from behind, or  some other option not yet suggested, might improve the class sufficiently without improved mitigation under all circumstances as a requirement.<br />
<br />
None of the other Monks on this thread that I've noted are willing to even entertain the idea that improving Monk mitigation isn't on the table.  It is the &quot;must have&quot;.  And that just doesn't fly.</div></div><hr />

Oh I see, if Monks suddenly have improved mitigation no one else in the game will be able to pull anymore and that will make things all better?  It seems like your purposed fix for your supposed problem wouldn't address the problem at all.</div></div><hr />

This gets back to the whole point about being STUNNED MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN RUNNING. I really wish some of you actually pulled more frequently than you obviously do. You might understand how the whole thing works. But, then again, you are tanks. You don't really spend much time thinking about that aspect of the game. So I can understand that. Still, since it's NOT your area of expertise, it'd be nice if you'd stop acting like it WAS when you posted about it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, it's great to hear from Kazzuk about how pointless the role of PULLER really is for a monk. It reinforces how pointless monks are, when seeing where their DPS is.<br />
<br />
What's funny is ... if Kazzuk had MONK MITIGATION, his pulling might not be as effective as it currently is. BUT ... people here still maintain that a boost to mitigation wouldn't help monks survive pulls.<br />
<br />
Whatever.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't go as far as to say tanks WAY better then a monk, but it is better to the point it's obvious. a paladin tanks, heals, cures, and can cc. but wait! craptacular DPS, and not as high a tankability. <br />
<br />
You truly are full of shit. <br />
<br />
REALLY?  Knights tank (take dmg) WAY better the monks?<br />
<br />
What's this here?<br />
<br />
PAL  2066  0%   0    102  22.1  255.1  68.8  3153  51.1  40.4  NA   4.1  5.5  4.7  | 130.4 <br />

Which if you take the avoidance out even, you get 146 per swing, but the problem is monks just simply get more avoidance out of time then any other class, and a monk with that AC and his/her softcap simply shouldn't take dmg that well.  But they do, and it's not to the point you can say they are WAY better.<br />
<br />
MORE HP<br />
MORE AC<br />
CAN STUN TO EVEN FURTHER REDUCE DAMAGE (SOMETIMES)<br />
CAN STUN TO LOCK AGGRO (ALMOST ALL THE TIME)<br />
<br />
And again having more ac or more hp, simply isn't required at point, specially if you have avoidance into the picture.  And sorry when I said tanking I wasn't mentioning aggro because to be frank if everyone in the group isn't playing like chimp on auto pilot that's really not a problem, monks CAN generate sufficent aggro to keep a group from dying.<br />
<br />
There, Pumilio, Monks aren't even needed as pullers, tard.<br />

Again we've all said monk DPS needs improved, we've all said we're all for pulling tools to help you do that better, but now acting like you're not needed as a puller is assinine because you know you are.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now on to the beastlords are overpowered.<br />
Beastlords get:<br />
A slow spell that's as good as the best slow Enchanters get, and it's CHEAP: 150 mana<br />
40 stackable stamina with 65 to resists, +atk and -sta loss<br />
A mana regenerate spell that pulls in an entire seperate fucking parent class to justify (9/tick!!!!)<br />
<br />
Oh no! BL get a slow that is more resisted then ANY other slow, or maybe it's just cause they don't have debuffs to go with it.<br />
I'm not sure about the stamina, thought we all used endurance /shrug but at any rate ferocity is killer and that's fine because it STACKS with ferine.<br />
Mana regen? omg we put more mana regen in the game please start crying cause you don't use it! I hardly see ANY bl getting a group for anything but slow and sometimes DPS.<br />
<br />
But it's hardly more dps then a monk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exempt Monks from the increase chance of stun while moving.  Been suggested.<br />
Give us an innate runspeed boost tied to our weight limit.  Been suggested.<br />
Attack off mitigation increase.  Been suggested.<br />
I'll admit giving us a Fear spell + mem-wipe post-55 seems like a new one.  What about 2ndary aggro?<br />
<br />
And no, the idea of getting balanced via AA is fucking retarded.  How'd you like to have to earn AA to get your DI bonus?<br />

Point is, you jack-a-knapes are jumping at fucking shadows trying to find any reason for us to be limited to purely DPS.  ( Don't even mention pulling.  One of your own very effectively dismissed that, remember? )<br />
<br />
Because we &quot;might&quot; upset the current cease fire amongst the Plate Tanks.<br />
<br />
Which is complete and utter bullshit.<br />
<br />
I think Frodlin was the only one that replied to my counter suggestion:<br />
<br />
Give us back our mitigation and give us an across the board 10% penalty to aggro generation by any means, DPS, Proc, Clicky, even Proximity.<br />
<br />
And I honestly can't remember his objection to that other than the Warrior party line &quot;Monks shud NOT mitig8!11!!!11! EVAR!!1!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Since Tanks are defined by:<br />
<br />
Damage over Time<br />
Spike Survivability<br />
Aggro Generation<br />
<br />
And since what we're asking for is an increase to our Spike Survivability, then counter balance it with a suitable reduction in our ability to Generate Aggro.<br />
<br />
What is so evil and vile and down right wrong about a Martial Artist being able to take the same or even close to the same amount of Damage over Time as a Warrior, through a combination of avoidance and mitigation?<br />
<br />
Why does the mere thought that a Pure Melee Leather Class could ever be as effective as a Plate Tank in even one aspect of tanking cause you all to start unhinging your jaws so that the winds of shitstorm hyperbole boil forth from your naked necks on how it would totally break the game?<br />
<br />
Every class has some ability to take damage over time.<br />
<br />
Any class with a Ranged option has the ability to take zero damage over time.<br />
<br />
Why must Monks be hit for max more often than a Rogue in the same displayed AC?  When did that become &quot;perfectly acceptable&quot;?<br />

  So, again, you're saying you tried some suggestions. Mostly before they started listening. That doesn't work, so instead of choosing a role and sticking with it, you try to gain something that has far more reaching consequences. Seriously, choose something and go for it. The less effect it has on other classes and roles the better. You've gone beyond just pulling at this point, the posts and tone reflect that. If you want to pull, compare yourselves to your competition. Point out why they do it better. Try for strengths that will help that. You're going after something right now that rightly SHOULD be out of your reach. If you're serious about being pullers, narrow your focus to that. If you want to be tanks, then confess and try for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every one of the ideas suggested ALSO has far reaching consequences. They just don't affect your tiny little corner of the universe.<br />
<br />
For instance ... run speed boost. That will affect bards. <br />
<br />
Not getting stunned while moving. That will affect the the designers who have to go in and figure out what the hell they were smoking when they designed the anti-kiting code. And then figure out how to turn it off for monks, but NOT for everyone else. (Which is just asking for a bug or two to sneak onto live servers). That's got the potential to be far farther reaching than mitigation tweaks would ever be.<br />
<br />
Having an avoidance boost (ala Voiddance) or mitigation boost (ala defensive) while not attacking, also has some consequences. Such as ... TANKING issues, that could end up being exploitable depending on how the idea is implemented. (I know what you're thinking ... but, but, if you're not attacking, how can you be tanking? Still, some of you will remember the wonderful log posted ages ago by an SK who tanked a boss mob without ever pressing the attack button ... which is my point, the idea could potentially be abusable ... and affect ... oddly enough, TANKING, far more than mitigation).<br />
<br />
These ideas have been suggested before. But don't act like just because they don't deal with the stupid-ass topic of THIS THREAD, that they don't have far reaching consequences on EQ gameplay.<br />
<br />
 Mostly before they started listening.  <br />
<br />
Where are monks are concerned, they never started listening.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you all simply don't understand.<br />

<br />

  Sure it will. Ok. Who really cares if bards can run fast? SK and pally horses didn't some how trivialize that. And I'm assuming monks wouldn't be able to make the whole group run faster... So righto. Trivially affects 1 class. Less than a boost in mitigation would affect the game? Yep.<br />
<br />
That will affect the the designers who have to go in and figure out what the hell they were smoking when they designed the anti-kiting code. <br />
<br />
  Each and every change, INCLUDING your mitigation fix, will affect the designers. That's totally irrelevent.<br />
<br />

  Sounds like an unintended bug. The vast majority of tanking wouldn't be affected.<br />
<br />
Where are monks are concerned, they never started listening. <br />
<br />
  Why did you get an unresistable lull and the ability to stay FD while casted upon if they didn't listen? Not giving you what you want isn't the same thing as not listening.<br />
<br />
But you all bring, by virtue of your class, one of the absolutely essential elements of a group. <br />
<br />
  Yep. One of the 3 that can do it. 3 healers, though shamans would loathe to admit that they can do it, 2 CC classes, 4 slowers. Every class argument can involve a required spot, and usually does. It's the grouping dynamic of EQ, and it bites. How do you think the healers would like it if pallies got heals sufficient for them to replace the others when they're not available? How would the mezzers like it if suddenly necros got a significant increase to their mez? <br />
<br />

  By used to do you mean pre-nerf? If so, then the developers definitely disagreed. Not even going to go there.<br />

 If you mean something else, well, I'm not sure. I can't solo pull back to a shaman, and you should know I don't tank two mobs as well as you tank one. Any time there is a group of mobs, you can duo better than I can. I'm a walking pile of hp and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

Bards pull. Monks pull. Do you really not get it?<br />
<br />
 SK and pally horses didn't some how trivialize that.  <br />
<br />
Oh jesus. Stop arguing just to argue. SK and paladin horses? We're talking about a run speed boost, along the lines of Selo's ... for PULLING purposes. Knight horses may be able to keep up with bard speeds for TRAVEL purposes, but not for pulling.<br />
<br />
And, just to get real technical, knight horse speeds DID cause problems with bards. Which caused changes to come down the pike in PoP to put Bards back as the fastest class in the game.<br />
<br />
I mean really. Why fight over something like this? Bards and monks are in direct competition for pulling roles. Bards run faster. Giving monks that power, will indeed affect bards. In a negative way. Just because you're not a bard, doesn't mean it won't affect them. And knight horses also did piss some bards off. And they posted about that, too.<br />
<br />
 Sounds like an unintended bug. <br />
<br />
It wasn't. It was done intentionally. <br />
<br />
 Why did you get an unresistable lull <br />
<br />
The lull can't be used on RAID targets. At all. The upgrade from OOW, according to the lucy data, is weaker than the original version. I really wish people would have some familiarity with the class before getting into details about the class when trying to sound all &quot;right&quot; in an &quot;argument.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Forcing others to wait on you until you decide to sign on must be nice.<br />
<br />
Having the entire game revolve around you and your innate fixes must be nice.By used to do you mean pre-nerf? If so, then the developers definitely disagreed. Not even going to go there.Oh bullshit.<br />
<br />
What the developers disagreed with was a Hardcap system.<br />
<br />
What the developers disagreed with was Monk gear having the same AC as Warrior gear.<br />
<br />
What the developers did was nerf the fuck out of Monks, at Furor's behest, because warriors had their panties in so much of a twist that they couldn't fucking wait for PoP to fix the &quot;Monk Tanking problem&quot;.<br />
<br />
You're actually going to sit there and say that something is justified simply because the Dev's decided to do it?<br />
<br />
So keeping Taunt gimped for 4 years was justified?<br />
<br />
Letting Knights outtank you in PoP was justified?<br />
<br />
You credit the Devs with entirely too much foresight, methinks.If you mean something else, well, I'm not sure. I can't solo pull back to a shaman, and you should know I don't tank two mobs as well as you tank one. Any time there is a group of mobs, you can duo better than I can. I'm a walking pile of hp and nothing else.You can't solo pull...  Umm... BS.  See poster above.<br />
<br />
You can't tank two as well as I can tank one....  Umm... BS.  You're telling me, in all seriousness, that you've never double tanked a couple of mobs, either of which if you saw a Monk tank them solo you'd have a crying hissy fit over it?<br />
<br />
You're a walking pile of HP that gets hit softer than any other walking pile of HP with a pleathora of custom designed tools built expressly for getting and holding the attention of one or more mobs until you die from that attention or it dies from it.<br />
<br />
As the OP pointed out, anyone slightly above the level of moron that can equip a ranged item can pull.  In fact, his position was that Warriors are even better at it than Monks since when Warriors do it they have no margin of error.<br />
<br />
Other than that margin provided by their &quot;pile of HP&quot; and DI bonus and snap aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">are you willing to loose FD? <br />
<br />
YES. The skill is almost worthless in EQ right now. YES, I'd lose it in an instant. You don't need it to pull. You don't need it to live on challenging content. The game has been designed to COUNTER it, since Plane of Fear first went live. YES. Take Feign Death and take it away. The skill isn't anywhere near what many of you think it is. All of the people in here that like to be condescending about monk SKILL in pulling ... and like to make rude comments about how if I or one of the other monks in this thread is dying on pulls, then we must not have skill ... or make some stupid ass remark about how best to survive a pull is to NOT GET HIT ... all of you listen up ... I DON'T NEED FD TO PULL. And the way it's been limited and gimped over the years ... I'd gladly give it up for BETTER SURVIVAL SKILLS. BETTER PULLING TOOLS. BETTER SKILLS ALTOGETHER.<br />
<br />
Would I give up FD? In a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
 loose your evasive powers in favor of absorbtion? <br />
<br />
Gladly. There are no INNATE evasive powers that monks get. It all comes from +AVOIDANCE on items. This would be insanely easy to code. Just go in and change all instances of +AVOIDANCE to +SHIELDING ... and viola ... Monks give up their &quot;evasive&quot; powers.<br />
<br />

The answer is no where.<br />
<br />
Now that you have the answer everyone with two wits can figure out let's get to something that means a shit.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how much better the Warrior can tank then ANYONE if there's a tank that will work and increase the group EXP, that's all that matters.  They don't care that you can tank quarm with one ch every 5 seconds when a monk can tank for the group in a sufficent manner AND kill faster. <br />
<br />
No one cares that you will be out tanked by the three tanks, the problem is you'll tank close enough.<br />
<br />
Your assertations about me bieng some fucktard that doesn't know shit is laughable when you come here asserting that monks somehow deserve to be a exp tank, and in other cases argue that a monk would never replace it (while ignoring any dps)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely correct Fitemore.  This stopped really being about pulling on the second or third exchange of posts.  That's merely camouflage at this point.  In actuality this is about tanking.  The Monks just refuse to admit it while they reject and discount every pull oriented suggestion by saying &quot;oh we asked for that before and because SoE didn't immediately give it to us, we're going to insist on more mitigation even though they haven't given us that either&quot;. <br />
<br />
Most of these guys are pissed that they lost god status with the nerf to begin with.  And two years later they're still holding a personal grudge over it and regardless of how it might impact others or the game, they're going to continue to campaign to get the nerf reversed, not because there is a good solid balance/game reason for it to happen, but because they're angry.  Angry that anyone would interfere with their ability to solo when they wanted, tank when they wanted, steal aggro from the real tank when they wanted, and then point at the poor slob and laugh.  <br />
<br />
Monks as a class were everywhere.  You couldn't go into most of the old world zones without finding several Monks soloing in different areas that had originally been designed for a group of 6. They were one of the most popular class in the game.  Why?  Because they were self contained and could do things solo that other melee classes couldn't even imagine.  And when SoE found out how good Monks really were, once you started lathering gear on them, they put it to a screaming halt.  Too bad, so sad.  Thems the breaks sometimes. But some of these guys just can't get past that.<br />
<br />
Do you hear Rogues whinging about how they need better mitigation?  How about Rangers?  Typically you don't.  Why is that?  Because they've accepted that they have a role in the game and that role is not primarily as a tank.  Monks however seem completely unable to fathom, let alone accept, that the reason for the mitigation nerf was because they were quite capable of tanking, even if not at the top of the game, and the designers decided this was an unintended consequence of game decisions, and changed it.</div></div><hr />

Quit spouting off bullshit. Everyone knows that that statement is flatly not true, that monks have an avoidance advantage without the avoidance mods.<br />
<br />
Glatius: really reminds me of the warrior nerf that we got a while ago due to being too powerful and being able to solo too much. After the nerf, we were LUCKY so solo light blues. What did we do? We dealt with it. Monks should learn from it. Nerfs happen when things are overpowered... deal with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Seeing your point I have to say if theres no  war/pal/sk available to tank it seems kinda silly to just not  have that experiance group.    I &quot;guess&quot; you could always use a ranger but  if  the ranger ever got to the point through AAs and or  new skills that  he was considered a serious  alternative to  a plate class then it would be a major issue.  Would it be ok  then? I mean his DPS is better compared to a tank , right?<br />
<br />
I see alot of comments on  &quot;God Status &quot;  . It should almost be in caps.  Lemme tell ya Ive been around a few years and while I soloed  a few mobs here and there the &quot;God&quot; monks musta been hiding alot cause I didnt see them that much.<br />
The whole thing seems to bounce back and forth from tanking  for experiance and soloing.  If its all about the tanking then I can see your point . But I see  just as much about  soloing and THAT seems like plain old envy.<br />
<br />
If your really wanting to  be mad about  soloing your looking way to hard at the wrong class.  I made a necro  gave him  ok gear and from 1-65 grouped maybe 4 times.  Now thats pretty fucking godly.  Same with the sick experiance  that other unnamed classes have been able to make....on yellow and red con mobs...<br />
<br />
Ive been all for a solution that makes both classes happy but alot of the attitudes i see here are just  1. Envy that monks could do something they couldnt, and 2 . happiness and a feeling of jusification that we cant do it anymore.   <br />
<br />
Based on  these things it seems likely that regardless of the changes made , be it mitigation , avoidance or DPS  alot of  people are gonna find a reason to say its unfair .<br />
<br />
And I gotta go back to...<br />
<br />
 It doesnt matter how much better  the Warrior can tank than ANYONE if there's a tank  that will work and increase the group EXP, thats all that matters. <br />
<br />
 I just cant understand the logic in saying that if no  traditional class is available to tank than just say ok  no group. It doesnt happen all the time but it does happen. If that IS the case then I will be just as happy with soloing skills  that are good enough to make it worth my  while if I die while I am trying. So when the experiance group breaks up and the &quot;soloing&quot; classes goes and solos and the 2 out of 3 trinity classes get groups Im not left LFG  again. <br />
<br />
Would this be OK? Does it enfringe on any rights or percieved rights?  Im serious. I dont really  wanna know if it will make  people happy , but will it stop them from being unhappy?   If not   then it means I cant tank because  thats your job , which is cool  it really is  your definition  but it also means I cant solo and the only reason I can see is because you cant solo. Is this true?  I am not being  sarcastic , these are honest questions .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glatius, Frodlin... long time.  See you're still active hehe<br />
<br />
Anyway, just thought I'd pop in and make a couple comments...<br />
<br />
Regarding some of the stuff we've asked for,<br />
<br />
Lulls - they gave us one, but it's basically useless on raids due to level limits, range, reuse, and duration (level 65 cap, range 150 - less than fangs/aggro range, 12s duration, 20 reuse)<br />
Memwipe/fade - they feel it would be too powerful for monks to pull with (can't say I disagree, and the OOW AA is 36 min re-use, making it useless in practical terms)<br />
Bard speed (runspeed 5+) - bards would scream bloody murder, and we've been asking for that for ages<br />
Avoidance from behind - ignored for ages, then gave us a crappy dodge from behind AA (basically worthless as block and riposte don't work from behind, and dodge only fires 3%)<br />
Feign death fail rates - they're considering it... for 3 months so far<br />
2 minute auto memblur when FD - they actually gave us that one.  Shocking, but true.<br />
Stun immunity while running - suggested, but most likely too hard to code<br />
<br />
On some other topics...<br />
<br />
I would gladly trade block for parry if they lifted the AC softcaps and remove the innate damage penalty.<br />
<br />
I would also gladly give up all the +avoidance mods and trade them for shielding mods on top of trading block for parry.<br />
<br />
More DPS would be nice, but to have the gap too large would really screw knights/warriors for raid spots and dps group spots.  On the other hand, if what you want is monks within 10% of rogue DPS, hey... some monks will go for it.<br />
<br />
Rangers have taunt buttons, but since the inception of the class they were shifted to range DPS specialists, no real justifiable reason for them to be tanking classes (on that note, ranger DPS post PoP definitely needs an upgrade)<br />
<br />
As for mitigation, who cares if a monk can solo 2 expansion old content or tank passibly when they completely outclass the content?  Personally, if a Tacvi monk can out-mitigate a bazaar warrior, who cares?  A Tacvi Warrior can certainly outdamage a bazaar monk, and most monks can live with that.<br />
<br />
As for Rogues asking for mitigation, no need when you totally dominate DPS.  How many rogues are screaming for groups?<br />
<br />
As for Rangers asking for mitigation, not much need when you ping stuff with bows and can bow kite.<br />
<br />
To the idea of mitigation vs avoidance for pulling, my opinions are well known.<br />
<br />
The idea of mitigation when autoattack is off isn't bad, but I suspect it would be a nightmare to code and we know how lazy the devs are.  It doesn't fix the whole picture of course, monk pulling has been relatively crippled through design, and encroached upon by more classes than I can count.  Also, it doesn't fix the lower level monks (sub 50's).  Keep in mind, the mitigation class penalty extends all the way from level 1 to 65, so even those monks who are levelling up are being severely penalized.<br />
<br />
As for autofd when under 20%, that's completely useless.  Alot of the time you're still running around when under 20% trying to get that mob a little closer to your camp/tagger.  Not to mention, if you're getting hit, that would fire nearly all the time messing up the pull.<br />
<br />
Monks are often the best pullers, but not due to tools - only experience.  Anyone with pulling experience can probably match/outpull a monk from a variety of classes in modern EQ, and situationally (or not in the case of bards) blow them away completely.<br />
<br />
Any bard that played a monk previously would pull circles around a monk in most content.  Any paci/lull class blows monks away on most XP based content.  Any SK/Necro can perform 95% of the pulls just as effectively, and on certain pulls trivialize content to a stunning extent (go go pet bugs).<br />
<br />
As for monk weapons, there may be some nice stuff in GoD, but in pre-elemental stuff, monk DPS blows chunks when scaled against weapon availability.  Warrior classes have alot fewer warrior only weapons, but they have access to boatloads of relatively good DPS weapons at that stage of the game.  And let's not even talk about Knight weapons... who hasn't seen a bazillion of those rot?<br />
<br />
As for many of the suggestions to improve pulling, monks don't want to trivialize pulling.  Most monks are proud of their skills, and like many classes work long and hard to gain expertise.  Skills like Fade would just trivialize pulls and lower the bar.  Skills like Lull and Pacify do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Monks don't want a free ride, but what they do want is some measure of predictability, where you can assess a pull and see a measurable risk to a pull strategy instead of a death sentence.<br />
<br />
Those who think a 1 in 10 chance of death on a pull isn't bad don't realize how many pulls a monk will execute during a raid.  If you conduct a 6 hour raid, it's not atypical to pull 50 to 100 mobs.  From that time period, you can expect to execute anywhere from 30 to 75 completed pulls.  If you died say 1 in 10 due to a random spike, you could then expect 3 to 8 deaths per raid.   Similarly, pulls in the more difficult sections aren't just pull, FD, tag.  Most often, there's multiple FD's involved, many times you're taking multiple rounds of damage and aborting pulls because mobs path incorrectly, cast, warp, etc.  To bring a single mob may involve 5 to 15 minutes of work.<br />
<br />
Similarly, with modern events Time is more of a factor than ever.  Dying when you're on a time limit is additional pressure on pull teams to be faster, safer, more efficient.  It's one thing to die on a pull, it's another thing to blow an event because your pullers are losing time to dying.<br />
<br />
As for avoidance, if you want to code monks with 360 degree avoidance and boost us by 15 percent (the difference between monk and warrior mitigation when you factor in AC, softcap, DI and monk class penalty), then go for it --  though you'll have monks encroaching on lower level tanks *shrug* and possibly on certain types of raid content.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to go that route, leave our mitigation and AC caps the same, but give us plate class HPs.  That has the same end result in survivability.  Just make sure to recode all the items so we cap out at 1400 AC in a full set of gear and we get Planar durability, 6 hps per stamina, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Or, you could just nerf Fading memories, and flag a crapload of zones as indoor zones, and then nerf the crap out of the lull/paci lines for the appropriate classes (listen for the screams of bloody murder).<br />
<br />
Anyways, it's not like it hasn't all been considered.  It just seems that mitigation is one of the simplest ways to start (as far as the monks are concerned).<br />

Aggro, again 10 Billion pts of aggro doesn't matter when all you need is 10pts.  That's why a monk can and will have enough aggro often.<br />

Any place where avoidance combined with their new mitigation allows them to require less healing than a similar Knight.

Given the following toons:<br />
<br />
Warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=320208)  with 2516AC at 11345 HP unbuffed<br />
Paladin (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=302393) with 2279AC at 10313 HP unbuffed<br />

<br />
Even if we assume that giving the Monk AC the same value as the Knight AC, point for point allows the Monk to take the same damage over time as the Warrior...<br />
<br />
Tell me, in all honesty, what content will that Monk, even with Knight-like mitigation, what content will that Monk out-tank that Warrior?<br />
<br />
I'm just curious.<br />
<br />
Where?  Elementals?<br />
<br />
Where will that Monk out-tank either Knight?<br />
<br />
And please, for the love of god, please remember that Tanking does not equal Damage Taken over Time.<br />
<br />
At what level of play will that Monk, with Knight like mitigation, out tank any of those three contemporaries?<br />
<br />
Almost everywhere.  The only situation that the monk in question would be out tanked by the warrior after removing their mitigation penalty is fighting mobs that can 1 round the monk but not the warrior.  So basically named mobs and bosses in cutting edge content the warrior would be the better tank for.  Everything else the monk would.<br />
<br />
Removing the mitigation penalty from this monk would allow him to take less damage over time than the warrior despite the warrior having better gear and being an actual tank.  In addition, the monk would more than double the warrior's damage output since the monk is dual wielding superior ratio weapons while the warrior is using a shield.<br />
<br />
First of all, the warrior has 4 AC augs and 1 shielding aug including a completed BiC aug.  The monk has nothing but HP augs and inferior ones at that for the most part.  A monk with equivalent augs would have more hps relative to the warrior.  Despite that, the warrior has a total of 15 avoidance, 26% shielding, 19% spellshield, and 3% dot shielding while the monk has 88 avoidance, 7% shielding, 11% spellshield, and 3% dot shielding.  The warrior is also using a shield while the monk isn't.</div></div><hr />

You get an avoidance AND mitigation improvement in OoWar, through AA.<br />

This will allow you not only to pull better, but to duo better. But it doesn't improve you in power relative to other classes, as they all have the ability to get it as well, if they so choose.<br />

<br />
Have you ever actually been riposted?<br />
<br />
It's your serious contention that that Monk ( unNerf'd ) would be a better tank than that Warrior on all content except raid level?<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that that Warrior will take damage in a much smoother manner due to DI-1 plus shielding advantage plus a significantly larger HP pool?<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that that Warrior has all the tools that Warriors have for aggro management that Monks lack?<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that one of the assumptions that the original question was framed around was the assumption that that monk unNerf'd would take precisely the same damage over time as that Warrior?<br />

<br />
And to answer your question, I do not know what bringing monk mitigation levels equivalent to a knight in the same AC will do in terms of tanking.  I'm also curious as to what monk aggro output will be with Wu5 and the new utility AAs.Honestly, Scal, I don't think it would be the &quot;end of the world&quot; (tm) if Monks took less damage over time than Knights.<br />
<br />
We' take it with more spikes ( due to lower attainable AC ) and we'd have fewer HP with which to absorb those spikes.<br />
<br />
Even on mobs that couldn't spike us into the floor, we'd never have their aggro lock capabilities.  Their aggro lock allows the rest of the group to open up sooner on damage, in effect frontloading the damage of that group.  Our DPS superiority would only come into play after we had established enough aggro for the rest of the group to open up.  And long drawn out fights don't seem to be in vogue anymore.<br />
<br />
So no, I personally don't see a problem with a world in which a Monk takes less damage over time than a Knight.  Because there will always be more mobs capable of spiking a Monk than there are capable of spiking a Knight ( even if only slightly more after such a change instead of many many more ) and because on mobs that can't spike you, frontloading the damage is much more effective anyway.<br />

<br />
Do you care to answer the damn question?<br />
<br />
At what level of content would that Monk, if unNerf'd, out-tank those Knights?<br />
<br />
Considering that Damage over Time is not the sole defining characteristic of a Tank.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
As far as aggro...  No one is trying to &quot;bullshit&quot; you about anything.<br />
<br />
Can we generate sufficient aggro to tank?  Certainly.  Can we do it rapidly enough to be efficient?  Depends on the RNG.  You remember those days, right?  When your aggro depended entirely on the RNG?  You remember Knights stealing every group Tank slot from Warriors not because they had lower Damage over Time but because they had instant on demand aggro, don't you?<br />
<br />
Their Damage over Time was sufficient and thier Aggro generation was so far superior that they almost forced you out of the game.<br />
<br />
Is Monk aggro instant?<br />
<br />
Is it on demand?<br />
<br />
Is it sufficient?  Probably...  Given enough time to establish it...  But then again, so was Warriors'.<br />
<br />
Seems like being sufficient and therefore &quot;ABLE&quot; wasn't enough, now was it?</div></div><hr />

Um. Remove the avoidance mods totally from the monk in the parse, and he STILL has a lower hit percentage than anyone else in the game. This has been shown in THIS VERY THREAD, by a post by ONE OF YOUR FELLOW MONKS.<br />
<br />
I find this hard to believe that you wouldn't know, BEING A monk, that even without mods monks have the highest avoidance in game. This is, after all, been commonly known for YEARS.<br />
<br />
I find it easier to believe that you're spouting off that BS because if people were to believe it, it would support your point. It makes a hell of a lot more sense than to believe that a monk of your level DOESN'T know what just about everyone knows about the class.<br />
<br />

Considering you were the one who originally copied and pasted Thep's parse into TSW's library, I find it amusing that you don't pay attention to the charts that often.<br />
<br />
Take a monk from Thep's own parse, that had NO avoidance mods:<br />

<br />
<br />
The miss percentage is actually BETTER for the warrior.<br />
<br />
The disparity being block. But that's an actual skill. Not INHERENT avoidance based on CLASS. If the 5.5 percent difference between the two in block is what you're referring to, then you need to rethink that as well. Because the warrior in Thep's parse dodges better and ripostes more often than the monk. Closing the gap in those SKILLS there.<br />
<br />
So what are you talking about Daemonwynd? Are you talking about block? Is that the big avoidance ADVANTAGE monks have? Block? (EDIT: And speaking of OOW AA's ... it seems there's an interesting little BLOCK BOOSTING AA available to some people isn't there?)<br />
<br />
Then remove BLOCK too. Replace it with parry.<br />
<br />
The avoidance BOOST in Thep's parses, and you know this since you've at some point READ the parses, comes from the +60 avoidance that Thep's monk was wearing.<br />
<br />
Miss percentage for Thep was 47.2. Miss percentage for the 1331 AC monk was 42.1. That 5 percent swing comes from Thep's Plane of Time +60 Avoidance gear that he was wearing when he did the tests.<br />
<br />
That's the monk avoidance advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The miss percentage is actually BETTER for the warrior.<br />
<br />
I can't believe you jumped on miss percentages as actually meaning something.<br />
<br />
The only thing that matters is the HIT percentage, not the miss percentage. The hit percentage determines how much damage you take, while the miss percentage is only PART of what damage you do not take, the other parts being things like block, parry, riposte, etc.<br />
<br />
To determine average damage taken per round, you multiply the average hit by the hit percent and you get average damage per round. Miss percent is just a nifty but ultimately useless number, as you can't use it in ANY calculation that I am aware of to come up with any number that means anything. Comparing miss percentages means absolutely nothing. Using miss percentages to calculate damage taken gives false and misleading information.<br />
<br />
There's a reason why Thepp, a fellow monk of yours, used HIT percentages and ignored miss percentages when calculating average damage per round.<br />
<br />
Again, this is another thing you should know. Yet, this is the second time you've stated something that you should know better than to claim. Both times, these statements have been to support your point of view. Could it be that you're not interested in the veracity of a statement, but rather whether or not it supports your argument? I wonder.<br />
<br />
Try again. And this time, look at the HIT percentages, forget about miss percentages.</div></div><hr />

They do not.<br />

To find out if they do or not, using Thep's parse, one needs to look at the PART of the parse where &quot;avoidance&quot; is taking place.<br />

Not average damage. AVOIDANCE. Avoidance is what? Getting MISSED.<br />
<br />
Monks do NOT have an INNATE avoidance advantage over anyone.<br />

They have +AVOIDANCE that they get from gear. In plane of time and beyond. (Which as you can see from Thep's parses, gave him a 5 percent increase in getting missed ... that's his avoidance superiority).<br />

Guess what? we lost, if we had maybe 10 more min we might have made it. Guess how my tanking did? I died twice. The bard insisted she pulled and brought many multi pulls (i could have done this single and we might have made it but i digress)<br />
<br />
bard brings a mob i start hitting and have agro cos bard. maybe one proc would go off before the shaman malo'd and then slowed, he got agro off me each time, i would hit disarm and intimidate and shout at the mob to get agro back, many times it just bounced back and forth from chanter to shaman and cleric before i got agro. When a mob was mez'd i'd beg, itimidate, disarm till it broke and not once did it not go straight for chanter. I even used Innerflame (x4 damage) and did not get agro back untill i beat on it for long periods of time. Root was used a lot. I landed an instil doubt twice on the mob after the shaman slowed it and i still never got agro. BTW, i was the only one that died.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, yes we can get agro lock, but only after the mob is arond 50%. And belive me i soaked that cleric dry. We had to stop to med 3 times and he had kei.<br />
<br />
With my low ac/hp and no taunt/snap agro i don't see how a mitigation increase will invade your territory. Will the 1% of monks on the server invade your teritory? maybe, i dont' care what hurts me now is the fact that my mitigation is lower than the shaman's. It's even lower than a beastlord who is a fucking shaman/monk hybrid. <br />
<br />
All your number crunching and bullshit does not make up for what i have seen. Crystoline Golems in PoV will get me to 60% in one fucking round. and that is just one of the fuckers. Play the goddamn class from 1-61 with no twinking or power leveling and then come back here and tell me mitigation is fine.<br />
<br />
Do i want more pullig skills? not no but FUCK NO. I do not want Lull, i do not want Paci, I do not want harmony. FD works just great for every single  instance i want to single pull and i can do it with no problems unless i flop to the ground. But we will get hit, there are many times when pulling even the most skilled monk will get hit. when we have to time the mobs return to spawn point so that one of them will remain when we fd the second time and someone can tag requires us to tank a little. When we come back to group and the War is not on top of things we have to take a hit or two before we fd or we train the casters. (Pallys are much better at this as they can throw a stun on the mob on incoming and get insta agro)<br />
<br />
What does this boil down too? Play the fucking class, I say there is a problem you say there isn't one. I have played the class you have not. (untwinked that is)<br />
<br />
BTW, when i sent a tell to this group looking for players they asked me if i could tank and i said &quot;you know i have no snap agro right?&quot; &quot;does the chanter have the agro buff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck you guys, anyone who is willing to log on to my server and parse me is damn well welcome to. I don't care about the 1%, i care about me who is in the 99%. <br />

Good christ, you're like talking to a brick wall. All you're really showing is that you really don't have a fucking clue about how avoidance works.<br />
<br />
Avoidance works directly on the HIT percentage, NOT on the MISS percentage. It WORKS on the HIT percentage to GIVE you the MISS percentage. Not only that, the MISS percentage is only part of your avoidance, the rest being your other skills.<br />

First off it wasn't SoE it was Verant. They nerfed us because itemization allowed us to get ac equal to yours and we tanked better. So they nerfed us instead of letting itemization fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">You're not the first, nor likely the last to say that.  It wasn't that simple.  Monks were originally designed to function with very minimal gear.  Part of that design was that they would have excellent avoidance and mitigate well even with lower AC, because they weren't expected to get AC that was in any way comparable to tanks.  As the game changed and gear became more prevelant, AC for Monks gained on and in some cases surpassed tanks.  They nerfed Monk mitigation because it made no sense to retain high mitigation for a class that was originally not expected to have substantial AC gear available once that gear became pretty common.  While item design has shifted and Monks have fallen back from getting equal or better AC than tanks, they still have far higher AC available than their original mitigation justifies.  They're not going to stop making items for Monks, so the only thing that makes sense is to keep the reduced mitigation.<br />
<br />
I can already hear how Monks are going to argue this just isn't true.  But the facts support this position far better than the position Monks take, which is SoE just doesn't know what the hell they're doing and did the nerf without any meaning what so ever.  Since Warriors generally don't believe that, it makes far more sense to us that SoE realized they'd stacked the deck too much in favor of Monks once more and more gear became available and adjusted accordingly.  Maybe it was too much.  Maybe it was too little.  Either stand is certainly debateable.  But to claim that it had no justification at all flies in the face of all logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">That's all well and good. But we're talking about AVOIDANCE here. Not average damage per round. You brought up avoidance. You.<br />
<br />
YOU stated that monks as a CLASS have an innate AVOIDANCE advantage.<br />

They do not.<br />
<br />
To find out if they do or not, using Thep's parse, one needs to look at the PART of the parse where &quot;avoidance&quot; is taking place.<br />
<br />
Not average damage. AVOIDANCE. Avoidance is what? Getting MISSED.<br />
<br />
Monks do NOT have an INNATE avoidance advantage over anyone.<br />
<br />
They have +AVOIDANCE that they get from gear. In plane of time and beyond. (Which as you can see from Thep's parses, gave him a 5 percent increase in getting missed ... that's his avoidance superiority).<br />

That's it.<br />

They nerfed you because you were taking less damage over time than warriors were.  Regardless of whether that's from gear, AAs, innate skills, or radioactive hamsters, it's wrong.  Your damage taken over time should be somewhat less than knights.  If a mitigation increase would allow you to take less DPS over time than a knight then a proportional avoidance nerf would be required to bring you back down below knights again.<br />
<br />
I really don't care if they increase monk mitigation but you guys need to decide whether you want to keep your avoidance.  If you do then forget about mitigation because it ain't gonna happen.  If you want your avoidance skills replaced with warrior or knight caliber avoidance skills then by all means go for mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to them damn parses you guys like to point at we DO take less DPS than a knight. But we are not the prefered tank over them, why? My guess is agro but i'm a stupid monk that knows nothing about tanking and does not want to. /sarcasm off<br />
<br />
The truth of the matter is, before PoP the hardcap of ac was 1300, monks were able to atain this cap. there needed to be a fix so they nerfed us. (I agree there needed to be a fix)<br />
<br />
I remember once in KC when the War had less AC than me. I was only at 1k and he was at like 900, this was pre nerf. Any time i could, i would take the agro from him, why shouldn't i have? was this right? no, it was not. was this fixed? well, seeing as how I can never obtain the ac of a war again yes it was. should the nerf still be in place? Not no but, FUCK NO!<br />
<br />
You guys don't seem to understand that we have been given two speeding tickets for the same offence. If you want to keep the nerf then we need the same numerical AC as you that we had when the nerf went into effect. How do i explain this?<br />
<br />
War ac = Monk ac.... there needs to be a nerf to keep monks from over tanking Wars<br />
<br />
War ac &gt; Monk ac.... no more need for nerf<br />
<br />
How else do i simplify this?<br />
<br />
I honestly don't think you guys understand where we are coming from. If after the nerf everything was fine? GREAT!!! but at that time we were able to obtain the same ac as you with no softcap.<br />
<br />
now there is a softcap and we can't get the same ac as you.<br />
<br />
What part of monk softcap at 1300 don't you understand? What part of not being able to get the same AC as you again don't you understand? What part of having to wait until you melee the mob down to 80% before anyone else can touch it or loose agro don't you understand?<br />
<br />
DAMNIT ALL!! this is like teaching long division to 1st graders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're referring to a world in which encounters lasted long enough that even non-Incite, busted-Taunt Warriors could get aggro.<br />
<br />
In a world where spikes can't kill you and mobs live long enough that instant aggro lock is unnecessary, sure, Damage over Time is the overriding concern.<br />
<br />
That was the world which &quot;justified&quot; the Monk Nerf.<br />
<br />
That world no longer exists.<br />
<br />
Spikes can now kill.<br />
<br />
Mobs don't last near as long, thus Snap aggro is vastly more important.<br />
<br />
Those facts alone refute the continued need for the Monk Nerf.<br />
<br />
There's a lot more to consider these days than simply damage over time.<br />
<br />
After all, pre-Incite and pre-DI bonus, Knights took more damage over time than Warriors and still replaced them as preferred exp tanks.<br />
<br />
Damage over Time is no longer the only way to measure a Tank, Khumak.<br />

Nor even the most important.</div></div><hr />

Okay, for the sake of arguement lets say what you say is true.  Doesn't that arguement justify giving Rangers, Rogues, Enchanters, Clerics, Shaman, and so forth higher mitigation?  Since Warriors would take damage much more smoothly and probably less over time and Knights would take damage at least marginally more smoothly, so on and so forth.

One thing you have to remember though. We have a penalty applied to our class. All we're really asking for is to have that penalty removed seeing as how the reasons it was placed are no longer in game.

<br />
I expect to be dramatically different because I'm just a Monk.<br />

Why do you, as a Warrior, expect to be dramatically different than a Knight?<br />
<br />
( Before you go off on me about how mitigation wouldn't allow me to suddenly attack from the front with impunity, well duh.  I just found the &quot;why do you expect to be different&quot; part amusing.  Apparently only Warriors can be &quot;different&quot;.

The whole scoffing set of posts that Pumilo STARTED with. The whole idea that monks must be stupid to desire mitigation instead of avoidance.<br />
<br />
If, as Pumilo began this set of trolls with, IF avoidance is so superior to mitigation, then why is it you warriors fear monks ever being able to mitigate again?<br />
<br />
It just seems strange. That this thread began with the absolute certainty that monks must be stupid for wanting to mitigate better than they currently do, because as everyone here already must know, avoidance is so much better.<br />
<br />
And yet, here we are, 60 some odd pages later, listening to how OVER-powered monks would become with mitigation. How mitigation would return them to GOD-mode.<br />
<br />
If mitigation is going to do that for monks, then why start this thread to begin with? Why were monks stupid for wanting mitigation if it's as powerful as many of you seem to think it's going to be when a monk actually gets it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">I'll answer this, because you already avoid the most damage in the game, now you want to mitigate like the best mitigaters.  Which guess what bieng the best (or near best) in both sides of taking damage (avoiding it and mitigating)<br />
<br />
But the point of the thread wasn't really which monks thought would be best for thier class, but the simple statment &quot;monks think mitigating 1% of damage as opposed to avoiding 1% is better...&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is true in ALL context.<br />
<br />
At the most mitigating the same amount of damage as you avoid is equal, but generally if not always, avoiding the potential for any innates is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mitigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
You want to say mitigation is what your class needs? fine, but when I saw in SOO many threads, even posts you and your fellow posters here have made that mitigation &lt; avoidance, I want to cry because of how retarded it is and that you'll even argue it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u203"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p203">If we were talking about equal amounts of damage being mitigated vs avoided then mitigation &gt; avoidance because there is less spikes.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u204"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p204">Khumak, you're referring to a world in which spike damage hardly mattered at all.<br />
<br />
You're referring to a world in which encounters lasted long enough that even non-Incite, busted-Taunt Warriors could get aggro.<br />
<br />
In a world where spikes can't kill you and mobs live long enough that instant aggro lock is unnecessary, sure, Damage over Time is the overriding concern.<br />
<br />
That was the world which &quot;justified&quot; the Monk Nerf.<br />
<br />
That world no longer exists.<br />
That world exists again.  Welcome to Omens of War.  Less spikey, more predictable melee output is back, along with longer duration fights.  Your long term performance relative to other classes matters again.<br />

Spike damage was a GoD content issue, just like mob mitigation was a Luclin content issue.  Now that we have another expansion to judge, it is time to stop trying to make spike damage into a class balance issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks mitigate as it stands.  You're the one who seems to feel their mitigation is insufficient.  Yet you seem unwilling or unable to sacrafice avoidance in exchange for mitigation.  Now, if we presume the following sentences are true:  <br />
<br />
Damage taken over time is the combination of avoidance and mitigation combined.<br />
<br />
Non-tanks should not take damage over time as well or better than a tank.<br />
<br />
Monks are non-tanks.<br />
<br />
Monks avoid more damage than tanks.<br />
<br />
Then we are logically forced to conclude that Monks should not be mitigating well enough that their avoidance and mitigation combined causes them to take less damage over time than a tank even though they avoid damage better than a tank already.  Ergo, their mitigation must be enough less than a tank's to continue to allow our logical structure to be true.  There is already doubt as to whether or not Monks are taking less damage over time than some tanks.  So raising their mitigation further without other changes to counter balance it basically just throws logic out the window.</div></div><hr />

While I don't believe an avoidance advantage exists, I will GLADLY give it up. I said so. Plain as day. The avoidance advantage you all believe monks have, I will GLADLY GIVE UP for restored mitigation.<br />
<br />
So you may want to rephrase that, and take the word &quot;you&quot; out of there. Because as far as Wubao is concerned, he doesn't need avoidance, and would much rather have mitigation.<br />

Because right now their mitigation generates enough spikeyness that they don't make great tanks.  Up their mitigation to the old levels and that won't be true any longer.  After all SoE nerfed them in the first place because of that very problem.  <br />

I've said it before and I guess I'm going to have to say it again.  Giving you enough of a mitigation increase that it actually makes a difference can easily put you into the having too much catagory.

Oddly enough I believe I stated nearly the same thing several pages back. I just hate to see BS facts used to make a reasonable arguement.<br />

<br />
Now, Superchum misstated his arguement but let's have a look at innate monk avoidance.<br />
<br />
Warrior hit % 48.1<br />
Monk hit % 46.8<br />
<br />
48.1 - 46.8 = 1.3 and. .013 / .481 = .027 or 2.7%<br />
<br />
So, the monk innate avoidance in the sample above is 2.7% fewer hits than the warrior.<br />
<br />
Now, when we get some solid parse data on shield block AA's we will see just how the innate avoidance difference stands. So far all I've seen is data from OoW beta that showed a 6.9% fewer hits with shield block 3 potentially screwing that advantage until monks can break into some +avoidance gear.<br />
<br />
I suppose I shouldn't count on reasonable discussions in the outhouse, but I like to try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nono Jat... according to Superchum, the only thing you can look at in regards to an avoidance advantage is the miss percentage, and the miss percentage alone. The hit percent apparently doesn't mean a thing.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u216"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p216">The hit percent apparently doesn't mean a thing.  <br />
<br />
The hit percentage is tainted by skills that AREN'T related to avoidance. Like a warrior with riposte AAs. Or a dodge. Or block or parry. The miss percentage is straight up, avoiding getting hit. And is not affected by OTHER SKILLS that aren't part of AVOIDANCE.<br />
<br />
Dodge is simply that, the dodge SKILL and how often it fires. <br />
<br />
You said monks had an INNATE class AVOIDANCE ADVANTAGE. So, to see if this is true you need to look at the part of the parse where AVOIDANCE IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.<br />
<br />
And not look at something like how often the warrior ripostes an attack. Or how often a monk's block skill fires.<br />
<br />
That's riposte. And block. Separate from what you were talking about ... an INNATE AVOIDANCE ADVANTAGE.<br />
<br />
Which, as the parses show, does NOT exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u217"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p217">/sigh...<br />
<br />
A hit that got blocked, or parried, or riposted, or dodged, is STILL a hit you AVOIDED taking. And when you add ALL the hits you AVOID taking  because it got blocked, parried, dodged, etc etc, you come up with a percentage that's higher than the warrior's.<br />
<br />
Why do you have to add all those numbers? because for each and every one of them, YOU DID NOT GET HIT. IE, you took NO damage.<br />
<br />
This is exactly why you use the hit percentages, and NOT the miss percentages, because miss percentages is only part of the equation when talking about AVOIDING taking any damage.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest things in that, by the way, is the block ability, which is TWICE as effective as the warrior's parry. You gloss over that completely.<br />
<br />
You're completely right in your claim that monk avoidance is worse than warrior avoidance. The problem is, you're using a completely different (and incorrect)definition of what constitutes avoidance. You use a definition of it's only flat misses that count. Most people use a definition of misses plus every other ability available that prevent you from taking a hit is what constitutes avoidance, and the definition of a hit is the nice little red message of &quot;X mobs hits you for Y damage&quot;. Or, to simplify it, avoidance is swings - hits = avoidance of getting hit.<br />
<br />
Of course, I fully expect you to insist that your definition of avoidance is only flat misses, just cause you say so. Nevermind the fact that misses aren't necessarily you actually avoiding a damn thing, it's just as easily the mob making a swing that simply swung way wide, and you were standing stock still watching the blade swish right by you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mob X tries to hit YOU, but you dodge!<br />
obviously, this is avoidance... but according to you it isn't. You know, by your very insistence of using misses only and ignoring dodge completely. Even though dodging something, is by *definition* AVOIDING something.<br />
<br />
Mob X tries to hit you, but you parry!<br />
Okay, so this somehow isn't avoidance, just like dodge. Never mind the &quot;TRIES TO&quot; hit you, which means, ding ding, he didn't hit you. Meaning, you AVOIDED BEING HIT.<br />
<br />
Mob X tries to hit you, but misses!<br />
I guess this is &quot;avoidance&quot;, but dodge and parry somehow aren't.<br />
<br />
By your definition of avoidance, a ROCK could have avoidance. You know... I took out a hammer, swing at a rock, and miss it completely. According to you, I guess that rock has avoidance.<br />
<br />
riiiiiight.</div></div><hr />

Umm, no. getting smacked on the back means most all of the monkly avoidance is bypassed making mitigation top dog. Whoever has the lowest average hit will win that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>LaotzuQigong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">Actually,<br />
<br />
I offered to trade block for parry.<br />
<br />
I also offered to have all the avoidance mod gear traded for shielding gear.<br />
<br />
The core problem is, avoidance melee mods make melee classes insanely hard to balance.  If you make avoidance universal across melee classes (let's toss in knights just for kicks), then the debate comes down purely to mitigation differences.<br />
<br />
As for Pumilio's comment, to say avoidance is better than mitigation in all contexts is simply incorrect.<br />
<br />
From the point of a monk where the question is live long enough to /disc, mend or FD, predictability is far more important than damage over time.  The fact I take 50 percent less damage over time is completely irrelevant to me as a puller if my mortality rate while pulling increases 10, 20 or 30 percent.<br />
<br />
From the monk class perspective, there are 3 different penalties.<br />
<br />
1)  All monk classes face the same innate class mitigation penalty (different than the softcap).  So even monks who aren't anywhere near the softcap innately take more damage.  This wouldn't be so bad except most gear sub-65 is designed around the original monk mitigation tables.  Monks were always intended to be able to solo effectively up until the 50's and act as reasonable group tanks.  That's why monks were able to come within 100 AC of warriors even in pre-kunark.  The trade off was significantly lower HP's, weight restrictions and heavily restricted gear selection.  (I'm sure some of you don't remember monks begging you to carry their coin for them... think about the implications of that in terms of saving money for gear upgrades when you can only carry 2 normal backpacks and maybe 5 stone of loot at most until you invest 40k + raids for weight reduction bags).<br />
<br />
2)  There's a class based AC softcap set massively lower than other melee classes.  Even rogues, rangers and shaman have full AC returns for far longer than monks do.  That this softcap is in an era where mob attack levels are tuned around classes with 2000+ AC, and basically you have the equivalent of a Velious geared toon trying to survive in a GoD/OOW/PoP world.  And that only applies if you have completed ID5 and LR5.  Those monks who are sub-65 or don't have those AA's, are operating effectively at 100 to 200 AC (which is a fuckton pre-65)lower in terms of damage taken.  So imagine your toon operating with Kunark level AC in GoD/OOW/PoP and trying to survive.<br />
<br />
3)  The softcap returns are not only the worse of every class, but inferior to heavy plate classes by a factor of 10.  Warriors believe they get 1 AC for every 4 displayed above softcap.  For monks it's more like 1 AC for every 40 points of AC.  What they've done is completely destroy gear progression.  What's the point of a monk reaching 1900 AC when 600 AC ~ 15 AC.  They've basically removed one of the core carrots in the game for the monk class.  Remember when warriors looked at gear and ignored AC entirely when they topped 1300?  Wasn't much fun was it?  Guess what, monks have operated for 6 expansions in that boat.  After NTOV (Luclin, PoP, LDoN, LoY, GoD, OOW) there is no reason to put AC on monk gear at all as far as most level 65 monks are concerned.  How would you feel as a class if for 6 expansions you only got HP/Stat gear and every other class kept getting HP/Stat AND AC gear?<br />
<br />
Now, this is on top of the fact that our core class competencies have been diluted.<br />
<br />
We've taken a core DPS reduction relative to most classes of almost 20 percent.  (We went from 1.4 of warrior DPS to 1.2 of warrior DPS) in 95% of the game, and a 10 percent reduction in the other 5%.  And all the melee classes except rogues have suddenly found their DPS completely gimped relative to caster classes (go go mega mana regen, horses, mana preservation, cast speed, mana dumping, ae mana taps) combined with melee resistant mobs such as mega AC luclin mobs + ae rampage + huger ripostes + insane mob avoidance + short range AE's  that often just happen to include Slow/Stun/attack debuffs...<br />
<br />
Our pulling capabilities have been given to half the classes in the game.  FD for SK's has gone from 5s cast time to 1.0s.  Paci and Lull have become huge tools due to the number of outdoor zones.  Fading Memories combined with highsun and innate bard spells have made bards top level pullers (on top of kiting, AE resists, mana song, overhaste, selo speed, AC buffs, group DS, DA, etc).  In-game pet bugs have made necro's/SK's able to pull content with zero risk that trivializes content more than monk FD pulling ever did.<br />
<br />
Content has been designed expansion after expansion to reduce the effectiveness of FD pulling.  New zones have increased FD Failure modifiers (finally acknowledged by SOE) meaning that FD fails far more often now more than spells fizzle for caster classes.  Scripts are designed specifically to hamper FD pulling.  Leashed mobs were designed with the explicit purpose to hamper FD pulling.  Not to mention starting in Velious mob instant-return, rooted NPC's, linked/tied mobs, mobs with improved accuracy (which nullifies avoidance advantages of any kind), and most recently mobs that move at faster than run5 (but oddly slower than selos....) and increased chance of stuns on ANY hit while moving (read... pulling/kiting)<br />
<br />
Finally, toss in that for a substantial portion of the playerbase one of the core perks of the class (soloing) has been completely gutted and you get an idea of how monks are feeling at the moment.<br />
<br />
Now before you say &quot;boohoo monks can't solo&quot;, imagine you're a necro/wiz/druid/bard/ranger/mage/beastlord and suddenly your ability to solo/kite was effectively removed from the game?  While soloing never made up a significant portion of my game even during Velious days, for a TON of monks, soloing was one of the core carrots for becoming a monk.  The idea of NOT being entirely group dependent and able to earn some XPs (even at 1/2 the rate of a group) was always an attraction.  That's why a significant portion of the monks post-kunark were CASUAL players.  Yes, those people who COULD NOT log in for more than 2 or 3 hours at a time, who if they could NOT find a group within that time were basically SOL.<br />
<br />
And ALL of this has been addressed to the devs at one point or another since the NERF, which just happened to compound everything else that was happening over the course of 6 expansions.<br />
<br />
Yeah, monks are asking for way too much...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>LaotzuQigong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">Glatius,<br />
<br />
What I was trying to do in my previous post is a couple of things.<br />
<br />
First, to show the overall dilution/decline of the monk class.  Only by viewing the entire picture can you accurately understand how much an individual change impacts the class.<br />
<br />
Second, to show exactly why the mitigation nerf has had such severe effects on the class.<br />
<br />
The mitigation nerf hurt the monk class not only for it's direct impact on monks, but it's indirect impact.  This was not only in terms of soloing, but in terms of groups and raiding.<br />
<br />
Let me try to explain this a bit better.<br />
<br />
Monks as a class have 2 core competencies.  First as puller, second as DPS.<br />
<br />
Monks also had (previous to the nerf) 2 secondary competencies, one as a solo capable melee class, and second as a viable group offtank and emergency main tank.<br />
<br />
Pulling<br />
<br />
Now, by design (I don't think you could call the increasing of pulling abilities for 5+ classes anything but design) the role of monk pulling has been reduced.  A combination of zone design + new class abilities has had the impact of reducing the importance of monk pulling in groups and raids.<br />
<br />
This in itself was a severe undermining of the monk class, but the mitigation nerf combined with harder hitting mobs, run5+ mobs, stuns while moving, and increased feign death failure modifiers have basically taken that already substantial reduction in monk raid/group utility and made us into also rans.  When a group starts in PoP, Luclin, Velious, OOW, LDON and parts of GoD, how often is a monk the preferred class?  Rarely.  And on raids (where monk primary role has always been pulling) marginally so.<br />
<br />
What the mitigation nerfs had the overall impact of doing was taking an already heavily diluted role (pulling) and making it even less meaningful as a primary group role for monks.<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
<br />
Mitigation has little direct impact on DPS, but indirectly, a combination of AE Ramps and heavy ripostes have made monks into basically mana sponges.  On AE fights, we take about the same damage, but when AE melee is involved, we deliver less DPS than nukers/rogues/rangers, and soak up substantially more mana.  Combined with the role of positioners (Dragon punch), monk effective DPS over a raid has taken a severe hit due to deaths/mana consumption when compared with other potential raid contributors.  If a monk's primary role on a raid is pulling, and that pulling no longer requires or even is tilted towards monks, then DPS is all we have left to contribute (plus positioning).  The end result is why add monks to the roster when you can just add wizards, mages, rangers and rogues?<br />
<br />
Offtank/Emergency tanking<br />
<br />
Though you can argue that time+ monks can act as emergency/light tanks in trivial content, the fact is that for content appropriate to gear level, monks are one of the worst classes to use as an emergency/offtank.  The mitigation nerf has had the impact of further compounding the dilution of core utility (DPS/Pulling) while at the same time destroying one of the advantages to having a monk in group versus a rogue/ranger/paladin/sk/nuker/(insert class here).  Since monks bring no spell utility (snare/stun/buffs/aggro/mez/charm/mana regen) and marginal DPS utility, the loss of offtanking/emergency utility results in yet another reason to choose another class over a monk in a group.<br />
<br />
Soloing<br />
<br />
So now you have monks with marginal raid utility and marginal group utility.  In the past, the inability of finding groups would drive the monk to solo.  However, in current EQ soloing is a pipe dream for most monks.  And sub-60, where monks were most likely to solo a substantial portion of their careers, soloing has also been crippled by the mitigation nerfs.  Where monks could solo dark blues until their 50's (even pre-kunark), this is no longer viable.  This has resulted in completely removing a significant portion of the flexibility of the class.<br />
<br />
In summary<br />
<br />
No, mitigation will NOT fix everything.  However, given the obvious design decisions of SOE (easy to pull zones/outdoor zones + paci/lull + fm + faster casting FD + pet bugs + fast mobs + stuns while moving), and the obvious lack of response by the devs to our concerns over the dilutions of the pulling role for the last 2 years+, what mitigation WILL do is have a moderate positive impact on Pulling survivability, return limited offtanking/light tanking, solo capability pre-60, and improved effective DPS on raids when compared to mana efficiency.<br />
<br />
If they can do that without making us preferable to knights/warriors, that's fine by us.  However, would it really be a crime to be able to use a monk in a pinch when the MT is down or when there's no Warrior/Knight available?  Or when you just want to do stuff with some friends who just don't happen to include a warrior/knight at the time?<br />

I find it sad that there is so much vocal bitching and pushing from your side for a NEW role, when the rangers do not even have a damn epic, are being told by sony that they are no longer a bow DPS class and that all their AA's from the past expantions are basically reduced to farming tools, and to top it off they will not refund them (yet let something like this happen to the mage class and you can bet they would get a refund) all because the people on the exclusive beta boards (for those that had their guilds copyed over) wanted rangers to fill a new role.... don't beleave the last part? go look at the pole and you will see that over 80% hate the new direct of their class and the changes to it (on the rangers glade)<br />

<br />
Avoidance is simply whether you get hit or not. And monks have no innate avoidance advantage.<br />
<br />
They have an advantage in that BLOCK works 12 percent of the time, compared to parry working 6 percent of the time.<br />

That's the advantage. Block is better than parry.<br />

You were wrong. Monks do not have an innate class based avoidance advantage. They have a skill that works better than your skill.<br />
<br />
6 percent better.<br />
<br />
And they get gear with avoidance. Gear from plane of time and beyond. Since warriors were annoyed that their entire class was balanced around AoW and beyond WEAPON PROCS, it shouldn't be shocking that monks don't want to be balanced around PoTime and beyond avoidance mods.<br />
<br />
Also, to underscore this, since you're obviously going to miss the point ...<br />
<br />
What part of combat does the +60 avoidance affect?<br />
<br />
The Avoidance mods don't make the monk dodge more. They don't make the monk block more. They make the monk get MISSED more.<br />

Avoidance happens there.<br />

Ok. Technically the monk has 2.7% better skill based hit deflection then. Not much of an advantage really compared to the ~16% higher average hit damage.<br />

That would set an equally geared couple either very close or monks slightly ahead, I'd believe something I should look into more than Thepp's.<br />

Will look into a few more parses sometime this week. (Very hard to get a long accurate parse of the same mob with an abnormal attack speed hammering on ya for 5 hours) as with a given attack speed, DPR can be found via knowing DPS.  Will look into parsing the monk and the sk sometime this week, need to find a happy medium mob of atk speed, ATK, and accuracy.  I'm thinking a kyv somewhere. <br />
<br />
Qiggy, agree with ya on some of the stuff, but I wouldn't jusitfy a mitigation increase based off not being able to solo effectively as a melee class anymore.  That, to me, seems to be an issue with the rate of content evolution vs the rate of character progress.  The game has come to a point where it is not efficient or possible for a melee to tank the mob unless the mob is beyond trivial.<br />

From the point of a monk where the question is live long enough to /disc, mend or FD, predictability is far more important than damage over time. The fact I take 50 percent less damage over time is completely irrelevant to me as a puller if my mortality rate while pulling increases 10, 20 or 30 percent. <br />
<br />
You have a disc that reduces the damage per hit so much that it can't begin to compare with warriors as far as surviability in short bursts, care to name it?  <br />
<br />
You also realise while mitigation may be your &quot;ideal fix&quot; it still won't do anything that a comparable increase in avoidance wouldn't do.<br />
<br />
The MORE avoidance you have the more realiable it is.  The more Mitigation you have the more reliable it is.<br />
<br />
For someone already high on avoiding dmg you'd think you'd be more willing to load up on it.<br />
<br />
Argue anything you want about how mitigation will help more, but the simple fact is it's not.  <br />
<br />
 There's a class based AC softcap set massively lower than other melee classes <br />
<br />
And it's intentional, and might need retuning, but your mitigation to be fully restored to the levels being demanded by every monk is something that will NEVER happen.<br />
<br />
3) The softcap returns are not only the worse of every class, but inferior to heavy plate classes by a factor of 10. <br />
<br />
Funny you mention this because exact numbers are STILL not proven yet, and I'm willing to bet you 5k plat on ayonae ro nothing will show a wizard taking less dmg because of this return bieng less then every other class.<br />
<br />
We've taken a core DPS reduction relative to most classes of almost 20 percent. <br />
<br />
yay something of merit here!  yes your dps isn't high enough, and every warrior posting here agrees.<br />
<br />
the fact is that for content appropriate to gear level, monks are one of the worst classes to use as an emergency/offtank.  <br />
<br />
Imagine that! EQ might want one of the 15 million war/pal/sk to do some work!<br />
<br />
Soloing <br />
<br />
Going to stop you there, forget it, it's for casters only now.<br />
<br />
How does a Monk in 1000AC take less damage over time when getting hit in the back than any of those classes? <br />
<br />
When the other class is not a tank and getting from behind, mind you while a small benefit you're the only class that has ANY skill for avoiding dmg from the rear arc.<br />
<br />
at 1000ac, no other class is going to hit thier softcap etc.<br />
<br />
As far as Rangers, ask Pumilio to start trolling them. /shrug <br />

If I was posting there, which I don't, it'd be something along the lines of what thier role is and what they need, which is actually something they agree on.  So no need to post.<br />

And no, Glatius, we were nerf'd because boosting Warriors immediately prior to the release of PoP would have &quot;trivialized&quot; it <br />
<br />
No you weren't nerfed for that reason.  You were nerfed because you were the strongest defensive class, even more so then paladin/sk.  The devs came up with a solution that didn't give a unwarranted boost to anyone and didn't prevent you from doing your role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay answer this before you reply.<br />
<br />
Were warriors meant to not tank for exp groups? If you're sensable you're going to say no.<br />
<br />
Were druids not meant to be able to heal? Answer? no, druids were meant to heal.<br />
Were shamans meant to heal? answer? questionable, but I'd say yes.<br />
Were Rangers meant to do DPS? yeah it's obvious by thier aa's, but they weren't doing enough because of geometry and issues with bow where thier dps came from.<br />
<br />
So they addressed issues regarding thier class and it got resolved, why do you think after 2 years, you still haven't got this &quot;nerf repealed&quot;?  it might be because it's unwarranted and not within your class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>LaotzuQigong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">Actually Scal, I wasn't referring to monks ability to solo in the level 65 game.  I referring to sub-60's being able to solo/duo old content like Luclin, Velious, Old world and Kunark which was severely impacted by the mitigation nerf.<br />
<br />
As for Pumilio's comments...<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a disc that reduces the damage per hit so much that it can't begin to compare with warriors as far as surviability in short bursts, care to name it? <br />
<br />
You also realise while mitigation may be your &quot;ideal fix&quot; it still won't do anything that a comparable increase in avoidance wouldn't do.<br />
<br />
The MORE avoidance you have the more realiable it is. The more Mitigation you have the more reliable it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Obviously you have no clue how our discs work.  Yes, they act as a major reduction in damage, but the duration is extremely short and has a reuse timer.<br />
<br />
To put it in the simplest terms, when you go out and pull you don't hit your disc then go pull.  The most likely scenario is you tag a mob, you run for camp, and then only hit your disc IF you get hit by a hard hitter or a crapload of mobs (think emergency life preserver).<br />
<br />
Since you're never going to hit your disc during a pull until the crap hits the shitter, then the ability to use that disc effectively is HEAVILY dependent on surviving the initial 'contact' rounds.  Think of it like this, how good would avoidance be for Warriors if they weren't allowed to hit defensive until they took their first round of damage?  Suddenly avoidance doesn't look so hot unless it's in massive amounts.<br />
<br />
While an avoidance boost COULD increase our survivability, it would actually decrease the effectiveness of monk mitigation discs and feign death, in that simply by the time you needed it, you're already dead (ie, you're in the crapper, but you went so far in you couldn't come up for air).<br />
<br />
If you actually sat down and crunched the probability numbers (based on upper quartile hits), in order for avoidance to be sufficient to offset a mitigation softcap raise/removal, you'd need to raise it by approximately 15% to start (to offset loss of dodge/block/ripostes from behind), then another 16% (to offset average harder hit).  So now you're talking a 25% to 35% raise in avoidance.<br />
<br />
This really would put the damage over time numbers so far out of whack that monk would stand a chance of becoming the preferred tank on Raids with extremely hard hitters, if not preferred tanks in group content once they achieve reasonable HPs -- something warriors and knights would clearly want to avoid.<br />
<br />
Back to Scal's question on monks having problems pulling outside of GoD, it's not so much that monks Cannot pull content, however, with the low mitigation it makes us quantitatively LESS efficient at it... so much so that it undermines our core pulling utility.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way, if you can pull a mob with another class, with less time spent pulling, and a low rate of death (read bards w/Fade, cleric/chanters with pacc lull, SK's with FD/Snare/Pet pulling), what's the point of having a monk at all?<br />
<br />
I would argue that if there were actually more bards/SKs/etc who understood pulling well, there would be no desire for monks on raids or groups.  SK's can pull sufficiently well on the extremely small amount of content where FD is absolutely necessary.<br />
<br />
Let's take a some examples outside of GOD.<br />
<br />
-  You can pull Earth rings with monks.  They can work to split mobs in teams.  In order to do that effectively they have to be a well oiled pulling team.<br />
<br />
-  You can send in a SK, they cast snares, then FD with the mobs already split.  Then any bozo class can tag.  Mix that with a mage COHing, and you don't even need a tagger.<br />
<br />
Don't like that?  Let's look at LDON.<br />
<br />
-  Normal adventures - no need to use a monk, any bozo can pull.<br />
<br />
-  Hard adventures - monk to pull is nice, but doesn't bring much more to the table than a SK or Bard.<br />
<br />
Don't like LDON?  Okay, how about BoT/Tactics<br />
<br />
- Paci/lull anything you need to pull.<br />
<br />
How about Plane of Fire?  Want to pull Fire field?<br />
<br />
- send in a necro/SK with circlet of Shadows, or rogue with SoS/Escape, or a Bard with Fade/Selo's<br />
<br />
How about Time?<br />
<br />
- Oh yah, no pulling there.<br />
<br />
How about Air?<br />
<br />
-  Mobs are so far apart any bozo can pull it.  As for dust ring, SK's/Bards can do just fine.<br />
<br />
How about Vex Thall?<br />
<br />
- Raids are so overpowered with gearflation that splitting is overkill for most guilds.<br />
<br />
How about Water?<br />
<br />
- low visibility and Z axis means pulling with spells/pets is more time efficient and probably less risky.<br />
<br />
NTOV?<br />
<br />
- so trivial that who needs a monk to pull?<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, with current zone designs, content and gear, monk pulling is marginally better than most classes, but nowhere near necessary or required.  And since DPS is sub-par, and we bring inferior offtanking/light tanking to groups and raids, what's the point of getting monks at all unless they're geared to the teeth with upper EP/Time+ gear or better.<br />
<br />
I've been the principal puller for my guild for the bulk of it's 5 year existence.  I'm also considered knowledgable and skilled by my peers both on and off the server.<br />
<br />
However, I've also led over 500 raids over that 5 year span.<br />
<br />
I'd like to think that I understand the raid/group mechanics well enough to see where we fit in the big picture.<br />
<br />
Quite simply, the monk class could simply disappear tomorrow and the other classes could easily step in and fill every one of our roles just as well or better.  And the really sad part is you wouldn't even need to add more of one class to do it.  Just have the existing classes stay in the raid, do what they normally do, and pull when they're not fighting.<br />
<br />
Bard = resistances, mana song, buffs, pulling, damage shields, overhaste, group regen<br />
<br />
SK = mana taps, attack taps, pulling, offtanking<br />
<br />
Enchanter = CC, mana buffs, situationally superior pulling<br />
<br />
Cleric = Healing, buffs, situationally superior pulling<br />
<br />
Druids = Healing, Buffs, group regen, situationally superior pulling<br />
<br />
Necros = Mana regen, superior DPS, situationally superior pulling<br />
<br />
In the end, it comes down to this.  If you really have to bulk up your numbers in a guild, you could simply skip monks entirely and bulk up on tanks and DPS classes.  Just have the SK/Bards/etc pull.<br />
<br />
As for what we're Meant to do... we were never &quot;meant&quot; to pull.  We were envisioned as a high DPS/light tank class.<br />
<br />
Rangers were the top tank pre-kunark.  Monks were undisputed melee DPS (by a good margin).<br />
<br />
In Kunark, monks were dropped to 2nd melee DPS (after they decided that they couldn't balance rogues on skills), and we remained light tanks.  <br />
<br />
In Velious, we became heavy tanks, and remained 2nd melee DPS (by a factor of 40% over warriors, 50% over knights).  In much of Luclin, we remained heavy tanks, and remained 2nd melee DPS.<br />
<br />
Just before PoP, we dropped from light tanks to NON-tanks, and became marginal second best DPS (20% over warriors, maybe 30% over knights, and less than Rangers situationally).<br />
<br />
It's been that way since.  So don't talk to me about what we were &quot;meant&quot; to do.  Hell, even SOE isn't really sure what we were &quot;meant&quot; to do.<br />
<br />
Finally....<br />
<br />
&quot;Except for the fact that monks have defensive skills that work from behind, while all other classes do not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong.  We have ONE defensive skill that works from behind (dodge), which only fires after you've purchased the AA's, and fires at a rate of only 3% (1/2 of Parry, 1/4 of block).  Hell, we'll give that to warriors for free.<br />

Fortitude. Better than monks in that we take NO damage in short bursts.<br />

Drop the s then. You have A skill. Which is still better than all other classes, who get... nothing.<br />
<br />
My point remains valid in regards to monk vs other classes in attacks from behind, however if someone wants to provide some parses showing different, I'm open to the possibility of being wrong, in regards to that.<br />
<br />
In regards to the rest of your points: Yes, I think it's fairly well established that monks need a DPS upgrade. I would support more avoidance for attacks from behind as well. This would help with your issues. Hoever, I don't think &quot;pulling problem&quot; is as bad as you make it out to be, your comments about lull pulling... monks have lull too, now.<br />
<br />
Most monks here have the mindset that they want more mitigation, and that's it, period. Other suggestions have been made to help out in different ways, and they have been almost utterly ignored. It seems monks want more mitigation period, and that's all there is to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u244"><b>arlakisd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p244">The Problem is Where are you going to put us in DPS? With Rogues? Not happening. Raise us up and make Tankes worth less on Raid boss fights? Not going to happen. There's NO avenue for advancement there. None. We just got Random utility.<br />
<br />
Rangers as is complain we do too MUCH DPS.<br />
<br />
There's just no room in DPS. Not unless they want to make tanks USELESS in that regard. And based on what you said since they aren't USELESS that must be intended so therefore we can't get that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u246"><b>Magruda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p246">&quot;Were warriors meant to not tank for exp groups? If you're sensable you're going to say no.<br />
<br />
Were druids not meant to be able to heal? Answer? no, druids were meant to heal.<br />
Were shamans meant to heal? answer? questionable, but I'd say yes.<br />
Were Rangers meant to do DPS? yeah it's obvious by thier aa's, but they weren't doing enough because of geometry and issues with bow where thier dps came from.<br />
<br />
So they addressed issues regarding thier class and it got resolved, why do you think after 2 years, you still haven't got this &quot;nerf repealed&quot;? it might be because it's unwarranted and not within your class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tell me somtihng, How come for the first 50 lvls of play a monk has a higher defensive cap than all the other classes?<br />
<br />
I feel the need to quote this one again <br />
&quot;Were warriors meant to not tank for exp groups? If you're sensable you're going to say no&quot;<br />
<br />
So the sensable people say warriors were not meant to tank?<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a disc that reduces the damage per hit so much that it can't begin to compare with warriors as far as surviability in short bursts, care to name it? <br />
<br />
You also realise while mitigation may be your &quot;ideal fix&quot; it still won't do anything that a comparable increase in avoidance wouldn't do.<br />
<br />
The MORE avoidance you have the more realiable it is. The more Mitigation you have the more reliable it is.<br />
<br />
For someone already high on avoiding dmg you'd think you'd be more willing to load up on it.<br />
<br />
Argue anything you want about how mitigation will help more, but the simple fact is it's not&quot;<br />
<br />
You just don't make sense, I swear you don't even know what you are typing. So your saying we should ask for more avoidance because it is better? But then half of you are saying we're overpowered already. Lets compromise we'll take the inferior mitigation increase over the superior avoidance increace just to make sure we don't out tank you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u247"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p247">Actually Scal, I wasn't referring to monks ability to solo in the level 65 game.  I referring to sub-60's being able to solo/duo old content like Luclin, Velious, Old world and Kunark which was severely impacted by the mitigation nerf.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong here but monks soloing in Luclin/Old World/Kunark/Velious would result in long fights, long fights is where avoidance takes its supremecy as far as reducing damage taken.  Monks are in no danger of being one-rounded (on solo content) as far as these expansions are concerned.  The only thing that matters would be the less DPS output as fights last fairly long.  Would you agree?  Pre-60 monks have it much, much easier than before the mitigation nerf.  Why? Bandages summoning devices, ability to bandage past 70%, general market inflation for cheap gear,  exp-hot spots, disciplines on separate timers, less competition for soloing spots, etc. (I can't think of too much more, just woke up :)) If you are referring to the exp not being better than grouping, then I agree but then again thats something that affects most(if not all) classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as pulling, thanks, I didn't think monks were having the problems of pulling in non-GoD zones.  The only zones that demand any kind of a puller would be some of the upper level Gates zones and a select few LDoN raids.  So far with omens it looks like any class can pull even without lull :).  So I'll agree with you the pulling role is diminshed, this does not justify giving monks the lower damage takein than warriors.  Monks biggest rivals in pulling is bards. (and mostly only in outdoor zones)  Most of the non-monk community (and obviously the developers) are wondering &quot;What the fuck&quot; when monks are asking for Knight-level mitigation to cure pulling woes.  How would this make monks more effective than bards in outdoor zones?  Why aren't monks asking for an endurance using version of Fading Memories or the like? Not sure here on Imitate Death's reuse timer.  <br />
<br />
In Kunark, monks were dropped to 2nd melee DPS (after they decided that they couldn't balance rogues on skills), and we remained light tanks. <br />
<br />
In Velious, we became heavy tanks, and remained 2nd melee DPS (by a factor of 40% over warriors, 50% over knights). In much of Luclin, we remained heavy tanks, and remained 2nd melee DPS.<br />
<br />
Just before PoP, we dropped from light tanks to NON-tanks, and became marginal second best DPS (20% over warriors, maybe 30% over knights, and less than Rangers situationally). <br />
<br />
Monks dropped to non-tanks because of the mitigation nerf.  Yet, with repelling the nerf, this thread is telling me monks cannot possibly be tanks.  Hate output for melee has only increased moreso than caster hate.  Would you agree?<br />
<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, with current zone designs, content and gear, monk pulling is marginally better than most classes, but nowhere near necessary or required. And since DPS is sub-par, and we bring inferior offtanking/light tanking to groups and raids, what's the point of getting monks at all unless they're geared to the teeth with upper EP/Time+ gear or better.<br />
<br />
Quite simply, the monk class could simply disappear tomorrow and the other classes could easily step in and fill every one of our roles just as well or better. And the really sad part is you wouldn't even need to add more of one class to do it. Just have the existing classes stay in the raid, do what they normally do, and pull when they're not fighting. <br />
<br />
DPS for all classes currently being evaluated.  I agree 100%, Monks should be putting out much higher DPS than they do now.<br />
<br />
All in all, almost every non-one-dimensional class in Everquest is broken (or the class feels they are).  I, for one, do not believe mitigation is the answer for fixing the monk class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors get an AA that gives stun resistance from behind. That's a defensive skill, that works from behind. So I'd go back to rewording what it is you're trying to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">Correct me if I'm wrong here but monks soloing in Luclin/Old World/Kunark/Velious would result in long fights, <br />
<br />
Dark blue conning mobs made for short fights. Especially if the monk was upper tier Luclin or Velious geared in regards to DPS.<br />
<br />
Heck, even the more common, standard solo monk at the time (Fungi/T-Staff running around Velks) wasn't relying on AVOIDANCE so much as they were relying on the irresistable STUN from the T-Staff proc as well as high monk DPS as well as the low damage output of the spiders as well as the low hit points of the spiders as well as the monk's ability to get a single mob from a small group of them.<br />
<br />
I've got some experience soloing with both my warrior and my monk in Velk's lab. The DPS difference at the time, as well as the hit points versus the regen is what made it possible.</div></div><hr />
