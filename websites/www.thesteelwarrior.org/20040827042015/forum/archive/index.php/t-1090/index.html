<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not a bad earing, but RvR its not worth it.. you need at least 2 solid groups.. maybee 3 depending on levels and such to have a shot at making it thru this event. Its alot of time and energy spent to get one person one decent earing.</div></div><hr />

___________________<br />
After getting the Tiny Gold Fist, go back and talk with Eino again. He will tell you to talk with Kerasha. Hail Councilwoman Kerasha and say, 'I will aid the Taanan', she responds, blah, blah, blah. You then say, 'What essences of power?' she responds, <br />
<br />
&quot;The powers that watch over the four elemental planes all gaurd their respective essence of power. You must defeat each of them in turn and place them all in this sacred bowl. Once I have the combined power of the planes I can begin the ceremony and set the foundation of the city to rights.&quot; <br />
<br />
She gives you 'A Sacred Bowl', a four slot container. <br />
_____________________<br />
Powers that watch over = 4 Elemental Gods, and they each drop an item, 4 slots, 4 items, I might be behind the times and that this has already been done before but idk :p I remeber them dropping something else like not the essences every single person that everyone gets but something else.. o well, people that are actually IN the elem planes can help on this one :p <br />
