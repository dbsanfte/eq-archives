<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a list of Warrior issues and possible solutions. There may be better solutions to these problems; I am providing them primarily to show that solutions are possible with minimal change and insuring viability of other classes should changes be put into effect. <br />
<br />
If we in fact come up with a community document (which this isn't btw), then I will support it without reservation. I'm not trying to co-opt the process, but there has been a lot of posting with no conclusions reached.<br />
<br />
1. Knight snap aggro on demand has become the standard against which players judge acceptable aggro abilities in experiance groups. Lack of competative aggro abilities has affected the desireability of including Warriors in groups. At a minimum Warriors need:<br />
<br />
The Taunt ability should operate at range. This need not be at a great range, but melee distance is unacceptable. Swollen Fungusbeast Gland and Crystalline Silk Net provide this capability, but since this ability is fundamental to tanking, it should not be accomplished through itemization.<br />
<br />
Knight's would continue having an advantage in aggro at a distance since their spells would still produce their main effects with aggro produced as a side effect. Also with Taunt operating at range they would be able to free up spell gems used for this purpose and use the Taunt button if  they choose.<br />
<br />
In order for Warriors to hold aggro more securely, the function of the Taunt button needs to be modified. If Taunt is pressed and the player is not at the top of the hate list, they are placed there. If the player is at the top of the hate list 75 Hate is added.<br />
<br />
The chance to successfully taunt needs to be adjusted upward and be scalable. At level 65, Warriors should be at 250 skill and Taunt should have no higher failure rate than the fizzle rate of a Paladin casting a high level stun in combat with decent channeling.<br />
<br />
While Taunt should not gurantee that the mob will never change it's focus from the player taunting it, it should produce simular results to those obtainable by Paladins chain casting stuns.<br />
<br />
Please note that Knights would still enjoy any advantages of the main effects of spells used to hold aggro while having the option of using the Taunt function to free up spell gems should they choose. In the unlikely event Knights determine they require greater aggro holding and building ability than Warriors they can use their spells, Taunt, and aggro weapons (including weapons that proc an increase to Hate) to retain an advantage.<br />
<br />
2. Since multi-class armor like Chestplate of Vindication, Great Shadow Platemail and recently augmented Royal Attendant Breastplate of the Sand have erroded the intended Warrior survivability advantage at nearly every level, Warriors need improved mitigation to regain a meaningful survivability advantage.<br />
<br />
3. We would appreciate it if disciplines could be separated into offensive and defensive groups, each with their own separate and independant timer. We would like to see the refresh time for offensive disciplines reduced to allow more regular use. All melee disciplines should be re-examined for usefulness.<br />
<br />
5. Melee classes need an increase in DPS. In a group there are typically a Main Healer, a Slower, and 4 utility/DPS slots. Every class needs either sufficient group utility or DPS (or combination thereof) to be able to compete for one of the utility/DPS slots. In a mana rich environment, sustained melee DPS does not compete with the sustainable DPS of many casters.<br />
<br />
6. Ripostes on dual wield need to be reduced. DPS produced by dual weilding needs to be improved vs. weilding a 2Hdr.<br />
<br />
7. Shields need to be revised to make their use an option. For Warriors, this requires -<br />
<br />
a. Fixing Furious Bash so that it actually increases the aggro produced by procs.<br />
<br />
b. Increasing the damage produced and proc rates of 1Hdrs when used with a shield by a Warrior.<br />
<br />
c. Give shields an inate chance to block repostes.<br />
<br />
8. While the introduction of Greatstaff of Thunder, Copper Hammer of Striking, and Sword of the Bloodsworn have helped Warriors in obtaining aggro Weapons, there continues to be very few options at level 65.<br />
<br />
The high level weapons are quite satisfactory, but require guilds to repeatedly raid the same mobs in order to acquire these for their Warriors. Guilds have other priorities. As a result many level 65 Warriors find themselves wielding a Blade of Carnage (you can confirm this by checking your database). While this is a fine weapon, the fact that it several expansions old attests to both the scarcity and lack of variety of high level aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
9. Warrior right-click healing effects and bandaging need to be improved. At 9001 HP's, healing from 1 HP requires 90 right clicks. If it is not possible to alter these items to accomplish a 2% heal per click, then creating a Level 65 Required chestplate with a right click self-only Superior Heal should be concidered.<br />
<br />
10. Methods to increase Warrior utility should be concidered. At the present time, there is little reason to add a Warrior to a group in any position other than Main Tank. Since in all fairness, Knights should also be able to perform this function we now have a lot of competition.<br />
<br />
Tanks should &quot;stack&quot;, having 2 tanks in a group should be seen as a good group configuration. While Knights have sufficient utility to be candidates for a DPS/utility slot, Warriors do not.<br />
<br />
Increasing melee DPS will help. Insuring that items like Truncheon of Doom, Silken Whip of Ensnaring, and Journeyman's Walking Stick perform their function on the majority of experiance mobs in all zones and at all levels is also very helpful. Please concider introducing upgraded versions of these items if they do not work on experiance mobs in higher level zones.<br />
<br />
Warriors have encountered some issues (particularly aggro abilities) that have become long standing concerns that need attention.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All items except 8 and 9 are intended to also apply to Warriors that have not reached level 65.<br />
<br />
As a result of your feedback:<br />
I added a reference to Chestplate of Vindication and noted that multi-class armor errodes the intended Warrior survivability advantage in all tiers. I now explicitly mention raising the success rate and scalability of Taunt.<br />
<br />
If there is something else I should have thought of that is important to mid-level Warriors, kindly post it. My oversight was not intentional and I apologise.<br />

Great ideas otherwise :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other point you may want to include to further stress the Itemization part of the argument is that TRADITIONALLY , and in the interest of class balance, Most classes have had to choose one aspect of their class's strengths above the others.  For instance, WARRIORS, when choosing Stat's/gear/weapons etc etc... have had to decide wether they wanted to Focus on Tanking, or upping their DPS.  <br />
<br />
For the most part,  warriors STILL have to decide on aggro vs DPS  when choosing a weapon, and although some of the &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; gear(Good AC STR, DEX, and STA + HP) is helping in this area, having a weapon that is 11/17 for aggro purposes is  likely causing you to sacraficing damage you could be dealing with a heavy hitter....I know some Higher lvl attainable Luclin and higher teir PoP weapons have low delay and high damage....but most Tanks that play this game won't ever see them unless they would like to spend 100k+ in the bazaar for them.<br />
<br />
Similiarly, Knights traditionally had to either concentrate on TANK gear or MANA gear.  They chose their role through what stats they wanted to improve.....I see no problem with a Knight that has chosen the tanking role, and geared his character accordingly to be a much closer tank to a warrior thatn other knights because the knight had to take tank gear, sacraficing mana,  to do it....this balances things somewhat.  Now, with Itemization totally out of whack....a Knight gets Gear that has teh best of both worlds.......THIS is one of the biggest problems I see for balance issues(along with aggro ofcoarse).<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh well .. its not like the developers are gonna listen anyway....I'll just keep submitting my weekly feedback complaining when something happens in game to piss me off all over again.</div></div><hr />
