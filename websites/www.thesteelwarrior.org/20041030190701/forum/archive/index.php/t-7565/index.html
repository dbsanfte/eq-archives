<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sloanbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dumped my warrior and put this up for sale for 30k. It sold in 3 seconds and the guy put it back up for 150k. I searched around on EQ sites and the rumor is it doesnt drop any more. Any truth to this? <br />
<br />
A couple hours later I saw one for 20k so I picked it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well congratulations on your quick 10k profit :)<br />
<br />

<br />
the previous day i saw one for sale for 200k ....<br />
<br />
and the previous few months i never saw one for sale at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">afaik still drops, but no one hunts in sebilis anymore. so it's gotten rare again.</div></div><hr />

Frodlin has gotten 10 aas while in Seb, so should say how rare it is.</div></div><hr />

Froglok Armsman iirc.  Camped it for a total of about 8 hours, gave up and paid 25k for one.  Lowest I've seen on Stromm is 25k, and have seen as high as 200k which is a total rip.  Maybe it's just me, but the proc rate seems horrible.  I am sure it is standard..  but it just doesn't seem like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Telen!   That guy is in the Chef camp correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, same camp. Where the chef is to the south, the armsman is to the east.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">its as rare or common as always ... nobody camps it tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Even though a Willsapper is a lower % slow, it may be a bit easier to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Proc rate is fine, just get WA5 and max dex :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Saw this post and decided to camp it. <br />
<br />
Took a little while to get there solo but once I did it was np holding camp. Started off getting the armsman after every other PHer. He dropped Seb leggings, Berz hat, Rog hat. Didnt get a spawn for awhile so came back this morning. After 1 PHer he popped and dropped the ToD. <br />
<br />
Spent about 8 or so hours total with 26minute respawns. Only trouble was actualy getting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A friend of mine camped Necro in seb for 60 to 80 hours a week, every week.  He grouped his cleric alt with the enchanter and ran a dc pet before exp was changed on/around release of PoP.  He leveled the cleric from level 42 or so in Seb to level 60 + 30 or 40 AA.  In that time, he obatined 3 of the rare drops (rbg I think it was.)<br />
<br />
I guess my point is, I would not expect to get anything from seb that is a rare drop like this in less than 2 or 3 months of camping 60 hours a week.  I would expect it to be 1 in 1000 kills or so.<br />
<br />
You don't see these anymore and you don't see them for sale because no one goes to the ghost town of seb anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot; A friend of mine camped Necro in seb for 60 to 80 hours a week, every week.

<br />
not saying your friend is one of them, but there were bots on all servers run on macro system which used to auto-farm lots of the seb camps for pp to pawn on ebay and the like.  enchanter DC + cleric is the combo that was always used.<br />
<br />
anywho, long story short: SOE cracked down on them and these buggers are no longer around to hog all the pp spots.  The backlash:  lots of these items which used to have a steady inflow into the enconomy have now been cut off.<br />
<br />
Is ToD worth 60k?  ... no<br />
Is ToD worth 30k? ... no<br />
Can people actually sell these for that much?  ... yes<br />
<br />
supply/demand dictates it, and 1 too many clueless newbs on every server leads to overprices goodies.<br />
<br />
PS- Cobalt bracer is hovering around 50-60k on Mith marr now ... /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/hugs his ToD<br />
<br />
i dont feel 30k was a bad price for it really, not considering its 50 percent slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On the guy camping Necro in Seb... You really wouldn't expect to see this drop in a Necro camp.<br />
<br />
From the zonein, you'd head right, crossing the bridge before necro, heading down, passed a doorway/hall on your left where the Gangerous Beetle or whatever gang was, then down again. This is the general area of Arm/Bar (Froglok Armsmen, which drops ToD, and a Froglok Bartender, as well as chef and maybe something else I can't remember).<br />
<br />
I got my ToD xping down here long long ago. Actually, I won the roll on a Sebilite Helm, lost the trade up roll on the ToD, but the person who won the ToD wanted the helm for a bard alt.<br />
<br />
I've seen a few drop, and never camped it, just killed stuff for xp here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">bought it for 2500pp some years ago =x. In 6 or 7 hours camping i saw it 2 times back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Proc rate is fine, just get WA5 and max dex :D<br />
<br />
I only use the ToD when there's no shammy around, hence no dex buff (unless I take a potion), and so I'm sitting at 160-170ish Dex.  Hard to max dex at level 59 and need to do a lot more leveling and other AA's before WA5.   :)</div></div><hr />
