<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This turned out to be more of a balad in prose, but I am no bard, to mark the occasion of this: http://www.archoverseers.org<br />
<br />
Don't be too harsh on me atm.  <br />
<br />
<br />
For nearly two years now,  I have done every thing from screamed and ranted, to making well thought out arguements, to rallying the community to band together to get SOE to listen. All for nothing. <br />
<br />
A paladin tanked, with ease, the very last  boss mob in the game today. Some will argue that it happened because of mudflation (I don't see how, since the time bosses drop the very best stuff in the game and it was a time boss) others will say it was because that guild had already killed that mob, but we know the truth. The paladins say its no big deal, but we know that boils down to the &quot;nothing to see here, move along&quot; argument. But we know the truth.<br />
<br />
The warrior's day was fading, and is ended, now it is the time of the Knight.  We fought our battles long and hard, never gaining ground.  And now, the our war is over, the day is not ours.<br />
<br />
There is no reason for a warrior to exist in Norrath after today. The devs don't care, because the classes are not that out of balance. The next expansion will come and go,  and warriors wont even be able to limp along with our one crutch. What would be the point as the knights gallop by? <br />
<br />
The war has ended, our battle lost. The armor and weapons will look fine on a tavern wall, with a bartender recalling the glory of battles long past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If warriors are to become better at competition for XP groups, then knights need to be better raid tanks.  Blurring of the roles is a GOOD thing for everyone.  Wouldn't you rather have all the knights as viable tanks for a raid against time gods?<br />

Slower than most, I hit the low 50's right at the point aggro lock became the biggest thing you wanted in a tank. I was told repeatedly that Paladins and SK's needed a place to shine, and that place was in XP groups, because Warriors shined in raids.<br />
<br />
 I've never MT'd a boss mob. Most Warriors I know will never tank a boss mob. I leveled slower than dirt all through my 50's because Paladin after SK grabbed the MT spots in XP groups because 'I shine in raids'.<br />
<br />
 Now they shine in raids too, and I don't have the XP spot to compensate. So take your 'competition' bullshit and blow it straight out your ass. You guys got your wish - you now can tank everything in game that's not specifically designed to defeat you, and you do it with a lot more brought to the table. Enjoy the banquet.

<br />
As said in the other 10 page thread...  Do you honestly think that a knight should be able to tank as well as a warrior AND retain their level of utility?  If you say yes then you need to put the pipe down and back away slowly.  We're not talking Aten or Emp here, you know the expansion that's not the high end at the moment...  We're talking the phase 5 gods and Quarm.  You can't tell me PoP isn't the current high end expansion and if you do you're lying not only to everyone here but to yourself as well.  Warriors should very well be &quot;the&quot; tank, specifically in raid situations, if knights were meant to be as good as them why the hell do they offer so much additional utility?<br />
<br />
Warriors are broken, horribly broken from a balance point of view.  There should be a broader hit point variance between warriors and knights, there should be a significant innate mitigation variance between warriors and knights.  Just giving warriors more hit points isn't the answer, it would be a crumb at best.  Simply put, at this stage of the game (Time being the true current high end because that's what's being unlocked and farmed and that's where the loot drops) knights should not be able to tank those mobs, period.  Warriors should have an innate ability to mitigate damage taken above and beyond what a knight can absorb and no defensive disc isn't what i mean.<br />
<br />
I really liked the suggestion someone had to give warriors 130% current mitigation, knights 80%, casters 50%, etc...  Fact of the matter is, this is beyond screwed up and it really does need to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its been less than THREE months since their first quarm kill(August 16 according to the jap progress site). So its not like its a very long hatchling process; check back new years eve and there will be a lot of hybrids that can pull this off, once the second wave of Quarm beating guilds have gotten their farming done.<br />
<br />
And nobody said warriors must by the only tank for _everything_, but they sure as hell should be for the current endgame mob of EQ.<br />
<br />
As for:<br />
If warriors are to become better at competition for XP groups, then knights need to be better raid tanks.<br />
<br />
You want to be a BETTER raid tank??? You can already tank the endgame mob in EQ, what more do you want, Quarm loot in your shiny newbie bag along with the 200 sense heading?? Gimme a fucking break.<br />
<br />
If you havent caught on yet, the reason it is BAD that a hybrid can MT the endgame mob, is that warriors are the damage intake specialists, and as such SHOULD be required to tank the very highest mobs(not ALL, but the high end). <br />
<br />
These mobs should be a challenge, and should be able to tear any non-specialized class(you know, those guys that CHOSE to give up some tanking edge in order to get neat stuff like spells) a new one. <br />
<br />
I just have one question for the brikhead hybrids out there:<br />
<br />
Why be a specialist in a game where non-specialists can perform the exact same duties as the specialist, and in _addition_ have a wide variety of convenient and attractive skills the specialist do not have access to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SOE controls the game.  Why did they let the game mudlfate that far?  What should a Paladin sporting Time gear be able to tank?<br />
<br />
Everyone glosses over the fact that if a Paladin can tank it a Warrior can tank it just as well without any added tricks.  If that doesn't strike anyone odd I don't know what would.<br />
<br />
Being the specialistis you are got you here.  It looks like being specialists doesn't help tank Quarm that much.  So what is the big bonus to being specialist?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Well, once upon a time there was one, until they put you guys on our defensive tables, upped your DPS, and gave you even better aggro control. The path of Knights post-Kunark has steadily climbed and doesn't look to go down. All the negatives you used to have are gone, and short of replacing at least some of them, Warriors won't be specializing in anything other than LF(Charity)G.</div></div><hr />

If I don't get a lifeline soon Im just going to drop EQ for a game alot of people are going to play - and it will probably be done right if Blizzard's track record is the same. <br />
<br />
I'm just sick of begging for some little changes for an obviously unbalanced class. My monthly fee is the same as someone with a knight .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Partha, you didn't answer my question.  What did being a specialist get the Warrior class?  Specifically how does specialization help beat Quarm?  Specialization placed Warriors where they are today so claiming that it is some big bonus is a little strange.  If a Paladin can tank Quarm and survive, then all of that specialization means zip. What skills does a Warrior bring to the fight to help beat Quarm?  Unless you think acting at a 10K HP bucket to fill and drain is some type of elite skill.<br />
<br />
Vie allows *everyone* to take a step up in tanking.  When you are at the top, what do you step up too?  Vie doesn't allow Warriors to tank anything they couldn't tank before but it allows *everyone else* to tackle stuff they couldn't before.<br />
<br />
Was Quarm tuned correctly?  It seems he was geared for Elemental + Time.  How difficult should Quarm be after then 4th time through?  Quarm certainly isn't tuned for Vie.</div></div><hr />

Warriors could use some improvements.. and indeed this series of events may very well fall in your favor as knights start to cross warrior-only boundaries, warriors may get some in-game help to cross what they think are knight-only boundaries.<br />
<br />
I want knights to be better than they currently are for raid level tanking. NOT better than warriors overall.  You wish to misquote me so you do...  I don't want to have to wait until 3 months after the mob is too easy for us to be able to tank something for the guild.<br />
<br />
DRUIDS tank for us on mobs we can let them... we have a running joke that one of our best equipped druids (time stuff in nearly every slot) is a tank, and we let that druid tank just for kicks (and fun) on battles we know are too easy for us.  Since the druid was never designed for a tank, this is a great joke...   grats to that paladin for being the 3-month-old joke...<br />

And I find your comment about there even being 3 tanks after Velious quite funny.  Maybe you guys didn't notice it but I sure as hell did, my guild along with alot of others wouldn't even heal Knights because their tanking abilites were too far behind, the first/only pre pop encounter knights got heals on to be truthful was Emp.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Not at all.  Just saying its not right (and never was right) for Warriors to have a stranglehold on raid tanking, and they're finally losing it, they just need to lose it completly now (you know, all that Kunark-Luclin content). Also, by the same logic Knights need to lose their stranglehold on exp group tanking, all 3 classes need to be equally desireable as tanks instead of Paladin top exp group tank, SK a little ways behind in 2nd place and Warriors a very distant 3rd and in raids Warriors #1, Paladins a distant 2nd, and SK's behind that.  As it is, at the point where Knights are getting the ability to tank time mobs Warriors are able to contribute pretty damn well to an exp groups (still need a tiny boost though) so I see that as being the way it should be minus Warriors still needing a small boost there since the RNG doesn't always work the way you want it to.  It's the other areas where theres a problem, give up being 100% required for a raid tank and you'll get exp groups.  Dev's have tried EQ as a game where each class is the best at one specific thing and it doesn't work, yet they've tried before with multiple classes filling a role and it worked, it appears they're going back to that.</div></div><hr />

How do you do that without NERFING your own class?<br />

This is a minefield. Tread lightly, there's no good answer.<br />

<br />
Brael, much like Brik, doesn't actually know a damn thing except what Arbaal tells him from the Senior Guide Inside Info Program. <br />
<br />
When you hear a Knight tell you things like 'you are on a different mitigation table,' immediately realize that this is a person that doesn't know their head from their asshole - and chances are good they are both located very close to each other.<br />
<br />
What you two fail to realize, as usual (very much like Brael's idiotic assumption that the VDD was a &gt; melee weapon than the GoC - from bad info and not from any actual understanding of how melee works) is that hitpoints past a certain point do not offer significant returns. Additionally, contrary to HPs, AC does offer significant returns, to points which players cannot and have not reached yet. Two things which work against a Warrior and work in favor of a Knight. Why? Knights can reach and go past that point of diminishing returns on hit points and Knights can and do have greater AC than equally equipped Warriors. Again, another Knightemization issue - something which the developers should be held accountable for and something which absolutely must be regulated.<br />
<br />
Go back to the SK boards and continue feeding your cronies false information and prepare for judgement day, pussies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Superchum, it's quite simple actually.  I'm sure these ideas have been listed on your own boards as well but I'll repeat it anyways since you asked.<br />
1.  Put Warriors on Knight HP tables and throw in a 10-12% innate ND from level 1.  With that and higher hp through some gear choices you'll be sitting at around 15% more hp than a similarly geared Knight which is a pretty good difference.  You have to remember that if you up the gap to much then you trivialize content, otherwise I would say shoot for 20% equipped, perhaps add the rest through itemization in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
2.  Add some minor snap aggro to your class for the beginning of a fight, such as a fast reuse (no recycle) button that places you at level*10 hate on the mob.  So for example at 65, mob is inc you can hit your button and have 650 hate on it, which is enough for you to establish melee aggro, early slows, etc... but does not increase sustained aggro generation.  If you had 400 hate on the mob then hit the button you would still have 650 for another example.<br />

<br />
small problem, and the main reason I don't think that'll work. 15% of what? 6k as a baseline? 900hp's? Mobs that aren't trivially easy to tank and require plate mitigation to be efficiently beaten have to hit at least as hard as PoP mobs these days. That works out at around 2-3 swings difference in times hit as a mitigation advantage. With so many warriors still having to dual wield to maintain aggro ripostes as they currently stand would eat that difference but really that's a side issue. That 900 hp's doesn't save a cleric much time between casts, therefore over the course of the fight he doesn't save much mana, therefore your additional utility is still a better trade off. For a pure hp difference to have a meaningful impact I think you'd have to boost warriors hp gap to ludicrous levels which would most definately not help with raid balance. <br />
<br />
That's leaving aside my own personal reservations with any plate tank that wants aggro having aggro on demand.<br />

I'll look for the post later if you want but there was a thread on your own boards that showed how mitigation differs between classes.

You're correct about AC giving gains well past points where players haven't reached yet we both know thats true so no need to argue it.  I can see where your argument is coming from by saying HP does give diminishing returns, I would assume you're referring to once you're at the point where CH's are regularly healing atleast 90% of thier max value on you.  The flaw with your logic however is that those extra hp still help, if you have a missed heal, damage spike, etc... those extra HP will keep you alive (hopefully) where another class tanking would have died.  DI and Vie are the two biggest contributors to tanking inbalances right now, not Knights/Gear.</div></div><hr />

That would improve the idea alittle.  With the way HP scale currently though, any adjustment made to lower Knight hp would force all other classes to be adjusted as well which is counter productive.

<br />
Ripostes are a good point I forgot about, something needs to be done about that, such as offhand being immune to riposte and 1h weapons having only half the chance to be stopped via riposte.  Atleast for Warriors, unsure if it should apply to other dual weilding classes.</div></div><hr />

I'm coming around again to my old saw - limited utility for warriors with a minor tanking advantage because someone will always have an advantage and whatever they can add to warriors will never be equal to spellcasting benefits from level 9 on...<br />
<br />
*EDIT* When I say spellcasting benefits I'm considering benefits obtained both in and out of combat/groups btw. Simple spells to ease travelling are immensely useful which might not be so obvious unless you have to do without them for 65 levels :p</div></div><hr />

I'm sure warriors would be thrilled to be the guy you turn to if the raid needs lev and/or invis.  OOH!! And they could heal you outside of combat, when nothing is going on?!?

Brael,<br />
<br />
I believe you're referring to Thepp's post, which was interesting to say the least.   What interests me is that there was an additionally extensive parse set over on the clerics' board which showed clerics mitigating almost identically to warriors (within the margin of error).<br />
<br />
What is of interest to me is that this places you at an interesting crossroads.   Do you believe that because of the two parses that you mitigate worse than clerics?   Or is it possible that there was enough variation (less than 4% difference outside of margin of errors) that would cause us to pause and reflect upon the meaning of the two sets of data?</div></div><hr />

If you want other possible things they could have?   Target ac/atk debuffs, group ac/atk buffs, group only improved /shield, increased chances for dodge/parry/riposte/double attack/dual weild/etc to go off when grouped with a Warrior, average hit goes up by x% when grouped with a Warrior, each hit goes up by x% when grouped with a Warrior.  Make the effects cumulative so multiple Warriors in the same group would increase the effects, also make them increase with level be innate and not need activated and give Warriors access to them starting at level 9.  Hows that for ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really need to bookmark that thread, I post it on so many boards when the question of plate mitigation comes up.  Clerics wondered if they had equal mitigation with Warriors with same AC.  They were proven right...average hits were about the same.  Clerics just have shit for avoidance (hence the reason why many clerics prefer Combat Agility than Stability, other than the fact it's better to avoid than take less).  Now if you have worse mitigation than Warriors with same AC, that means you have worse mitigation than Clerics with same AC.  I don't believe that to be true.<br />
<br />
And Brael?  An idea similar to that has been suggested before (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=783)...although back in May before this really got heated.  There's been lots of ideas thrown around by all sorts of people, and a lot of them are very good even if requiring some changes, but it's all for naught if SOE doesn't even add them.  <br />

Knights first take over the Warrior's group role, and now their raid role, and you want to give them &quot;self-sufficiency.&quot;<br />
<br />
You're targetting the wrong kind of utility.  When pure melee talk about &quot;utility,&quot; we're talking about options like: <br />
<br />
root the mob<br />
stun the mob<br />
snare the mob<br />
quick-aggro and offtank the mob<br />
quick-aggro and kite the mob<br />
keep the group alive with a timely heal<br />
keep the raid alive with timely CC<br />
perform situational damage against a favored enemy<br />
perform near-manaburn levels of instant damage<br />
<br />
and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
We're not talking about downtime heals or single effects obtained from easily-bazaar-bought potions or common right-click items from Venril Sathir.<br />
<br />
Target ac/atk debuffs, group ac/atk buffs, group only improved /shield, increased chances for dodge/parry/riposte/double attack/dual weild/etc to go off when grouped with a Warrior, average hit goes up by x% when grouped with a Warrior, each hit goes up by x% when grouped with a Warrior<br />
<br />
Few of which are in line with what a warrior is supposed to do. A warrior does not inherently confer bonusses to group mates. A warrior is not a bard.<br />
<br />
You keep tossing these ideas out... ideas that go against everything a warrior is or should be, when instead you should be discussing how to give back what has been stolen from them.  You're acting as if the hybrids are the parent class, and the Warrior should be content in the niche role that you, yourself was not content in playing.<br />
<br />
That makes you a hypocrite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Bards, have to sing.  I was referring to just from being grouped with them.

<br />
Frodlin, I looked at those parses, but then theres also that other set which was done between a Paladin and Warrior which show differently, and since I think its pretty reasonable to say a Knight isn't mitigating worse than a Cleric that means the two contradict eachother, so I'll hold off on further comments about that for now, however if it does end up being true it shows Warriors need an adjustment to their mitigation table since they're supposed to use AC a bit more effectively (in addition to having the same or larger amounts of it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Bleh, all i can say is don't try to discuss class balance at 4am in the morning, it hurts your head :p.<br />
<br />
Lessee,<br />
<br />
My personal assumptions that i bring to the class balance debate, take them as you will.<br />
<br />
The psychological impact on a class whose character concept is entirely designed around a particular job, when it is consistently being shown to be clearly inferior in any part of that job is not good. When that other is less focussed on the job and suffers no significant trade off it become untenable. <br />
<br />
The conceptual differences between warriors and knights are part of the problem. You want to tank like me but i can clearly see you have a number of advantages elsewhere. Why should I accept your muscling in on that concept when you originally made the choice of having the extra tricks that i did without? <br />
<br />
Knights wish to tank with balanced ability vs. warriors.<br />
<br />
Any 'Balance' has to take into account additional abilities accrued by a class outside of the combat arena.<br />
<br />
Being the 'best tank' is THE basic core of the warrior concept - in order to invalidate that by making Knights and warriors 'equal' any advantages warriors gain will need to be clearly visible to both the warrior and his group so that the trade off in individuality seems 'fair'.<br />
<br />
Any utility you do give to warriors needs to remain inside the concept of a 'man alone with just his weapons, armour, guts and natural wits between him and the enemy' Not only did i choose a warrior because he was best tank, but because I did not 'like' the Tank plus divine spells concept. See any archetypical Warrior found in fantasy fiction for the general idea.<br />
<br />
Go to far away from that premise with our 'hybridisation' and you risk making him alien to the initial concept that attracted us to him. <br />
<br />
..on a tangent,<br />
<br />
*Noteable examples of this thought process* <br />
<br />
Despite how bloody irritating healing downtime is I DO NOT want heal spells - it's not 'me'. <br />
<br />
Specific examples of a warrior skill 'inspiring his group to further efforts' similar to short duration buffs are not inimicable to me though exactly what you choose to enhance in such a fashion would have to be carefully considered to remain 'in character'.<br />
<br />
Warrior 'special attacks' that create a debuff effect (pulverise armour with a crushing blow, cut a hamstring to snare a mob, cut an artery to create a DoT etc) on a 1-2 minute timer would be 'acceptable'. All such abilities would have to be relatively short term compared with any caster spells to create a trade off and require some thought on timing/picking your attack.<br />
<br />
Spells as cast by both hybrids and pure casters are extremely 'powerful' things. Whilst any and all of this would help provide colour, make playing second fiddle less of a chore etc (always a good thing) none of it can be powerful enough to overweigh hybrid spells or else again you attack the warrior concept and you also attack the individuality of the hybrids and bards themselves. A warrior wouldn't use 'tricks' of stunning magnitude. <br />
<br />
Having said that, one particular ability I would kinda like and which bucks this trend whilst giving a warrior a real 'non-tanking' secondary skill (with a high value trade off) is the 'Cripple' ability (no longer linkable :p) a 50% slow, balanced by 'normal' chances of a resist, a 10 second refresh, aggro equal to any other slow with the warrior's survivability compromised by taking damage as if under aggressive disc from  the moment the button is first pushed until a full minute period after the last button depress. <br />
<br />
Hopefully you can see the trade off and why i think that seems 'acceptable'. <br />
<br />
Back to my assumptions,<br />
<br />
From where I and most warriors are standing (and it's people like me you need to sell this on or our enjoyment of the class is destroyed) a 'high end fix' of utility is NOT far reaching enough, we've spent 65 levels without spells because of the understanding that it wouldn't be fair for us to have them when we tank 'so much' (~) better. I cannot imagine that any SoE fix will address the redesign of a class from the ground up in more than a cursory fashion. Which means an inequity will still exist.<br />
<br />
Equity will never exist so long as any class has a clear aggro advantage and 'close' mitigation. You 'could' give warriors aggro on demand to address that, however I'm concerned that (as it does now) it trivialises aggro penalties for casting/effects. <br />
<br />
Imagine my cripple ability with another warrior quickly and without risk taking aggro away from the 'vulnerable' tank. No trade off. There have to be consequences for what are currently 'high aggro' actions by classes that are at substantial risk from mob damage. If there is no risk, then player 'skill' is meaningless. Long ass threads all over here /shrug lots of posts by me too :p <br />
<br />
To my mind, Tank aggro (defined as that aggro that classes seeking to obtain the attention of and control of a mob whilst also being able to withstand that mobs attacks handily) needs to be innately better than current warrior levels by some margin whilst not becoming an automatic, foregone conclusion (a la current knight aggro) The provision for snap aggro should probably still be available but with much heavier restrictions in terms of 'stacking hate', a need to pick the correct timing, mana costs or penalties to a classes own performance. i.e. A real trade off for 'sidestepping' the game mechanics. <br />
<br />
*Inherent problems with mitigation trades as a balance against non-combat utility.*<br />
<br />
Balancing a warrior by increasing hp's or a mitigation change that simulates that : Given current (and future) mana regen levels/size of mana pools and requisite mob damage output to keep up with party hp levels i no longer think balance by hp's is viable. To cause a cleric to suffer any real, noticeable mana saving via pure hp's alone (a la the old kunark balancing) warriors are gonna need what? At least a third more hp's? Unless a fight lasts as long as the Luclin drone fests that hp advantage will still be relatively unneccessary as to allow knights to 'tank well' you could not make use of that additional 'potential' without making it very risky for the knight to tank. Long fights also mean long med times helping to negate the advantage. <br />
<br />
Even if we do that making a signifiant warrior improvement such as that will affect raid balance very greatly. Doing so well enough to balance the spell inequity would make a group seeking a TANK still choose the warrior first, you cannot have a tanking advantage if it's no advantage.<br />
<br />
My conclusion? I really don't know. I'm leaning towards much higher 'risk' factors for plate tanks so that smaller differences make more of an impact, this would of course cause a correspondingly higher difficulty for casters and require them to really worry about gaining aggro again. Most casters and DPS will hate me :p, additionally mudflation with smaller differences will be correspondingly worse in it's impact.  <br />
<br />
If it wasn't for it being their own fault for inflating abilities continually without in-depth thought of consequences i'd feel a lot of sympathy for SoE right now....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Couple of notes on skills/spells in game that lead me to conclude that tank spell aggro as it currently stands was not a 'design decision' but more of an accident. <br />
<br />
AEtaunt - firstly it's an AA skill, not an innate ability. Secondly this warrior form of 'snap aggro' (practically in many circumstances not much better than spell hate) has a low range, attracts the attention of multiple targets beyond the control of the user, and has a massive reuse time (15 mins base as opposed to 5 secs).<br />
<br />
Shadowknight hate spells. The spells Shadowknights gain that were SPECIFICALLY designed for hate purposes. At least according to what I've read, when cast at range the hate level is significantly lower (not much more than an arrow tag) and/or the spells require the SK to be in melee combat to generate hate. <br />
<br />
Food for thought perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Slansin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">but whats wrong with everyone in the group getting bonuses to melee from being grouped with a Warrior, the precedent was already set with Warcry (although its rather poor impementation and general lack of fearing mobs makes it almost completly worthless).<br />
<br />
Because the Warrior is the master of melee combat.  Not the warrior's group.  It makes no sense that simply being in proximity with a Warrior magically makes me better at my job.  Warriors ARE NOT MAGICAL.<br />
<br />
If Warriors were given what you suggest, not only would it be completely against their archetype, but you'd have Bards screaming to high hell that Warriors had better (constant, without song or chance to miss a note) group effects.<br />
<br />
Warcry is a triggered skill, not an inherent group bonus.  If you want to give them a library of similar triggered skills and turn Warriors into Diablo 2 Barbarians, that's another story.<br />
<br />
But you'd only be &quot;fixing&quot; their raid stackability.  If you hadn't noticed, the uproar is over tanking, not stackability.  I'm sure they'd welcome some sort of stackability, but again, I doubt that giving them such a consolation prize without fixing the major issues involving your full spellbook and complete knightemization would really change anything or make anyone happy in the long run.<br />
<br />
Such a &quot;fix&quot; would still leave them in 3rd place for tanking.  Sure, they'd actually have a minor use on raids...<br />
<br />
Remember when you never got to tank, and were called on only for minor skills and spells?  <br />
<br />
And you liked it so much back then, which is why you were content with your class and didn't want any upgrades at all.<br />

You mention giving warriors a penalty in mitigation and/or avoidance for getting momentary spell-like aggro.  <br />

<br />
What if instead, knights had a penalty for casting spells during combat.  Sure they get the aggro, but maybe they don't want it then.  Maybe 15 seconds or so of cleric-like avoidance or ranger-like mitigation.  They are casting spells after all and that should take alot of consentration and energy.  Right now the only penalty is the spell might be interupted and their melee dps is paused while the spell is cast.</div></div><hr />

I just wanna be able to enjoy the game .. no I never personally get ousted as a warrior from groups because of a paladin .. but dammit man .. do we get anything for playing the game for 4+ years dedicating time and money to watch a corp look the other way while we suffer from lack of ability to enjoy the material as it comes  .. Hey sorry pallies sks rangers I dun care if you had it bad once thats not our faults or resposibility, we smply want pay period like every other class for continuing to invest our time . I mean Geez where the hell would yall lazy butts if we were constant first class on the mob protecting you? Huh? /smack<br />
<br />
Think about it here comes Kunark VP first expansion where were forced into tanking .. like tat was in the plan when I started my character .. nope don't think so woulda been much happier just sittin back being a DPS class with a couple of axes of something .. then here we are 4 years later asking for help like the boss forgot to put TP on the roll in the john fo us ... the least you can do is show some damn respect.<br />
<br />
Hps don't cut it yo .. dimishing returns happen at somewhere around 9 to 10k . Hps are a mute point when another class can match your one trick pony and hand out sodas and hot dogs while your sitting there with your ego in yours hands going? what's up .. how come I don't even have a cup holder Sony?<br />

Lots of Knights simply are against Warriors because the majority of pure melee said fuck hybrids for 3 years, hell I can remember Warriors asking for SK's/Pal's to get nerfed during Kunark.  Granted most of the people refusing to help now didn't even play back then (or atleast didn't play Knights) but thats a large part of it.  Those of us that did actually do think you guys need upped, just cautious about it being taken to far and being brought back to Velious or even worse... Kunark style balance again</div></div><hr />

You mean those &quot;one arm gimps don't belong in a group&quot; jokes? Wow, i thought pre-SoL Knights had it pretty shitty. Actually, i take that back. They did have it shitty. Although the next statement here makes me laugh more :<br />

OH my. My sides hurt. Like mentioned before...WHO actually thought Pal/SK were overpowered? Holy shit. Ya'll were so down in DPS and overall utility that you were the red-headed stepchildren of EQ. Stuns didn't means hit, buffs didn't mean shit, because when 60 was top level YOU COULDN'T DO SHIT.     <br />

Again; I seriously doubt that aside from the sarcastic remarks of nerfing plate hybrids pre-knark...no one in their right minds want you guysnerfed. You all are just too damn useful for ALL instances to take anhting away from it.<br />
Sure; it wuld be nice to do some of the nitty stuff you plate hybrids do but Warriors for the most part do NOT want to become soloing gods o the game and scoff and mock at others. <br />
We'd just like to be useful in some shape or form other than the 3 minute miracles or 'unless you got 300 aa's you suck' dept.<br />

KNIGHTS STFU.  You won, you have it all, you can tank it all.  Back in the kunark and velious days, I felt for you guys. But god damn, you guys got it all and its not fucking enough. You couldn't just be gracious, no you gotta keep everyone else down. I wasn't on the nerf knights bandwagon before, but after having to deal with your class attitude for over a year now, and especially after last weeks events, I hope to god you guys get the nerf bat shoved so far up your asses it comes out your mouths to bonk you on the head.  Thats right I said nerf knights.  You guys don't deserve to have it so well.  Warriors were gracious to you all when you sucked so bad, but by god I think maybe you all deserved to suck now with the sort of treatment you come here and give warriors. You can't be happy to have what you do, no you have to come here and start rubbing salt in the wound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Shikarii, it wasn't everyone, there was that minority of people who did say things like that though.  Actually, it was some of the Warriors who still post on this board, who would say things seriously such as if were supposed to be 75% of a Warrior we should have 75% of the hp, 75% of the ac, 75% of the skill caps, etc... suppose it's not a big deal though since every board has/had its fair share of idiots and that number rises significantly when your class is percieved as being one of the best classes at the moment.<br />

Still think a button that puts you at a certain amount of hate on a mob as long as youre under that amount would go a long ways towards fixing your guys problems.<br />

If you've seen my boards, you would understand what being a mod/admin on them for years would do to your mind.  That should explain it.<br />

Yep, I was there, first 60 sk on my server one of the first 60 sk's overall.  Played all through that expansion and know what it was like, the situation isn't as bad right now as it was then although the amount of Warriors who don't get a group should say alot.  You have to keep in mind though when looking at lfg people, only 1 person in a group ends up getting a tanking spot and there are still alot of people playing Warriors (probally more than Pal/SK combined) so you'll always see more Warriors LFG than Knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">The problem is, BoV isn't the problem.  The imbalance people are crying about existed before LDoN, and thus before BoV.  It just makes the imbalance more pronounced.  <br />
<br />
The solution is to fix the problem, not bandaid something that irritates the problem.  Fix the problem and BoV becomes that it was intended to be, a nice tool.</div></div><hr />

I believe you're referring to Thepp's post, which was interesting to say the least. What interests me is that there was an additionally extensive parse set over on the clerics' board which showed clerics mitigating almost identically to warriors (within the margin of error).<br />
<br />
What is of interest to me is that this places you at an interesting crossroads. Do you believe that because of the two parses that you mitigate worse than clerics? Or is it possible that there was enough variation (less than 4% difference outside of margin of errors) that would cause us to pause and reflect upon the meaning of the two sets of data?<br />
<br />
You are missing some vital pieces of information. The paladin and the warrior in Thepp's post had A) the same defense skill, and B) displayed AC that was very close. The difference between that parse and the cleric parse is that the cleric and warrior did indeed have almost identical displayed AC, but their defensive skill was very different. Here (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=14449) is the cleric post and the relevant data from that post follows. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, took the 65 warrior with no CA/CS and tanked the same mob I tanked with Mikar. Both took 1000 swings exactly. <br />

I leave the numbers up for debate without any conclusion for the time being.<br />
<br />
You are assuming that since these 2 characters had essentially the same displayed AC that they had the same mitigation. That is not true. The warrior had less mitigation AC than the cleric did. The warrior had a higher defense skill meaning he had higher avoidance. Remove the avoidance and compare their mitigation directly:<br />
<br />
1299 displayed AC -584 avoidance for the warrior = 715 mitigation<br />
1297 displayed AC -475 avoidance for the cleric = 822 mitigation<br />
<br />
In spite of that, the cleric took slightly more damage per hit on average than the warrior did. Even more telling is the shape of the curve. The cleric is getting hit for minimum more often than the warrior is, and yet the cleric is also getting hit for max more often as well. Warriors just don't get hit for max as often os other classes do for the same amount of mitigation from all the parses I have seen. Whether that is just the RNG at work, I don't know. I don't know what mechanism is used to  differentiate mitigation abilities like that, but I know they aren't client side. They are not affected by displayed AC because we can find out the exact mitigation values for each of these characters with a given displayed AC. According to the mitigation AC each of these characters have, the cleric should mitigate better. If mitigation was linear then the cleric should actually mitigate 15% better than the warrior, and yet he didn't. <br />
<br />
I don't see how that parse shows in any way that clerics mitigate the same as warriors. Of course, the parse is small enough that it should be taken with a grain of salt, but it definitely doesn't show clerics mitigating the same as warriors with similar levels of mitigation AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
*This post is only tangentially about class balance. It is mainly about what I percieve to be false conclusions about mitigation based on a single parse.</div></div><hr />
