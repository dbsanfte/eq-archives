I go away for a weekend and join a raiding guild, and look what I have waiting for me when I come back!  3 *hours* of summarizing.  Whew.  I could've gotten a couple more AA points, I'll have you know.  It's a good thing I love my job.<br />
<br />
In other news, your friendly editor tanked the Itraer Vius today for the first time.  :-)<br />
<br />
But now, on to the summary of the summary.  People debate how to balance AC and HP.  People speculate on shields and the AC softcap, and Kavhok settles the issue.  People debate the EQ attack algorithm, and Kavhok settles the issue.  People debate CHeal--and Fitemore settles the issue.  Crit DoT aggro sucks, warriors need an AA to make DI work better (but no one quite agrees on how it should work), WA 1 is a great buy and WA5 is not, the effect of ND/PD/PE on hit points is detailed, and the 1500-hp double-crit lifetap is explained.<br />
<br />
In other news, warriors suck at PvP, and if you make a new warrior twink and he doesn't worship Rallos Zek, you're an idiot.<br />

Much debate on AC vs. HP.  Some say AC &gt;&gt;&gt; HP until around 2khp.  Some say 1 AC = 4 HP, 6 HP, or even 10 AC.  Best advice from the thread, in your humble editor's opinion: choose a formula that works for you, and then *stick with it*.  Don't try to eyeball each particular item in isolation.  If you've decided that 1 AC = 4 HP, then that 3/100 Shaderock Amulet really is better than a 15/35 collar, and forget how miserable looking at that pathetic 3 AC makes you feel.  If 1 AC = 10 HP, then the 30 AC Yellowfang Earring is enormously better than some 8/60; specifically, it's more than twice as good.  Again, ignore the fact that it does *nothing* to push you above 7k, or 8k, or 9k, or what have you--if 1 AC = 10 HP, then the Yellowfang is *amazing*.  But, people being what they are, most would choose the 15/35 collar and the 8/60 earring, for a total of 23/95, rather than the 3/100 and 30/0 for a total of 33/100.  Pick a formula and stick to it, and you'll at least avoid that mistake.  You may choose the 3/100 and the 8/60, for a total of 11/160; or the 15/35 and the 30/0, for a total of 45/35.  Depends on whether you believe 1 AC = 4 HP or 1 AC = 10 HP.  But at least you won't make the sub-optimal choice of preferring 23/95 to 33/100.<br />
Some people say that you should get a certain minimum amount of HP (9k seems like a common comfort zone), and then get as much AC as you can while keeping above that minimum HP.  Lets you max CHeal effectiveness with a bit of a buffer for error, and in situations where you would need to mitigate more (like bosses), you'll generally have lots of healing to patch you up and make mitigation-over-time less important.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?p=116262#post116262 AC vs HP<br />
<br />
Much debating back and forth about the effect of shields on the AC softcap.  Fortunately, Kavhoc helps us out with one of his delightfully straightforward comments:<br />
&quot;The cap on AC in the Velious era wasn't a soft cap; it was a hard cap that had been there from day 1. After a certain point, which differed for each class, the benefit of more AC didn't just diminish - it dropped to nothing. <br />
The change I referred to, just before PoP, changed that from a hard cap to a soft cap. You get a percentage of the amount over that soft cap. Shields increase both your total and your soft cap, making them more effective than any other item with equal AC. Your mitigation AAs, level, and class also affect the cap and the percentage return for AC over it. <br />
Separate from this, there are diminishing returns if your AC is much greater than the NPC's attack. This is due to the nature of the formulas that produce the probability distributions that have been well documented on this board.&quot;<br />
My God.  It's full of stars.<br />

An interesting attempt at reverse-engineering SOE's melee attack algorithm from observations.  A number of comments refining it.  A nifty little snippet from Kavhok: &quot;NPCs' innate proc checks occur on every swing. So an NPC can technically proc 4 times on a quad attack. Weapon procs (both player and NPC) only check once per round, as you have above.&quot; And &quot;Yes, NPC innate procs only go off if the NPC does not miss and isn't blocked, dodged, etc. So it would be more accurate to say it checks on every actual hit.&quot;  Kavhok also specifies how the &quot;NPC's have a chance to stun on any attack&quot; works: &quot;NPCs need to be level 5 or higher for the innate chance to stun with melee hits when behind you. That's why orc pawns can't do it.&quot;<br />

Tome of Stone Throw is a silly little discipline for familiarizing newbie melee types with disciplines.<br />
The charm from the tutorial (5 STR/5 STA/5 AGI/5 DEX/10 HP/10 END) is better than most mid-level characters have; it should be made available to existing characters. <br />

Apparently, crit DoTs are so badly broken that one crit on one tick of one dot can pull aggro off a tank with an EB proc stacked on top of Taunted, Incited slow aggro.  Many DoT casters wish they could unspend their crit DoT AA points.<br />

<br />
Maybe warriors should have an AA that makes DI fire more reliably.  Maybe warriors should have an AA that makes DI fire at 20% or 30% health rather than 15%.  Maybe CHeal is broken, and should heal more HP.  Maybe CHeal is broken, and should never have existed.  Maybe lots of warriors talk past each other instead of to each other.<br />
Oh, and maybe Fitemore kicks someone's ass for completely missing the point: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=116468&amp;postcount=16  Go Fitemore!<br />

In approximately 10-hour parses, WA1-5 gave the following increase in procs:<br />
WA1: 7.83% increase / 2 AA = +3.92% per AA<br />
WA2: 14.47% increase from base = 6.64% more / 4 AA = +1.66% per AA<br />
WA3: 26.27% increase from base = 11.8% more / 6 AA = +1.97% per AA<br />
WA4: 40.95% increase from base = 14.68% more / 8 AA = +1.835% per AA<br />
WA5: 52.04% increase from base = 11.09% more / 10 AA = +1.109% per AA<br />
So WA1 is clearly the best buy, and should be purchased immediately. WA2 is adequate, and WA3 and 4 are both solid.  WA5 is expensive and bizarrely unrewarding, and should probably be postponed until late in your AA purchases.<br />

GSot4W is better aggro for short, easy fights because it provides consistent early aggro.  For fights over about a minute, two aggro-proccing one-handers are better.  Easy LDoN works really well using GSot4W.<br />

The following are affected by ND/PD/PE:<br />
1) Base hit points as calculated from your STA (including STA buffs and STA on your equipment)<br />
2) tribute-based HP increases<br />
3) +HP on your equipment<br />
The following are not affected by ND/PD/PE:<br />
1) buffs that directly add HP (Virtue, BSS, the HP part of Focus, etc.)<br />
2) Sturdiness<br />
The multipliers for ND/PD are:<br />
ND level 1: +0.02<br />
ND level 2: +0.03<br />
ND level 3: +0.05<br />
PD levels 1-3: +0.015/level<br />
PE: +0.015, but only if you have at least ND1.<br />
So if you have ND2 and PD1, you'll have a total bonus of .065, or a 6.5% increase in those parts of your HP that are affected by ND/PD.<br />
Formula for total HP is thus:<br />
(base HP + hp from all STA including buffs and equipment + equipment HP + tribute HP) * ND/PD/PE bonus + raw HP buffs.<br />

Merc points out that DKP will put all/all gear into the hands of classes in the following order: BST, ROG/RNG, caster DPS, tanks.  Also points out, though, that this problem is self-limiting; a guild whose MT's can't handle the next level of content due to a shortage of All/All items will just end up farming the current level until the tanks have those items.  In fact, your friendly editor points out, a merit guild with its quick advancement will often move forward long before the current level is farmed out, leaving every class *but* the tanks under-geared.  A DKP guild will progress more slowly, but ensure that everyone gets good gear, and that the farming is efficient (lots of killing at a level already mastered).<br />
Most guilds seem to give 0% to 50% DKP to boxed toons.<br />

Brutul says Finishing Blow works in LDoN easy.<br />
Ronaan seems to imply that your ranged attack can trigger a Finishing Blow as easily as your melee attack, which is quite useful if I have interpreted it correctly.<br />
Finishing Blow kills the Statue of Rallos Zek, about half of LDoN easy mobs, is useless against undead, is great against Mastruq (which mitigate melee damage when running).<br />

Michil reports that putting AA points into +hp AA's is not as useful as putting them into avoidance/mitigation AA's.  Your friendly editor, with CA3/CS2/PE, and ND1 just because PE then boosts HP as well and it's only two AA, heartily concurs, and is surprised so many people go for the +HP AA's rather than the &quot;take 20% less damage&quot; AA's.<br />

Do Tactical Mastery and Strikethrough affect %chance to hit?  They don't affect your &quot;to hit&quot; percentage, but they do affect (a little bit) how often your hits land.  Since Tactical Mastery and Strikethrough don't stop the mob's riposte damage, just hit them through it, these aren't so great for warriors.<br />
Your friendly editor wishes to note that while tanking mobs in Akheva today, he kept attack on when a trash mob enraged (it was only doing perhaps 180/hit average) with TM 2.  Over the course of about four seconds, say 7 hits, two of them went through.  Actual parsing is required, but it's clearly not a ridiculously low percentage.<br />
