<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Taelosian Geomancy Stone Jelki to turn in and I went to Allah to read up on the quest. My concern is when I hail Reyfin, as Allah says, I do not get any of the quest text reply from Reyfin. He is totally oblivious to me.<br />
<br />
I recognize I don't have to hail the mob to do a turn in, but my worry is that if I can't get a hail reply that my turn in will not be recognized, and I would lose my stone. I don't want to be in that situation where I petition and wait 2 years finally to be told there is nothing the GM can do.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had this same experience of not getting any text message when hailed? Is it safe to just give the stone to the quest mob for those who have experience in this turn in?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I eventually was able to contact another player in a higher tier guild who confirmed personally that the quest turn in works without the text.<br />
<br />
Whether this loss of quest text occurs for every class I do not know.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
