<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is my first post here.  Sorry if this is 'that question' that everyone is sick of hearing over and over again, but I didn't see any threads on this issue.<br />
<br />
I have just started an ogre warrior on the new Stromm server after getting fed up with playing other toons on Luclin server.  I know that this is the warrior site from a guildie, so I came here for help.<br />
<br />
Fllea is only level 6 as of last night, but I noticed that I can only use either kick or bash at one time.  My question is which situations should I use each in, benefits/drawbacks of each, and any other info I should know.<br />
<br />
My gut feeling is to use kick in most cases and reserve bash for fighting casters.  That is, of course, after maxing each skill per level.  But, I don't know what other factors come in to play with each.  Do either of them use up an attack or anything weird like that?<br />
<br />
Just the basic detailed low down I guess is what I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
And if this has been answered a hundred times already a link or even just some general 'go here, click this' information would be swell.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get both if possible well worth it. kick has advantages and bash has stun at low levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kick stuns post level 55, slam stuns at any level. I have always played large race warriors and don't use kick, it does nothing that slam doesn't. Slam also caps higher in skill at high levels, and for those first 54 levels you can disrupt casters with a well timed slam while they can not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Slam has been my focus and it's worked out well.  My advice is to max slam each level, then work on kick against non-caster mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Use slam mainly and when you get to the 40ths and someone casts werewolf on you be glad you also have trained up kick since those can't slam :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Keep up both. Remember that slam caps out higher than kick, so whilst in the early days you will see more return with kick, slam tends to work out better later on. however as someone pointed out, when your in boon or any other form, slam wont work so you have to resort back to kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't timed it, but it's my impression that the refresh is faster on kick than on bash.  If that's right, more kicks = more chances to stun, post 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azlana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeps do bof.  As barb m'can slam buh when m'uses mes DE mask only can use kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Slam Stuns/Interrupts casting much much much more often than kick does and it caps higher, so in my experience... I would say focus on slam and only work on kick if you have &quot;spare time.&quot; Ideally get both capped... btu if you must choose... cap Slam/Bash first.<br />
<br />
Slam will hit harder, has a higher cap, and interrrupts from lev 1.... so the only reason yuou might ever want kick is if yer in an illusion form (Nightdark terror, werewolf, imp, whatever).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cool, thanks for the replies.  I was always planning on keeping both capped as much as possible.  It sounds like bash should be my number 1 priority though, so I'll max that one first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skullreaper Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also good for stunning mobs when they turn to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Refresh time on slam and kick is the same.  Also, I get alot more stuns from slam than I do from kick, especially from fleeing mobs.  Overall, slam is better IMHO, but as was mentioned previously, keep both skilled up for when you're under the effects of illusions, 'cause slam wont work then.  <br />
