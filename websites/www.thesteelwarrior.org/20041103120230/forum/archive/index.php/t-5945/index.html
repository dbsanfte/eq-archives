<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>One_Wise_Gnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I’m currently in India right now and have been for the last 6 months being gone this long kind of reminded me how much I loved to play eq and adventurer. Well I will be returning at the end of march and want to start up eq again I use to play a SK and shaman duel box to 59 but I want to start all over most of my old friend don’t play any more any way.<br />
<br />
I’m probably going to play on the Stormm server since I think it is the newest one out and most likely going to trip box a warrior, cleric and enchanter all gnome.<br />
<br />
I was never much into ldon usually just kept in pop and leveled up but can I out fit all three of us in ldon pretty easily and save plat for spells for the cleric and enchanter and weapons or higher ac armor for the warrior pretty easily ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any of the advice<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you can do just fine gearing and leveling up in LDoN.  At lower levels with some twinkage you can probably beat missions with just your 3 toons as well.  A friend of mine has beaten LDoNs at 25 3-boxing testbuffs with no problem.</div></div><hr />
