One question though.  Now that they have added a augment birdbath to the guild halls, can't they take it the next step and have the little merchant guy in your guild hall sell distillers as well as the solvents?  I can't see what it adds to game play to make you run to BB to buy your distillers when the aug birdbath is in your guild hall.  Also, the proximity to a banker in guild hall would make this so much nicer.</div></div><hr />

I do agree...seems pointless to have a bird bath without the distillers.</div></div><hr />

The bridbath is only useful if you have the solvents/distillers.  The distillers are no-drop and can only be bought in BB. The distiller merchant is 3ft. from a birdbath. What is the use of running back to your guild hall to make your changes when you are already at a birdbath?   <br />

Its like having the guildhall portal, but the stones to activate it are only available in S.Ro.  I just don't think this is an example where added inconvenience is adding to gameplay. Seriously, can we forward this to someone who can see about getting it fixed :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would love if they moved the guild tribute master into the guild hall.  Would make managing junk in guild bank easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, they have two augment bathes in the Guild Hall. WTF is up with that? Guild hall was a great idea but it's a damn huge waste of space. Friggen copy and pasted pictures on each side of the 18 bulleton boards... 2 corspe summoning areas with 10 corpse summoners, and 2 summoning regent merchants.. what a waste.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC, that is the original solvent, where it would remove the augments from the item and destory the augment itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jearom</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it is only the solvent not the distillers.  A couple people included solvents in their requests.</div></div><hr />
