<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merc</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DPS really is the only function.  If what is said about aggro generation is true, in that the 'swing' generates the aggro not the landed blow or damage, then I'd have to say it's a purely DPS AA.<br />
<br />
But, in a close battle a few extra DPS could save your life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any idea on how much DPS? 1, 2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">added 7 dmg to my offhand hits.<br />
no parses done so far, and i doubt i have &quot;before&quot;-data to compare anything useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is agro relative to how much damage you could have done, not including crits, so a 10/40 weapon won't generate as much agro as a 30/40 weapon.  This is generally referred to as DPS agro.<br />
<br />
Whether the Sinister Strikes bonus is considered for agro generation or not is unknown, but my guess is that it would give a tiny bit of additional agro.<br />
<br />
Remember, we aren't the only class that gets Sinister Strikes and the rogues would hate it if it gave a lot more agro.<br />
<br />
Hmm, now that I think about it, you should probably check with the rogues since that's probably the first GoD AA they bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To figure out your dps from SS, just take your hits per second times the damage bonus (delay / 3.5).  It'll usually work out to around 4-6 dps depending if you have ambidexterity, worn haste, and spell haste.  No noticeable extra aggro after getting SS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds promising, haven't gotten it yet though, too sick to log in. As far as aggro is concerned, I wasn't really interested in that possible aspect, considering where I am at in the game, there are no more other AA's available to me that will help with aggro.</div></div><hr />
