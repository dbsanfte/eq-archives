<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did the following test today. <br />
<br />
Mikar 238 cha, Elez 40 cha. <br />
Buffed Elez with DP (the cheaper version of DI) 50 times. <br />
21 heals - 29 failures. <br />
<br />
Mikar 1 cha, Elez 263 cha. <br />
Again, DP 50 times <br />
49 heals - 1 failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very cool information here... I guess the tank's CHA plays a much bigger role than the cleric's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm.. that is strange. Completely contradictory to the current theory of Cleric CHA vs Warrior CHA. Definitely bad news for Trolls and Ogres..lol. Would be nice to see some more testing. I posted on my War guild forum. Just have to see if anyone is up for a few deaths. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tank every mob with Solons, the massive Bard Charisma buff.<br />
<br />
Buffs me to 305 cha, fyi. DI very rarely fails, the only time I have it not work, is when a mob beats my ass so badly I don't fall into the &quot;Di trigger area,&quot; which is anywhere below 15%, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always have bard and buffed cha, easily get over 250 and I only die when DI fades or after DI is used already.<br />
<br />
What ainian describes, the mobs just killing you so fast, that you get the &quot;saved by DI&quot; and then the &quot;you died&quot; is a bug, I think, it happens sometimes and sux</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I saw that bug firsthand in PoE last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea, there's that bug also, but what I was talking about is this:<br />
<br />
If a mob deals say, 8k damage in one round of attacks, and you are at 50% health, there isn't a chance for DI to trigger off, since it only triggers when you land at less than 15% health after a completed attack round. Not when you actually &quot;die.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nice test, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt;3 bards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hydramada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I almost always tank with a bard in group.  It has become standard practice for our warriors to have 305CHA on major targets.  Appears to increase our life expectancy a wee bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My MT group : <br />
Me + Bard + Druid + 3 clerics with UD3 (from the CH line)<br />
<br />
2nd MT group (for when the fight allows MT changes):<br />
Bard + some wars +  a healer.<br />
<br />
305/305  UD3 DI  own</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Btw ... small question about DI<br />
<br />
We have all seen the  &quot;XXX has been saved by DI&quot;  &quot;XXX dead&quot;<br />
I got the feeling partially due to a bug.<br />
<br />
But how do you actually know when DI worked well ?<br />
1) Full heal (thats easy, you dont die the icon poofs)<br />
2) Partial heal (tricky part)<br />
3) Fail (thats easy, you die, the icon poofs)<br />
<br />
I remember a thread with Full/Partial/Fail parses on EQclerics.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to actually separate Partial from Bugged ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">DI has no such thing as a partial heal, or a full heal, or whatever you're talking about.<br />
<br />
It's a full restoration (Complete heal Cap does NOT apply to DI) of your HP, when you fall under 15% life, not including when a mob &quot;one rounds&quot; you from above 15% to 0% (death)<br />
<br />
Hard to explain, but it restores ALL your HP  whenever you land between 1hp-15% of your HP.<br />
<br />
When it fails, you get the text &quot;You are no longer watched.&quot; Keep in mind, it can fail and you still survive if another heal lands before you drop to 0% (death)<br />
<br />
<br />
A bugged DI, on the other hand, triggers the &quot;Ainian has been rexscued by Divine Intervention!&quot; text, and if you recieve damage immediately after the save, you die. It's like, the heal lags, or something. Remember when you would recieve a heal, and still die back in Velious/Early Luclin? It works exactly like that. Play with ALL spells on, and it doesn't bug out. For me, anyhow.<br />
<br />
Bugged DI looks something like this:<br />
<br />
A fire beetle hits YOU for 1188 points of damage.<br />
Ainian goes into a berserker frenzy!<br />
Ainian has been rescued by Divine Intervention!<br />
A fire beetle hits YOU for 1744 points of damage.<br />
You die.<br />
You die.<br />
You die.</div></div><hr />

Funny enough, Mikar and Aditu are from my guild (Well, Mikar is on vazaelle now) and it was his results I posted in the first post in this thread p</div></div><hr />
