<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is the situation, <br />
<br />
I have a GSoT that is augmented with angerII.  I don;t have too many aggro issues with it.<br />
<br />
I also have a CHoS, and Sword of the Bloodsworn both unaugmented.  I also won a ornate stone battle hammer 13dmg 19dly (+10sta +8agil +7 resists +75hp efect mirror III).  I also have a shadowheart (11dmg/17dly), and longsword of freedom (20dmg/29dly) in my bag.<br />
<br />
I have enough points to augment another weapon with anger II.<br />
<br />
Which weapons choice will bring me the most aggro???<br />
<br />
Should i stick with the 2hb, or will a 1hs combo bring me more aggro??<br />
<br />
FYI I am lvl65 and have 0 offensive aa's working on my defensive ones, I use a windblade for DPS.  I am not currently in a raiding guild so I do not expect to get any upgrades to my weapons unless it's from a hard LDoN, points or bazzar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">since you have an  agro wepon auged gsot, you could grab some dps procs, or save up for anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have little to no agro problems at the moment I would not worry about another augmented weapon and spend the points somewhere else.<br />
<br />
I would think about getting anger 3 and at the same time look for obtaining weapons that gives better agro then the CHoS or SotB and putting anger 3 on that, but thats if you really need it.  CHSD is a fairly easy item to get and does give a decent agro when added with anger 3.  I've had 65 mages dump their full mana bar and not have them draw agro off me when I get lucky with a few procs.<br />
<br />
Personally unless you are the MT of your guild or your normal exp group is having trouble keeping agro on you, I would work on getting armor or the 8% dodge aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the responses thus far, but one question still is bugging me, <br />
<br />
what kind of weapon combo would i need to get (for 1hs) that would create more aggro than a GSoT augmented with angerII ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something with TB or EB procs or something to that equivelent probably.<br />
<br />
Anger2=400pt hate.  <br />
tb = 450<br />
eb = 700</div></div><hr />
