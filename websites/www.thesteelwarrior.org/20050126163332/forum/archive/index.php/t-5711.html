<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santhar</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for opinons on the hate/agro abilities produced by these cheap weapons:<br />
<br />
Preator's Blade of Debility (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7383) (Is one proc or more suficent? If it requires more then 1 proc, does it proc often enough to be effective?)<br />
<br />
Barnacle Covered Axe (http://http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19649)  (Effect lists this as +100 hate. Would this be effective at lvl 56?)<br />
<br />
And there was one other that completely escapes me at the moment. It'll come to me....&lt;begins to think real hard as his face turns blue&gt;....Drat, I'll edit if I can remember the third.<br />
<br />
I'm asking this because I use Black Blade of Tormenting (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4500) as my main agro grabber. The dd + dot proc is really nice at holding agro, if I have the right buffs +  haste and get lucky on the procs.  Granted, I haven't used it in awhile because Taunt has been kind to me with a lot of success rates lately (stealth nerf? :D ) even in groups that I think are gonna be agro nightmares.<br />
<br />
I have a GSoT, but I'm looking for a replacement 1hander for the Black Blade. It's just starting to loose it's edge in effectiveness.</div></div><hr />

it'll out-do the weapons you got now; easily; and last to 65.<br />
BTW how much spare coin you have available anyhow? for about 20Kpp or so you can get the sword of the bloodsworn/copper hammer of striking setup which most warriors get and use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santhar</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have about 0k to spend, but frostbringer sounds like the way to go. Don't know why I never thought of it, probably because I never think I'm gonna afford/see them =). Sword of the Bloodsworn will be my next upgrade, don't really like the knockback of copper hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or for nothing you can get some friends together and camp them.  The guy that drops the sword is lvl 61, and is a big pansy.  Not sure how tough the hammer camp is, mine was a gift.   Also, xps are really nice in droga.  And the knockback on the hammer is really inconsequential.  If anything, it helps to a small degree to counteract the push of the melees that are behind the mob.  And sometimes it isnt nearly enough if there are alot of pets behind said mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirle1</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Camping them is a the best suggestion, also might see if you can find the cultural yak's for sale, on zeb they run about the same as a frostbringer, so you could check on you're server for that.  I havn't been to droga since just after it was changed but i remember tons of coin dropping there as well, hopefully they didn't go back and change that.</div></div><hr />

Btw, if your guild can kill Xanomech in PoI get your hands on a CHSD</div></div><hr />

Just so you know GSoT = UGLY yes, but works just like a leash on 99% of all the mobs I have ever tanked.<br />
As it is now was seriously thinking of selling off my two 1hr's and upgrading some armor spots.</div></div><hr />

Ahem...Planar Strike has knockback of 1, same as Force Shock.<br />
<br />

<br />
  I dont think its the hate from each proc as much as the number of procs.  With 2 1handers I get 6 procs a min, that gives me a 50% greater odds of an early proc. over a 2h.   Its very seldom that the first proc with Incite wont grab aggro from anyone and the sooner that proc comes the better.</div></div><hr />

oh, and for a good laugh santhar; i used the praetor blade and a BBoT for most of my MT work up to level 60 on just about everything up to clearing ToVN :D  <br />
<br />
Ok, I will defiantly get the praetor just to try it with the BBoT.<br />
<br />
Its pretty hard to beat GSoT for holding aggro until u get some true hate weapons (either EB/Anger proccing). If you have the GSoT I wouldn't recommend buying anything else truth be told unless your preference is using 1hr's. I used to find one or two GSoT procs would lock the mob on me...combined with yer new hate dots you could probably use in all the tier three zones. <br />
<br />
I don't have a real perferance for weapons, cept maybe Bloodguard Wand of Walking Dead in offhand. Best off hand weapon I got.  I'm almost always swapping weapons til I feel like I like I'm doing my job of holding agro.<br />
<br />
I don't have any really good DPS weapons, so I just kinda &quot;go with the flow&quot; of the group I'm in.  For instance, not to long ago, I did two adventures with a high dps group (2 rogues in first adventure and switch oned for a monk in second). My DPS couldn't hold a candle to theirs and i felt I could maximize their DPS by keeping agro on me with the mob's back to the DPS'ers so I whipped out the BBoT. (Actually I hate when when people label me as a DPS. I knew I was a damage soaker since day one of my warrior, second week after the Nameless opened up. Yalp parses me as 28 dps, but I think that's just Yalp. my dps is probably just a tab higher).</div></div><hr />
