<br />
I just went from Baron to Veteran the other day. Veteran is nice, I suppose. I like it better than Marshal. Good thing for me that I've placed higher priority on the tanking AA's (and won't be accumulating 24 in class for a very long time).<br />
<br />
Has anybody heard any rumors about the custom titles we're going to be offered in OoW? I've always wondered why we couldn't have Warrior or Overlord for titles ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am just getting confused now with 16 classes x 4 titles (+ more coming--even if they are the non-aa titles). <br />
<br />
Baron is a silly title--or more suited to Knights with their Sir and Duke titles. <br />
<br />
Vereran is not bad. Marshall--a representative of the all--while workse RPly for me as a Tribuneral follower is bad for almost anyone else. <br />
<br />
Then try working your whole title--Kailyn being a barb-- is a wolf of the north. So with AA and level title, she is Veteran Overlord (Wolf) of the North. I hope they only give one new class title at 70 (and extend overlord to 69).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Marshal &gt; Elder. My main is a Druid and I don't think it's fair we have to share titles with Shamans and Beastlords. If they do make new titles I hope they are better then the ones now and every class has their own. That's all I really have issues with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since we're on the subject of titles, how do people get these crazy titles I've been seeing around, one guy on Vazaelle is Vansob Defender of the Forest or something like that.  Are these awarded from GM events (that's what I heard) or did he pay for it or is he buddy-buddy with a GM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm pretty sure they're GM rewarded during events, Nazgrub.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's an SK on Stromm by the name of Faydra Defender of the Ages. I saw another Defender of the XXX character on Stromm but I forgot what the XXX was. He was a caster type though.<br />
<br />
She confirmed it was a GM event  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Defender of the Ages and Keeper of the Ages titles were awarded in a recent PvP event, Defender went to the winner of the Melee event and Keeper for casters.<br />
<br />
I was never a big fan of Marshall as a title though Veteran was pretty cool, but theres a bit of status that goes with it too which is pretty cool (and more so for warriors because most of us are sensible enough to get tanking AA's 1st so if you see a warrior with Marshall Title it suggests they have &gt;120 AAs rather than just &gt; the 42 needed to get the title).  Since I got the title I wouldnt trade backwards.<br />
<br />
We didn't do too bad though, Chanters for example have Sage as thier 3rd title which is the same as a Necro's 2nd title... ripped off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dununder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never did like Baron/Baroness, but I suppose SOE had to come up with a generic title for that AA level. All in all not horribly out of place. Veteran and Marshall I always thought were pretty appropriate actually. Veteran in my reckoning being someone whos been around at least a bit. Someone whos &quot;seen the elephant&quot; so to speak. Marshall has always been a leader I suppose, a superior Warrior whos lead others into battle and survived to old age. General may have been a title we all could have related to though. Its certainly better than Duke anyhow  :D <br />
<br />
Dununder Thunderchunder<br />
Overlord of Papago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IIRC, the new titles that were hinted at for OoW were supposed to be 'general' titles that anyone could get, not necessarily class specific.<br />
<br />
Custom PC Titles:<br />
Players will be able to select titles for their characters based on various accomplishments. These titles will be available across all levels<br />
<br />
Of course, they may add class spcific ones but who knows. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i hate marshall because it's frenchish! field marshalls are the top dogs or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Warrior best of the best title was cool...&quot;the Champion&quot;. <br />
<br />
I wish they did another round of best of the best.</div></div><hr />
