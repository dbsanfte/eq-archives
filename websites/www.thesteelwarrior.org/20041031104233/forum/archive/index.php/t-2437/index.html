<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone has any ideas what the future holds for theese 2 new and wonderful weapons.<br />
<br />
Some say that sony will nerf the drop rate, others that they will become NO DROP, others that they lower the stats on them.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any clue?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hopefully they leave them the way they are. Prices will keep dropping, and finally the non uber warriors from 50-65 will ahve a decent combination of agro weapons. Warriors in that level range seem to have it hard, and an affordable dual wield combo that can hold agro can only help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As one of the dolts who bought these the second they hit the market (at 40k each no less: I thought I'd scored an uber deal, only to learn later how pathetically easy they are to get and watched prices plumet to the 8-20k range), I'd love to see a drop rate nerf (would love to see drop rate on GSoT and similar BoT loot too, but I don't have the ear of any developers, so I'm not holding my breath). I already see too many people running around with these items: these are fantastic weapons that, quite frankly, shouldn't be common drops in a 1 group encounter.<br />
<br />
But maybe I'm just bitter that when I upgrade I have no hope of selling these for as much as I paid lol :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">please referr to the copper hammer as &quot;CHAOS&quot; from now on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't have a problem with these weapons being dirt cheap, what I have a rpoblem with is them being superior in DPS, and in aggro to all but 2 tradable weapons.<br />
<br />
That means that everything which is ridiculously difficult to get (Fleshgrinder anyone?) in relation to these has now become worthless.  I don't have a problem with the weapons, but the way they implemented them ruined the economy, and i'm sad to see they didn't get a drop rate nerf this patch.<br />
<br />
So basically since PoP opened, thanks to the Windblade, Greatstaff of Thunder, Copper hammer and Bloodsworn sword, all weapons are completely worthless and the economy is screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well i like it, the problem with itemzation is all the good stuff costs to damn much for my warrior to buy, so i have to go make a cash farming alt, buy gear for it, raise it to the same level, and then finally get something. i LOVE them for doing this, it fixed my agro problem, it fixed my money problem, im sorry to those that are bitter for paying to much but hey, ya fugged up EQ isnt comunism so dont whine when things get turned on their ear like the american market, the 30k alone i saved on agro weapons can be used to save up for the 120k+ ornate armor parts (some of them are that high)<br />
<br />
or saving for that CoF that some cleric won on a raid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The fact of the matter is though, these are both top 5 droppable agro weaps and virtually anyone can get their hands on them either by the mind-bogglingly easy encounter, or by saving up a ***very*** small amount of plat. Hell, I'd at least love to see these flagged as ND- even if it burned me. I just think that great weapons like this should not be so easy to acquire.<br />
<br />
Haass makes an excellent point about the economy. When weaps like this are so cheap, it makes other items (SBoZ, Fleshgrinder, HoH etc....) plummet in value.<br />
<br />
I've played the bazaar market to my advantage and I can live with getting burned once in a while, but do think this particular instance has gone a little too far in it's market implications. Not to mention there are too many clones running around with the same droppable equipment already :P This just homogenizes us more :-/</div></div><hr />

I value class balance higher than economy though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You may think this is class balance, but it's not.  It's yet another crutch.  It's exactly the same as EB weapons.<br />
<br />
Tying warriors to specific weapons does not balance them.  We're still absolute slaves to procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes but with my barnacle axe and kunzar kujuch I was a slave to LFG till I got CHAOS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think the nature of MMORPG's is such that the economy is never going to be stable, it is just something to deal with.  On the other hand, as theseweapons are so in demand at the moment, try and get the camp to farm them.  I have managed to get it once(and no drops).  I am stcuk in the boat that if I want to try and get them to replace my GSoT(and see for myself how agro compares), I either have to shell out 35 to 40 K to get both, or live in Droga an extended period of time and wait for the camp to open.</div></div><hr />
