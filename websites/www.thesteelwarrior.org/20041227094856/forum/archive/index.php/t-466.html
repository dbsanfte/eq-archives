<br />
I'm looking to take this mob down for epic blade and I'm looking for some info/tactics on her?<br />
<br />
Can anyone let me know if she is slowable/stunnable. Can her guards be singled out before you engage her? I have heard she doesnt have an AE, rather its a conical proc in front of her, so keeping everyone behind her except MT should help?<br />
<br />
What is her special abilities?<br />
<br />
As a guild we've taken down Vindi/Trak/Gore/Isle7 PoA, and are currently farming HoT for guild upgrades.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What were your levels? What level was the cleric to pacify?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Single group was prob mid 60s+.<br />
<br />
I was always under the impression that she had a hellacious frontal AE (as opposed to a proc), so as long as you keep her away from your help, they should be able to take her out fast.<br />
<br />
Times we have killed have been in King room or in the hall to it. Used to use monks splitting to get her guards and/or her. She's low HP (18K?) so a manaburn wizzie can greatly speed things along...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can pull her alone your gonna own her.<br />
<br />
I dont really know how to do it, maybe ench/cleric pacify series.<br />
<br />
Get 2 groups (1 would be hard for 60s)<br />
Have clerics load group CH / Group Heal / Group Elixir<br />
<br />
Pull her, clerics chain cast group heal.<br />
Burn her down.<br />
<br />
Ps : I remember her having a pure AE (aka not frontal or anything)<br />
Bard, like 1k-2k every 10 seconds or something as insane as that.<br />
<br />
Fight has to be SHORT (60-120 sec max).<br />
<br />
Ideal setup for 12 lv60's would be :<br />
2 cleric, 2 paladins, 1 ench, 1 sham, 1 war, + DPS (anything that can hit hard &amp; fast)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">everyone was 65 except chanter was like 60 or 62 I dunno.  lvl 65 cleric pacification spell works (think its same as lvl 62 chanter spell) on her, it was late, I think we pulled her room 1st then pulled her now that I think of it.  Key to fight is to keep have the paladin keep agro &amp; everyone else stay outta ae range &amp; nuke her - the damage from the ae is pretty high...but when only 1 person is getting hit it isnt bad at all.<br />
<br />
as always, secret to fun chardok raids = non kos rogue &amp; have a cleric camped at top of stairs in safe hall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way to pull her solo (havent tried this lately, if its been changed please say so), clear the king room first. Have someone pull her, if the whole room comes, no biggie. Let the person run past king room and up the ramp a ways and fd, die, whatever. Someone ally to chardok faction runs out and hails the queen and starts talking to her. Keep her hailed and jabbering while the rest of her flunkies path back to the room. When shes solo, bring her in and kill her.<br />
<br />
Her ae is a point blank fire ae (with -100 resist adjust) that does around 850pts of damage per tick. I cant recall how hard she hits, but suffice to say if you've been exping in PoP, her melee dps is going to be trivial. Get her solo and crank out some fast damage and she's toast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the times i went down to do Queenie i've always /disc fellstriked :D ..<br />
<br />
How I remember it for how we killed her was<br />
1. Clear to Hallway outside Prince. Pull his cronies; kill; than kill Prince. grats enchanter in need..<br />
2. progress to library..get pwned in library; res fallen; than regroup ( always can get dicey in library, it's loads of excitement )<br />
3. move to hallway past queen/king trap ( follow raid leader Precisely; have monk or non KOS person drag the fools who still fall through the trap )..buff and have monks/SK's pull king room.<br />
4. when they are dead, pull king ( if not already )...gank him hard and grats someone on incarnadine BP.<br />
5. move raid force to King room.<br />
6. pul queens cronies; kill thusly.<br />
7. Here; it's your raid leaders call. Either pull queen to king room ( safer in case of goof-up )...or if y'all feeling ballsy everyone bum_rush her with full offensive discs; nuke hard..she's dead in 12 seconds :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jezzibell</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last raid I went on in Chardok our chanters kept the Queen and her guards stunned the entire fight, just treated it like they were AoE'n. <br />
<br />
<br />
She got off an initial AoE of her own, but after that she brought nothing to the table.  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahomn</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we went down like shikarii stated..but pulled King room single to the room above him.. killed him by the fireplace. After we recleared king room (to avoid repops while doing Queen) had wizard eye target queen, everyone assisted, Paladin with DA on charged the room to eat the first AE, then everyone followed and AE Stun, AE blast, melee's /offensive disc, dead before 3rd AE. about 20-24 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have single pulled the Queen to King room before, with a Lvl 60 Chanter using Lull on all the guards.<br />
<br />
Big thing about Queen is she only has 18K HP. So have everyone go all out offensive. The first time we managed to get her, after wiping a few times trying, we did it by rushing her room, letting the chanters do their thing on the guards, and everyone else attack with all they had, that included the clerics blasting with their best nukes instead of waiting and healing folks.<br />
<br />
One thing that can be real helpful for Chardok is a Non KOS mage with CoH. We saved wiping one time because when queen died, we were down to 3 melee and an enchanter left alive. But I had my non KOS Shaman there grouped with the mage, gated back up, zoned in and invited the three naked clerics that were bound at zone, They got CoH'd down just in time to keep us alive and start clicking the rest as we dealt with the 5 adds and hall respawn. Chardok Royals themselves are easy, whats hard is dealing with all the guards and the fast respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you pull her into King room or anywhere else, watch out for two things.  One time, we pulled into King room.  Had her beat down pretty good even when the rest of her room mysteriously added from the single pull.  When she got low on health and we lost quite a few people from the AE and adds, she gates and starts chain summoning people.  Between that and the adds, we wiped.<br />
<br />
Another time we had her very low on health and she took off like a rocket out of the king room and up the ramp.  She finally died with just her feet sticking through the locked door to the library.  Running past the other mobs in the hall and side room of course aggro'd them and the library so we wiped.  We had an ally mage still in the king/queen area and two of us warriors managed to make it back to Chardok before her corpse timer ran out.  The first warrior who had been promised the blade got there with around 1:30 or so left on timer and got Coth'd in.  He couldn't loot fast enough and died so I got Coth'd in and managed to loot right as I died.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have apally tank.<br />
Have the pally run in fully buffed and with DA up t take AE make him put his back to wall then have everyone zerg and take him down have everyone except clerics Nuke if it get another AE off have all healers Beastlords  Pallys and Rangers also heal everyone up ASAP although she only has about 10k HP the AE is nasty with enough DPS you can kill her before 2nd AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE your way down its a blast.   We always pulled the king to lib and kill there AE style and then jumped down into the king room, forget the ramp.    Have everyone med and wait for the respawn.<br />
<br />
   When we were ready I (note I as in warrior) ran into Queen room and jumped up on platfrom behind her so her back was to the room.  Everyone else came in and joined the fun, its was an awesome AE party.   Last time we did this had 3 deaths cause a palie had to stun and turn the queen and 3 casters died before I got her back.   If you have any resiste at all she is a piece of cake, the worst she ever landed on me was about 650 or so, did not even need a heal during the fight.   Just keep eveyone behind her and its easy.<br />
<br />
Rodney<br />
Overlord CT<br />
<br />
ps I dont think she is stunable, the first time we wiped cause I could not get a target lock and the chanters were taken out FAST.  We now have a wiz send in an eye of zoom and then I assist him to pick up target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SamirDaStinky</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have your raid force go full offensive against her. Everyone, including warriors, offensive disc on her and everyone else full nukes on her etc.  She should die in like...5 seconds np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres another totally safe way to do it.  Single pull the queen (many techniques listed, we use ally faction hail parker) and have your top 2 hp tanks engage.  A CH caster assigned to each.  Just let the tanks beat her down for a while.  Get SNARE in then zerg at 60.  She runs at SOW speed and if you're not lucky with 3 or 4 nukes landing at once she will get away and be through the library before you know it.<br />
<br />
This is fast, foolproof, and you can do her with very small numbers.   The her running without snare is really the only way to wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shonshu</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that if you setup the raid so it can support ae it works out extremely well.<br />
<br />
Thus you want 2 enchanters to do stunning, with everyone else either ae'ing or dps'ing.<br />
<br />
This works for Prince, King and Queen.<br />
<br />
On the queen, I would suggest having a paladin run in with DA and agro the room to the rightside corner. Everyone else runs in and starts pounding on Queen while the chanters are doing their stuns.<br />
<br />
Don't have to worry about the Queen gating at low life.<br />
<br />
Doing this will get you out of there in under 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam3</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just find someone who is ally and then monk pull the entire room, FD in the stairs out of the room (or die if FD miss :b ) and let the ally one chain hail her. I did it for me , i ve a 55 SK ally and it worked well. When he is alone, tell mt to bring her in King room and you will own her (the time i camp and relog my war she was already dead lol :b )</div></div><hr />
