I've seen the parses of VDD DPS, don't know what BoW is like but I assume its slightly under VDD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
VDD has better stats, but BoW is more than sufficient.<br />
 <br />
I'd say grab the 1st one you can, A3 it, then go looking for armor.<br />
I'm still using the same BoW i got 2 years ago, and its doing just fine.</div></div><hr />

If you're in time you should be able to get a DB soon enough and A3ing a huge dps weapon like VDD will basically mean that you have to have it bagged 95% of the time unless you MA 100% of the time for your guild.  I know that with all offensive aa and WA3 I pull aggro ocassionally with my VDD and I choose to bag it for the first 40ish % of time boss fights.  I actually haven't finished WA because I don't want the additional procs atm.</div></div><hr />

If you have neither at the moment, I'd go with whatever dropped first (depending on your current weapon setup and your guild loot distribution system) but you should start seeing darkblades drop shortly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">start darkblades drop shortly<br />
<br />
This sooo fucking pisses me off !  2 Darkblades in 6 months...<br />
With RZ killed on every pop.<br />
<br />
Was it Valon that never saw a JTB ?<br />
And Ascending Dawn that saw 10+ DBlades ?<br />
<br />
Do not &quot;plan&quot; you will get a DBlade. Its by no means a regular drop.</div></div><hr />
