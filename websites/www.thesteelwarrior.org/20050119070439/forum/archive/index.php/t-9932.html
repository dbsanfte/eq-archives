<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xiphos</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Half-Life 2<br />
Halo 2<br />
World of Warcraft<br />
Everquest 2<br />
<br />
These four games are becomming the bane of my existance.<br />
<br />
In recent weeks with the release of so many long awaited titles the playerbase on my server (Bertoxxulous) has dropped considerably. Way back when I started playing (1999) I can remember not being able to find groups in Blackburrow because it was overcamped. Snakes taken. Commander taken...Those were the days.<br />
<br />
Now, I can't find a group because noone's there. Up untill a few weeks ago, there were an average of 70 people in Walls of Slaughter at 12:00am EST. Now, by 11:00pm there are about 2 groups with noone /lfg, making it hard to form another. <br />
<br />
I am currently a student and work a (very crappy) part time job, so I'm not able to play before 9:00pm est normally. By the time I get home, eat something, and log in everyone is gone or worse...noone was ever on. <br />
<br />
Some of the upper level guilds have drastically dropped their recruitment standards because of a serious decline in regular players able and willing to raid. It's getting extreamly hard to find groups. It's getting hopeless....<br />
<br />
So my question is this:<br />
Do you guys think the player base will pick up after some of the hype from the recent releases has died down, or do you suggest me finding another home? I have several friends who are in the same boat I am (guild) and I was wondering if there is a server out there that still seems to have a large playerbase so I can get back to the grind and quit wasting time warming a small patch of dirt in WoS while I wait for a cleric to go LFG or for a group to snag me.<br />
<br />
I would be somewhat sad to see Bertoxxulous go for the simple fact that I've been there so long. I know, as servers go, it's far from the top of the list, but it's still my server.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to drop it like a live grenade if there's something better out there. There has been some talk recently on the server (nothing official, mind you) of a proposed merger. If this were to happen, it could potentially help with the playerbase problem but I'm not sure I want to wait around. I want to get back into the game and stop waisting my $13/mo.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

UO is a good indication 10 years &amp; still alive.<br />
<br />
Some people will come back from EQ2/WoW , some will leave.<br />
Overall you can expect a significant drop in EQ population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should see Test hehe.  /w all counts on each class showed only 70is non-anon people across all levels on test Saturday, and 36 of those were in my guild.  /w all 70 showed only 2 people who weren't on our raid. <br />
<br />
We are still raiding now, and getting 45ish people on average, but the other raiding org is pretty much not raiding at all, and I don't know where we are going to recruit from, because it's almost impossible to find a pickup group so people are not going to be leveling on Test unless some people move there.  On the other hand, those of us that can get groups have the run of the server hehe.  Kinda nice to know you can go to any camp in the game with a 99% chance that you will have the whole zone to yourself.<br />
<br />
Personally I am having a blast, but I don't know about the future of raiding on test.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
b the time I hit 46 I can at least hit the planes for some action...that is; if there is anyone willing to go to PoJ/PoI which would be the equivelant to a root canal with a plasma cutter  :eek:</div></div><hr />
