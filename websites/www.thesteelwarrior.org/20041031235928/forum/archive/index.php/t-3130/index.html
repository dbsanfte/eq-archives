<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My hps sucks. I'm in a sol-ro enabled guild atm and I want to get my hps up there so I can start tanking. Problem is I'm apping to aforementioned guild and wont see very many primo loots any time soon. I've managed to get a few VT items here and there, but overall, I find my hps severely lacking. I was hoping on the Bazaar to help me in a few areas that are critical, especially my bracers, arms &amp; helm. <br />
<br />
I have about 60k to spend, or I could keep saving for a helm of rallos zek..or least that's my current plan. <br />
<br />

Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well since you are agnostic you are sorta screwed. when it comes to cheap upgrades for your SS quest armor.  I would try to get as much ornate armor as you can.  Ornate arms, legs, bracer, BP and hat would all be upgrades for you with more hps and more AC.<br />
<br />
You might also try to find some of the elite droppable items like crystalized acid bracer, RZ Helm and such but those will all be very expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's exactly what I was going to say. Camp BoT for ornate arms, legs, bracers x2, and a hat.<br />
<br />
Save your plats for an earth ring. Hit tactics for the parts to make another Bloodmetal ear. An ornate BP or LDoN 1492 BP will be pretty nice particularly with some augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slagfest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">since ur Sta isnt maxed u could try the BoB bracer quest from SS if u can get a buddy or 2..aint hard from what im told<br />
<br />
rest is pretty much Ornate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wandor you said the 1492 point BP from LDoN... I asked somewhere else but where are these listings of stuff?  And are they being updated in a main spot/point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Looks like your bracers are killing you.  Ornate bracer would be a nice upgrade... and benevolence, warlords, or even a silver chitin would be a HP upgrade over the myrmidions.<br />
<br />
Also would rep the solstice earring with another bloodmetal.<br />
<br />
Looking at your AAs I notice you havent done any planar durability.  I don't remember exactly how much PD3 added, but I would certainly get it if you're trying to boost your HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Amydgalan ? Mask from Cazic Thule (The zone, Pyramid 1 group camp)<br />
Shaderock Amulet from The Vadynn (Akheva, small raid force)<br />
Bloodmetal Earring (Tactics, dunno where)<br />
<br />
Ornate Bracers (dunno from where)<br />
Ornate Arms (dunno from  where)<br />
Ornate Greaves (dunno from where)<br />
<br />
Helmet of Rallos Zek from AoW  (Kael Drakkal, full raid)<br />
<br />
This will get you easily over 6K.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps : Do not buy AoW helm (if u still kill AoW its way too common)<br />
Ps 2 : Go xp/camp ornate <br />
Ps 3 : Buy Plate legs if u can, you will keep them almost for ever.<br />
(thats if u dont do VT/HP anymore)<br />
Ps 4 : Earth ring is way overvalued</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Errr, don't mean to nitpick, but 5300 + the 250 upgrade from those things does not equal &quot;easily over 6k&quot; or even near 6k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well lets see :)<br />
<br />
Earring : +3 sta + 15hp = 33hp<br />
Neck : +5 sta +60hp = 90hp<br />
Bracer : +4sta +30hp = 48hp<br />
Bracer : +4sta +30hp = 48hp<br />
Arms : +1sta +35hp = 41hp<br />
Legs : +8sta  +50hp= 98hp<br />
Mask : -4sta +40hp = 12hp<br />
Helm : +13sta +65hp = 143hp<br />
<br />
Total : 513 so 513X1.17 = 600<br />
<br />
Should had said 5800-5900 :) my bad<br />
<br />
Add the +31 stamina from the legs and Tadaaa 6k !<br />
<br />
<br />
Got my revenge on the 25 range arrow thing :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Planar Durability 3 would help a lot too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As a gnostic dorf I've had to deal with the lack of good cheap buyable gear as well.  Here are some suggestions outside the above listed.<br />
<br />
The new droga ring event (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=6706.topic) results in a decent bracer (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62203).  Since you're SolRo flagged, it should be pretty easy to do up to the second gate neck (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28290) quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2287)(you should do this anyway you'll need it later).  The named in the maze event in PoN often drops these arms (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=11423), you can buy them too, but if you're buying you're better off with ornate.  An alternate to ornate for your legs are Tae Ew Plate Greaves (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27777), if you can find them for sale.  Grab another bloodmetal earring, those things rock.  Also, while very time consuming, the chardok quests result in two nice pieces of gear I'm still wearing at 6.4k unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Work on PD3!  HP AA's make a huge differance, you're almost there keep going.  The 4.5% extra from PD3 even without any gear upgrades will give you 211hp.  Also I'd play around with switching your onhand/offhand, you'll probably get better dps and better agro with the GBoS in the onhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got my revenge on the 25 range arrow thing  <br />
<br />
Okay, you're right.  Except 22 of that 34 stamina gets wasted when he's buffed, so he doesn't actually put that many HP on, so there goes another 154hp off your total....and stamina buffs don't count in mangelo :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Managed to buy a Helm of RZ last night for 80k. I'm offically broke. I'm going for the 760 armor in Everfrost for some quick upgrades before we start farming elementals. <br />
<br />
I will also be camping Ornate plate camps as much ass possible. Thx for tips guys. <br />
<br />
PD3 is my next focus for aa's.</div></div><hr />
