Not a attack on women, a friendly list for the humor, if you are easily offended by jokes, do not read.<br />
<br />
If a man washes a dish and a woman isn't around to see him, did he really wash a dish?<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
Why are men thinkers and women talkers? Cause a man has two heads, a woman has four lips.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
Why is it bad when the wife is out of the kitchet? The chain must have broke again.<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
Women are like.............<br />
<br />
<br />
...country western songs<br />
They're annoying, they all sound alike, but if you really listen to them you'll get depressed and drink a lot. <br />
<br />
...parking meters<br />
If you don't feed them with enough money you face serious consequences.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok somebody else do a few.........<br />
<br />
Oh and females are welcome to post their own pro female jokes as long as they are intended to be humorous.<br />
