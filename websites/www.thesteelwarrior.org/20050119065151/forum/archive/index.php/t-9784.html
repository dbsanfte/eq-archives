<br />
As for myself I'm not in a raiding guild and probably never will be.<br />
<br />
So I'm looking for stuff that I can buy or stuff that's groupable.  I have all expansions and yes I plan on grinding a bunch of ldons or at least as many as I can since that will probably be my best bet for some slots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the most part everything looks pretty good. The only &quot;weak&quot; spot that I see is your shoulders. 20AC is nice, but some HPs would be nice, too. Get either some cultural shoulders (forget what Mith Marr cultural is called) or something similar. Horn-Spiked Shouldplates are good, too if you have the money. Cultural bracers would be a lateral upgrade in terms of HPs, but you'd trade in some stats for a good jump in AC. Look into some ornate gauntlets, too. Big increase in AC/HPs and similar stats. Plus the haste clicky is awesome if you don't have a haster in the group. Weapon wise you are perfectly set. If I were you I'd just focus on levels right now and eventually AAs' Everything else will come in time, as it looks like it's doing now.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, get some Halas 10lb. Meat Pies and some Grobb Liquidised Meat. For about 100pp you'll gain 30HPs, 11str/sta and 5dex/agi.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The cloak that I have in my magelo will be a good upgrade, too. If it's anything like Torv, it won't run too much more than a Pernicity cloak, has more raw AC plus a clicky that's 26AC or so and stacks with anything you'll ever see if you aren't in a raid guild. On top of that you'll gain raw HPs, dex, agi and some nice saves.</div></div><hr />

I have some decent utility items there too. <br />

Was planing on updating the shoulders as they are clearly the weakest spot but was curious how I was doing with the rest.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
