<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenyi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now this may be related to the AA bug.  I say this because I have /shield range extension level 2.  Since Wednesday's patch (and still happening after Thursday morning's patch) anytime I shield a PC, I see 'Target begins to use Kenyi as a living shield!' *immediately* followed by 'Kenyi ceases protecting Target.'  The duration of my /shield is no more than 0.1 second.  This was not a result of my or the other PC moving, we were both stationary.<br />

Bug reported twice now &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

Hey folks,<br />
<br />
The servers will again be coming down tonight at 3AM PDT (July 16th,2004) to correct some AA issues and a few other lingering problems that resulted from the AA system change.  We feel that some of the AA problems are enough of a hinderance to gameplay, that is it necessary to correct them tonight. <br />
 <br />
Some of the issues we are correcting are;<br />
Problems with Fading Memories <br />
An issue with warrior/shield<br />
Look for a more detailed list with the update.<br />
<br />
 I apologize to those of you, who had raids and other activities scheduled tonight and thank you for your patience.<br />
 <br />
Thanks all.<br />
