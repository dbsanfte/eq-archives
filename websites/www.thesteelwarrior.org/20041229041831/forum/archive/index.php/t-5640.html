At the chat about GoD they said that another portion of the melee enhancement was going to be put in with this patch.  I've seen nothing posted about it anywhere.  I also saw nothing about it in the patch message.<br />
<br />
Did I miss something new we got (other than new AA's that are expansion specific or dropped items with +end) someplace.  I didn't get a chance to play much last night which is why I was trying to find out what we got here.<br />
<br />
I really wonder if I missed something new because I don't see alot of people complaining about not getting it.<br />
<br />
Thanks and if this is addressed someplace else can someone point me to it.</div></div><hr />
