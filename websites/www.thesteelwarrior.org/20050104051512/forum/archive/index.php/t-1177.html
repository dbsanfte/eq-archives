(cant even go to HoT anymore because of ppl leaving at round lvl 60, and recruitment starts at 45) <br />
<br />
If so, its kinda sukky for lvl/AAs imo, and would prolly recquire a new guild, eventhough i like my present one.<br />
<br />
I will buy 1 more bloodmetal, but thats kinda all i can see in the near future.<br />
<br />
Take a look and feel free to come with ideas...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">honestly you need to have a bit more leadership and restraints/rewards in your guild to solve the leaving problem.<br />
<br />
with that in mind; start off small..y'all are 50+...do some kael raids. get a list going of your guildmates; and farm the hell out of the joint. get the leadership roles set out and organize organize organize !! plan raids. talk to other guilds whom are around/close to your levels/size and work out a schedule. farm the gear. promote those willing to lead; reward those who put their time in. with that in mind you'll be in HoT/planar/wherever you want to go.<br />
<br />
believe me, it works. when i joined my old guild, Divine Legend, on Terris Thule server..we were barely in Hate/Fear and we were all scattered/scrambled about. In the course of a year they're now one of the top 5 or more ( been a while since i actively played on TT ) guilds on the server; progressing through VT now; still jamming the planes in PoP...and have made quite an impression on everyone as a guild who paid their dues and now are reaping the rewards.<br />
<br />
In closing; you could use some gear now..but i'd start looking towards the future of what you'll be doing once you get these items. Sounds like your guild needs a bit of structure and the rest will all fall into place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, leadership is the most important part of guild advancement.  When I joined my guild a year ago, we were rocking Kael arena and plate cycles.  We also were making a lot of trips into HoT.  We were smacking vindicator with 6 groups and felt bad ass =)<br />
<br />
We were making small advances, but not really going any where.  About early or mid may, we decided we were done with farming HoT, and having Vindi or the PoN named as our biggest fights.  Instead, our leaders and members buckled down and we started to do a lot of advancement work.<br />
<br />
Now we are working on getting as many people as possible ST keyed.  We went through and decimated Aary, Lord Vyemm, Lord Koi and Lady M in NToV on our first run.  We pimp smacked Tunare on our first run.  We pimped the PoS Lords on mulitiple occasions.  In a couple of monthes, we went from HoT/Vindi farming to being capable of killing mobs on a much greater scale.  The driving force behind this was my guild's officers and our raid leaders.  They worked their asses off to plan and strat mobs, and our raiders took responsiblity and played smart.<br />
<br />
Organzie a plan of action.  Set goals.  Figure out the steps you need to take to accomplish your goals.  And don't give up.  Hopeflly you can retain some of those 60+ people.  Soon, when others hear and see how you have a plan, and that you are taking steps to succede in that plan, you'll have some of those 60+ comming back.  People want to be part of something focused in EQ.  Set a goal, and work on it, and the people will come.  And then the raids and the gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get those SS gloves, they rock.  Ditch the Tattered mantle and get the chodikai pauldruns, barbed rubi, or one of the dragonskin mantles depending on your cash situation.  Get a Windblade.  It's a little better aggro and a LOT more DPS than your 1 hander combo.  Earring of Solstice is a cheap earring upgrade.  Go farm CT, you can pick up barbed rubi pauldruns, heavy rubi girdle, mosquito leg earring, and amy mask.  Swap out your haste belt for a CoF asap.  Other than that you'll have to join a raid guild unless they bump up the drop rate on ornate soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempur</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you are on dragon faction, draconic pauldrons and bracers of benevolence would be good.  Heavy Rubicite Girdle should be easily campable in CT and the Mosquito Leg Earring drop in the same area.<br />
<br />
I'd start looking for smaller encounters with good drops to get a fire lit.  Radir in UP, Va`dyn in Akheva, Velks....  Some successful fights tend to get peoples attention and keep higher lvls interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would strongly suggest you go kill anything and everything that does not chew up your little guys with AE's...<br />
<br />
I.E. Rumble, Va'dyn, Vindi, Doomshade, Statue, King Tormax<br />
<br />
Grab a couple extra clerics or 58 Shaman/Druid Healers. Your warrior with proper buffs will probably max out at around 7800 hit points. <br />
<br />
That is more than enough to kill the mobs listed above if you can get 5-6 clerics (the tougher fights), one reliable 61+ slower and some DPS. <br />
<br />
Any DPS :) (Borrow if you have to)<br />
<br />
So while you are waiting around for the guild to level up, Go work on:<br />
<br />
a 100 HP neck piece (Va Dyn)<br />
a Vindicator Breastplate (duh)<br />
a 70 hp 15 Stamina Cloak (Rumblecrush)<br />
a Vindicator Boots (duh)<br />
a 41% Haste Earring (Doomshade)<br />
a 50hp 10 Stamina Bow (Doomshade)<br />
<br />
Different story here, but something to think about in time...<br />
<br />
a 75 hps 10 stamina set of boots (King Tormax)<br />
a 100 hps 12 stamina helm (King Tormax)<br />
<br />
Remember that the higher you go in hps, the further up the list of items you can go. Start with Va Dyn. Then move to Rumblecrush and Vindicator. Once you have a strong cheal chain and your warrior is topping 8k hit points, you may be able to survive KT as a single tank long enough to take him down.<br />
<br />
No AE = attrition fight. <br />
More clerics = longer fight. <br />
Higher Hps = more room for error.<br />
<br />
The poster above is right to suggest CT. You will clean up in there. Just dont be afraid to try some of the raid targets too :) You have about 1700 more hps than I did when I did Vindi for the first time. I probably have more DPS than you will, but I really don't see that being a huge issue :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mbad</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys. Nice info, mostly along what i figured. Just gets damn frustrating when guild goes from 22 ppl lvl 58 on raids to 2 groups lvl 55...<br />
Guess ill go farm Cazic :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also a good idea is to get some ally guilds to combine with and make a big alliance so you will be able to kill alot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont be in a rush to recruit. nurture what you have, get rid of any dead wood. even 2 groups of mid 55s have quite a few thigns u can aim at and if you start to raid regularly then you will over time attract more people to the guild. <br />
<br />
always have goals in mind, in terms of guild numbers, class balance and raid goals/progression. set these out so that everyone is working to the same goal. e.g. you may want people to concentrate more on levelling at this stage rather than aaxp as 2 groups of level 60s can do a lot more than 2 groups of level 55s with 20aaxp. have a good procedure for monitoring new members to ensure you retain the good people. <br />
<br />
have a decent website, keep it updated. for me, i find it really easy when a prospective applicant asks whats your url and i say www jadedphoenix com as opposed to some ezcrap url which you can never remember.</div></div><hr />
