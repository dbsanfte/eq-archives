<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been a bunch lately of gear upgrade questions and it got me to thinking.  What are some good places people can go, 50+, to exp and have a reasonable chance of upgrading their gear at?  Part of this is assuming that, like so many warriors, you simply do not have alot of cash.  I remember my 50's and early 60's(and continuing on even to now, tho it is not nearly as bad) as being very poor, and not being able to afford all those wonderfull things in the bazaar.  I also remember not wanting to spend countless hours farming greans for cash or some ultra rare drop.  I wanted to spend as much of my time as possible exping.  So, what are some good exp spots where you can also attain servicable armor?  Let me start with a few.<br />
<br />
1:  Soulscream belt, Veksar:  Can probably start doing this camp about 50 with a regular exp group.  Veksar exp is not bad at all, mobs all drop plat and some weapons, and a chance at a 31 % haste belt make for a win win situation.<br />
<br />
2:  Mosquito leg earing, Cazic Thule:  full group 55 + could probably handle this camp(maybe higher for your CC person).  A good droppable earing, what should be decent exp(tho not great), and not usually camped make this a nice possibility.  CT yields several other nice pieces of gear, and sewers is a good place to start in CT.<br />
<br />
3:  Moktar/Ralduken armor, Umbral Plains:  Early SoL this was a scary zone to a lot of more casual players.  Guild I was in at the time would take 3 groups to slowly farm ZI.  This is no longer the case, and 1 group 50 + should be able to farm ZI with little trouble.  Moktar/Ralduken armor is not the greatest stuff in game, but some pieces are servicable into the 60's.<br />
<br />
Those are 3 that pop to my mind, what other good ones are out there?<br />
<br />
edit:  Wish this thing had a spell checker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why not visit Sebilis, it´s pretty simple to get the key and with a patient +50 group u can wield ur way to several nice camps.<br />
<br />
Here is how u get the key:<br />
<br />
&quot;The items and turn in for the key are in Trakanons Teeth.<br />
You must kill a Froglock Hunter and a Froglock Forager for the medallions of Kunzar and Nathsar.<br />
They are no drop and lore.<br />
Turn them in to Emperor Ganak and he will reward you with the Idol of Trakanon which is the key to Seb.<br />
The Emperor is in a cave on the other side of the zone from the zone in from skyfire.<br />
The hunter can usually be found roaming around near the zone from skyfire and the forager is usually near the middle of the zone near where the lake is&quot;<br />
<br />
And here are som links to stuff that drop inside, exp is prett slow in there but it´s still a great palce with nice drops.<br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=89&amp;start=75<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Velks has some drops that could probably be considered gear upgrades to some in the 50's too.<br />
<br />
Crystal Chitin Vambs and Gauntlets from the dogs in the pit, Silver Chitin Wristband and Handwraps from the spiders, Barbed Ringmail and bits of spider fur gear from the dogs up the top.<br />
<br />
If you can get a group to carry on up into the castle you can get blood runed Gauntlets, belt and legs aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aluamilli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't overlook Nadox.<br />
<br />
This is a great lil zone with several drops scattered through out. Steel Wrapped Armor is pretty good until you start getting Cultural and/or Thurg.<br />
<br />
Also, while there you might wanna try the Incubator Room. This is a great lil XP camp with the chance of an OK Earring. Though the mob who drops it seems to be excruciatingly (Is that even a word?) rare. <br />
<br />
Don't forget, those weapons that drop in Veksar: Turn 4 at a time in to the Iksar on the beach for some nice Cabby Factions, EXP, and around 20pp (the same you would have got if you sold em). I find alot of people don't know about this, but it's really nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sebilis, Nadox, Velks, Droga, Nurga, Lodizal come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">haha<br />
yah xp off gonles there and just casually kill Lozidal. HAHA<br />
<br />
I seriousley wouldnt know what would anyone use from sebelis in this day and age. By the time you get anything decent you'd probably save up enough gem cash to buy yourself something twice as good.<br />
<br />
I'd say xp in kael arena/bank for thurg armor,<br />
veleks frenzy/kobalds<br />
rewamped zones probably bigest bang for the buck, but also requier more skill.<br />
CT-Droga-Veksar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thurg armor is a very good idea.  I like the Sebilis/Velks suggestions as well.  I guess it depends on what pieces you are needing an upgrade as well.  Some nice drops in ME if you do not have them yet, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&lt;3 the CT revamp... just wish I knew a healer who loves it as much as I do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Plane of Hate is exp zone now and still drops the hate gear.. I upgraded with indi boots yesterday</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You're also on Stromm....you were probably still in Bronze Boots :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Crafted, newb! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ChrisDaTank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Old Sebilis = RBG (27% Haste belt with nice stats), Tolans Bracer(Sell in Baz and buy a Valorium Ring), Juggs drop 55-60+ spells that are baz food, umm...Fungi Tunic (70K on Lanys).  With the exception of Juggs and Fungi, I can duo this place with my wifes 60 cleric.  <br />
<br />
Veksar drops are pretty good:  Soulscream Belt as previously mentioned, Razor Edged Shantok (not a bad offhand 14/19 1HS),  some BP that drops there sells for 5K.  <br />
<br />
Velks kinda seems like a waste of time to me anymore, but named ledge is perma camped by a few 65 necros that take turns all the time, so maybe Im bias'd.  <br />
<br />
Alas, a 50+ group should be able to one group Kael Arena with the right classes, which can yield some Thurg armor.  <br />
<br />
Thats about all I can come up with right now....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well, the Razor Edged Shantok I have is only 12 / 20</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Chris, if u ever hunted in sebelis you know that RBG is pretty much non existant. I've seen 3 total haste drops from OS and it was like the only zone I xped in for a year. Same can be said for Fungi Tunic 60+ hours seen 1. As in regards to other stuff its cash loot and as I said by the time you would get anything nice that maybe needed by warrior u'll have cash to buy better. Which proves my point. Sebelis is nice for pharming cash if you are high level and mobs are trival. If you want straight up gear upgrade, dont come to OS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mobs in Droga drop 15-20pp though. so better than Seb I guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ChrisDaTank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Guess Ive been lucky, Ive pulled two RBG's and a Fungi out of OS, and Ive only been playing in the high end game for maybe 6 mos.  Besides, its excellent for cash drops, which in turn, can buy you gear.  You were correct, Shantok is 12/20, my bad on that, was in a hurry  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the earring out of ct slime pits is supah rare now. however the rubicite belt also drops there along with ft3 boots. great camp if you can find it open. if you clear all the slim pits while hugging left to pull, you will get all 3 phs, really not hard to do, only 3 pits.<br />
<br />
need a better than average group to do the pyramid in CT but good stuff there too, fleshgrinder PH is in the left corner as you come up.<br />
<br />
plate cycle in kael, part of the 10th ring quest, normally drops a plate item or two, can repeat it indefinately.<br />
<br />
havent been to the revamped zones so cant really say, but the weapons/eq i seen posted out of them makes them your best bet. sebillis is definately a total waiste, rbg is a myth, anyone who got 2 in one day made a deal with the debil.</div></div><hr />
