I am just wondering if anyone else out there is using one of these. ( They drop off the Luggald Broodmother in Crypt of nadox )<br />
I personally find this weapon has given my main hand Blade of Carnage a run for it's money for agro in the offhand simply because it has a very high Proc rate. <br />
<br />
Bone-Bladed Battlehammer <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP <br />
Damage: 14<br />
Delay: 22 <br />
Ratio: 1.571 Amazing <br />
Sta: +6 Agi: +7 Wis: +6 HP: +55 Mana: +35 <br />
Weight: 0.8 <br />
Weapon Skill: One Hand Blunt <br />
Classes: Warrior Rogue Monk Bard Shadowknight Paladin Ranger Beastlord <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Inventory Slot: Either Melee<br />
<br />
Effect: Lightning Call ( 122 DD and stun for 0.0 sec )<br />
Type: Random <br />
<br />
If you check several other weapons rated as excellent agro weapons from the list above, this effect is similar to The ones on the Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled, Great Blade of Storms , Scepter of Destruction. It gives a decent Direct Damage in 122 points, and has the 0.0 second stun. I am just wondering how this weapon stacks up against such hallowed weapons as the Scepter of destruction, and the Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled.<br />

The only problem with the hammer is its got a knockback component to it , that can be very annoying.<br />

I haven't picked one up yet, but those that have it have said it's really great agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how hard is it to kill that guy with say 3 groups 55+? or what kind of force does he take?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do things the standard way ( how someone solos this thing is beyond me and I find that amazing to say the least ) you will need at least 2 groups of higher levels and I think 3 groups would be better if the average is around 60ish.<br />
You get her to spawn by killing the Luggald Ambassador.<br />
The Luggald Broodmother walks around and causes other luggalds to spawn and attack you, usually about 4 at a time. I recommend having a monk follow her around and pull the spawns to you as soon as they Pop. This goes on for quite a few waves until she becomes targetable and you can engage her in battle. <br />
She isnt targetable before that happens. You need the numbers to take the mobs she spawns down before there are to many to handle. Treat it like the Plane of Justice trial of execution event and you will be fine.<br />
Once solo she isnt that hard to take down, she hits for around 300ish, max 490. I believe she is slowable ( altho I am not certain ).<br />
<br />
Good Luck on this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 bards in Pak have the broodmother permacamped on Tarew Marr =/  I barely managed to get my solo shot in because they were away raiding when the ambassador spawned.<br />
<br />
The reason she's soloable is cause she doesn't summon, and you don't have to kill the other stuff that spawns while she's untargetable.  Hammer seems to be a rare drop though, its usually the crap boots or the droppable ring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
