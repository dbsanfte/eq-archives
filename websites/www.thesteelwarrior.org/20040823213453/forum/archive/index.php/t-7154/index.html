<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TankAbbott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My first post as a warrior.  I have played on a few different servers and played a few different types of characters.  I recently started a warrior on the Saryrn server to play with some real life friends.  I am currently a 35 warrior.  My main character is a paladin in an elemental guild on a different server.  I have to say I enjoy playing a warrior.<br />
<br />
Well, I was perusing some of the websites of some elemental guilds on Saryrn to see what guild I might try to apply to in the future.  I was checking out raids and such and came across a guild, Guardians Of Light, where they recently let a paladin, Adlerr, win the bid on a Blade of War.  I was shocked, but then I thought maybe all the warriors already had one, and dug deeper and I believe that this BOW was only the 2nd or 3rd in the guild.  I play a paladin and I would have to say that I never would ask for a BOW.  I currently wield a Crow Footed Lance on my pally and like it very much.<br />
<br />
So, being new to the warrior class I would like comments or thoughts on this subject.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

OH well; guess the Pally will be doing a lot of MT work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember when Circle of Legends on Bristlebane finally got GRMK off Solusek Ro... it was the best rogue weapon to ever drop for them, and it got claimed on DKP by a Beastlord...<br />
<br />
Good times.  Now I remember why DKP sucks the cock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">DKP is fine as long as you don't have retards in your guild.  <br />
<br />
But really, who cares?  If the warriors wanted it they should have bid more.  If the paladin wanted it bad enough to spent points on it, who you to say he shouldn't have it?  That guild isn't going to fall apart because one of their warriors didn't get a BoW on this kill.  It's no bigger disaster than if it hadn't dropped.  The warrior will get one next time, or they will get some other weapon.<br />
<br />
That said, my guild is dkp but we merit EB weapons.  All it takes is a little foresight from your officers and things like this won't happen if you don't want them too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Warriors can always get a SEWS too yanno.<br />
<br />
That's how DKP works, pure dkp sucks, but regulated dkp owns.</div></div><hr />

Unfortinutly theres several guilds on Saryrn who choose quantity over quality and would rather have 90,000 members and atleast 5 people on a day that you dont know, instead of a guild with 50 level-headed players who know how to work well together and get the job done without zerging things. <br />

The paladin with the BoW's magelo is here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thats not a pally thats a warrior. Look at his gear choices.</div></div><hr />

Check his dream list, he also plans on getting a SEWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barboki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually my guild has had a paladin with a BoW for a long time.  Grant it he got the BoW because SoE had done one of thier wonderful jobs at a patch that caused people to go 1018 after they died or zoned for over an hour.<br />
<br />
Thus all the warriors were 1018 and he was awarded the the BoW when it was less than a minute from rotting.  I believe he was the first Paladin cross all servers to get one.  He got to MA alot for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We dont care at all, good for the Paladin.<br />
<br />
A BoW going to a non warrior can  mean :<br />
<br />
1) All wars have BoW or better<br />
2) All wars dont have enough dkp/att to merit/bid on the BoW<br />
3) The Loot System/Officers could use some tweaking.<br />
4) Someone Somewhere fucked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guild plans on getting some of the Knights some Blades of War, but that isn't because we're idiots, hehe.  <br />
<br />
I would have to say that my guild seems to get the rarest drops out of mobs the most sometimes.  Caen's Bo Staff of Fury?  It's supposedly super rare, yet we had I believe four of them in 5-6 Emperor Ssraeshza kills.  As far as BoWs go, we've had a total of five in 5-6 Rztw kills (and all the main warriors have a BoW now).  Three Fiery Staves of Zha in 4-5 Reparm kills.  We even had 2x GRMKs drop off Solusek Ro our last kill.  <br />
<br />
Just odd stuff.  So hey, why not?  Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=329256<br />

<br />
omg ranger with BoW :\<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What happen was, little over a year ago 2 dropped for them. One went to a warrior, and no other warriors needed that where present. So ranger got and made everyone cry :**( serverwide.<br />
<br />
...not dkp either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i think a hybrid with a BoW in their magelo is a death sentence. if i were in charge of guild recruiting seeing one on a maglo profile would tell me something about their sence of what their classes primary job role is, as well as how willing they are to help the guild as a whole. my first inclination would be to think this person is A) a moron, B) loot whore, or C) has no idea there are better weapons specifically designed for their class. somewhere, WAY past those first few ideas would be that every guild warrior has a BoW...which you can usually tell by the rest of the persons gear as well as how far they've advanced.<br />
 <br />
i actually know a SK with a BoW, altho he had full EP plate by the time he looted it, all the other warriors actaully DID have the BoW. probably THE very last assumption to cross my mind would be that absolutle NO warriors were able to get there. it gives me the same feeling as when i check the beastary on allakhazam and you get a swarm of idiots dictating what the best class is for such and such a drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lidarae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ok, I am a member of the Guardians of Light.<br />
<br />
We are a bit different then most of the other elemental guilds.  We don't have level restrictions or AA requirements.  If someone wants in the guild and gets the vouches, they could be a level 1 for all that it matters.  We also don't require raid attendance.<br />
<br />
As a result we have a real mixed bag on raids.  Sometimes 30 people show up, sometimes over 100.   For the smaller raids it isn't unusual to have one of our paladins acting as raid main assist.  The warriors are saved for off-tanking unmezzables and bosses.<br />
<br />
Adlerr is one the paladins that occasionally acts as main assist and him getting a BoW wasn't a problem.<br />
<br />
As for DKP, we don't bid.  Highest points gets the item.  However, there is a sanity check; our definition, not popular opinion.  If a ranger had bid on the item against a warrior or one of our raid main assists I am sure they would have been refused regardless of DKP.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  Froggerx please don't grind your axe on all the boards.  We do things different then most folks and are happy.  Save the acid for the specific idiots in our guild who like flaming you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">but doesn't adlerr know that there are so many other weapons out there better then the BoW for a pally? (sews, hopebringer, gboc, kgm, etc..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lidarae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">He is main assisting in a raid in Earth now, so it works for us.  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bokuza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Being one of GoL's oldest members I can say that I was not to fond of a paladin even bidding on what was a warrior weapon.  But GoL isnt like the others.  While we have grown alot since we were able to kill RZ and enter the planes months ago, we still have a sense of family, better than Froggerx can say for his guild of block heads, but thats for a different thread.<br />
<br />
I was upset to see adlerr win it.  But now that I have raided and seen that it does help us and that adlerr and a few other paladins in the guild actually hold their part in tanking or off tanking I think it was a good choice.  <br />
<br />
But then again you might think I am wrong, I can understand why since this is like me going into The back alley and telling them that just because there is a backstab mod on a weapon that any mellee can use doesnt mean its entitled to them.  I have always believed in giving it to the class that benefitted most, but either way out guild benefitted on this special occasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">enough of teh guild drama, we get the point =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As far as I am concerned, I have no problem with a paladin getting a BoW. It is a nice weapon, if they have worked for it, let em take what they worked for. Escpecially in a  dkp system where the paladin had more.  <br />
<br />
Now if you want funny, there is one guild on my server that had such crazy luck getting BoW's that about 1-2 months ago a bersekrer alt looted a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In the days of anger 3 + incite EB weapons are no longer requiered to hold agro well. Personally I stoped considering BoW warrior only weapon. Also see no reason not to give it to Pally/SK especially if your top 2-3 warriors got nice agro setups already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Angry_Tank01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">He is main assisting in a raid in Earth now, so it works for us. :-) <br />
<br />
Pally MA, while warriors offtank unmezzables...  <br />
Someone send this thread to the pally boards to get them to stop moaning about not being able to tank  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
The issue is that Pallys don't need weapons for aggro. <br />
Take the best warrior 2hander before RZ, and whack a Anger3 aug in, (I'm thinking BBB or similar) then yes you'll have a *good* weapon, but lets face it, BoW is godly at the level it's obtainable - and it's a long wait until you'll see a DBoW, 9months here since we grabbed a BoW, and still no DBoW.<br />
<br />
Enforcing common sense when it comes to bidding is near impossible, but it seems like you guys have a very unique guild, so it would make sense you have unique rules.</div></div><hr />
