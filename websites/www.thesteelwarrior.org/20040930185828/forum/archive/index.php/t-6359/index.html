<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night we had 2 occurances of this in the Ikkinz Glorification raid...<br />
<br />
DI would fire on the tank... the tank would get every indication he was dead and would get LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
  Upon zoning the tank would be at bind with full gear, and no corpse in Ikkinz.  This happened to 2 different people last night.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen this?  I did a bug on it last night but felt it was significant enough to warrant some more attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This happened to a guildy of mine in HoH last night, wasn't anything to do with DI for him though.  I'll try to get more details of the circumstances but i'm pretty sure he retuned to his bind point in full gear after a death and he had no corpse in hoh but lost XP, GM treated him like he was crazy and told him that he had no corpses anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh I died tanking exiled last night.... corpse was at bind spot, I was warped to ssra zi naked..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Similar thing happened in my group in Hard Miragul's adventure last night.  Monk was pulling, had two, got stunned...he FDd, but it failed.  He got down to 1% and I hit DvA (basically agro-less heal for him) and he shoots up to 80%.  Next thing you know, he zoned.<br />
<br />
You know when someone dies you can see their hp bar completely empty?  His looked like he just zoned out.  He appeared at his bind point with all his gear and no exp loss.  He told me he died and I healed him right after.  Think the bug involves a heal landing right as you die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same thign happened to me last night in Glorification as well.  Was just after the 2nd locked door fighting the g-flxuer.  Hate doing that run through Kod'taz :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinmari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We had some people die to the a DoT from Babnoxis and then died repeatedly to the DoT at their bind spot.  Their gear went with em and they only seemed to lose xp for one death versus every time they died.  It was very odd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You didn't die, he just hit you so hard it knocked you out of your armor and you came down at the zone-in!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe unrelated to DI then, some new bug with death and client syncing with the server or something along those lines</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Had a strange one in PoD last night while getting the book from the spider for a friend.<br />
<br />
Had my ench out of group and he died before we engaged. I said screw it will rez at ZI after evac.<br />
<br />
Kill spider, loot book (yay!), evac to ZI and wait for the enchanters corpse.<br />
<br />
Corpse pops like normal. Rez it, ench loads into zone fine. Loots corpse, but when he is done and stands up (realeasing corpse to poof) he warps to where he died in the room before the spider...<br />
<br />
<br />
Very very wierd, just glad he could mem gate and get out to prevent a possible repeat performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lorce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Same thing happened to me while tanking fabled king tranix, got a message saying I died, but lost no exp or gear and was still fully buffed at my bind point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Same thing happened to our tank in Time last night.  Not sure of the particulars under which he 'died,' but he made a comment about being at bind point buffed with all his gear (moments earlier he was tanking Quarm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Happened with quarm from the DOT's he does, happened to about 10 or 12 of our guildies when we did quarm the other day when death occured from DoT because of bad bugged walls that didnt allowed positioning to block the AE , except the difference here is we warped to bind at like 500 hp and than the DoT kills us on the time dial, some people were in Death loop dying over and over and the DoT's didnt fade even after they had died already, for me I got warped to time dial in full gear and died from 2 DoT's from quarm and that was the end of it for me, but basically all corpses littering time dial in tranquility, was pretty dumb looking imo . Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So is this part of Melee Enhancement part II? We get a mob-inflicted gate ability? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Celeador goldenharp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I had this happen when my Ikknz trial 1 group wiped on DD, weired thing was DI fired on me then i got smacked around and i though i died, it wasnt as if DI had fired and i was ported out, Also in the continueing list of bugs when a DA was used in combo with Lev i was unable to move to a lower elevation and was able to clip / move though walls, oh and comming out of ikkz trial 1 with lev on will drop you under the world, this seems to apply to multiple zones including earth as this happed to several peeps when raid was setting up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Happened to me in Yxtta, except my corpse didnt come with me, but I didnt lose any exp, and when I was rezzed I didn't have any rezz effects and was poofed to the Yxtta zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Happened to me also in VT, DI triggered, I got the message that I was hit by a bogus spell, and like 1-2 melee rounds later I showed up at my bind with full buffs, all my gear and no xp loss.  Strange</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just happened to one of our monks.  Said he died, showed up at bind full buffs / gear, no exp loss.  He also still had a dot on him, and was put at 3%.  Instead of dying though, when he got to zero, he would just poof again back to bind, full gear, and 3% again.  After that happened a bit, he finally got his druid bot to him to heal him before poof again, and was able to get to the zone, and CoH back.  Quite the odd bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Halfway through an Ikkinz raid, it's already happened three times to us.  Twice to our puller, once to our MA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Happened to probably 10+ people at our PoF raid tonight.  Pathing has been a bitch since the patch and we get alot of named warping right on top of us.  We wiped to Blazz and we had a bunch of people that hit a death loop from still having Blazz AE at bind or had their corpses pop to their bind spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Happened to me while I was tanking Time TZ last night.  He killed me ( I got hit for some damage and it said, &quot;You died.&quot;), then I got healed immediatley after, and TZ hit me some more, and I got healed some more, but after about 2 seconds of tanking him after I &quot;died&quot;, I just ported to my bind spot, with all my gear, buffs, and detrimental TZ spells on me.<br />
<br />
It was dumb, I had to run back snared. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Athrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I was playing with my eye in a LDON, cast illusion among other things while roaming (Illusion warps you back to your toon for a split second).<br />
<br />
My eye faded and I warped to where it poofed.<br />
<br />
I wasn't able to duplicate it, but still, pretty confusing.<br />
<br />
I guess if anything it was good for a laugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Happened to me after DI as well.  However, I know several other people it happened to with no DI issues.  Running back sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I've had this happen to me twice lately while tanking Time gods.  I'll be tanking, get low hps and 'die', but I'll fall down like I'm dead (FD) and then I will continue to get hit by the mob (TZ and RZ) until I loose aggro.  My UI locks up like I'm dead and I can't move the mouse or anything, I can only type in the chat window.  It's getting extremely annoying.<br />
<br />
A GM today, 9 hours after I petitioned, told me that I should use the default UI or call tech support and /bug it.... I bugged it a while ago.<br />
<br />
In both cases, I eventually died (to TZ, and to RZ's adds about 1 minute after RZ died and everyone left room) for real and was sent to my bind spot naked, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">This was likely related to the auto rewind.  It should be all better now that that is gone... hopefully anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Happened last night against Tallon in time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Had this happen to me exactly as you describe it for the first time last night.  Di fired and I am looking at my corpse, except I am alive.  Was able to type /sit and at least get up off the ground that way, but ended up having to /q out so I could do anything more.  Annoying to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wargo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Aye, same thing happened to me with Blazzax last night. Got knocked unconcious, DI fired and UI locked up in over head camera. Was nothing I could do until I eventually died.</div></div><hr />
