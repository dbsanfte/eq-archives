<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a nice way of fixing Warriors all around, all while making them funner to play, balanced, and without using spellish skills!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors get a new bar which replaces the mana bar... (it could also replace Sta bar, but would have to change Sta a lot, and remove zing spells).<br />
<br />
This bar represents your energy, or willpower.<br />
<br />
Warriors also get a new Skill, &quot;Energy Surge&quot; of however you wish to call it.<br />
The skill enduces pure hate into the adversaries (thus best used after Taunts).<br />
But each time you use this skill, it takes away 10% of your Willpower bar.<br />
Hate induced would be around 300hate.<br />
<br />
The Willpower bar will regenerate while you're seated, or simply not combatting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now disciplines are entirely unlinked. Each different disc will only keep reuse timers for themselves.<br />
Meaning once defensive is used, you can immediately use another disc... but not defensive, until it's 10min timer has run out.<br />
<br />
Now here is the important part.....<br />
<br />
Each use of a Discipline will demand Willpower.<br />
Using up 50%-30% of your Willpower bar.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
-This way, we can have knightish aggro at the cost of not being able to use a disc.<br />
-Or, we can moderate our aggro, and be able to use Defensive or whatever disc is needed... using little &quot;juice&quot; to maintain aggro along with our EB weapons (this keeps the EB bonus from weapons, still very usefull).<br />
-Or, if we're not tanking, we can go all out on our aggressive discs. Dealing decent dps.<br />
<br />
In groups:<br />
<br />
Since we hardly use defensive, we can choose to go full aggressive for more dps, using very little &quot;juice&quot; to maintain aggro.<br />
Or a lot of our juice to hold some Knightish aggro.<br />
But if you use too much, there's a point where the rest between pulls wont be enough regen, and youll either have to have a bit of downtime, or go back to using Taunt only (the way we're doing it now).<br />
<br />
So most will use the Juice for initial aggro only. Giving Knights an advantage in the aggro departement. But a balanced advantage.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Raids:<br />
<br />
Defensive and Evasive are very important, thus Aggro Management still plays a very large role. And wizards cant go all out.<br />
The warrior only has limited Juice, and most of it is used for those 2 discs.<br />
<br />
Thus raids stay pretty much as is for tanking....<br />
but Warriors that don't tank can go full dps!<br />
<br />
We can also be pretty decent offtankers, able to keep hate without breaking mezzes, and a longer distance in aggro getting.<br />
<br />
<br />
So this solution pretty much fixes all our problems, without stepping on Knights toes, and without overpowering us.<br />
It puts us JUST where we want to be, and should be :).<br />
<br />
<br />
And most of all, half of this solution (the juice part), is already rumored to be in SOE's line of idea.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
The juice taken from using discs can be discussed ;)...<br />
maybe make it different % depending on the disc used...<br />
20% for small poopy discs like fearless or resist... and 70% for more important discs like Defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caeden</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only problem I can see, is there will be warriors wanting + willpower on items, knights get +mana why don't we get + willpower?<br />
<br />
So how would you decide how much willpower we have? You wanna say the more Wisdom or Intelligence gives us Willpower?  Then we're gonna be looking for armor with +Wis or +Int on it.  Or are we just gonna have a set number based on what level we are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow... that's a great idea man........<br />
<br />
Few questions tho,   would there be spells castable on the warrior ala KEI to make your willpower bar regen faster?  or will it all be the same,  and I'm assuming that this bar would be based off stamina + level + a new skill.... or something.<br />
<br />
SOE READ THIS POST OMG!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it's hard to say about how regen should be without actually testing it :).<br />
<br />
At first I thought regen while not fighting was good.... but there would be problems with very long fights like in Vex Thal or Xegony.... where you can pull off 3 or 4 evasives.<br />
With this, only 2 evasives could be pulled off.<br />
<br />
So a small regen while fighting would be nice, one that regens you around 20% of your bar within 10mins.<br />
Doubles if you're not fighting.<br />
<br />
And even then, problems can arise, but need to test to see them.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Willpower mods and the such.<br />
Why not? :)<br />
Definately NOT use wis or int for it though. Stamina if anything, and Dex/Agi for monks and rogues if they get something similar.<br />
<br />
As well as Flowing Juice items ;p.... can't hurt to add a few effects to items that amelliorate juice regen.<br />
The balancing part here would be the hard part.<br />
<br />
And no buffs for juice.<br />
Buffs are meant to bring your character to higher levels depending on the classes that are with you....<br />
you don't want your ability to use Disciplines or to get Aggro to have to depend on other classes do you? :)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Could put it like this:<br />
<br />
Starting Willpower = 100<br />
<br />
once Stamina goes over 100:<br />
2 Stamina = 1 Willpower point.<br />
<br />
So getting maxxed Stamina will give you twice the Willpower you had at 100.<br />
<br />
You can put levels into this as well....<br />
for a end result where a level 65 with maxxed Stamina has around 3 times the willpower of a level 1 with less then 100 stamina.<br />
<br />
<br />
Amount of Willpower to use for a discipline : 90<br />
<br />
Amount of willpower to use for a Energy Surge : 10<br />
<br />
Willpower regeneration while fighting:  1/tick<br />
<br />
Willpower regeneration while sitting down: 3/tick<br />
(this avoids ridiculous downtimes, sit down and rest while the monk pulls.<br />
Only silly warriors that can't manage their juice will run OOJ)<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
While fighting, you will regenerate 100willpower within 10minutes.<br />
10minutes is the amount it takes to refresh your defensive skill.<br />
<br />
This keeps our discipline usage as is, for Xegony fight for example,<br />
where you fight over 30mins... you can still use evasive or defensive as usual, once every 10minutes, without running out of juice.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, I've posted this idea on the Paladin forum.<br />
And up till now, Ive only gotten positive feedback on it.<br />
<br />
Paladins like this fix for warriors it seems ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zandorf</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and Bunnie, you rock!  You have some of the best ideas ever!  This deserves a donkeh parade!<br />
<br />
Zan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An interesting fix.<br />
<br />
We wouldn't be slaves to the proc anymore, we'd be able to get snap agro, and warriors would actually mean something outside of a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamanor</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Improved Taunt : something that could happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
 This stuff : something that will never ever ever happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and why not?<br />
<br />
as I said, the juice part is already rumored to be in the works...<br />
<br />
stop keeping a narrow mind. If it's balanced, theres always a chance it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To the person who said this would never work.....  Lemme explain to you,  this would still give paladins / SK thier current aggro abilities,  and HP while allowing us,  if we manage it correctly to keep similiar,  slightly less perfect,  amount of aggro.    Decreasing our deficiency,  while keeping others in place,  and as for aggro,  still a large margin ahead,  and if discs are tied in,  it keeps paladins/ SK's happy,  because to manage the same level of aggro as them,  would destroy our ability to use any disc more than once,  therefore further evening the playing fields.   <br />
<br />
So please... tell me why this could never work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He didn't say it woudn't work. He said it would never happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cipps</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">couldn't we just make it the mana on items and ft = willpower for us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cipps, it would be bad that that happens...<br />
<br />
if mana makes you stronger... what warrior would want the manaless warrior only equipment?<br />
And who would want Raex armor?<br />
<br />
Mana was never meant for warriors, and should never be meant for them..... unless you want to add mana and int on every single equipment out there? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">read wrong... nm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea Bunnie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyloc Wormwood</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think its a great idea. to make it easyer for them to impliment just keep the juice stat for monk/rogue/warrior as Stamina (dont wanna make it to hard for them haha)<br />
bonus to &quot;juice&quot; should be placed on pure class armour and weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnaus</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very Very nice Idea. can add a little dis improvement too (+10 resists is a joke and some other reuses. but if we can win the Juice it will be a great step in warriors life !<br />
<br />
Thx for this fantastic idea !</div></div><hr />
