<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So we do another backflag run through Uqua last night.  Our last one was a month ago.  Several things were noticeably different:<br />
<br />
1. All the golem mobs now appear as 20' tall human male monks.<br />
2. Trap mobs appeared to be more split up, and moved slower<br />
3. Trap mobs in the spirit guardian room (after death room 2) spawned as human female monks (making them substantially easier to see).<br />
4. Our only deaths came from a few people who were new to the zone and didn't know better.<br />
<br />
Now, I know that we had more levels this time - our average has probably gone up to 68 since OoW released.  But Uqua has never, ever seemed easy before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was everyone seeing the models as Humans? That's usually a client-side issue when you don't have the proper models downloaded.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ryanosky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its the same other than the graphics bug.  We just beat it and had the first 5 mob trap charge us with selos and 3 stacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kharan_Zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its just a graphics bug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kezlar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's fixed now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Same, saw the giant sized human monks and was the topic in guild chat most of the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did it tonight.. everything seemed normal.  Well other then it seemed to be a tad bit easier... Barxt was still mean, about it tho.  Heard of one or 2 people talking about Human models, just figured they needed to patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slashy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shouldnt Uqua be a total joke now? I mean lev70, new spells, new AAs etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I could see it being easier than it was, but certainly not a total joke.  Less than a month with a new expansion, so you're probably not going to see a ton of the great gear/aa/spells yet.  F me if I'm wrong, but I don't think there's anything about 5 more levels and some spells that's super game-breaking.  When I think of that, I recall what PoP did to luclin endgame, specifically the &quot;new&quot; shaman disease slow on the previously unslowable emp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, regardless of levels your tanks/healers still have to be on their toes picking up trap pulls as they come in.  However, stuff like dps with new skill caps and champion on your raids melee dps will be a big increase though along with higher level/new aa's on tanks of course, still far from trivial though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Uqua became pretty easy when they decided to 'fix' it a couple of months ago.  Haven't been back to uqua in a few months, i can only imagine it's easier though since the last time I was there.</div></div><hr />

i dont' think they have made it easier, i just think it is the combonation of levels,spells,aa, and just knowing what to do.  We did a reflag as well for uqua and inkuta and both took around 2 hours to do for each of them. everything seemed the same for me for the most part besides maybe the models of the golems being changed.<br />
