Now to get 2 hb up.  Went from skill 35(all the training points I had left) to 120 and my normal group shaman tells me already I am to use no other weapon.  Thank you all bragging on this weapon, it truly is that good(and looks awesome too).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would love to have seen a Greatstaff of Thunder for 25-30k.  I would have bought it in a heartbeat. Hell, you should've bought it and sold it to me for a profit, hehe.<br />
<br />
Good hunting,<br />

After reading this I think I'll buy a GoT and switch between that and the Windblade in battles.<br />
<br />
Just hope I can pick up one for a reasonable price on my server, as I'm a bit short on plat at the moment.:(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soch Fizzler</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks .. how can I put this .. <br />
<br />
DUMB!<br />
<br />
But I managed to pick one up for 10k and that is a suprise after reading this thread.. especially since prices on Vallon seem to be way higher than the non pvp servers.<br />
<br />
I am somewhat impressed so far, I started with 2hb (27) and am now at 2hb (112) and able to maintain agro pretty easy already.<br />
<br />
The only part that pisses me off (other than its appearance) is that my friends tell me I paid 10k for a YAK! heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually like the way they look.  Large 2hb with a big ring on the end with a horn thru it(my descriptive skills lack).  I noticed since I got mine that the number of ninja inspects I get has risen dramatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My groupmates refer to it as a Bubblewand :)<br />

I noticed since I got mine that the number of ninja inspects I get has risen dramatically<br />
<br />
Ive noticed this also :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually I like the way it looks.  Very Warrior like.  I keep thinking of some Warrior finding a stick, a ring and a horn he got off some kill.  Then saying &quot;Hmm, I'll I take a belt, attach the horn to the ring and stick then go poke something with it&quot;<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually wear this around now and Ive been getting looks all over as well.  Its a weird looking weapon and people think you're uber for getting it.  I think theres gonna be a lot more folks wielding it soon.  Saw one in PoN the other night :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Icebladee</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have seen one once up in baz.  only once.  posted WTB on the server boards and got one from the high lvl gulid on my server.  anyways love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Story of how mine looks:<br />
<br />
Well you see, it used to look really sweet!  Well, one day I was running to a raid, late of course, and I wasn't paying attention!  Well dumb me tripped and got a mouth full of dirt!  To make things worse, my nifty looking bashing stick was broken.  Well, being late for the raid and all, I pulled out my lucky duck tape, and went to work.  Well, it's not pretty, but boy does it get the job done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me, it looks like a trophy they give you for killing a bard. Duct tape his horn to the end of a big stick.<br />
<br />
My only gripe about the darn thing is that you 'poke' with it, like a piercer. Same as all 2hb's, which just bugs me. If you goto the character select screen and turn off rotations, you can keep clicking your character to see what different battlemovements they do. When it cycles through and your toon is swinging the GSoT like it was a 2hs, it looks terrific ( Over-head smash style ). Wish they would fix that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like a mage staff to me, at least a mage in guild has a staff with the same graphic.<br />
Saw Wandor's mule trying to sell one for 2 days now on Terris with not much luck so far(and no, i am not interested-spending my plat to complete my clerics spellbook atm, rather successful as well). Just curious what you got for an upgrade on your warrior alt ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kodi</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey True Love!  You still got that GSOT for sale on TT?  If so send me a tell inagme, or I will send you one and maybe we can get a deal done on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten lots of tells asking for a link to my staff.. makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside :P<br />
<br />
I bought the first one I saw for sale on MM, saw one since then,  and haven't seen another person wielding one yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No upgrade for Moordian Gnomb, he still has his. I picked the one I am selling up in a trade. I am a little suprised it hasn't sold already considering the only other one I have seen lately was selling for 80k (worth every plat, but still ridiculous!). But then this week seems to be a bad selling week, took me a couple days to sell a PoFire player made 70mana bracer!!<br />
<br />
If you are interested in a GSOT Bubbamac, send me a tell I have one for sale and I am flexible on the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Come to BoT Baadan and you'll see me weilding one.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and that 80k GoT in bazaar was probably mine on my trader. I was bored one night and thought I'd see if anyone would want to buy it for some crazy amount hehe. I didnt want to really sell it anyway.</div></div><hr />
