<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, I am a level 46 war who is unguilded and plays in a regular group of all family, there is usually just four of us, (shm,clr,ench,war) but sometimes we invite others to our group.  I have quite a bit of plat saved up (100k) and can make it fairly fast as the war is my main, but my former main is a 65 wiz.  Here's my magelo, some recommendations would be great.  Also, I am on Stromm, so prices are high (as in 100k = 40k on a normal server), hehe, and the rarer items are almost non-existent.<br />
<br />
Telen's Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=867529) <br />
<br />
Also, I see conflicting info on ornate drops.  What is required to quest Ornate gear?  Just level 55 or is there flagging requirements?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions.  Really bored at work today and can't wait to get outta here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only suggestions I would make is to upgrade some of your non-hp items to items with hp.  Besides that, your plenty fine for quite some time.</div></div><hr />

But, but, it's burning a hole in my pocket.  :)  I think I'll start saving up for some ornate purchases for when I get higher level and look at replacing the pale steel bracer, the cobalt gloves, and the dragonspine vambraces with some items with hps.</div></div><hr />
