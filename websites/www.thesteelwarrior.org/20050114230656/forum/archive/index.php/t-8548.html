<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grumush</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi I just apped to a great bunch of guys that are workin into time atm.  Good people and I like they're style.  My question is (after backflagging is going on/done) what should I shoot for as gear as I go through the planes and into the early stages of time (if I do get accepted)  I would like the best bang for my buck so I dont have to upgrade each piece 3 or 4 times.  Bow is a no brainer.  Any suggestions?  We're also doin KT pretty heavy but I'm still workin flags for that.  I'll be doin nothin but backflags/ldons/aa/key farming for the next 3 weeks VERY heavy so nm the LDoN augs and aa's i'm missin in magelo they will come and i know wich to get.</div></div><hr />

Sure RZtW drops the BoW but good luck on that.  I also think that agnarr drops some decent earring but other than that I can't think of anything off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Once you get flagged for elementals try for plate armor molds mostly.  KT is much easier to get flagged for than elementals and accessories like rings / earrings / shoulders / mask and stuff are much better in GoD than in PoP.  If you can kill the KT named or the ikkinzi trial mobs, then you can get upgrades with single groups for a lot of slots in GoD that are far superior to elemental raid loots.</div></div><hr />

TZ drops a nice mask<br />
agnarr drops decent gauntlets earring and bow<br />
<br />
thats what i can think of for pre EP, once youre in EP theres pretty much stuff for every slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grumush</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My gear is in my magelo link.  I am working for KT flag, but we're also trying to get the guild eventually all flagged for time (they're at time VZ now).  I will definately look into getting the KT and gear from there/tipt/etc.   The augs and whatnot will be a good stab too.<br />
I guess what it boils down to,  Is that I have to get flaged for everything, what should I save my bids for that I won't be upgrading 5 times on the route through time/GoD.  I want nice bids for items i'll keep for a good while.  That way I can get needed gear for me and not detract from other up and comers in the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raex molds are a pretty safe bet.If you're going the distance with them I'd wait for molds for visual slots and fill the rest in time/god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree with Gunnar.  The items that go in non visual slots that drop in pre elem pop are just pretty much a joke.  You can buy much better stuff from players.  I cannot really think of one item that is a significant upgrade over the player made items.  About the only item that might be worth while, and its not even on planar progression, is the 20 AC 80 hp cloak from Munjuki or whatever his name is in the plane of Nightmares.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the elemental molds are worth shooting for, especially since the first phase of Time drops nice jewlery.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're getting into a guild nowadays that's just now breaking into Time, then you're looking at a guild that is primarily doing the following content:<br />
<br />
-Pantheon encounters<br />
-Plane of Fire<br />
-Plane of Earth/B<br />
-Working for Ikkinz<br />
<br />
Now, a lot of guilds don't stop doing the elementals the moment they reach Time.  They usually know that, in order to be initially successful with the Phase4 gods, that each member must be reasonably equipped.  At least on my server, many guilds who hit Time dabbled in the elementals for a good month or two afterwards, or until they finally defeated Quarm.  Not to say that they went after elemental mobs every waking moment, but if a full pop was up in Fire, for instance, they would be all over it.  Earth-B is very quick and very easy, so that would be included in the list tool, not to mention that a guild breaking into Time doesn't need 60+ to defeat these minis like a guild who just defeated Rallos Zek would.<br />
<br />
So, with that in mind, you'll probably want to look at loot, for the most part, found in these zones.<br />
<br />
-Raex molds are a given.  They will also be your #1 biggest upgrades.<br />
-Blade of War if you can get your hands on one.  From everything I have read, the Darkblade is incredibly rare.  Snagging a Blade of War would be a solid, wise, long-term investment.  :)<br />
-Clawed Earthcrafters Hoop cause you'll probably be doing EarthB a lot.<br />
-Drape of the Agile.  It's not a spectacular backslot, but you may it to be incredibly cheap if you're using a DKP system.<br />
<br />
Hmm, it's definitely 4:23am in the morning.<br />
