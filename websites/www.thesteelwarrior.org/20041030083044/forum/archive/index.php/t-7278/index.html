No offense but if the necro couldn't pull aggro off you they weren't trying to hard.  The amount of dmg / hate that goes along with dot stacking + nuking is pretty nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malikae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">but some like Yak for slight DPS increase<br />
<br />
Nobody cares about a warrios DPS. No matter what you do, your at the bottom. Caring about your DPS is a waste of thought. I have never had a warrior invited to any group because of DPS. No one is impressed by damage procs. <br />
<br />
Now on the topic, If you have a weapon you KNOW your keeping a long time, then anger III that weapon.  The one your talking about is ok, but is easily replaced. Thats alot of points to basically throw away if you only have it a few months. If you get that weapon you half a long time, anger III is the bomb. Again, damage proc = who cares. Its all about agro. Anger procs are unresistable, and will make a mob stick on you like you insulted his mommy. If I get an anger proc to land as i start attacking a mob, tash, slow and necros initial DoT never draws agro off me.  And the group notices that, lemme tell ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dethvegi, your post had nothing to do with the question asked.  Unless you have something directly relevent to add, the only other reason for your post is to make you feel better for some odd reason.  And yes the necro was trying hard, not that that really matters in this particular instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lifeburn is nearly 0 aggro in my experience, same as mana burn. <br />
<br />
I don't mean to insult you, but I have to agree with deathvegi...if a necro couldn't pull aggro off you, he didn't know WTF he was doing. Using a BoW with anger 3, and added Aten gloves stun proc, and weapon affinity 4, necro's are the class that most often steals aggro from me on raids. BTW, I have nearly all the relavent offensive AA's for a 2h...PB maxed, Flurry 5, Fero maxed, etc.<br />
<br />
**edit**<br />
<br />
Forgot to add my response to the original question~<br />
<br />
I'd go with anger on your CHoS and off hand the Duk. Another thing to consider, is how long till you think you'll get a GOOD viable upgrade to the CHoS? If a BoC is only a few months away for you, I'd go with anger 2 on the CHoS unless you just have LDoN points to burn. If it'll be quite a while before you see a BoC, HG, GBoS...then slap an anger 3 on the CHoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I rarely had agro issues with the ykesha procs, even got tells how i was doing it from our nukers occasionally.<br />
One was chain nuking from 95% mob health (druid) and only was summoned (but didnt die as i successfully taunted at the moment) at enrage -  poe 1 boss mob i think it was.<br />
But still depends a lot on the mobs too.<br />
I remember some deaths of the mt on poe rings when i played my cleric and it usually was the rogues and monks before the wizards who got summoned and splattered and i dont think anyone will claim they can outdamage a wizard at that point of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and im gonna agree with deathvegi, theres no way that could hold aggro off a necro and wizzy trying . you say only time you lost it was on a crit but crits are the same amount of aggro as a regular hit. aggro is based off potential damage, not damage done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i've got a yak auged gsofw (better than anger2) and and anger3 Boc and anger3 GBoS ... with weapon affinity 2.  a wizard with 40ish aa's (short fights only) or a necro with ZERO aa can take aggro from me if they try and are being stupid.  take the bullshit somewhere else plz, cause i doubt anyone really believes ya.   :eek: <br />
<br />
that said, i would go with a yak augment.  its the same price as an anger2 augment but <br />
<br />
1. its more aggro than an anger2<br />
2. you DO get some extra dmg out of it<br />
<br />
the knockback is minimal at best.  its not even worth thinking about.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS-  i'm confused as to why somebody would make up stuff ... its not like any warrior here worth their stuff wouldnt see right through that claim.  I can say i solo'd quarm all day long .. but that sure doesnt mean i actually did it .. or that anybody would believe it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh hell no.  There's a 0sec stun on Yak, which is the reason a warrior would ever use it.  A ranger with Yak augs is the same as a warrior trying to fight for aggro off of a Copper hammer wielding ranger/monk.  Those procs get attention.<br />
<br />
If a ranger wants a proc, they should go for the straight DD ones.  They'll get a higher DD as well, and won't have the 0sec stun portion that causes the aggro.</div></div><hr />

I beg to differ on the issue of a warrior doing DPS - if you choose the right AA and weapons you can do a significant amount and augs that give both aggro and DPS are a big plus.  I do keep a big 2 hander with Anger 3 for when a raid demands it - but if we are talking about everyday use I say buy the Ykesha augs and save the difference for HP or AC augs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could not agree any better.  I would not suggest auging anger 3 on a weapon that is worth less than the aug.   Yak aug will do fine, you can even try a yak + anger 2 combination to see which one you like better since you dual wield, and then put the better augged weapon u like in the main hand. <br />
<br />
As far as the previous post about out aggroing shk/paly or necro, from my experience that is bull crap.  Assuming outaggroing meant maintaining aggro at all time on your mob no matter what spells others cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have used a variety of things. I wasted alot of ldon points in this order<br />

Blackout + strike of ykesha<br />
BBB + force of ykesha<br />
Bloodfrenzy + force of ykesha<br />
Bloodfrenzy + anger3<br />
Blade of Carnage + anger3<br />
<br />
When you get a weapon you are going to use for a long time as an agro/tanking weapon get anger3 on it. It is worth the time.<br />
<br />
If you have a weapon that... <br />
a) you want for multi purpose <br />
b) not going to use for that long <br />
c) just need to aug with something because you don't have the time for ldons for quite awhile<br />
...then go with a ykesha.<br />
<br />
Right now I have Bloodfenzy + anger3, and Blade of Carnage + anger3 and wa5 (all dps aa except pop crits, dr and ss). I love my agro. Really allows to control a situation. Wizards go oom when I am tanking without getting agro unless they use stuns. Necros with burning affliction4, ID4 etc and all the right spells can still take agro in the right situation if they don't use feign death.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is off topic, but I am very interested in knowing how you are holding up with aggro mainhand +stormrider carpace.  I have read through pages and pages about that shield, and everyone is either for it or against it.  However after looking at people's magelo, it seems that people whos use that setup seem to have a pretty strong primary aggro weapon to offset the difference in minor lost of aggro with the shield.  I do not think the shield is usrless but bash generated hate has not been parse so I can not assigned it a value,.  If my theory is correct, and if you do plan on using that shield, perhaps you should use a better aggro weapon in primary such as boc with anger 3 or gbos(cheaper) anger3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i recently tanked LMM, bert, Agnarr, RD etc.<br />
<br />
these are the only situations other than GoD trials in a pinch where the shield comes in handy.<br />
<br />
generally i:<br />
<br />
1. furious<br />
2. defensive/stonewall<br />
3. Toss shield in offhand after disc falls<br />
<br />
the 3 minutes has let me build up some major hate, and the 5 procs i get per min mainhand (with WA2) always tides me over to the end, even when casters start letting the nukes fly.<br />
<br />
i buff out to 9k while buffed to max.  after defensive falls, i cant afford to use duel wield against mobs that hit for 2k, as a full bad round + riposte might 1round me ... especially when the mob has a proc/nuke like LMM.  chances are i'd be fine without it, but its nice to toss up 100 more ac and 80 more hps when you know you arent gonna lose aggro.<br />
<br />
i would never use the shield EVER unless there was a chance that i could die.  the only GoD trial i have whipped it out in is tipt/vxed.  we have an enchanter pet so pulls are dead in under 15 seconds anyways.  its not like the aggro i can generate there matters hardly at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Just because it never happened to y'all doesn't mean it couldn't have happened particularly in a one shot deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I could see in a one shot deal if you used furious on inc then followed up with some offensive disc you would hold aggro through ONE fight with a hell of a lot of luck, but making your initial claim is rather deceitful.  one fight scenerios can not even begin to verify a claim like that ... and i doubt either of your caster friends could have tried all their tricks in 1 short fight.  the poster came asking for advice and you blew smoke up his ass saying anger2 was omgyzers fookin LEETZORZ ... yeah ... anger2 and a gsofw are decent aggro but theyre not as amazing as you might think they are.  plz just be honest.  i dont dislike you but it really jerks my chain when people claim they can do the near-impossible without even the tools to come close.<br />
<br />
you cannot and will not every be able to hold aggro off of a necro with 300 aa's who really really just wants to have your aggro.  maybe with a DBoTWL , Raex bp ...  EoE ... maybe with anger3, thule, and an aggro debuffer on the necro ... with a 20 second head start ... you could pull it off ... but it aint gonna happen otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">(double post sorry)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Apolyon, for some reason you've made this your personal vendetta.   I never claim that my set up was the end all.  In fact I distincly stated that I wasn't getting anger III until I got a BoW.  A remark you seemed to just brush aside.<br />
<br />
I just stated the facts of an event that occured.  BEFORE I auged the GSot4W the self same necro bitched at me about getting the aug because I kept on losing agro to him.  So AFTER I auged it (I was saving up for new boots, which is neither here nor there) he wanted to see what it would do.  After he had satisfied himself with my agro, that was that.  I didn't claim multiple instances, I said tested, singular past tense, not plural.  I never claimed that I never lost agro to a necro or wizard ever again.  I didn't realize I had to right a novel to not be denigrated.<br />
<br />
The reason I told the poster about my anger II is because I wouldn't waste points for anger III on the GSot4W and I definately wouldn't waste those points auging the wep he mentioned.   Again, my comment about not getting Anger III until I got a BoW.  However, you continue to read what you want to into it, and take it to the next level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">This board has been a great help to me in learning how to tank.When Stromm first opened I had only been playing a cpl months casually on Tunare and was a complete newb so to speak.I ma for an  guild now  that clears ep's routinely save for the pantheon god's( so far we've only attempeted Fennin... got him first try weee :) ).Of course I'm just a small ,easily replaced cog in the wheel ;we have a fantastic raid leader and a guild filled with great people.However,I know what little I do in part to Steelwarrior and the old timers who have contributed to this board.Sooo claims and opinions made here are subject to critical evaluation for good and bad reasons.The good reasons are reason enough though.<br />
<br />
Regarding equipping for aggro has an ma;it always comes down to the group or raids output around you.Maybe time and god tanks can magically always lock aggro,but, I doubt it.I Tank named encounters almost every time since we broke into ep's and my aggro is usually very good.Theres a lot of people who could pull aggro at our raids if they chose or were not a little careful how they applied themselves.My wizards have told me they can open up pretty fast in xp groups and raids now and I rarely see them summoned in a normal fight even chain nuking tho this wasn't always the case.Now a necro imho has insane aggro.I think there are raids now when they've started a lil slow and i've been procing well that they can go all out later in the fight.My regular xp group is a shammy,cleric,necro and myself.Yeh , using taunt and procing well i can sometimes out aggro him if he doesn't go hard off the bat.Of course that involves luck in taunts(stacking on his hate) and proccing well.I wouldn't have a chance on red mobs.A lot of people pump out a lot more hate then a warrior can hope too and from what I've seen at my level of the game necros are &gt;all.<br />
<br />
Sooo, what it comes down to is being able to do your job as best you can.You won't ever have enough aggro before Time imo and should plan out some reasonable setups to shoot for and aug.I like anger 3 but anger 2 or yak augs make sense on weapons that you need now ,but ,will be outgrowing shortly.The chos and sotb are easily gotten weapons by raid tanks until they win better that justify anger 2/yak augs imo and work well for young guilds.Alot of combos can be made to work.Anger 3 on most anything makes it a viable tanking weapon for ep people,but, I don't see the sense in short changing yourself.I'd only a3 a weapon with an innate proc that I would tank with.As far as shields go, I've found them so far to be lacking in the aggro dept and not worth dropping my offhander for.This may change in Time and certainly they have situational use.<br />
<br />
What works ok on a raid or in an xp group is highly dependant on the people you're playing with.Their firepower and the need to exert it quickly will play a large role in whether your aggro production is great , lacking,or something in between.If you want to be a strong raid tank I would always error to the side of greater aggro within reason.Sorry, if you've found this longwinded or misplaced.<br />
<br />
 1)Tharak, I'd anger 2 the chos and eventually offhand it with an auged eb weapon.If you really want to use the shield a3 the chos ,tho it's a lot of points for something you will probably upgrade soon.Auging a weapon with an innate high aggro proc is the right move.<br />
<br />
2) A good Necro of equal power will out aggro a warrior if they desire.Tuant and assist delay can mitigate this.They produce a lot more raw hate tho.I have won brief aggro fights with my necro friend,but, it involved luck and timing.A suggestion that we could lock aggro against a raid of casters is false imo.Especially one with necros hehe.<br />
<br />
3) The CHOS never gave me any significant problems with push when i used it to ma.<br />

Here is the problem. There is no way, that a good or even an average necro and wizzy with 300 and 200 aa doing &quot;all the tricks they could think of&quot; would not take agro from you.<br />
<br />
You need to suck it up on this one; you exaggerated the story and got carried away. The lie was BS. They did they normal casting nothing special, and you held agro with the exception of an early crit. Which is entirely possible, especially with incite. But don't tell people they tried all the tricks they could think of, because it just isn't true. <br />
<br />
For the most part people weren’t even hard on you. It is easy to embellish a story, but some really want to learn and fudged facts don’t help them.</div></div><hr />

beyond that tho, it does seem that some people come here and post BS thinking they look cool or something. apparently the guy that tried to answer my question about augs had never even looked at what slots his own augs were in /shrugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Obviously it all depends, but my wizzy can take aggro of my warrior (DBotW currently unauged with BoC offhand and also unaugged) no problems depending on the situation.

<br />
Heck I have harder time getting aggro off of my shammy once slow and my standard 3 baseline DoTs are stuck (when shammy pulling) :)<br />
<br />
And yeah I know, get some damn augs, warrior needs like 2 LDoNs for Anger 3 (need theme pts not total) for mainhand but want to get his feet fixed first  and LDoN is currently only real option for me :o</div></div><hr />

I heard this rumor, but I really don;t think it is true. I know crit weapon attacks don;t generate more agro, but when i strugggled with agro over a good wizzy. I was useing gsot and some offensive aa, i swear when i lost agro it happened much more often on crits, same with heavy nuking druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Been tested, crits aren't any additional agro. Hate is based on base spell damage, not the amount of damage actually done. Check out the agro thread on graffe's for the details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I have NEVER posted a lie here.  To go back on what I said here would be a lie.  I'm sorry if y'all don't like the facts.  They stand as they are.   If I have said that after the wizard critted (in the middle of chain nuking) and once I regained agro (which wasn't instantaneous), I furioused, people still wouldn't have believed me it would seem.  However I was just trying to answer the question, and not write a novella.  Both the necro and wizard were happy with my agro after the test.  That's all I know.</div></div><hr />
