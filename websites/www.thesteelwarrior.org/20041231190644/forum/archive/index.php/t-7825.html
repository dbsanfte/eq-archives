<br />
<br />
 It's official for me.  I no longer take focus, and use this buff exclusively. The 36AC is FAR more valuable to me than the extra 200hp.    <br />
<br />
  Brutall and I both responded asking for details, and my currently unanswered comment is this:<br />
<br />
<br />
  I agree with Brutall. Please to be giving up the l33t infoz, Frodlin! I remember this subject coming up some time before on TSW and no definitive answer turning up. I tend to rate ac highly compared to hp using a 1ac = 6hp conversion formula, but 36 visible ac is the equivalent of a 22ac item, for a drop of 244hp. That's a 1ac = 11hp conversion formula to just break even between the two buffs. This is, to some extent, an all or nothing sorta deal; that is, either all armor and buff tradeoffs should be done at this sort of formula or none should. It seems a tad too extreme in favor of ac, though I would very much welcome the information you came across to make your decision. <br />
<br />
  Any chance of a followup?</div></div><hr />

  This was a thread about focus vs arcane shielding. Wtf does speed of the shissar have to do with anything? It's not a hp vs ac tradeoff...</div></div><hr />

But that isn't a hp vs ac tradeoff, because there is no hp on other haste. It's a good idea, just kinda off topic because it doesn't involve ac vs hp. I have to admit that I don't make that particular tradeoff though, so I'm glad it was brought to my attention  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on the best data available on AC and damage mitigation, which is the various parses shown by Brael throughout GoD, the following hypothesis can be made which seems to be supported.<br />
<br />
AC provides a &quot;range of linearity&quot; in which the value of AC at the low end has no real advantage based on mob atk.   Once in the range of &quot;effective linearity&quot; the advantage to AC seems to follow a very consistent rise, until we assume it eventually levels off (this is semi-confirmed by Kahvok's post confirming the existence of a 'softcap', which has yet to be found, even up to the 3kAC levels.   <br />
<br />
Hitpoints are only a valid factor in mitigation when they are completely renewed at a given interval, or on the very rare instances when you are &quot;purpled&quot;.   The value of additional hitpoints declined substantially when the Complete heal spell had a cap placed on it.  The value of hitpoints declined even more substantially when faster, incomplete heals such as holy light became the order of the day.     The value of 200 hitpoints that are not constantly refreshed becomes much lower than a scaleable benefit that adjusts itself with a mob's DI number.<br />
<br />
Let me give an example.   <br />
<br />
If the average DI goes down by say... 0.2 with 36AC, then with a mob with a 50 DI (quite common in GoD), you save 2.5 points average per hit, but what's most important is that mob damage doesn't go down by 2.5 point intervals but by DI=1 intervals.   Any net gain tends to mean that you take a few 50 point less hits, which pays off over time.   As the DI figure goes up, the benefit of AC goes up as well.   Hitpoints remain a constant, and unless they're constantly refreshed, their value is that of a &quot;reserve&quot;.  While a 'reserve&quot; is certianly valuable, at the point where we're referring to, which is GoD content, Vxed+ in particular, there is a reasonable assumption that with the gear, the hitpoints on gear are already factored in.    <br />
<br />
If I give myself an additional 200 hitpoints and buff to 11,800hp instead of 12,000 hitpoints, that's a 1.7% increase that doesnt' scale, that isn't &quot;always on&quot; (in other words, I don't always use those 200hp unless I come within 200hp of death, which rarely if ever happens) and which dont' necessarily get refreshed when healed, EVEN WITH complete heal.    If I give myself 36AC, it's &quot;always on&quot;, the benefit is not one that relies upon refreshment to see any value, and it scales with the DI number, providing greater benefit as the mob's DI number increases.<br />
<br />
Putting a &quot;AC=X hitpoints&quot; number onto anything is not a wise choice, because there's too many variables in too many situations to make that meaningful.    Doing an &quot;AC= X hitpoints&quot; has always been foolish, but assuming that you did so, it is simply crazy to apply velious era calculations (1AC = 6hp) to today's EQ when exp mobs have DI numbers that eclipse raid mobs in that expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand what you're saying, Frodlin, but I don't understand the following:<br />
what's most important is that mob damage doesn't go down by 2.5 point intervals but by DI=1 intervals. Any net gain tends to mean that you take a few 50 point less hits, which pays off over time.The number of one-DI-less hits is going to produce a reduction of average damage equal to 0.2 DI = 2.5 hp, isn't it? So the 20-step hit distribution provides you with no advantage compared to a per-hp distribution, or compared to any other distribution that has 2 or more steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets say there is 12000 HP and 2200AC buffed tank without buffs we are testing<br />
<br />
36/2200 ac = 1.6% increase in AC<br />
200/12000 = 1.6% increas in HP<br />
<br />
With HP there is more of a chance you will survive a lucky round, with AC the chances of lucky round are lessened.<br />
<br />
I mean regardless you are going to get healed at same rate thought on non trival mobs. I think AC and HP increase should be compared by percentages whatever is bigger is better. Thats that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I see what you're saying Frod, but let me rephrase it back at you to see if I got it right.<br />
<br />
  Most warriors, especially at the high end, have sufficient hp to not be one rounded. They also have sufficient hp to NOT be healed to full every time a heal comes. Therefore, the hitpoints over the amount needed for basic survival only comes into play when the mob lowers your hp within the difference between the sacrificed hp and the current hp. That is, it only really matters when the hp you gave up would have been enough to save you from death.<br />
<br />
  Because hp beyond a certain minimum isn't ALWAYS affecting your tanking ability, ac becomes more important because it has an impact on every hit. Therefore, added ac after that minimum hp is much, much more useful than added hp.<br />
<br />
  Was that what you were saying, more or less?<br />
<br />
Putting a &quot;AC=X hitpoints&quot; number onto anything is not a wise choice, because there's too many variables in too many situations to make that meaningful. Doing an &quot;AC= X hitpoints&quot; has always been foolish, but assuming that you did so, it is simply crazy to apply velious era calculations (1AC = 6hp) to today's EQ when exp mobs have DI numbers that eclipse raid mobs in that expansion. <br />
<br />
  Naturally, there are a nigh infinite number of variables when it comes to tanking. What the 1ac = 6hp I use is attempting to do is give an easily accessible and applied generalization for choosing between gear. This is mostly relevent at the middle game, where people have a very large selection of gear. Of course it doesn't cover all situations and circumstances; it's a generalization for a reason. The question is, is it good enough? Do you have a better formula for a narrower crowd? Newton's laws are generalizations, for example... but unless an object's velocity is approaching that of the speed of light, it's good enough. I'm sure my formula isn't accurate enough for everyone, but I simply don't have anything better to offer. It SEEMS to work reasonably well, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Arch Shielding over Focus at times, for much the same reason Frodlin mentioned, although Warriors hit the point sooner due to higher HP.  What good do extra HP do you when you're rarely using them?  In order for the jump between 12k and 13k to make a difference for example you have to be sub 1k HP often.  This will rarely be the case (the times you're under 8% hp to be exact).  Having additional AC however will help you alot by reducing occasional hits by a a DI level or two.<br />
<br />
In Frodlins case, because AC will always work in the time it takes for the additional HP to be used he would have conserved far more hp.  Thus lowering the amount of healing required for him (meaning faster killing in raids by having more dps or more healing mana aviable in groups) and would be less likely to die to a spike because they would be less common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do remember: Ac still only adds incremental bonuses. I wouldn't say &quot;because AC will always work in the time it takes for the additional HP to be used he would have conserved far more hp.&quot; Ac is significant, but the tradeoff, especially in this case, is still minor. It's unlikely that he would have conserved many more hp at all, frankly, by choosing arcane shielding over focus. <br />
<br />
  One reason why hp is still so important over the minimum required is due to spikes. A few bad rounds, which is always possible, could have the healer casting a late heal. Hp is always best in the worst case scenario; ac makes that worst case scenario come less often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my bag on the issue:<br />
<br />
If its a boss mob and it aint gonna 1-round you ... ac is more important.  Once you have 11k+ hps, unless youre fighting a mob quick quads for 4k, its my opinion that you'll see more help from he ac.<br />
<br />
Until you get your hps up to the safety zone tho ... you better we working on it ...<br />
<br />
In the end does it matter?  36ac vs 200hps?  neither are going to make the difference btw pass and fail.<br />
<br />
That said: My ac sucks  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up valuing AC &gt; HP because AC is a lot harder to find.<br />
<br />
Compare SoL -) VT -) EP -) Time -) GoD<br />
The AC differences are very small for many pieces of armor.<br />
<br />
Example :<br />
Rings Velious = 30/100 30/100<br />
Rings Luclin = 25/125 30/100<br />
Rings PoP = 18/145 30/150<br />
Rings Time = 35/195  32/210<br />
Rings GoD = 34/225 25/240<br />
<br />
Try : Helms, Necks, Earrings, Legs, Belts, Cloacks, BP, Range, Masks, Arms, Bracers.<br />
<br />
You will get my point. AC is a bitch to find. And if you actually compare  PoP / Time / GoD.<br />
The AC difference will be rather small, while the HP gap will be immense.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how this would work for scaling up ... <br />
2000/10000 to 3000/10000  2000/15000 ?<br />
<br />
The death of CH the rebirth of spam healing.<br />
Make this ever worse. Because you can see the problem 2 ways :<br />
- More AC = Less DPS = Overlapping heals become less dangerous since you take less dmg<br />
- More HP = More buffer = Maximizing heals, no more &quot;Has healed you for 589 points of dmg&quot;<br />
<br />
Spikes are a non factor , since 1 rounding is impossible.<br />
And DI is here to cover most of the &quot;Oooops&quot; situations.<br />
<br />
I went down the road &quot;Ac is harder to find, so because its rare, it should be powerfull&quot;.<br />
Stupid ? Maybe, but it served me well.<br />
<br />
PS : 1 Rounding is a myth exept for 2 or 3 mobs EQ wide (Raperm &amp; Quarm for example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically when I reach a HP effectiveness softcap of 12K I should start using SotA over focus?<br />
<br />
Just trying to make sure I be understanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye,younger tanks should keep in mind the advantage of ac over hp becomes a stronger factor as the likelyhood of &quot;onerounding&quot; diminishes.If you have a reasonable cushion for your healers to keep you up through a round of max hit's(this is unlikely to happen of course) and whatever added damage is involved(procs etc.) then more hp is only extra insurance.At this point more ac pays out extra insurance and mitigation.<br />
<br />
So the ratios people apply to hp/ac are misleading.It's really dependant upon your total hp measured against the  content you are tanking.Most tanks doing xp mobs will see greater returns from ac and so will most raid offtanks given efficient healing.Most young tanks (not twinks) crawling up through to ep content need more hp,though, the new GOD aa probably has affected this a little.Of course it's better to have both ,a balance is important.<br />
<br />
Bad rounds will happen a lot more often with lower ac,but, if you have the hp to stand through it the heal will land anyways.With higher ac ,but, too low of hp for the target the bad round that comes less frequently will kill you.Or at least fire di hehe....risky.So Frodlins buff choices make sense for him,but, probably not the average young tank doing aow for the first time.<br />
<br />
Imo ac is kewler. :) However,the demands of your target measured against your tank and healing determine the best ratio of hp/ac.I think I said somewhat what Frod did in a dumber way hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your first supposition is correct... they'll have similar benefits &quot;at the crucial point&quot;.    The point I'm making is when NOT at the crucial point, AC continues to see a benefit while HP are unused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't main tank every raid mob obviously but I've done enough of it to get a reasonable grasp on what type of HP you would be wanting before focusing on AC.  In time I felt that 9500 hp was more than sufficent for anything (hell I did Quarm with that even) and more just seemed to be cushion, in Inkuta Ive felt that 10.5k was enough, currently I sit at 12k and unless I get seriously mauled on a pull I never make use of that additional HP regardless of what I'm tanking, it's AC that saves me (hell, I've done clay monoliths with 2 shaman healers only when Warriors with far lower ac but equal HP would get completly mauled with multiple cleric healers).  The best case I see for additional HP is if you're rampage tanking or tanking multiple mobs at once (espically mobs with AE's), if you take a spike and drop under 25% hp getting summoned/mauled by multiple mobs is a very real threat (not to mention it moving all the mobs around), even with that though going for more mitigation and getting to atleast minimum sufficent HP off of that gear seems to be the best way to go with tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to make clear:<br />
<br />
The 6:1 rule of thmb is just that. I don't think that extensive testing has gone into it, and if it has, by now its outdated.<br />
<br />
AC &gt; HP is only true once you are well above the 7500 Complete Heal cap. If your cleric can't consistantly get a cleric to heal you for 7000+ (without lots of death) keep the rule of thumb. <br />
<br />
Once you start to out grow CH's (or ICHs) the value of AC in creases because it will take 2 or more heals to fill you.<br />
<br />
If you are like me--5100/1335 unbuffed. I am not yet consistantly even beening healed for 5k on CHs  the rule of thumb still applies. I suspect that break point for HP being less valuable is 9k+. For us mear mortals, HP still have reletively high value vs AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Frodlin, I don't have enough information to either agree or disagree with you. But I wanted to add some observations.<br />
<br />
The Developers comments hint at the existance of a softcap. We have not apparently established where it is vs. any mob. We suspect it interacts with a mob's attack indirectly.<br />
<br />
When I look at parses, I see a lot of hits for minimum or near minimum. I buff out at around 2300AC. There is a limit even concentrating on AC how high I can obtain.<br />
<br />
Muddying the AC water is the importance of Avoidance.<br />
<br />
At the same time, when tanking a mob, I see my HP's move around, and ocassionally DI even goes off. To my mind a good HP reserve serves an important function. I buff out at around 12200HP's and with raid healing on some mobs DI goes off. That 100 HP, 95 HP, etc. aug looks pretty darned good under the circumstances. I'm fairly convinced my survival would go up if I could hit 13k HP's. Extra healing just means my tank is full more.<br />
<br />
I tend to believe you must have it all Avoidance, AC, and HP's. The mob gets a lucky streak and quads for near max twice in a row, you best have a good sized reserve and be full HP's or you are deads0r. It happens.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a lot of you are forgetting that AC is more useful than HP because most people already have a lot of HPs.  The effect of AC 'HP' is essentialy HP / (1-% mitigated).<br />
<br />
In the end just wear the equipment your class is supposed to use and things will take care of themselves.  Don't take some leather bracer with 20 less AC just because it has 100 more HP, for example.  If you can afford to not get some HPs you can also afford not to have some AC.  The effective of HP and AC is cumulative anyway.  AC works because you've all that HP to benefit mitigation from.  Consider there is virtually no high AC raid gear that's without HP but plenty of high HP gear without AC, it obviously makes more sense to concentrate on AC first.  If the choice was say, 30 AC 200 HP or 50 AC 0 HP, what would you choose?  Yeah, 50 AC 0 HP looks right on paper, but have you thought about what happens if all your gear is 50 AC 0 HP?  You'd die to a mob that hits min for 4 times in one round.  Since there is no such kind of tradeoff that exists in EQ, picking AC is very safe, but you shouldn't have to give up your right arm for it.<br />
<br />
And BTW, Clay Monoliths don't exactly do that much damage if they're slowed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They do enough when slowed to be pretty hard for a Knight to tank with 2 shaman healers only... it's a good example of the value of AC, 2 shaman don't even equal 1 cleric in raw healing power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW dont forget a very important thing : AC is &quot;partially useless&quot; because of the BD.<br />
<br />
If you assume (like i often do for gear selection), That 10% more HP = 10% more AC<br />
you ignore the fact that AC doesnt give total benefits.<br />
<br />
10% More HP, means you will need 10% more DMG to die.<br />
10% More AC, doesnt mean you will take 10% less DMG. <br />
<br />
That could work with overall linearity &amp; equal benefits.<br />
But on a theoretical lvl that its flawed just because of the DB.<br />
And we have no clue is AC benefits are linear (they seem to be so far however).<br />
<br />
I'm at 2300/10000 , and i've been wondering since the day GoD come out.<br />
What would work better ?  <br />
10% more AC : Making me a more efficient tank DPS wise taking less dmg.<br />
10% more HP : Making me less vulnerable to &quot;ooops&quot; having more room for mistakes.<br />
<br />
It ends up as the dilema : More efficient tanking vs More room for mistakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given how itemization works, it is simply not possible to go for 10% HP over 10% AC because the gear with 10% AC will probably have 10% more HP as well unless you consciously made a choice to wear equipment not designed for your class (i.e. you wear all/all or all/melee items with leather/silk AC).  The advantage of HP is its reliability.  It is always there against every form of damage:  melee, AE, procs, etc.  AC is only good against melee, and while it is generally much better versus melee than HP, melee isn't the whole picture of survival.<br />
<br />
But like I said, you'll be hard pressed to come up with any AC upgrades that doesn't improve your HPs unless you consciously choose to wear non-plate items.  For example Raex is like 45 AC 145 HP or so and Vadd is 50 AC 220 HP.  Unless you choose to wear a chain or leather bracer from Time, you always end up upgrading both evenly anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are other augments than just LDoN purchasable ones, and there is more than 1 gear choice. Non-visible slots tend to be defined less solidly by class, and sometimes you won't have the chance at the optimal piece you want. You just might end up with that leather bracer compared to a chain bracer because the plate one just doesn't drop. <br />
<br />
  You've stated, Phantron, that 10ac &gt; 20hp. Is 10ac &gt; 100hp? If not, where between 20 and 100hp does the value lay? If it is, is 10ac &gt; 500hp? By giving one hard value tradeoff, you lead to others and therefore a formula. It's just the way it works, unless you want to base your gear choice off of emotion or randomness.</div></div><hr />

I am thinking more and more listening to everyone that you can not make it a set 1:6 AC:HP though. You can say that when your HPs are between a certain amount and say your Ac is between a certain amount. But if you come to a point where you have alot of HP and AC is still not that high then AC should be more important and vise versa. Just still not sure what that formula is that you can plug your current AC in and current HP in and see what your ratio should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It means roughly that after tanking time mobs 50000 times take for example innoruk who is a fairly long fight in respect to the rest of time.  Every ac figure that i have tested recently gives me about 2.8 hps worth of mitigation.  Assume cheals hit every 2 seconds and the mob deals 1200 dps.  In 2 seconds the mob does about 2400 damage on average.  Each ac i do cuts dps by 1.4 or 2.8 hps per cheal cycle.  These are only rough numbers, on some parses i get 2-3 reduction in dps per ac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the same CH interval, on a 2 second delay, each AC point results in roughly 1.4 hiptoints less damage taken per second against Innorruuk based on the size of the heals?   How does it fare with other mobs?   I've never really used this methodology before since while it sheds some light, the 2 second CH interval would need to be pretty precise to conclude anything, and I must admit, my clerics arent' the most precise timers on earth.</div></div><hr />

Get your HP AA's, and AE Taunt.    In gear selection, don't skimp on AC for ANYTHING.</div></div><hr />

IMO, I'd go with the defensive AAs first, but so many people debate it that you will hear many different ways to do it, when to get AETaunt, when to get PE, etc etc.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion is to CA1, CS1, ND1, CA2, CS2, PE, ND2, CA3, CS3, ND3.<br />
Once you finish up your archetype/class, move up to Planar Power, then sturdiness.<br />

People will disagree with me, though :)</div></div><hr />

Arbitrary numbers here, but if ND3 provides you with 400 extra HP at 65 thats one (or less) max hits off most mobs you will be tanking.  Whereas CA3 potentially allows you to avoid 400 or more damage in between heals.  If you avoid one max hit in between heals, on a mob suitable for your level, then you're likely going to exceed the benefit of ND3.<br />
