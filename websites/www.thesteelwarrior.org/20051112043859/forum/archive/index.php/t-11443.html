<br />
I was in Uldaman the other night with a so-so group.  The group was me (lvl 41 warrior), mage, mage, priest, paladin.  The paladin was a level lower than I was, so I became the defacto puller/tank.<br />
<br />
The paladin was slow.  Never healed, even himself.  The priest was amazing.  One of the mages was pretty good, though he couldn't control his aggro.  The other mage was a bit off his rocker.<br />
<br />
Anyways, we get into the trogg area with only a little fuss.  The mages worked out a system of which mobs they would polly, I pulled/tanked, the paladin did whatever (off tank mainly), and the priest healed.  And then the 2nd mage says, &quot;Mencar, use assist.&quot;<br />
<br />
My response... &quot;Who am I assisting?&quot;  The group all responds, &quot;You're the tank, we're supposed to assist you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Apparently the 2nd mage was upset that I kept hitting his sheep.  But then I pointed out that he was sheeping the mob that I was already fighting!<br />
<br />
Fun fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-02-2005, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is one lesson I have learned in WoW that was much less of an issue in EQ.<br />
<br />
Pickup groups suck. Harcore.<br />
<br />
I have met more morons/idiots/whatever in 4 months of WoW than I did in 4 years of Everquest. Granted, I've done a few pickup lbrs/DM/strath 5-mans that were damn good, as well as the occasional pickup strath/scholo raid, but on the whole, pickup groups usually have at least 1 incompetent member. If it's the priest, you're screwed. If it's the tank, you're usually screwed (I play a warlock in WoW, no longer a warrior =/ )<br />
<br />
But yeah, as a warlock, I get to seduce/banish mobs for crowd control. I also Curse of Doom said mobs (when we pull 3+) to do basically a free 3200 nuke. You have no idea how many times the mob that is Doom'ed is the first or second to die. It's like people see the curse of doom, and can't help but attack it just so it dies in less than a minute. Most annoying thing in WoW so far for me.<br />
<br />
For tough pulls, pretargeting works wonders. As a tank, you'll generally also pull, which means you're the guy who tells people what to target. Mages pollying your mob deserve a talking-to. Mages using frost nova or other AEs (or warlocks doing the same) also should be told to knock it off. Loose mobs in WoW kill people fast, and a group that realizes and controls this has a good shot of accomplishing their goals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">05-02-2005, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe Sort Of thE Same thing happened to me last night. As we were doing ZF and me now being a lvl 51 warrior... we had a paladin,paladin,warlock, and a hunter.<br />
<br />
the lvls were.<br />
<br />
Warrior: 51<br />
Paladin: 53<br />
paladin: 49<br />
Hunter: 48<br />
Warlock: 48<br />
<br />
We Were Doing Divo Part, cause i needed big bad pauldrons... well somehow i became the tank which i didn't mind, i always love running in yelling Attack Me Attack and then start to die... btw  the lower lvl pally was the best healer i have seen in my life...other than this once priest...<br />
<br />
But the warlock would have his sucubus seduce the target i was already attacking then would yell at me when i was attacking... <br />
<br />
I have also had the same mage sheep problem as you but in Muardon... We Died Becausse Of Him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">05-02-2005, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate being the MA in groups. Hate it, hate it, hate it. <br />
<br />
I am usually bouncing around 3 other mobs to get their agro on me. Last thing I need to do is spread the groups damage all over the place becuase I am trying to keep agro. If the MA wants to pick up a target from me that is great but I rather have the freedom of chaning targes as needed without worrying if some slacker is going to choose THIS moment to target something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">05-02-2005, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are tanking and doing CC (which you usuall do as a war in an instance), you cannot be MA.  You simply switch targets way too often for that to work.  I've found it works best when one of the dps classes, or any class that can afford to NOT switch targets until the target mob is dead, is the main assist.  Of course, it also depends on the player behind the toon.  If the MA sucks, the group will suck.</div></div><hr />
