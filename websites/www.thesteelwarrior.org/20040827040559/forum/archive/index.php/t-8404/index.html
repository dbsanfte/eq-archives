<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to upgrade my comp, and I read through the other posts so I have a decent idea of what I want to do.<br />
<br />
First a few questions..<br />
How do I check the RPM of my hard drive?<br />
How do I check the speed (pc133 or whatever) and type (SDRAM or whatever) of my RAM, and what does it mean?<br />
How do I check what motherboard I have?<br />
<br />
Here is my current comp, it'll turn 3 years old this Christmas. It is a stock eMachines T4155 except I added 256MB of RAM and a new video card:<br />
-1.5GHz P4<br />
-512MB RAM (not sure what kind, how do I check?)<br />
-128MB GeForce FX 5600 Ultra<br />
-60GB Hard Drive<br />
<br />
The hard drive space is fine, and I'm satisfied with my video card, although I wouldn't mind an upgrade, but I'm thinking I'll wait for the new x800 or 6800 cards to drop under $300 before I do that.<br />
<br />
I want to get a new motherboard, most likely an ASUS as I've heard nothing but good things about them, a faster processor (probably an AMD 2800+), and 1024MB of RAM.<br />
<br />
I'm confident doing the installation myself, but I'm not ashamed to say I'm in over my head with the miles of specs listed for these pieces of hardware.<br />
<br />
Where I really need some help is picking out an ASUS mobo/AMD cpu combo that'll fit a 2800+ processor, 2 RAM sockets that each support 1024 (or maybe 512, not sure here), and a AGP 8x slot. I'll worry about 64-bit processors and PCI-Express when I upgrade next time. I looked on the ASUS and AMD website but couldn't find any info about the amount of RAM the mobos can hold.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well I am not able to answer all your question, so I will give you only the few I know :<br />
<br />
 * how to know which motherboard you have ?<br />
 ---&gt; it's writen on it : for exemple on mine it's writen MS-6330 v1.0C this stend for a MSI MB for AMD thta you can check here (http://www.msicomputer.com/product/p_spec.asp?model=K7T_Turbo_Lite3) (yep it's danm old too). the detailed spicificities of your MB is given on the net to know if you really have to change it when you upgrade your stuff.<br />
<br />
 * How do I check  my RAM, and what does it mean?<br />
 ---&gt; there is a note glued on it. mine is  256MB PC 133 SDRAM. 256Mb is obviously the size, PC 133 is the freq allowed (100 or 133 Mhz bus speed : which is the speed of your MB ~&gt; see MB web page for tolerances), SDRAM means its a Simple Double canal Ram ie there is 1x128 connection. there was RAM EDO (64 connection), then 128 connection thus Double RAM = DRAM, then 2x128 connection (two paralell row of 128 connections) thus DDRAM. at this point DRAM has been called SDRAM, the fisrt letter S or D stend s for SIMM and DIMM.<br />
<br />
 * How do I check the RPM of my hard drive?<br />
 ---&gt; I don't know, try to get you HD is your hands to look on top of it for its serial number and try to find the web page of its manufacturer to get its RPM, size, Buff size (more important than the two previous), canal speed  (100Mz, 250Mhz,...) and canal type (EDO, ATA, RAID, ...).<br />
<br />
<br />
 * I think (but not sure of it) is that you can't put lower speed memory (RAM) on high speed MB. but even if you can, this will just slow the whole MB and then your whole PC to the speed of your memory.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
well I will stay around to see other replies...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lotsa sites you can check for mobos and other hardware.<br />
http://www.newegg.com<br />
http://www.tigerdirect.com<br />
http://www.pricewatch.com<br />
<br />
Newegg is really good about statistics and layouts and crap; they have pie charts sometimes!!!1  Tigerdirect has good info as well. Pricewatch is really barebones but you may find what ya need there - you'll likely find better prices but keep an eye on the vendor you're buying from. Some blow.<br />
<br />
for your other stuff you can find serial numbers and crap on your individual pieces of hardware, - or use your PC brand and model number - and run those through google or emachines.com or whatever's appropriate. also if you have difficulty finding out what kind of RAM came with your machine, you can run through http://www.crucial.com to get an idea. it may not be entirely accurate but it'll tell ya what kind of RAM your system is optimized for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the best things you can probably do is find a small to mid sized local shop that build custom computers, and have a long chat with a sales tech before you buy anything, especially of the technology labels confuse you. Make sure it's a mom-and-pop type shop, and you can probably get someone who at least knows that you need to put tab A in slot B. The big advantage to this is that you can take it back in a 15 minute drive, and you can talk face to face with someone who knows what they're doing. It'll be more expensive than piecing things together off a dozen vendors, but the much lower aggrivation is -WELL- worth fifty bucks if you've got a good shop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valkiera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I fully agree with Arathena. Finding a local shop with friendly folks have saved me money and time in the long run. <br />
<br />
Matter of fact when I go in for new parts their fist question is if EQ is still my main gaming concern  :)  You might pay a bit more to start not piecing a system from the best prices, but as you return you usually get great deals. Along with a person you can go to or call.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get a 2.6 p4 and double your ram, make sure it is all the same type and size unless your motherboard allows for differnt sized ram.<br />
<br />
Dump the Nvidia card if your preformance is still crappy and your start crashing in EQ, the latest tests shows that Nvidia has really made some poor drivers as of late, so much that companys have to make special code to even have an Nvidia card run well (The &quot;way it is ment to be played&quot; means Nvidia gave them some cash to make a special graphic rendering code so that it will run well with their game, basically they are so lazy they pay OTHER companys to clean up after them -_- )<br />
<br />
Not to mention it forces 32 and 16 bit to 24 before it renders them, basically screwing over how graphics are ment to look.<br />
<br />
I have 4 boxes at my house, 2 Nvidia and 2 ATI, switching all of them to the 9800 Pro card as soon as possible, its as smooth as ice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually atm if you really want the best consumer video card atm, go with an FX6800 - it owns ATI's x800 up and down something fierce due to true PS 3.0 implementation. course, that only works with games that utilize PS 3.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">see what kind of ram you have, and other things about your computer, download this:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">actually atm if you really want the best consumer video card atm, go with an FX6800 - it owns ATI's x800 up and down something fierce due to true PS 3.0 implementation. course, that only works with games that utilize PS 3.0.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is my point isk, All of Nvidia's cards are asking for special code and special attention from game makers, IMO that is shitty, I can play any game with ATI's x800's almost as well as a FX6800 card in a game that uses PS 3.0, and be perfectly even in a game that doesn't have special code for Nvidia cards, to me it sounds like Nvidia is the retarded kid that you have to make special rules for.<br />
<br />
I recommend the 9800 pro because it is a sweetspot of price and power for the 200$ US.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">huh? I just meant ATI's current implementation of PS 3.0 has been incomplete, which puts the blame on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gerrick, when PS 2.0 was released, Nvidia cards weren't supporting it, but ATI was.<br />
the tests, show that Nvidia wasn't too far behind ATI, and that somtimes it was even before, just because Nvidia was converting in real time all the PS 2.0 commands to an optimized PS 1.8 code. this was possible because few game programmers were aware of the specificities of the PS 2.0, and actually they weren't using PS 2.0 at its full power. So I don't think that Nvidia programmers are lazy, because being able to reencode, in real time, to optimize the use of the card is for me a mark of insight.<br />
You must be right in saying that the previous Nvidia drivers aren't able to support PS 3.0 well, but that ATI does, but it can just mean they are working on it. <br />
You are right to say that Nvidia aren't clear on its state, because its history is covered with roguish and sneaking flaws, but I think that if they pay game programers to leran how to code PS 3.0 to decrease the occurance of errors so that Nvidia cards stop sucking, it can be only good for us, cause it will profit as much Nvidia than ATI.</div></div><hr />
