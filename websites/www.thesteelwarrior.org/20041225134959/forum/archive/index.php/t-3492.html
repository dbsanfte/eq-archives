Sorry, we abbreviate things because it's quite a handfull to type out things like Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled. You'd do well to learn the more common ones rather than blast us for using them.<br />

Could someone that has a good knowledge of warrior acronyms post a decent list in &quot;The library&quot; section? That would probably be a good help for folks that are not veterans to warrior equipment.        <br />

<br />
Example &quot;Man, I looted a BoW last nite and I'm fuckin stoked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Note that person has a magelo to the left of his post, and you can actually pull that up and look at it, look at all his gear and find something that could be abbreviated to &quot;BoW&quot; and my god, you'll probably find that shiny Blade of War in his primary slot.  You figured it out all by yourself, didn't need anyone to hold your hand and didn't look like a fuckin idiot in the process.  Tis better to stay silent and have people think you are a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.  It's really not that hard.</div></div><hr />

Then instead of everyone jumping him like we do now a guy with a lot more posts would come and say &quot;hey this is the reason that we use BoW and dont call us morons&quot;. <br />
<br />
  These days though its like we've become a board just looking to jump down anyones throat. I know we are all a little scratch that alot frustrated with the lack of anything even resembling a response from sony but cant we just calm down a little. I know this guy desreved it for making a thread with the word morons in the title. On the other hand might he be someone just here to troll us.</div></div><hr />

Uhh, what &quot;advise&quot; was that?  Don't talk about what you don't know?  Doing research can prevent stupid questions?  Get a custom title so that the new guys aren't intimidated by your generic title?<br />
<br />
I'm a prick.  Calling me one isn't an insult, I already know it.  Hell, it could say it in that title over there and it wouldn't bother me a bit, so I'm confused...exactly what advice of mine aren't I following?</div></div><hr />

Actually Haass just mentioned one of my biggest things that make my eyes bleed dealing with words.<br />
<br />
Advice.<br />
Advise.<br />
<br />
Two different words; two different meanings :D<br />
( no, this ain't directed at you Haass; I know you know the difference..this is just free rambling on my part )<br />
<br />
I never knew how one could ask for 'advise'. You could ask to be 'advised' which kind of relates to being led along and told what to do; but usually asking for 'advice' leads to an answer of sorts.<br />
<br />
But i'm nuts like that. :D Acronyms I deal with on a 24/7 basis here at work so i'm just numb to the sheer metric fucktons of acronyms that pummel me day in and day out.</div></div><hr />

Most of the abbreviations can be &quot;guessed&quot; by looking at the threads in The Library forum. Weapons normally discussed here can usually be found in the Aggro Weapons Compendium thread there.<br />
<br />
Many abbreviations will soon be common sense to you after a few visits here, while a few will be hard to remember and some will be mixed up.<br />
Even the most active posters here can not agree on a clear abbreviations and therefore mix them up at times.<br />
<br />
All in all you will soon learn it. :)</div></div><hr />

I think everyone got pissed at the original poster because of the way he brought up this subject.  If he had posted in the thread in which he didnt understand: &quot;Hey guys i'm sorry but I'm new what does BoW mean&quot; I would bet the response would have been alot cooler than what has been vetted here.<br />

<br />
Completely untrue.  I'm a dick to the people who ask for it, and I'm nice to the people who ask for that.  Human nature makes people remember the times I'm mean over the times I'm nice.<br />
<br />
Don't like me?  No big deal, but I speak the truth more often than not.  It just may be that you don't wanna hear it.  You can indeed figure abbreviations out from context if you actually try.  Lately there hasn't been a whole lot of trying around here though.</div></div><hr />

Also being ex-military, I fully understand the metric fuckton of Acronyms you get bombarded with.<br />
<br />
Its just, I decided it was a good idea to purge my memory of them when I became a cop, so as to make room for all the cop acronyms I now have to deal with daily.<br />

Someone told me I should be raiding ST and NToV cuz I suxxor, but I tell em to STFU LOL.<br />
Im ROFLMAO at this CLR, so we get a TL to bind and run to PoF FR is up and needs killing, <br />
someone sends me a tell asking what keys/flags I have I say CS, TT, Seb, ST, SS, and flagged for CoDb, HoH cuz I killed AD, PoI, PoS, PoV, PoT cuz I killed MB, TT, BoT, PoW, PoA, PoE, PoF, Sol Ro, and PoEb so I can prolly sell some of my gear for pp and and keep the ND stuff and PA the toon but I like EQ and I wasnt PL'd, and after doing XP in VL to get all my AA I want to hang onto this toon, I have ND3, PE, ID5, LR5, AE, CS3, CA3, CF3, PP5, PD3, PB3, and SE3.<br />

I assume you mean you are new to EQ since anything that can be shortened is. Being that you are new to EQ I would suggest you don't call people morons. See the way it works is when you start something you test the waters first and see how things are done, said, etc, you don't barge in and call people names. Since it was me you attacked I will say this in response, Go fuck yourself tard. <br />

Next time Try something with a post subject like, I'm confussed. Then ask what some of the common abbreviations are. I'd also suggest that you make a new account since as of now you are labeled an asshat.</div></div><hr />
