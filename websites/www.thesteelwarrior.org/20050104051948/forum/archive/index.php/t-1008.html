<br />
I have:<br />
1)  Swiftblade of Zek<br />
2)  Wave Crasher<br />
3)  Frostbringer<br />
<br />
I'm guess you will suggest for aggro mgmt that I use #1 in primary and #3 in offhand?<br />
<br />
If this is incorrect, please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advace!<br />

Or, use Wavecrasher and Frostbringer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frosty's proc if fine.<br />
<br />
SBoZ is a very fine weapon, and you'll dig the HPs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you can sell just the SBoZ and get a GSoT. Still leaves you with a duel wield set up, but I don't know why you would want one when you can have better DPS and better agro with a 2h.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SBoZ/Frosty will be your best non-tank combo.<br />
<br />
keep all 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to use Frosty/Swiftblade of Zek, but I swapped my Swiftblade for a Wavecrasher and moved Frosty into offhand.  Aggro with Wavecrasher/Frostbringer is much better - the slow proc on the Wavecrasher, as well as generating lots of hate, is very useful in a group without a slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shorties</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info all.  Yeah I was thinking way back when that dual wield was simply the way to go...but I realize 2-hander when not needing aggro is the way to go. <br />
<br />
So I'll sell the SBoZ and get a good 25k and use wave/frosty.<br />
<br />
Also, I was gonna buy a windblade, but it seems from what I'm reading that truncheon of doom and then greatstaff of thunder is the ticket?<br />
<br />
I also like to solo a bit so the latter combo seems best when soloing?  Of course I'm 41 with a fungi tunic and it seems sadly that my soloing days Im told will end at 50 :(  Ahh well.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the info!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, soloing doesn't have to end at 50.  It just slows down.  I did it and have never owned a Fungi tunic and I didn't get my clicky BP until lvl 60.  Embalmers skinning knife is almost a must.  I found grouping though to be faster and safer exp and I generally solo'd only when I was short on time to find a group or before PoP made travel almost trivial.  I also used to kill low dark blue / light blues while working on BW.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I have never owned a Wavecrasher so take this for what it is worth.  Frostbringer is enough to hold taunt in offhand by itself with almost any &quot;decent&quot; weapon in onhand.  SBoZ qualifies for that role.  IMO your DPS if you choose to solo will be greater with SBoZ and Frostbringer.  DPS is very important while soloing.  Although, I would certainly grab a Truncheon of Doom when it will proc for you (50?).  I am biased against 9/19 weapons as they seem to do craptacular damage so I never pursued a Wavecrasher.<br />
<br />
For the pp a Wavecrasher will net, I would look at one of the 2 handers out there with a 1:1 ratio.  Most are less than 10k and selling the Wavecrasher should net you one and pp to spare.  This way you will have a good DPS/Agro 1 hand setup as well as a good DPS 2 hander.<br />
<br />
One final note, if you have trouble with the aggro from SBoZ/Frostbringer, try reversing them for more proc's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you're forgetting Friedrick is the proc on the Wavecrasher.  It does 70dd over 4 ticks, but more importantly it slows the mob 20%.  Not only is this a major source of aggro if you're MT, but it means 20% less damage inflicted on you, which is quite advantageous when you're soloing.  And its proc rate is very good - at least as often as the Frosty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to be a little off topic, but I heard the Willsapper that drops in Dragon Necropolis  is also a nice taunter and has a slow proc on it.. so I was wondering how Willsapper and Wavecrasher compare ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Willsapper is 35% slow compared to Wavecrasher's 20%, plus its 13/20 compared to the Wavecrasher 9/19, so it does more DPS.  I'm trying to convince my guild to raid there. :D</div></div><hr />
