Needless to Say, glad they are finally adding news discs for the 60+ folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stonewall disc is interesting...it's almost literally Defensive, except the tradeoff for the higher mitigation is you aren't gonna be moving very much instead of less damage output.  Whether that makes it a worthy &quot;upgrade&quot;, you guys will have to decide. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the ability to switch between discs on different timer sets ... the interaction between defensive or stonewall ... and spirit of rage ...<br />
<br />
it's pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
Bust out the aggro increaser ... get aggro ... bust out the defense.<br />
<br />
It's ... gasp ... almost strategic in nature.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
At the very least, it's got some potential.</div></div><hr />

Trading DPS for Mitigation is a poor tardeoff in the long run.  Even infinite mitigation (ie. invunerability) won't kill a monster.<br />
<br />
Trading off movement for Mitigation is a better value.  Being able to trigger multiple skills in a coordinated manner is what makes casters so flexible in the first place and should never have been denied to melee in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the new defensive.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Rage discipline... sounds great... except it last a WHOLE two ticks.<br />
<br />
Unless it multiplies all the hate you have on a mob as some say, and not mutiply only the hate generated while the disc is active as others would have you believe, that looks pretty useless to me.<br />
<br />
Then again, all the abilities that don't even last as long as a bard song are useless, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;except it last a WHOLE two ticks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two ticks is longer than it looks on paper.<br />
<br />
Almost all of my discs as a monk are about that length in duration.<br />
<br />
And they're relatively useless, but not because of how long they last, but because of their refresh time (why use voiddance to avoid all damage for two ticks when it takes 40+ minutes to refresh? Answer: Only if it's your last option before death).<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
In any event, give it a chance, test it, see how it works. I don't think the duration is as bad as it sounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashbomba</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is actually pretty neat. now we can use a paly/sk to grab the immediate aggro and chain cast until we are in postition and then use the aggro increase disc to increase our aggro over the knights. once we have it locked in we can then use a mitigation or avoidance discipline immediately for those benifits.<br />
<br />
alot of very interesting possibilities with us being able to chain discs now.</div></div><hr />

 Raid situation<br />
Ranger: weaponshield....<br />
<br />
warrior: busts rage. get's solid aggro with provoke. stone disc..... after it wears defensive.<br />
<br />
Thas is!<br />
<br />
in a grp, just cut out the stone and the defensive, and leave in rage and provoke.... get rid of the pally tho, and put in RANDOM_PULLER_01</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never did understand the reason for Defensive's original design or intent. Trading DPS for Mitigation is a poor tardeoff in the long run. Even infinite mitigation (ie. invunerability) won't kill a monster.<br />
<br />
Because you can, with care, select who takes damage.  Those who don't take damage can do damage.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make you more powerful, it just shifts your power.  And if you could hold aggro, a 3 minute invincible discipline that made you do no damage would be way better than a discipline that made you do 5 times the DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand it, Defensive was orginally meant to be our escape discipline.  Pop Defensive to help you get to the zone alive, thus the decrease in dps wouldn't matter, since you'd be running.  Obviously this isn't how Defensive came to be used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Masaz</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow if I ever hear warriors make these retarded statments about Defensive again I am going to reroll a Palladin and I would still be less retarded.  Defensive is  the only thing we have now that makes us chosen for raid encounters if we get lucky.  No offence warriors weren't ever designed to run for the zone.  A warrior would rather die in battle than run like fairy bard.   So stating that defensive was meant for when we needed to run take a look at the skill evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Masaz, he's right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you guys are missing one of the better points of Spirit of Rage.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that the high end guilds still bother with transferring agro from main tank to another tank when his /disc wears off, but we certainly do, and Spirit of Rage could make that a ton easier.  That seems in itself to be good in my opinion, despite the limited use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most guilds consider the disruption involved in transfering both aggro and the CH chain to a new tank mid fight to not be worth it unless the MT dies.  Every raid mob I know of that doesn't DT can be single tanked if you get a few DIs off at key damage spikes.  Keeping 1 tank up even if he's not defensive is easier than switching midstream.  <br />
<br />
For some mobs the disadvantage of trying to switch tanks is so severe that it's not even worth trying.  Fennin Ro for example.  If we're doing FR and our MT drops with FR at more than 30% or so we just camp a cleric and try again.  As soon as the MT drops he moves, hits a few people with rampage and/or AE and then it's just chain low HP aggro til the whole raid wipes.  That's right, 1 death and we just write it off as a wipe and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khumak is absolutely right.  In those class raids you plan on keeping the MT up as long as possible.  Even if a Warrior is used and even if they use Defensive, they are held in that spot for as long as possible.  Why?  Because if you try to swap out one MT for another MT, agro fluxes so wildly you endanger both MTs if not the whole raid.<br />
<br />
If you guild is at this point in the game, raids wipe not because of a lack of Warrior agro.  They wipe because the MT dies.  By the time another MT has stepped in, even if it only took a tick to correct, more players have died or are in serious trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps with some well placed DI the MT can be saved, but this saves a whole lot of effort.<br />
<br />
Disc falls on MT; next tank fires off ae taunt and Spirit of Rage.  He gets agro, but since he's only 1 point higher in agro than the original tank, the agro can fluctuate between them, often causing one (or both) of them to die.  But with Spirit of Rage up, he produces 50% more agro than the MT does (assuming they have same weapons), so he won't lose it at all.  He takes control of agro safely, and pops off defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure it is 45% to DI Only - as it seems to be on same line as defensive (Check Stacking)<br />
<br />
but thats just an educated guess so dont quote me on it &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aeka<br />
<br />
Defensive was envisioned to be a poor warrior's gate and its common MT usage was not envisioned. So--pop defensive and run for the zone, with luck, you just might live though the experiance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one thing I haven't seen conclusively tested (and I don't think it will be either till it hits us live) is how big raid targets behave with these.  There is a remote possiblity that big raid targets might be coded to have a different, lower rate of success or maybe none at all.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be a downer but I do want to caution many who think they can throw away old tactics because they have new skills.  SOE has a nasty habbit of sneaking in logic changes during these overhauls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spirit of Rage is really crappy currently, but I think it's a bug.... it disables *all* openings and provoke for 10 minutes after firing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't imagine why you'd use defensive as your attempt to escape when Fortitude is way better.  Have you actually ran for 3 minutes with mobs beating on you before you get to a zone out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mishratm</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it has something to do with the level you actually get to use those disciplines, and of course, the re-use time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sure as hell would use Evasive and not Defensive if I had to haul to zone, nothing worse than a 'stun' when you are getting your arse handed on a plate heh....<br />
<br />
Back on topic, Rage and then Defensive, sounds really really.... sweet :D You could even hit Provoke, Furious, Rage and Defensive for an awesome tanking chain :) Of course, this is all &quot;it would be nice&quot; :p</div></div><hr />
