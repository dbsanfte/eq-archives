<br />
seen any number of threads talking about the time that you have to do all 4 earth rings - comments range anything from 5hrs to infinity with a lot of people suggesting 24 and 48 hours.<br />
<br />
My guild is currently working through these, so was hoping to get a definitive answer on how long you can take to do all 4 rings, assuming no server crash/reset.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=3<br />
<br />
But to answer you, I believe you have 24 hours to beat all 4 rings to spawn the Arbitor.</div></div><hr />

This forum is for HIGH LEVEL warrior posting. It is heavily moderated to ensure it remains that way. PoP Time and Kod'taz+ issues only please.<br />
<br />
and thought it would be best here - happy if an admin wants to move it obviously :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no time limit within which you have to do &quot;all&quot; the rings.  I've seen it strung out as long as 3 days from people farming only specific rings and leaving the others.  Four wins = spawn the arbiter(or) and reset the counter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tubthumpa</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so by one definition, we have 24hrs (read effectively 1 raid night) to do all 4 + boss + croc.<br />
<br />
And under the other definition we could do 1 ring on monday, 1 on tuesday, 1 on wednesday, final on thursday and kill the croc at some point during that, and the boss on thursday.<br />
<br />
This is what confuses me :)  We did 3 last night, so I think it's probably worth us trying and just see what happens, but it seems that nobody can give a definitive answer.<br />
<br />
(thanks to those that replied btw, just wish you both hadn't said different things! lol)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">from what i've seen, you must kill all 4 rings, real or fake, within a 24 hour period from the death of the first ring, to spawn the arbitor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iyacc@work</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've always gone by the rule of thumb as follows..... any four rings in a 24 hour period will spawn him. We've almost always been ok with this.<br />
<br />
When we first started doing EP, we thought it was all four within 24 hours, but we've since experimented and cleared a non loot version and had him spawn also.<br />
<br />
Night 1 - croc, mud, stone<br />
Night 2 - Perfected and stone again<br />
<br />
Arbitor spawned<br />
<br />
<br />
One disclaimer - this zone and the rings can  be buggy as shit. We've gone in after not having seen anyone in zone for a couple days and done one ring and had him spawn, and we've also gone in and done all four rings and not had him spawn. <br />
<br />
We've also several times done Stone ring and ended up having one of the rubbles die, instead of becoming non targetable and homing and this blows the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats the respawn on each ring btw?  I hear 4 days but thats for the loot dropping version as I understand. Is there a reset time for the non loot dropping rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each ring repops in approximately 2hrs<br />
<br />
Loot rings repop in 3days<br />
<br />
Arbitor will pop after 4 separate rings are killed within a 48hr time period.  It is not 24hrs because we typically did them over 2 days.  Start at 730pm, clear 3, start again at 730, finish fourth at like 830 or 900 and the arb popped.<br />
<br />
The kill doesn't have to be the loot dropper, but all 4 need to die within 2 days of raiding.  Potentially 3 days, but 2 should be doable for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tubthumpa</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, we've certainly managed to kill one of the rubbles - seemed a combination of snare and over-dotting did it for him, but he died and that did break our first run at that ring - second time we were that bit more conservative with the nuking and all went to plan.<br />
<br />
We're going to see if we can get them all done in one evening by starting our raid night slightly earlier (I'm sure efficiencies will be introduced over time, but this will be our first run at the lot).  If we can't, our next raid night is 2 days later, so we'll again have to start early to see if we can spawn it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info folks - as usual a veritable fount of it :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tubthumpa</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">many thanks all - guild has now completed the earth rings + MAoE.<br />
<br />
For information, we started at about 6pm with a small force, did Rock then Vine, gathered more of our regular raiders, then did croc, then Vine and Mud, then made the run to MAoE.  Finished at about 12:20, but that was without AEing the events, now that we have the event down, we hope to speed this up at varying points by AEing sections of it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again all,<br />
Tubs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandien</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You must kill 4 rings (not necessarily 4 different rings) between patches.  24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, whatever, it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Every time a ring is killed a counter is incremented.  When that counter = 4, the counter resets and the arbitor (or his PH -- which also gives flags) spawns.<br />
<br />
If the zone crashes, or the servers are brought down for a patch, the counter is reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tubthumpa</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">can now confirm for folks:<br />
<br />
killed 2 rings on friday evening<br />
killed croc, then last 2 rings on sunday evening<br />
<br />
no patches in between<br />
<br />
Mystical Arbiter of Earth spawned immediately and was delivered a prompt spanking.<br />

<br />
Completing 4 rings triggers the arbitor, like has been said.  <br />
Completing the ring when all you get is the PH boss at the end counts as well.</div></div><hr />
