<br />
So what are all of your suggestions for guilds for these two characters?  I've grouped solo'd with random people way too much, and it's time I found a guild that I can become familiar with.<br />
<br />
I want to be able to take part in raids and planar raids when I finally hit a level high enough to be of value.  I want to be able to have a group of people to hang out with - you know, all the obvious reasons to join a guild.<br />
<br />
So what are all of your suggestions for guilds on Cazic Thule?  And where might I find a good updated list of guilds on Cazic Thule?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and aside from Dawnshroud, where else could my 34 Warrior comfortably hunt, kill and maim mobs?  (my druid spent too much time there, I'm burnt out on DP).</div></div><hr />

/em is a dumbass and will go to the Cazic Thule boards.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Divine Entities is a 45+ guild that does a lot of Kael and epic stuff on Cazic...my monk was in it. Just send a tell to Roreksis or Sheenadonas in game and I'll give you a good recommendation. <br />
<br />
BTW: They prefer 50+...and get run3....EVERYONE in the guild has it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You really don't want any guild that would take a 47 druid and a 34 warrior right now, for a couple of reasons.  Don't take offense here, and realize that this is what usually happens in these situations.  There are exceptions, but this is the norm.<br />
<br />
First of all, any guild that can currently do what you want to do (planes+ stuff) doesn't need characters that are that low of level.  If you do manage to get in a guild that does that stuff, you're going to find yourself being left behind a lot because you're too low to contribute and actually end up being a liability on that raid.  End result?  You're not going to have fun until you get into your 50's.<br />
<br />
Second, if you join any guild appropriate for your level, there is a solid chance that guild is always just going to be a guild for chat and will never be able to do the things you want to do.  This isn't a bad thing. Friendships are important in EQ, but if you truly have aspirations of doing bigger and better things, a family guild is just going to hold you back.  You'll get attached to the people and stick around doing nothing for longer than you normally would, just because of &quot;your friends.&quot;  Case in point -- I came back to EQ a couple weeks ago, and found that my guild had split off into another guild essentially.  Damned near the instant I got back online, I had 4 people in the other guild come back to mine because they know that I get things done and their guild wasn't doing shit except be a green chat channel and some more letters over their head.<br />
<br />
Your best bet in your situation is to get into your mid 50's and then start looking around and seeing who's raiding what on the schedule you play on.  Find a guild that does things when you want to do them and then try to form a relationship with them.  If you find a guild now, chances are you're not going to be doing anything until your mid 50's anyway, so just keep plugging along and worry about it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sound advice.<br />
<br />
I'm at a loss here.  I just returned to EQ about 3 months ago, started out again from scratch.  But prior to that, I had been on Rallos Zek, guilded in Tier'dal Templars and Covenant of the Wolf.  The first was a strictly RP guild, so it didn't really fit my needs, the second had some things going on, but I came at a time when shit was hitting the fan with all the leaders and such, then a faction broke off, yada yada yada.<br />
<br />
So with my little experience in guilds, I definately don't want a 'family' type of guild, its too easy to get caught up in shitty wars and fueds and drama.  But I also don't want to step into an Uber guild.  I want something in the middle.  <br />
<br />
And your point really drives home the un-guildablity of my characters with my ambitions (??).  <br />
<br />
But I really want to find more people I can group with on a regular basis.  I don't find soloing my warrior a very fast process.  Wheras with my Druid, I really don't need a group.<br />
<br />
Bah, I tell ya, this game sure does suck you in.  :)<br />
<br />
So anyways, I think I'll still continue to look for a guild.  And when I do get into my 50's and such, I'll start looking for another if the one I'm in doesn't do much for raiding.</div></div><hr />
