Search didn't come up with an answer, so I hope you don't mind a noob question.<br />
<br />
In the beginning of a fight where Defensive/Stonewall will be required, the MT has to a) acquire aggro, and b) live.  It appears to me that incite cannot be used at the same time defensive is, though?  If so, is AE Taunt the answer?  Start incite, cancel it, then go defensive?  We have some issues getting the CHRot started smoothly, and therefore a tendency to loose MT's - so going defensive as early as possible is desirable... while still acquiring aggro, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use incite while defensive.<br />
<br />
Use rangers and it sounds like it'll solve all your problems at once. We've been using WS to start fights for as long as I can remember, and it works great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your MT can also hit furious while the CHrot starts, or have druids/shaman spam heal until the complete heals start to land. If the mob flurries then use fortitude instead.<br />
<br />
And yes, you can use incite while using any other discipline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blazyn</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, that helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Few things.<br />
<br />
On big mob, MOST times I tag with arrow / incite, furious, defensive/stonewall or evasive, refresh incite occationaly depending on my &quot;feel&quot; for agro.<br />
<br />
Incite is not a true disc, it is a combat ability that is triggered.  Kinda like taunt, in that you can set a hotkey, can use during other discs .. it does you endurance though.<br />
<br />
Also, as for the CH chain not starting smoothly is something they will have to work on.  Warrior can use furious to help a little, but to me want to get the healing chain working 100%. (there are tricks, but better to be ask a cleric then a fat warrior like me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the fight is planned and not a surprise, then the CH rotation really should be starting about 15 seconds before you engage the mob, so that there is no chance of a big gap at the beginning.  Furious/fortitude gives a nice buffer at the start, but really, you should only need that buffer if you are taking over tanking mid-fight, or some other unexpected situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The interesting thing is if you target yourself and hit incite, it shows up in your combat effects window and you can't turn on another disc unless you click it off.<br />
<br />
I am sure this is not how it was intended, but this might have been what confused your friend. <br />
<br />
Note: this might have been fixed already anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weedas</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite has a hate increase over time effect just like a DoT or an HoT which is probably what the icon represents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brannwen</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I am not the puller (and that is always a good thing :rolleyes:  ) I will tag with an arrow, hit Incite and that will usually &quot;pull&quot; the mob right to me.  Then I start to hit the mob and use taunt just to be sure I have aggro locked in.  I will refresh Incite maybe once in a group situation and two or three times during a boss fight (depending on how quickly it's health is going down) but I like to save a little for when nuking begins in earnest.  And save Taunt for when I actually lose aggro.<br />
<br />
When I'm tanking a boss mob I will put up Defensive if I'm forced to stand in an open area and the push may get out of hand.  But if I can get my back into a corner, and movement is not an issue, then I'll use Stonewall.  And, yes, you can use Incite with Defensive, Stonewall or the other &quot;non-taunt line&quot; of Disc's as long as you have Endurance left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For building up a lot of aggro:<br />
<br />
Let a ranger pull the mob, go weaponshield, and spam snare hotkey (rangers get an AA that lets them snare for zero mana).  <br />
<br />
Right as Weaponshield is wearing off, but before the ranger dies, use AETaunt and pop furious -- if the ranger dies before you AETaunt, you lost a lot of aggro.  If you get a successful taunt off before he dies, you did your job well (the ranger may still die if he continues to aggro after your taunt, of course).<br />
<br />
Furious is popped because once the mob is hitting you, every riposte you make builds your aggro up even more.<br />
<br />
When you're down to the last 2 seconds of furious, start spamming your defensive/stonewall key.  You should not take any damage without having a discipline up.<br />
<br />
You should now be set for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnawbone</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The incite, then furious, then defensive chain should work for a vast majority of raid mobs you'll encounter. 12 seconds or whatever is plenty of time to start debuffing and get the CH chain set.<br />
<br />
If you are still having issues, and you don't like sacrificing rangers, assign a pally or two to LoH during the spikes before debuffing.</div></div><hr />
