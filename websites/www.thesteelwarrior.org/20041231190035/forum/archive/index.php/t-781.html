<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Picked up one of these in Kael last night. (11/24 proc venomous chill, or something like that....hate not being able to hit game sites at work) At the time I was using a scimitar of ykesha (8/22 ykesha proc) in main hand and bed leg club in offhand.  I'm trying to save for a frostbringer.  (Also working on epic). I wanted to get some feedback on: 1) Which weapon to use in main hand and which offhand, was thinking scimitar main, axe off.  2)  Which would be better to duo with FB or epic(if I ever complete the damned thing) :)   Any feedback would be appreciated.<br />

Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For pure aggro, you'd want Frostbringer in mainhand and Ykesha in offhand.<br />
<br />
For DPS you'd want Frostbringer mainhand and Veno Axe offhand.<br />
<br />
Or red epic/blue epic. Heh.<br />
<br />
The Ykesha proc is more aggro than the Veno Axe. But the axe has a better ratio.<br />
<br />
Frostbringer is the most superior weapon of the ones you're looking at.<br />
<br />
Until then I'd probably go Ykesha main, Veno offhand. Or if you don't want the Yak proc (meaning, you don't want to draw aggro, as someone else is tanking), Bed Leg Club main, Veno offhand.<br />
<br />
Part of the fun of being a warrior is playing around with your weapons. Heh. Enjoy it. Have fun. And carry a big bag around for them all!</div></div><hr />
