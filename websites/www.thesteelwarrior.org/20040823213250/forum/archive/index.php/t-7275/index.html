I have 2000 Chevy Impala LS the engine V6 3.8L SFI.   THe check engine light recently came on and I took it to a garage near my apartment to find out what the problem is .   The diagnostic machine indicated two problem codes<br />
<br />
1) P0102- Mass Air Flow sensor,  I am not to worried about this from what I am told that this is a simple fix.  Either the sensor is blown, or it could be the MAS fuse or even the wiring/ground.   Estimated to be around 100 bucks work.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) P1811-Shift at Max-  This one I have no idea what this is about, even when the mechanic tried to explain it to me I still have no idea. If anyone can shed some light on this for me it would be greatly appreciated.  Also if there is a mechanic in the house can you tell what will it take to fix this problem.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did some more research about the problem and found out that 2000 impalas Have a problem with the Transmission Pressure Control Solenoid.  The part cost 49.99 dollars  plus labor so that is not that bad,  THe MAF can cost a bit I am not sure but the part alone is like 160.00 dollars but the labor is next till nill.  All I can do now is pray that it is all that it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MAF replacement on most vehicles is simple and straightforward, takes a few minutes.  It's just a matter of removing a few bolts and the connector, removing the MAF and putting the new MAF into place, then re-installing the bolts and connector.<br />
<br />
I'm not familiar with Chevys but the TPCS is probably accessible by dropping the transmission pan where the shift solenoids are usually located.  I'm only familiar with imports so I could be totally wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I got a appointment on wednesday with my mechanic so I will see what will happen.  <br />
<br />
One more question though,  Can someone explain what Hard Shifting is,  I really dont understand the concept of it.  If anyone can break it down so that a complete idiot like myself can understand it would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
