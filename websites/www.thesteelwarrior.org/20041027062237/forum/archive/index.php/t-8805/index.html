<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am working on the newbie armor quest in Freeport atm and was wondering what weapons I should try to save up for as I level up.  I want to try and keep all my weapon skills up and hopefully get some decent but cheap weapons to do this.  I also need a cheap shield too since I'm a human and will have to ghetto bash to keep my bash skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No one has some ideas?  If you are looking for price range, I don't have much since I am just starting up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">May I suggest the search function.  It may alleviate your frustration with people's lack of desire to answer the same questions every week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dravok,<br />
it's a combination of what Haass said and the fact that many of us haven't leveled a warrior since the &quot;recommended level&quot; aspects of weapons went into effect. <br />
I'm going to assume that you are new to the game, and all that follows is based on that.<br />
Centi weapons do not have a recommended level, and they are quite usable. The longsword is a good weapon, but the short sword is almost as good and often a lot cheaper; the spear is very cheap and gets you some piercing skill ups. I'm not sure about the sarnak battlehammer's recommended level, but in your 20s it is a usable 2H blunt weapon.<br />
Someone in another thread mentioned the player-made steel-laced Aged Snake Whip as having no recommended level and selling for &lt;2000 plat. That's much more expensive than centi weapons, but damn the thing is 12 damage 18 delay which would pretty much keep up with any twink outfit for a very long time.<br />
I used the Jarseth trident (mainhand) in combination with the Shimmering Partisan (offhand) for a while, and that worked pretty well. Again, I'm not sure of recommended level on these, but check them out because if you can use them, they're apt to be cheap.<br />
For any of these things, go to the bazaar and search there by race, class, slot, religion and your budget (the same goes for armor).<br />
The only toon I've leveled since newbie armor came into the game was a troll sk. In his case, he found that the newbie armor quests resulted in good stuff for pre-level 21. however, before the rare drops for the chestplate and the legs dropped for him, he had enough plat just from killing stuff in the newbie zone to buy better legs and chest armor in the bazaar. /shrug.<br />
After the newbie stuff, look for <br />
1. player-made LDoN armor (gothic, frosted, sandblasted), making sure that before you buy it it will fit you (don't buy large or small if you are human). Also look for crafted and crustacean armor pieces. Get a feel for prices before you buy.<br />
2. Next up from that are things like barbed ringmail and steel wrapped armor pieces.<br />
3. Then there's a layer of Velious quest armor sets, though few people find it efficient to quest these nowadays. I've always liked hunting in Kael, though, so if you are there anyway you might pick up the odd quest drop around level 50 for a filler piece.<br />
4. Merchant armor purchased with LDoN adventure points ranges from darn good to the best stuff you can get without being in a raiding guild. I'd tend to save my first couple thousand adventure points for anger augments though, as beginning in your 50s you really need to ramp up your hate output to do your job (cf the millions of discussions about droga weapons on this site).<br />
5. Depending on the religion you picked for your warrior, some of the sets of human cultural armor, which you might be able to afford sometime in your 40s or 50s if you're not twinked, are very good indeed. Look up the stats on them here: http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g67&amp;menustr=080040000000<br />

heh, that ought to keep you busy. If this is your first character, you should know that the easiest way by far to make your warrior more powerful is to level. However, don't be afraid to look around, check out new zones, and in general engage in at least some inefficient behavior. Some of the coolest zones in the game are on Antonica, and if you level in 20 minutes you'll miss out on some interesting aspects of the game. And Orcs must die.<br />
Also, learn how to be a good warrior. It's not terribly complicated, but you do have to pay attention. Learn what the little things are that help you increase the efficiency of your group, and help you hold aggro, and understand the mobs you face.<br />
When you get to about level 50-52, go on at least one Vox or Naggy raid. I really feel sorry for warriors who have never tanked those dragons. when you do it, don't forget to turn /log on. It'll be the coolest fight you'll have up to that point by miles.<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
