<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is this fucking thing ever going to go live?  I seriously doubt it.  I was kindof psyched from reading the chats for god saying the second half of the revamp would be live today..i log on and not a god damn thing once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought it was supposed to also, but I have come to expect the least from SoE. Kavhok did at least admit in a post around here somewhere that they are behind due to the pressure of releasing the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What second half of the revamp?  If you are talking about the Opening system, that got scrapped a month ago.  SOE said it was a bad idea and unworkable.<br />
<br />
We got Incite, we got improved mitigation, we got more hit points (once you spend up to 60 AAs), that about covers the main points that we wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Poosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only other thing I'm expecting is the +Endurance on existing (i.e. pre-GoD) items.  If you look at the sheer number of melee items in the game, it's no wonder this got pushed back.  It is bad that they missed their self-imposed deadline, but if that means that they'll have the chance to do it right then fine by me.  I'm with Haass on admiring the guts (or coffers) of companies like Blizzard who say &quot;It'll be done when it's done&quot;, but not everyone likes to go that way... all managers are not created equal.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a second half coming still, they have said they were going to do more.  Plus end on items is one part.  They scratched the opening system, and said they are replacing it with an on demand system, basically skills on demand that take endurance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Weve waited this long, whats another month or two?Incite+Extra HP+ Weapon Affinity are good enough to &quot;tide us over&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">they said when they scrapped the openings they, instead,would give us more incite like skills such as making them bleed, or targeting vitals (like the berserkers do now)<br />
<br />
im still looking foward to it, im expecting it to coincide with the graphic update because one of the dev's (rtan i think) said he wanted to add trailing particals to our weapons when we use a skill, currently impossible(think soul caliber 2 weapon trails, cool lightsaberish glowing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Launea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, at least they gave us a couple upgrades to Incite, even if one is and &quot;Ancient&quot; skill drop.</div></div><hr />

We got Incite, we got improved mitigation, we got more hit points (once you spend up to 60 AAs), that about covers the main points that we wanted.The original openings system was scrapped, they are &quot;working&quot; on new version. Of course that was over 3 months ago... Incite is awesome, can't argue with that, the 5% is cool, but hardly noticeable, and it sucks dick that they chopped off 5% from Defensive. As far as Sturdiness or any of the other ridiculously priced GoD AAs go, they are just retarted, only a tiny tiny percentage of Warriors has gotten all of the useful AAs (ND/CA/CS3, PE, AET, LR/ID5, PD, PP, etc etc 200 more offensive AAs..)Originally posted by Dakryn <br />
Weve waited this long, whats another month or two?Incite+Extra HP+ Weapon Affinity are good enough to &quot;tide us over&quot;  Weapon Affinity and Sturdiness part of what is there to tide us over? HAHAHA. Sorry but as Haass had said, they're not worth the 90 AAs for something we should have already.</div></div><hr />

A long time in the MMORPG world.</div></div><hr />

I don't care what anyone says about you Baadan, you're alright :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So, who ever said they were supposed to tide us over or were designed to be part of class balance?  Only people I hear saying that are the people who say it isn't enough.  Well no shit, thats not their fucking purpose.  Weapon affinity obviously doesn't balance a class, but it is a damn good utility aa.  It isn't an aggro aa unless you make it one by using aggro procs.  Or you can pull out the ToD and get a slow in faster, or a life tap proc for more heals, or faster snare / tash, faster gate to OT.  It's just simply a very good utility aa if you want it.  &quot;Fixing&quot; warriors isn't part of this aa, you people have just added it in so you could bitch idiotically more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Weapon affinity obviously doesn't balance a class, but it is a damn good utility aa. It isn't an aggro aa unless you make it one by using aggro procs <br />
<br />
Dude, seriously.  The only thing anyone cares about anymore are fucking aggro procs.  It's been so ingrained into everyone's brains that no one uses anything that doesn't generate aggro.  Fleshgrinder?  Sucks, get rid of it.  Snowchipper? sucks, get rid of it.<br />
<br />
This shit has been going on for years now.  The only thing warriors use procs for now is aggro.  This is an obvious augment to that fact.  If people still used DD procs on a regular basis, it would be different.<br />
<br />
It's the same thing with augments in LDoN.  You see anyone walking around with a fucking lifetap proc?  No, that would be retarded.  Same deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You miss my point.  This is not designed for class balance.  They are supposably working on that seperately.  Yes, we are bound to aggro procs, and that can be an issue.  But this aa wasn't put in to deal with that, thats something seperate that they say they are working on.  If they came out and said that this aa was supposed to fix class issues, I'd be pissed also.  But they have stated that they don't believe class balance should require an expansion, so with that in mind this isn't supposed to be the fix.  Things like Incite are available no matter what expansions you own, and when they do more to fix the class it most likely will be in that way also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No, I see your point, I just disagree with it.   <br />
<br />
EB wasn't meant to be a permanent thing, but it was.<br />
<br />
The HP gap shouldn't be so small, so it's being corrected via AA's.<br />
<br />
Whether or not weapon affinity was designed for class balance or not, it WILL be considered in any decisions they make, thus we lose overall power if we don't have the AA.<br />
<br />
It's just like the 5% mitigation bonus.  Ya, that's nice, but why the fuck did they nerf defensive to compensate?  You see where I'm going with this?</div></div><hr />

Yeah...that fixes difficiencies in Warriors.  Are you sure you don't work for SOE right now? ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it does.  Right now we are able to perform the job with Incite.  We don't need any more upgrades to be able to control a situation ourselves.  The only problem is how we stack up to other classes, some of which have been overpowered for a good long while now.<br />
<br />
All of you people who spout the &quot;Nerf always = bad&quot; nonsense aren't right.  Nerfs are necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">you will have to wait on that next nerf. the dev's have already shot their load on the delightful orb of forgotten magic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">How is a 320 damage proc going off before level 50-something anywhere near 'balanced'?  Level 55 for a proc on an item with a recommended level of 63 is definately in line.  Now to nerf the proc on that copper hammer, or whatever it is that procs the 179DD+stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Don't be nerfing the twink stick yo.<br />
<br />
I mean, lets be serious.  I can already log on the 65 druid and bust out TGB spirit of the wood on a 50 mob pull on the little guy, the least SoE can do is let me just use the hammer and my fungi on my twinks.</div></div><hr />
