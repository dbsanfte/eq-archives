Seems a lot of MT's do it to give the sign for the rest to attack but I always figured that when you are 65 you should know when to go in.But then again I might be missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm.<br />
<br />
on trash mobs during moves towards named, our MTs actually call out assist, which ensures the rest that the MT has locked down his target and about to break mez<br />
<br />
on named stuff, we rarely bother (or i just am not looking close enough), just wait a bit until he's positioned (if applicable) and have at it.<br />
<br />
depends on the amount of hate teh MT is able to generate though, I'd guess. i remember we used to wait for assist calls during luclin and velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harkov</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On normal mobs leading up to the fight I only call assist if i'm MA right when I target it.  And it's really only for the benifit of the SA so we don't end up with the same mob.<br />
<br />
When I'm SA I hardly ever do.  Things die too fast to keep spamming and everyone knows anyways to switch to my target after the MA.<br />
<br />
On bosses, I always call in.  Guess i'm just kinda used to it because nobody listens anyways :P  Everyone attacks before or waits later lol.  I'm usually only anal about it on specific mobs where I need a gauranteed aggro before hand.  Or on fights where have to kill adds in the middle of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On mobs that needs to be killed fast (PoFire minis etc.), I call assist after about 10 seconds, or when the first EB proc goes off. For the 1% times that i lose aggro after that, AE taunt remedies the situation. For mobs like Fennin Ro where you really can't move from your spot, I give it a bit more time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally speaking, always on trash, rarely on bosses.<br />
<br />
On trash, it's purely to focus people onto the same mob. I don't even wait until I've got agro; just pick and call. On bosses, people have such varied agro, and often pushing is needed asap, that a single assist call for the entire raid isn't viable. They know my agro and they know their agro. They get it wrong, they get summoned and die, or get chased and kill people. - either way, they learn pretty fast when to attack and how fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krauth Isuber</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to be doin' stuff backwards compared to the other people...<br />
<br />
On mobs leading up to the big %T, I rarely, if ever call assist, unless there is an add (only to make sure people are /assisting me, which they should always be doing).<br />
<br />
I always call it on the boss mobs though....I call it after I get the mob to 98% (on a lower HP boss), I get him positioned correctly (&lt;3 corner tanking), after the mobs first AE (make sure no one gets hit by first), when I get my first proc in (Duel-Wield a GBoS and a CHSD...whatever procs first), or after about 7-10 seconds.  <br />
<br />
I rarely ever lose agro on the big guys, but occasionally lose a lil' bit agro on the smaller mobs.  Normally due to someone else landing a string of procs, or a few resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I engage.<br />
5-10 seconds after melee engage.<br />
10 second after casters engage.<br />
<br />
After that when i have agro locked i call full burn.<br />
Thats offensive disc &amp; chain nuking.<br />
<br />
Never had a single caster summoned in fire.<br />
(happens once in a while in water caus agro is harder)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always call it.<br />
<br />
While clearing I call it as soon as I target the mob I want to kill (so everyone knows the MA has his target).  I don't worry about building aggro beforehand.<br />
<br />
On bosses I call it when I have the mob positioned where I want it and when I feel like I have enough aggro (depends on procs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stommper</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In xp groups I only call it if there are multiples, mainly to let all know what I'm attacking. In raids, I call it when I feel I have sufficient hate, mainly because our guildies are trained to wait for that call before attacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I call em all except in xp groups on single pulls.  <br />
<br />
If I don't call assist I get 3 /tells from other mellee's telling me I forgot to call assist ;)  Our guild is very disciplined and people wait on the assumption I&quot;m trying to position or ensure agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only call assist if Im the MA.  When tanking, unless there is a major need to call in the rest of the guild to attack, I don't, they know enough to wait a few seconds to let me get aggro.  When exping the only message I give is my pull message and the occasional hail when multiple are mezed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Boss Mobs-  I never call assist. The Raid leader calls assist, sends in pets, nukes, etc.<br />
<br />
In Exp groups- never call assist, if level 65 people in tier three cant assist, they need to go back to KC.<br />
<br />
On runs to an encounter, when we have multiples in camp, and off tanks have mobs, I call assist as soon as last mob dies. Basically my job is to redirect the focus of attacks, this kills mobs faster. Some times I cant even hit the mob, let alone tank it or get aggro, but My job is to move the raid thru targets efficiently.<br />
an example, SSRA, headed to EMP, when you charge the tube rooms, I start at one mob, other tanks fan out to other mobs, as sson as my initial target dies I get the next target asap and call assist.. this redirects the casters to the new target, and focuses DPS on one spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In clearing, my old guild didn't call assist, but the new one does and I really like it.  It's hard if people are just spamming assist as soon as the last mob dies, because then if you accidentally target the wrong mob you're stuck with it.  I don't wait to get aggro clearing, but I don't want anyone hitting assist until I call so nobody ends up on the wrong target becuase I mis-clicked something for a second.  <br />
<br />
On raids I think the tank should be the one to call assist.  They are the only ones that know if they got a proc, or got stunned right away, or did something dumb like forgetting to turn on attack (don't try to tell my you've never done it :)) etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burol</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">During raids I call assist for every mob. When we are clearing to the target I call it right away so we can clear each mob quickly. On most main targets I will build some agro before calling for assist.<br />
<br />
In exp groups I do not call assists. If I see that people are not assisting me for their targets I will usually just tell them too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I target, I attack, I hit my call which states that I am engaging this target (implying if you hit your assist key, you will have the same target as me).<br />
<br />
I do it on all mobs, the same way every time.  I am not calling for people to attack so much as for healers to watch me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a lot of great tanks out there, but as a group calling assist seems to be a shortcoming every bit as bad as monks not FDing off aggro (this applies to paladins and SKs too, not just warriors).<br />
<br />
I agree completely with what Hulanta said btw.  The best sequence I've seen of this kind goes simply:<br />
<br />
&quot;Engaging %t, WAIT FOR ASSIST&quot; (on big mobs)<br />
<br />
This alone halves the chance the MT will die in the first few seconds of the fight on a big mob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Assist me on %t&quot; (not necessarily called by the MT)<br />
<br />
As for me personally, in exp groups I always call assist.  Lots of reasons for this, but two of the most important are:<br />
<br />
1)  It helps let everyone know when it's safe for them to start hitting the mob (and helps them realise this isn't necessarily the instant I stand in front of it or plink it with an arrow).<br />
<br />
2)  It reminds everyone *I* am the assist, not the puller, and so when breaking mez etc they're already in the habit of waiting for my assist call.<br />
<br />
But overall, it's staggering how many tanks feel it's frustrating, unnecessary and offensive to suggest they should call assist, and then blame their groups or raids for the result if it goes wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we are clearing mobs on raids we like to use a split assist. A thru K assist one tank, L thru Z assists the other. This works well for us. The tank I'm usually paired up with have a system that works quite well, it just takes some discipline of the guild to wait for the assist calls. If I'm on A-K I will target the first mob, engage and call the assist for my people. The L-Z tank will assist me, then pick a new target and call the assist for his people. We also have back up people just incase the main assists die.<br />
<br />
For boss mobs our raid leader usually calls a GO, when they don't a lot of people do speak up asking...&quot;GO called?&quot; We are creatures of habit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought BoT was the new KC.<br />
<br />
<br />
I use my assist call in exp groups just to identify mobs(ie on multipulls).  On raids, clearing again only on multipulls, boss mobs either I or raid leader.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But on the boss I always call it. Only I know if I have built up enough agro to not loose it, if i've proced, yada yada yada.<br />
<br />
Also on bosses, I always wait until they are slowed if they haven't been preslowed already. Just to make sure I don't call assist before I get agro back after slow and tash and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I call assist in exp groups just so the other 5 people know that we're about to fight something. It tends to make the majority of folks be a little more attentive to the chat box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On clearing BS mobs that don't hit hard, where positioning isn't a problem, we just go FFA.<br />
<br />
On slightly harder hitting mobs (lets say clearing to xano in PoI), we have all our 65 warriors pulling mobs, certain groups assiting them when they call it.  I ususally call quickly, once I get a couple good rounds of damage in, since I know I don't proc on raids =P.  I figure a dead mob does less damage than a beating one.<br />
<br />
When I'm tanking a boss mob.  I call it when two things happen:<br />
<br />
1.  mob is where I want it to be<br />
2.  I feel like agro is good.  With my current weapons, if I get a couple hammer procs, or I've had about 10-15 seconds solo time, I usually call it.  If I'm using my staff, one stun does it all.<br />
<br />
I told a lower level warrior who was asking me about calling assist, that they should feel comfortable about it.  Most warriors, time they are over 50, should have a good idea of what their agro is.  They should then be able to figure out when its ok for them to call.  Its different for everyone.<br />
<br />
Pretty much, I consider calling assist to be a gut feeling which we all figure out eventually.</div></div><hr />

I suppose if i tank a big mob or in hot/tov (which i probably won't) i would definately use an ok assist me now.<br />
<br />
edit: i remember i did it on ixiblat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen it done both ways and I, frankly, don't care for calling assist.  Aggro isn't just the responsibility of the MA. It's my responsibility to control my aggro to under the MA.<br />
<br />
Even with waiting for assist, I could peel aggro off the MA if I wanted to.  Since I know enough not to, why make me wait for assist?<br />
<br />
I've also seen (pre-raid function), someone who insisted on soloing each mob to 80 before calling assist.  He says that's how his guild did it, I looked at it as him using our raid as an excuse to power level himself. Maybe that makes me biased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyndrusher</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always call assist when tanking, even on small trash mobs.  Some people in the raid will always start attacking when they're not supposed to, and I'm a big believer in practice makes perfect .. so we use trash mobs to practice on and drill the point of waiting to attack until assist is called into their heads.<br />
<br />
On large mobs, I usually give it about 10 seconds, or until I believe I've establed a good aggro lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stopped calling assist for raids for boss mobs, but maybe for clearing when there are a couple of mobs in the camp.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I take the view that if you raid often enough with the same people and at this stage of the game, they should damn well know how to manage their aggro without me having to tell them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I call assist so people know which mob to beat on.  I never give them time for me to build aggro though.  If it's a trivial mob it's not my problem someone overaggroed (and he will probably live anyway).  If it's something that can actually kill people, I figure someone died overaggroing is like extra insurance against clerics/slowers/enchanters from getting killed.  While it's possible a cleric died trying to heal someone who overaggroed, on the real dangerous stuff people who overaggro usually just die instantly giving clerics no time to heal them.<br />
<br />
In some sense people who can't mnage their aggro isn't that bad because they're the ones that make sure if your MT somehow died you have a better chance to switch tanks, since they'd die (good) instead of the clerics (bad) or the next tank (very bad).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see your point Phantron.<br />
<br />
Of course if it's a big mob on a raid, when someone other than the MT gets early aggro one of two things will probably happen:<br />
<br />
1)  It's a melee damage dealer in which case the mob will turn and kill them, blocking backstabs from the rogues and scattering a few colossal ripostes among the damage dealers.<br />
<br />
2)  It's a caster or healer who took your assist call as a signal that it was safe to cast some moderately hate-inducing spell, in which case you've lost your mob positioning, plus losing the caster and any others who had enough hate to get proximity aggro when the mob ran over and stood on top of them.<br />
<br />
Overall it probably doesn't matter much though, since most people will compensate for things like that on raids if they know the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild has splitted the jobs. We haven MAs and MTs on Raids.<br />
Normally the MA is not the MT ( for Bosses ).<br />
In some Zones were working with more than one MA. This is a Point our casters love, cause they now can nuke several targets without having problems getting aggro and can make more damage in same time. Also the bunch of melees can be splittet so that everyone can dish better. For that we split the Raid in 2 .. forces and give each force an extr MA. Works great in special places ( VT ,,, ).<br />
<br />
The MA call to assist. The MT call to engage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's up to the casters to know how much aggro they can get away with.  It doesn't really matter how late you call it because unless you call your assist 3 minutes into the battle, a wizard bent on nuking hard will eventually catch up to whatever head start you have.  If your casters don't know how much aggro they can pull then you certainly won't know either so there's no point to call it later, since someone who doesn't know what they're doing will steal it anyway.  You have some insurance against messing up positioning, aka summon, which makes single occurrences of overaggro relatively painless.  If a mob turns around, melees aren't so fragile to die instant from the 3 seconds it takes an uber to kill someone, and losing backstab for 3 second is unlikely to affect the overall result of the battle.<br />
<br />
At any rate, in the days of EB weapons and Voice of Thule, melee overaggroing is very unlikely if a mob doesn't have any anti-aggro abilities and if the mob has anti-aggro abilities then it's up to everyone to know how to manage their aggro since anti-aggro abilities are obviously meant to defeat mindless autoattacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahhj</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great saying we rogues have, &quot;Count to 10, then jump in.&quot; <br />
<br />
I've taught it to the rest of my guild, too. So long as the rangers keep joltin, the monks keep falling down on the job and the rogues do their thing it's usually not so bad. <br />
<br />
Aggro management is everyone's responsibility, because everyone gets and makes it. <br />
<br />
When we first started raiding we had our main tanks call for assists, and now whenever we go some where for the first time they usually do too, but eventually it's assumed that everyone knows how it works and it's left to them. I rarely see engages called in Exp groups, but as a rogue I still give tanks some time to build aggro, even if it's just a few extra seconds. <br />
<br />
Now if only I could get everyone to figure out how root works and to respond to it when it happens :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Luckily a unplanned root makes both the rogue who stands too close to a mob and the warrior who drifts too far from it both look bad :D <br />
