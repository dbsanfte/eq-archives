Going to be a fairly simple questions, would like any opinions on it from those who have or still do use a BBB.<br />
<br />
How would you rate the BBB in vs a BoC in terms of argo generation for the xp and raid settings. Also how would you rate it in a dps situation (i've heard you can somehow manage the argo from proc, i'm guessing it's from mob proximity when the rune fires but I really have no clue).<br />
<br />
Any information is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If BBB is close (well related) to the BoW then the Agro <br />
(from sheer DPS) is gonna be insane.<br />
<br />
Fero + Avatar + Thule + AA + Vengeance = I can give full burn order.<br />
(Thats chain casting Wiz/Mage) after 50- 60 seconds in fight with zero<br />
risk of loosing agro (even if i dont proc).<br />
<br />
I agree BBB isnt BoW, but it will surely beat AHR+BoC in DPS &amp; Agro.<br />
Thats under normal conditions (Xp) If you have the AA,<br />
Sheer dps is the best &amp; most reliable agro to my eyes.<br />
<br />
As for MTing... well with the proper preparation... <br />
I'd say its more than great (wont beat Dual EB of course)</div></div><hr />

Got almost all my offensive AAs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a BBB, and most of the warriors in my guild are packing at least a BoC. When we're running through VT and I split a mob, if another warrior is hitting it at the same time, they will almost invariably take aggro away from me. Sometimes is takes a while, but if they're taunting and they proc, aggro is theirs. If I proc, aggro sometimes bounces a little.<br />
<br />
  However, in PoP, I find I hold aggro better than a BoC wielding warrior. The ac difference has enough of an impact in PoP that I pump out enough DPS to stay ahead with a few procs.<br />
<br />
  For exp type situations, BBB locks down aggro just fine. Good DPS, reasonable aggro proc... It's good enough for exp no problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if they are taunting wouldnt matter if u were dual wielding bow's they would take agro from u if theres a sucessful taunt...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The key though is that we're both taunting. Or, for example, I was MA at one point and I couldn't take and keep aggro from the other warriors if they continued attacking. That's with me taunting and them NOT taunting. If there was fairly equal aggro between the two weapons, I should have been able to take over at some point. Instead, I could never hold aggro in VT with them still attacking the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorette</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">got a BBB and all offensive AA quite good aggro while MT but take care when your are not MTing if the MT die you will be the first one the hate list <br />
<br />
BBB is the best weapon for a 2nd MT never overaggro en BoW wielding MT unless chain flurry but always overaggro BoC wielder MT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Promethis</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a BBB and Hategiver and Bloodfrenzy combo if I need insanely fast aggro.<br />
<br />
But... I use BBB almost exclusively for tanking, using Emp 2h for exp groups or when I'm not MT.<br />
<br />
BBB aggro is good for the long term, I've found EB to be like Anarchy, you can snag snap aggro with it fairly well, but for long term (10+ min fights) BBB will be your best bet.<br />
<br />
Also, and the main reason I switched to 2h, is that tanking mobs with 15/19 and 16/20 with max haste is going to completely and utterly fuck your shit up with Ripostes. Especially if the mob hits for 2k+.  In that regards, BBB &gt;&gt; duel weild.</div></div><hr />
