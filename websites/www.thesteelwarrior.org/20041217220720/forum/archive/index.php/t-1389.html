<br />
LOL&lt; why does anyone think the moderators here have any control over who posts what on other boards? The moderators here control what a player playing a Paladin writes on his classes board? This is to funny.<br />
<br />
No, I don't plan on posting on PoN just to piss them off, waste of my time. I convinced 20 people in my guild in Diablo 2 (most two box D2, LOL, so 40 accounts) to play WoW instead of even thinking about EQ. Don't say one person can't hurt Sony's bottom line, they can. Furor has done at least 10 times that damage.<br />
<br />
(All warrior chars in EQ deleted or sold)<br />
<br />
Proud butt kicking Barbarian who can OWN a sissy Necromancer (guy with a dress on) in Diablo 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the same way you were banned from their boards, even being a paladin. This us vs them mentality has to stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But Raaj, it IS us vs them until they fix/nerf warrior/paladin aggro. They are taking our places, and we don't like it. It's simple as that. Warriors deserve experience just as much as paladins do.</div></div><hr />

We're all players in the community, regardless of class.  And overtly attempting to sabatoge or annoy another board is not going to do anyone any good.  Behave like adults.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trolling is bad, mmmkay. <br />
<br />
I agree with Glatius. You can discuss the balance issue anywhere so long as you are civil and not being a troll. <br />
<br />
Over here we would get upset if a knight came over and said &quot;warriors suck it&quot; just to get a rise out of us and we would most likely ban that person. Why should it be any different elsewhere.<br />
<br />
With that said, I don't think the pon mods should complain because a poster, who isn't a paladin trolled there with the subject being warrior issues. Ban the poster and move on. Perhaps warn other message board mods that the guy is a trouble maker and let it go. <br />
<br />
We come to message boards to say what is on our minds within the topics set forth on  the boards we visit.  So I personally think the paladin mods should stfu about it to the steel warrior mods. They have about as much real control over what an individual poster/thread starter can say on a different message board as ghandi does over what I am having for dinner. <br />
<br />
If this community board becomes a sort of facist, &quot;Mods from board X complained about you, rightfully so or not, so you can't post here&quot;, it will be the eventual downfall of this board. <br />
<br />
Much as we all love this place, no one likes being told what they can and can not say, especially when it is in a different venue  than where they are being told what and what not to say. <br />
<br />
With that said, if you as a poster, associate the steel warrior name with your posts on other boards, the mods here have ever right to tell you to either not represent yourself as a  member of the steel warriors because of what you post or bugger off. <br />
<br />
<br />
For those who have taken too many head shots: Don't sully the reputation of all of us at the steel warrior because you want to say what you want and we will all get along fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you, 12?  This is nonsense.  You're making it sound like it's the paladin's fault they are better in groups than we are.  Starting idiotic rivalries with other players based upon the way people in San Diego designed a game is about as illogical as it comes.<br />
<br />
Paladins haven't done crap to put us in the situation we are in, except figure out how to use the tools they've been given the most effectively, and we would have done the same if we were in their shoes, so can it.</div></div><hr />

No one can go to the PoN board and claim legitimately they represent the Steel Warrior board, except the Moderators here. PoN Mods should know that, they are behaving like babies about the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

I did nothing even close to what you are describing.  To be honest, I saw nobody else doing anything untoward there either.  Post an example.</div></div><hr />

I know I can depend on you to post the examples for us.  Thank you brother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haass, Glatius, Frodlin are all top notch people here.  Don't always agree with them, but a world of respect for all of them.  They make the warrior community a better place. <br />
<br />
Ok, brown nose time is over(tho all I said was true there), bakc to our regularly scheduled bitchfest.</div></div><hr />
