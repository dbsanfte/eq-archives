<br />
Note that when you augment an item, it becomes No Drop. Now anyone can wear whatever gear they want with impunity at any level so long as they have LDoN. The entire dimension of risk vs reward and punishment for death is completely gone on the server.<br />
<br />
Easily attainable No Drop had hurt the server for a long time, but this just finishes it. <br />
<br />
Instanced zones are pretty bad too. The entire point of a competitive server is being able to control areas and kick people out who you don't like. Now the only PvP I see going on is in the PoP exp zones and at the wayfarer's camps.<br />
<br />
This latest expansion just proves that the SoE developers have never, nor will ever, put any stock into the PvP servers/system, regardless of how many people enjoy it. (I bet more would enjoy it if it was better.)<br />

<br />
But that would pretty much negate almost all of the appeal of LDoN. What player would spend hours in a dungeon farming points to buy an augment they could lose when a couple sk's sneak up behind them? Hours, days, or even weeks of hard work, not to mention raid rewarded augments poofing in seconds. I can bet you'd have tons of more pissed off people about that than you do about items being No Drop once they were augmented.<br />
<br />
With the changes implemented in this expansion, I dont think there is a happy medium for pvp servers no matter what idea they try. SoE is more centered around selling expansions to people of all servers than keeping the people on the couple of pvp servers happy. I wouldnt expect a drastic change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would just mean that augmenting a droppable piece of gear would be risky... just like wearing droppable stuff in the first place. You would try to put your prized augments onto nodrop items (which presumably would remain unlootable).<br />
<br />
It would probably represent a more significant coding challenge the current system, but it would be more conducive to pvp... maybe they'll change it in the future.</div></div><hr />

You're an idiot. If I fight hard against someone, and don't just grab some friends and zerg him (like you suggested), I DESERVE SOMETHING IN RETURN. He lost, and he needs to lose something now. I'll admit, some people are assholes about it, but Rallos is incredibly anti, and they'll never make it past 60.</div></div><hr />

I can assure you that SoE doesnt care about the Zek servers, and to be honest, neither do 95% of the players. <br />

Do you actually even play on Rallos?  I do and I can't remember the last time I killed a PKer and looted anything more than some fishing grubs or maybe a spent pumice stone.  Actually check that, 2 years ago I killed guznuk outside karnor's castle and looted a heiro cloak.  <br />
<br />
Ever since PoP came out the height of PvP on rallos was for some lamer SK or MB wizard / Lifeburn necro to zone into Bastion of thunder and try to sneak up on someone and gank them.  If someone actually engages them when they zone in, they quickly zone back to PoT and sit right near the stone waiting for another chance to rush back in and gank.  If that if the kind of PvP that you enjoy, well I guess LDoN ruined it for you :P</div></div><hr />

you play on a zek server? if not; than stfu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strange, but I've not seen zek server players have any qualms about spouting off their opinions about the PVE servers.  You know, the ones they call bluebies and carebears other derogatory things.  Why should non-zeks have to stfu, are their opinions about zeks less valid than zeks opinions about PVE servers?  If so, why are zeks so much more insightful?<br />
<br />
I haven't had much experience with PVP I'll admit.  A very brief stint in UO dealing with PK muggers who'd ambush you and steal everything you owned.  Not my idea of fun.  I don't think most people enjoy the idea of paying good hard earned cash to be mugged at every turn by those who aren't necessarily better players so much as they've had the time to invest in stealing what they need from everyone else.<br />
<br />
PVP is not particularly noble or worthy of high respect.  Some PVP players are decent enough I expect.  Others, perhaps many others, are not.   And while you can probably say the same thing about PVE players, what is different is that PVE players can't ambush you from hiding, crow about mugging you, steal from you, and camp your body making your day even more unpleasant.<br />
<br />
So, I don't play on a zek server.  I have no real idea what it's like on a zek server.  And I'm still going to voice my opinion that zek servers serve only one real purpose.  They give those people with that mentality someplace to go so the rest of us don't have to deal with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, yeah I think I did choose the wrong game. I'm just hoping Lineage 2 or WoW don't mess up PvP.<br />
<br />
There are some people who crave the challenge of fight someone as smart as (or smarter) than a NPC. That's where the Zeks come in. Just because some asshat with some problems getting along in society wants to camp your corpse doesn't mean that everyone there is like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes i played on a zek server. yes, i thought that maybe it would be a challenge to try going against real people and not the stupid AI of the NPC's.<br />
<br />
truth is PvP is nothing more than a server full of griefers. heck i even saw a guild sitting in DL once ambushing players from another guild as they kept trying to get in and loot their corpses. the OOC spam was kinda interesting, it ended with the first guild saying they were going to set up a rotation to make sure they always had enough people in DL to make sure none of these guys got to their corpse before it rotted.<br />
<br />
you may enjoy it, feel free, thats up to you, but dont whine to me about how LDON has stolen your cash cow of free loot.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if we have a differnce of opinion in regards to PvP, but the real servers are more fun and more rewarding to me. and will always be what SOE cares about. PvP was an afterthought and thats all it will ever be. EQ will never support what you guys want.</div></div><hr />

I have no pity for the PvPers who feel theve been cheated ... they need to wake up and realize, they dont play EQ as it was meant to be played.  Get off their high horses, and join the rest of the multiverse and play on a &quot;bluebie&quot; server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just going to start from the top and work my way down.<br />
<br />
For the people who condemn looting items from people for killing them... that was the entire point of the server. You got something for killing another player. It didn't have to be fair, or just, it just was. That's why it had a loot code where no other server did. You're getting angry at people for being upset at seeing the rules of their server completely disheveled.<br />
<br />
sounds more like this is a whine not so much about how LDoN is changing the game, as it is about I cant steal some free loot from people anymore<br />
<br />

<br />
you may enjoy it, feel free, thats up to you, but dont whine to me about how LDON has stolen your cash cow of free loot.<br />
<br />
First off, PKing hasn't been a &quot;Cash Cow&quot; for some time now. When Velious came out, No Drop Items became so readily available (and viable), that people didn't have to wear gear if they didn't want to. It's only gotten worse with each expansion. As another person explained, you rarely get anything for killing someone.<br />
<br />
You can bet this helps the griefer 100 times more then the person just levelling with his guild. When they have nothing to lose, and gear that's just as good as the next guy, you can bet that when they die they'll be coming right back to your camp. PKs have always been in the minority (vast minority nowadays), and they die VERY often. With nothing to lose, they can do it all day and night. And they do. No Drop helps the griefer, and punishes the casual gamer and those who engage in limited and meaningful PvP. <br />
<br />
I won't lie and tell you that the loot code on the server was making wonderful bounds of progress up until now. It was on its last legs with easily accessible no drop, manaburning wizards, lifeburning necros, super harm touches and Ivandyr's Hoops. It was however an important defining characteristic of the server. <br />
<br />
And yes, PvP servers have plenty of jerks. You can't tell me that other servers are exempt from jerks as well. The defining characteristic of a PvP server is having the power in your hands to do something about it. <br />
<br />
The griefing becomes less of an issue after time. I can't recall the last time where I was griefed and couldn't do anything about it. I spose after time you just don't put yourself in that position, or know how to get around it. There's a lot of useful things you pick up on a PvP server if you stay for more then a few days.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand the animosity. You approach this issue as if the person who voiced it is capable of coming to your server and griefing you. It's a problem on RZ for RZ. Everyone who plays on the server knows the risks, that's why they play on the PvP server with the loot code... I don't understand what the problem is. Everyone agreed to it when they made a character. No one's getting short changed. <br />
<br />
Regardless, beyond the ethical questions of looting people on the looting people server, there's a bigger problem that I thought you people might see. <br />
<br />
SoE makes changes to the game that completely alter hours, days and years of work. I know many many people who have quit because the server no longer has meaningful PvP. With no risk/reward, gain or loss, it's just griefing. How could someone wanting to PvP on the server do anything but grief in this environment? <br />
<br />
I made the post here because the Warrior board has seen a lot of goofy things from SoE lately... changes which have been pursued without thought to consequence. People being left out/promises being broken.<br />
<br />
I thought if anyone, this community could see an ongoing problem with SoE taking something established and wrecking it. Tell me that you can't see a problem with SoE making changes to the game which dramatically alter/undermine the rulesets of servers after they've been up for 4 years.<br />
<br />
Clearly you're too worried about losing your loots on your blue servers? So open minded when it comes to the overall betterment of the game when it comes to increases for your class, but man... if the betterment of the game doesn't have your best interest in mind...<br />

<br />
Actually, I think we're worried about how something that works well for us and that we like is fubared for PVP players and how PVP players think it needs to be changed.  Well SoE doesn't typically do well at fixing things for PVP without sometimes screwing up PVE.  We like augments.  And we don't particularly want to see changes to them just for a very small portion of the population.  Particularly a portion of the playing population who seem to have representatives who go out of their way to disrespect PVE players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The augments'd be removed and the item given to the player, just as if it'd changed hands otherwise. Wouldn't take much at all in the way of coding, just having to deal with how augmented items are looted.<br />
<br />
Since items aren't found augmented, it wouldn't even need a whole lot of special exceptions. <br />
<br />
But they wouldn't bother to do that... so the server's completely changed instead. Sorry paying customer of 4 years.<br />

I'm sorry the PVP-ers aren't happy with loot rules with LDoN but that is the way the cookie crumbles.  <br />
<br />
Unacceptable. Let it fucking perpetuate because hey, who gives a damn. I take it you're a paladin...<br />
<br />
And Jesus, I never said to make augments droppable, or augmented items droppable. One thing would fix it. When you loot an augmented item it loses its augment. <br />
<br />
Tada. <br />
<br />
Since you don't find preaugmented items in a PvE environment it wouldn't change anything, and for PvP it'd make it so that loot code could continue on Rallos with the same risks as always... wear a droppable item and risk losing it.</div></div><hr />

Many players enjoying PVE only have one opinion of PVP: We just don't care.  If it works or if it is broken none of us really care.   You are crying to the wrong crowd.  In fact the only time we care is if it is going to screw up PVE.  Then we care a lot.  If you think we are hostile now, just wait till a change is made to PVE to accomidate PVP quirks.<br />
<br />
If you guys really want a fix ask for any loot.  Why be &quot;bluebie&quot; and protect only NODROP items?  Hell...loot all of the items on anyones corpse.  Once again, we just don't care.</div></div><hr />

You're saying you would have a problem with items with augments in them becoming droppable on just Rallos or ever for all servers.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
all servers. I lik ethat augments are no drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
if they became dropable items, every single person would roll on anything no matter what it is just so they could sell it, or twink an alt.<br />
<br />
while i have nothing against selling items, fact is augments are powerful upgrades. consider the 6 stamina augment.  no drop. people go out and do the crawls to get these. usually only melee fighters ( which means, wars, monks, knights that kind of thing) roll on these items, because they are the ones that need it. in return they stay out of +6 int drops and such. i have found most people who go on crawls are more than happy to NBG and it works out fine.<br />
<br />
in comes droppable augments, well now every single person will roll on anything they see cause they know they can sell it later in bazaar. rather than beign able to pick up a 6sta augment on a crawl, now you have to buy that damn thing for 10k.<br />
<br />
so yes, i like it the way it is.  if RZ has problems with augments making things no drop and unlootable, you shoul;d ask for every single item in the game to become dropable on RZ. not ask for augments to be changed.</div></div><hr />

You know what? <br />
Remind me not to care next time you have a problem.<br />
<br />
True, this is a minor problem, BUT it's still a problem. The governor running for office still goes for the minorities, and this is no different.</div></div><hr />

Well, actually it is different.  First off, none of us nor SoE is running for office.  Second, you see it as a problem.  We see it as a non-issue.  There is a fundamental disagreement there, I admit.   But since I don't play on PVP how would I even be qualified to comment on the problem?  How could anything I say about changing it have any validity given that I don't play on the server?  After all, if my opinion doesn't matter when I disagree because I don't play on the PVP server, how could my opinion have any greater value if I happened to agree?<br />
<br />
You seem to want my opinion only when it agrees with yours.  Otherwise, I should just keep it to myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konjunktion</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the deal, the solution to the problem is obvious, takes a few minutes to come up with on your own. I presented it, it wouldn't influence PvE at all, stop acting like it would. It had nothing to do with making augments tradeable. <br />
<br />
What I've presented is a solution that maintains the integrity of the server and doesn't affect anyone else. I can only assume the continued hostility is towards PvPers and the PvP server as opposed to this actual idea. <br />
<br />
I'm pointing out that they've alienated a group of players again through sheer ignorance and laziness.<br />
<br />
Time and time again PvP has been utterly wasted by changes for PvE. We've never looked at blue servers and thought &quot;Damn them for wanting to enjoy the game as well!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Complaints have almost always been voiced at Verant/SoE for not coming up with smarter solutions to problems rather then picking at those who the problems affected.</div></div><hr />

True, just using that as an example, and I probably would've figured that no one cared about it really except Rallos people. The Zek people are small, BUT I still think they should have SOME say in what goes on with Everquest as long as it isn't a huge problems for the PvE or 'Bluebie' players.</div></div><hr />

Sure most of us had near full no drop anyways, but its always nice to make your RZ Helm, or Monk AoW legs, or FT3 boots from CT no drop.</div></div><hr />

agreed. <br />
<br />
If that was how the original post that started this thread began, I would have been in complete agreement</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
 Can I loot? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question regarding this.  Can an augment be removed?  Even if it destroys the augment, I would prefer this.  Here is why.<br />
<br />
First off, I am epic, have a full suit of HoT armor...all of which I worked my ass off for, and are no drop allready so it is a VERY moot point to me as far as those items are concerned.  But, I have a few items that I'd like to augment that are NOT no drop that I'd someday like to sell. FOr instance: Cloak of Flames, Copper Hammer of Striking, Valorium ring of gallantry, Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement....all of these items will at some point be replaced by an upgrade...However I'd LOVE to augment them and still be able to sell them once I get an upgrade for the item.  If Augmenting will keep me from being able tosell thiese Items down the road, then I am not nearly as excited about LDON and Augments as I was......they need to make the augments removable(even if it destroys the jewel in the process).<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
NM.  I read some more of the thread and with solvents, the way I am reading it, the augments can be removed and the items sellable once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrmmm well there is a ton of history here.  The Zek servershave always been an interesting experiment.  I can see the viewpoint of the starter of this thread; whether they deserve to exist at all is a moot question; years ago they were given life for a reason.  <br />
<br />
Idea: why not just remove solvents from the RZ server?  Then players will have a BIG choice: do I protect my gear and limit it or do I leave it unprotected and leave my options open?  Risk/reward and human agression....perfect mix for that server IMHO.</div></div><hr />
