I was camping in Naggy's Lair the other day, watching the high-end players. They continued to shout out, &quot;watch the rampage!&quot;... when fighting the Efreet, King, Priest, etc... now I know what rampage will do, but who are they directing the call at? Is there something tanks can do to avoid the Rampage? Or is this just a call for all but the MT to be ready to jump back?</div></div><hr />

They are probably referring to watching the health of the person taking the rampage hits and thereby want that person healed.  Cause like if they die .... then rampage will switch perhaps to a cleric and then so on down the line.</div></div><hr />

In that case, people need to watch their health and back off when they get hurt too much.<br />

Rampage is set based on order of aggro.  So assuming no one messes up and you set rampage right, you should know who is going to get hit or not.  But, it is best that tanks take the rampage and not avoid it, since if they aren't getting hit, someone who is a lot more squishy will be.  Though you usually have a set ramp tank, so other tanks won't have to worry about it unless he dies (which is why you have multiple people get aggro in a certain order).</div></div><hr />

perhaps one of the squishy people was getting hit and was being yelld at, prolly not but its another option.</div></div><hr />
