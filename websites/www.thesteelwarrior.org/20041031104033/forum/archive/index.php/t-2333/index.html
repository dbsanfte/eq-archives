Thanks in Advance=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How much money, what kind of guild ect ect ect.  Oh get a nightmare compound bow.  The hp is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get a darkwood bow of suffering over nightmare bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sylnathorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have about 20K cash, as far as guild goes this is an alt so not alot of help gonna come from them. Nightmare bow is recommended 61 so that is out. Darkwood is good though. <br />
<br />
I have been thinking about getting a Swiftblade of zek or a Disemboweler. Stats aside is the swiftblade a better choice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bone Carved Shortbow over Darkwood/Nightmare.<br />
<br />
Swiftblade of Zek doesnt have a proc and there are plenty of better ratio weapons out there now, so I wouldn't recommend it as an agro weapon.  The new toys from Droga would probably be a better option.<br />
<br />
Get Helanic Tundra Bracers and Boots - much better than Champs.<br />
<br />
Get earrings with HPs.  Mossie or Blood Metal if you can afford them.</div></div><hr />

BS! I'm trying to get groups to droga for chos and sotb. When on syl we'll grab vic/hyd and head there, should be fine. I know camp well, just need to get there is all. I'll see what I have stockpiled in bank for ya too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kilamthorngage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">start buying all of the helanic tundra armor you can get your grubby little hands on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sylnathorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't wanna get any weapons/armor that is recommended level 53 or higher. Not sure when if ever I will level past 52. I haven't looked at all the helanic tundra armor but I think the thurg BP is better and I am gonna get some SS gaunts if they are better than Helanic. I know someone who makes it so I can get whatever I want made... And like I said before amor is not really an Issue...finding good weapons is... I have a rangers mindset on weapons and that doesn't really apply to warriors. What is good for a ranger is not always good for a warrior and vice versa.... Anywho thanks much for the suggestions so far keep em coming..</div></div><hr />
