1) It's spell haste.<br />
<br />
2) Most &quot;bard haste&quot; is ALSO spell haste, and doesn't stack with other hastes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only time I use it is if I have extra buff spots and want to make sure I have some haste if the chanter/shammy one drops mid fight. It's spell haste and does not stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hi.<br />
<br />
Monk here.<br />
<br />
And this is an old, old topic for us monks.<br />
<br />
Our epic is a bard song that boosts haste.<br />
<br />
It stacks with worn haste.<br />
<br />
Both the Celestial Tranquility Icon and the Visions of Grandeur Icon can be UP at the same time in your buff window. The hastes, HOWEVER, do NOT stack.<br />
<br />
The other affects are what is stacking (AC and ATK boost from the monk epic click).<br />
<br />
Song Haste IS Spell Haste.<br />
<br />
And the HIGHEST haste you get either from a song or a spell will stack with your WORN haste.<br />
<br />
That's how it works.<br />
<br />
What confuses the issue is BARDS have special songs that are called OVER-haste songs. These songs will indeed STACK with spell haste like Vallon's Quickening, as well as worn item haste like Cloak of Flames.<br />
<br />
These select songs were designed to do that however.<br />
<br />
And as of right now, no item clicky has been introduced into the game yet that has OVER-haste capabilities.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps clear it up a bit. If not feel free to ask more questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taliefer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">pretty sure tehre is an earring in time with right click version3 (over haste as you put it) haste. im not positive however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i'm pretty sure if you wanna check stacking on haste you just go to lucys &amp; look up the spell/effect.<br />
<br />
If the description says &quot;Increase Attack Speed by x%&quot;, then thats &quot;spell haste&quot; &amp; stacks with worn haste.<br />
<br />
If the description says &quot;Increase Haste v2 by x%&quot; than that haste will stack with worn haste + &quot;spell haste&quot; up to whatever the haste cap is.<br />
<br />
If the description says &quot;Increase Haste v3 by x%&quot; than that haste will stack with worn + &quot;spell haste&quot; + v2 haste &amp; will increase the haste cap over whatever the limit is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It doesnt stack as said before but nice to have when no chanter in the group...Soulscream belt+ Ornate guant clicky and you can self haste 61%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vixyyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is also good to have for several higher end encounters...the buff doesnt get debuffed with the AoE Slows like VQ does...meaning you still got atleast 30% while tring to get a real haste in the middle of the raid :)<br />
Also lasting 54? mins it covers them slow casting Bst/Shammy on XP grinds :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's the duration I love. It's only an extra 10% haste over my Eyepatch, but my Eyepatch haste is down every time I look. When I farm tradeskill supplies and stuff, it's nice to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thyll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use my gauntlets for a junk buff, if I am with my normal group.<br />
<br />
The only time I use them as haste is on the rare occasion I feel like running around with my ToD attempting to solo things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Malikae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've found the haste is handy on raids and LDON trips because i can keep that buff on top, and its always the first to be dispelled. 3 sec cast time makes it a pretty handy junk buff.</div></div><hr />
