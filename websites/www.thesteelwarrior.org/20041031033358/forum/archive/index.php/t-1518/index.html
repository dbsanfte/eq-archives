<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a decent range slot item, but am really, really tired of swapping in a bow for tagging on the pull.  Would appreciate some suggestions, I am a mainly Velious geared L61 Warlord.  Guild is casual, so I'll probably be purchasing this upgrade from the bazaar.  Obviously, AC and HPs are priority, I couldn't care less about bow dmg/dly.<br />

Best I've seen by pruning around in others' profiles is:<br />

If cash is an issue then just go for a Darkwood.... or maybe you can snag a War Bow of Rallos Zek, since I hear it commonly rots now-a-days.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">May I recommend the Sarnak War bow from the Drillmaster in chardok...like 10 str, 5 sta 25hp or so.  It's no drop, so the price is gonna be right.<br />
<br />
I don't lose many HP at all using it over my idol of the thorned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyway for an Chardok aligned person to get that bow Haass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would use a Darkwood Bow of Suffering for now, they are cheap and the stats are pretty good. You actually end up with more HP than an Idol of the Thorned.<br />
<br />
Once you get that, save your coppers. The more guilds that get into the EPs, the lower the prices of the player made bows are getting. On most servers you can get them from 125-150k so you can plan on them coming down even morein the next couple of months. Even at 200k these bows are worth ever plat, they are by far the best tradeable range item available and you have to kill some pretty uber stuff to get even a no drop upgrade.</div></div><hr />

It's actually even easier to get if you're on Chardok faction now since the Drillmaster paths up to the bridge area now.  He spawns in the upper level of the bank, then wanders all the way up to the bridge and then warps back down (intentional? I dunno).<br />
<br />
If he's not holding a staff or a dagger, he's got the bow.  Bring your favorite healer friend, grab him near the bridge and pull him somewhere shady and beat his ass.  If you're gonna go with the darkwood bow, I'd just save the plat and get this...you lose out on 5hp, and 5hp ain't worth what you'd spend on a bow in your case.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't have to be a ranger to fletch Kolani, and Nightmarewood Compound bow is pretty cheap if you can round up the pieces and have a fletcher make it for you.  That's what I did :D <br />
<br />
Yes I am a warrior who fletches ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Stonewood bow is way too expensive on bbane still, but featherwood is down to 55k.  24/24, range 220, and it is the only elemental bow (besides stonewood) that has 10 stamina in addition to its 100 hps... I got this thing way back when our first guild went elemental, and theres no way I'm dropping another 100k to pick up AoB effect.<br />
<br />
Its price will drop eventually, as will stonewood's, so in the long run it is going to be a losing investment... but if you're gonna knowingly go into a losing investment, there is nothing better to buy than a 10 stamina 100 hp range slot item =p</div></div><hr />
