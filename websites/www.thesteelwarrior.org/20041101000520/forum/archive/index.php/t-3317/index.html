<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im still new to LDoN, but i am finding aggro a bit screwy. im using the regular set up of CHoS and bloodsword which is fine in PoP but it doent seem so effective in LDoN. esp the CHoS procs - in pop when it procs i can snap aggro back to me, but a lot of mobs seem to ignore it in LDON.<br />
<br />
anyway, i was wondering, whether any of you have switched out to a dps setup with maybe an aggro augment proc e.g WMBS, windblade or a GSo4W.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've done about 30 dungeons so far with my warrior. Most of the time I use a sword of the bloodsworn and either tae ew longsword or club of ice ocean in other hand. I mainhand the bloodsworn depending on whether I'm MT or not. Usually, in pickup groups I have no trouble maintaining aggro over other tanks, just lose it to slowers/healers/sit aggro sometimes. In my guild groups, there is one paladin who I have a dick of a time keeping aggro when he's in the group (and it's not because of stuns). <br />
<br />
Last night I picked up that wand that drops in Mistmoore theme with the Guard II proc. Got to test it out today for the first time in a guild group (including said paladin). First, the proc rate on the guard II weapon was just as good as the Mirror I augment on my sword of the bloodsworn - that is, with a dex buff I had the Guard II buff up continuously. And, second, maybe it was just coincidence or luck, but until the shaman buffs (dex and haste) started dropping late in the mission, I barely had to try to hold aggro over anyone. Have to say I like it so far...will do more testing and see if it was just a fluke (have to bear in mind it was a guild group and we know how to play together). Pick up group will be a better test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wratth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use SotB and CHoS and I notice both get resisted more then in Tier 2 planes on LDoN missions.<br />
<br />
I think that may have something to do with agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For easy missions I always use my 2 hander for extra dps.  It holds agro well enough and the mobs are so weak that almost anyone can tank them if I lose agro for a few seconds.  For hard missions I definately always use my agro 1h combo.  Those mobs rape non-tanks faster than you can curse AoE Taunt for not being up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I swap around till I find what works and holds agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some observations I've made about LDON agro:<br />
<br />
1. proximity seems to really be king (yes its always been king but its ridiculous now). The taunt button seems to almost be an after thought against proximity agro now.<br />
2. you almost will never get a mob to flip its facing (or very rarely).  I always position myself to be in its face no matter what the rest of the group is doing (sorry mage pets, rogues etc).  This of course ruins any positioning skills you might have.<br />
3. Trying to turn a mob is almost impossible and more than likely will cause you too lose agro (sorry group that doesnt want a mob pushed in a particular direction like through a door)<br />
4. A mage/wizzie nuke or good CH will gank it off you like a ping pong ball.  Know where those casters are when are on the mob, turn and get a forward facing between them and the mob asap to limit the damage.<br />
<br />
As far as weapons, using a 2 hander with less than max haste just doesnt seem to hold up well against &quot;spike&quot; agro in ldon.  Unfortunately I've gone back to dual wield with 4x procs to maintain agro (most of the time I group with ellie equipped folks so your mileage may vary).<br />
<br />
I'd like to get a stun proc for my GSoT so i can try a double stun setup to see how it flies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My vote would be DPS. But it depends who you group with I guess. <br />
<br />
Lately I have been grouping a fair amount with PoTime equipped rangers that just dont care if they get agro or not, so I dont care either. Its waaay too much work to try to keep agro of a dualwielding ranger with double procs on both weapons+innate proc, that also nukes/snares. <br />
<br />
So instead I will just let them tank one, and kill another mob instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After 30ish LDoN missions, my strategy going in to every one is to treat them all as a slaughter mission. Pull hard and fast, go all out DPS all the time. The down side to this strat is that you have to have competent people because one idiot will cause a wipe. Even though I play war/wiz, I try to keep casters to a minimum unless they are very well equipped. Everyone should be able to tank if they get agro. The mobs drop fast enough if you go all DPS that it's not much of a problem unless you get some low HP casters in your group.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you're doing higher level dungeons or something, but I havent found this to be true at my level (55). I did two more missions today in pick up groups this time with sword of the bloodsworn (augmented with Mirror I) and bloodwand of the walking dead (Guard II proc). It sure seems like the Guard II proc generates some nice aggro, because usually once the planar stun or the Guard II proc fires, I have aggro lock and I can turn the mob anyway I want it, I can position it where ever I want to take it when the push gets too bad, and as a last resort I move to where I want the mob and sit down. First run we had a monk, 2 beastlords, and myself (plus cleric and enchanter) and I held aggro nearly the entire time. Second run we replaced one of the beastlords with a mage, and same deal. Both were assassinations, and the cleric in the second run even complimented me afterwards on my mob control. Both times the other tanks would normally only get hit because the enchanter had a bad habit of rooting mobs that he had mezzed so proximity aggro would make it flip back and forth until root broke, then it would lock to me again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I don't have a haste spell on me (got CoCW also) I use the SotB and CHoS combo and don't have much of a problem holding agro.  <br />
<br />
If I have a haste spell on me, I stick with the GSoT and usually have zero problems holding agro.  (but without haste I can't hold/get agro for squat with the GSoT)  I've tried using the SotB and CHoS combo when hasted in ldon and I had major agro problems.  (maybe because everyone else was hasted as well??)<br />
<br />
As to turning mobs once I have agro...never had any problems getting them to stay on me when I flip.  And, I'm almost always grouped with at least 1 pet class, so I generally flip mobs every fight (get initial agro on the pull, wait a few seconds, then flip so the pets have the back)<br />
<br />
As to losing agro once I've got it...with the GSoT this hardly ever happens unless the casters start serious blasting from the start (i.e.;  time is short so they do full nukes at 90%.)  But, even then the GSoT does a decent job holding/getting back agro if I'm hasted.  If I use the SotB and CHoS combo, unless I get a bunch of early procs, the casters have to be more patient (hasted or not hasted.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe you're doing higher level dungeons or something <br />
<br />
Good point...usually grouped with 65s with vt/elemental gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zantaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've done about 25 adventures now and this is what I've noticed.<br />
<br />
I do 99% of the non-raid pulling as a warrior no matter where we go, and LDoN is no exception. On normal, with the groups I take, 3-4 pulls are fine, and agro is never a problem.<br />
<br />
On high mode though, agro is...tougher to manage. I have 41% haste, always have haste, and use a Blade of War and unless I have VoT on, I always have to watch my agro on my chanter hotboxed on the side, and nukers can pull it off of me. PoWater regura XP groups are 3x easier to manage agro than in LDoN High missions for me.<br />
<br />
Mobs like proximity much more than anywhere in PoP, and taught works well after a rage proc, only like 33% of the time otherwise.<br />
<br />
Still havin a blast tho!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Feysboil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can vouch for the fact that proximity is king in LDoN.  There are some times when I just can't seem to get aggro unless I'm right on top of the mob, at which point the mob will turn even if I don't taunt.  I make it a point to ensure that I'm always as close to a mob as possible when I'm MT.  When I stay face to face with a mob, I can  generally inch backwards in a circle and strafe slowly to position a mob for rogues/pets to get a mob's back.<br />
<br />
The problem is mainly when there's a lot of push (like BL pets).  It seem like in LDoN I never manage a complete lock on a mob's attention until that mob is well under 50% (using CHoS and BWoWD or Fleshsear Cleaver with a 50pt Fire dd aug - I usually swap out for the faster fleshsear as soon as the BWoWD procs Guard II, then swap it back after a minute or two to get a fresh proc).  That means I can never reposition a mob (move it to the other side of a room, for instance) until very late in the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is my opinion that DPS is agro in this game anyways.<br />
I have a very regular group and they have all told me I hold and gain agro alot more efficiently using my Great Staff of 4 Winds over my 2 1 hand slashers.<br />
I have bagged my Blade of Carnage and Bone bladed battlehammer combo in favor of the DPS weapon that gains and holds agro alot better.<br />
I swap in my Prismatic sword for the avatar proc then put the GSo4W back in and kick arse.<br />
