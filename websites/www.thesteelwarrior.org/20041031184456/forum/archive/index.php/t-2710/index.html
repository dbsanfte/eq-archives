<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This isn't realy an issue for warriors as much, but I'm wondering if any of the parsers know the answers:<br />
1) Is it exactly like melee damage, even though archery damage is non melee?<br />
2) Is Atk the main determinant, ,and therefore max str important?<br />
3) I'm pretty sure dex affects crits in bow usage<br />
4) Does haste affect bow delay?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have formulaes on Bow damage comparable to the exact formulaes we have on weapon damage?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jarrae Halliwax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm pretty sure dex affect damage.  <br />
<br />
I'm curious how quiver haste stacks (or doesn't stack) with other perm haste too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So I went over to the ranger board because the only time I used a bow to kill something was when I was killling green guards in east commonlands.<br />
<br />
1: More or less: you have to have a Line of sight and there is no min damage, will not triger damage shields nor generate riposte dps, but other than that it kills them in the same.<br />
<br />
2: Uses dex and not str.<br />
<br />
3: Yes, for some strange reason I want to say it crits more than normal melee but I can't back that up at all.<br />
<br />
4: You can have one of every type of haste stack, that means Worn haste, spell haste, v3, and quiver haste all add up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jarrae Halliwax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey, that's good news on the haste.  Now that you mention it, I do seem to see more crits with my bow.  1 in 4 maybe.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm crazy, but I love to use my bow.  I'll lob as many arrows into a mob as I can as they run up from the pull.  Gets me a head start on aggro and if I'm lucky enough to get my bow to proc, that really does make difference.<br />
<br />
What's really slow is skillups.  I'm lucky to get one skillup for every 400 arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I switched to magic arrows i skilled up quite fast.  Might wanna try that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One reason I posted it here is cause wife's toon is ranger, and the ranger boards all seem like speculation and no data.<br />
Can anyone confirm that Bow Damage depends only on Dex?? That seems absurd to me. Crit % yes, but damage?? NOt ATk, or str??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sylviania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wold what ranger board u use ? go to The Ranger's Glade (http://forums.interealms.com/ranger) for a ranger board. <br />
archery depend on DEX the SAME way melee depend on STR... and as well as dex as no effect on melee, str has no effect on archery. (special : procs and crits, based on dex for both melee and archery)<br />
It is a known thing that has been tested / parsed, and if there is no more data on it, it is mostly because noone wanna do it again.<br />
<br />
for more , read varaho post<br />
<br />
about crits : crits rate on archery for war and rngs = crit rate on melee for war iirc (we had parses about that on the glade, must dig a bit to find them)<br />
<br />
about damage : <br />
the easiest way to know archery damage : like any weapon, a bow + arrow will have a damage/delay : total damage is sum of bow damage and arrow damage, and the same thing apply for delay (well, in fact delay = bow delay because until now, all arrows have 0 delay). <br />
The fact is damage calculation does not work the same on archery and on melee, but the difference is simple : with a given weapon damage, archery will do 2 times less damage than melee. <br />
Meaning a 20damage bow with a 2 dmg arrow will do the same damages than a 11 dmg weapon (with a 0 DB). fact is delay will prolly be more important, and u will lose the melee DB.<br />
Meaning also that all formulas u use for melee will apply to archery if u use ((bow dmg + arrow dmg) /2) instead of (wpn dmg) and DB = 0<br />
<br />
so for answers to the 1st post :<br />
1) Is it exactly like melee damage, even though archery damage is non melee?<br />
yes, but main stat is dex and not str, and the formula to know real damage, based on weapon damage, is a bit different.<br />
<br />
2) Is Atk the main determinant, ,and therefore max str important?<br />
1st part : ATK is exactly the same importance for archery than for melee. but str doesn't change archery atk, only dex does.<br />
(REMINDER : the ATK value shown in EQ is the MAIN HAND MELEE ATK only, and does not apply to offhand nor to archery. off hand and archery atk are calculated the same way than main hand atk, but use their own values for skill ( slashing/piercing/archery) and for stat ( str used also for off hand, but dex for archery). yes, +atk item does influence archery atk.)<br />
so the answer to the 2nd part is : no , max str not important at all, but max dex will be (and will also give more procs and more crits, and more skillups)<br />
<br />
3) I'm pretty sure dex affects crits in bow usage<br />
yes, same way it effects crits in melee<br />
<br />
4) Does haste affect bow delay?<br />
same way it effects melee. But archery uses one more kind of haste, stacking with the others : quiver haste (QH). it follows the same rules than all the other kinds of haste : only the best QH is used if more tahn one apply. To have a QH, u just need to have a Weight Reducing quiver in the inventory.<br />
QH = WR of the quiver / 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If  this has been parsed,  can someone direct me to the sticky of this analysis?<br />
They are saying that although raising your str as a ranger visibly increases your atk rating,  it has no effect on your bow, even though if you boost your atk with a spell, it does. So does this mean ranger atk buff doesn't affect their melee damage? Or are you saying ranger atk buffs affect BOTH melee and archery, ,but str only affects melee atk, that is a very complicated system.<br />
Hard to believe there are two separate atk calculations.<br />
I'd like to see the original data on this! Also, has this been rechecke dpost Luclin,  when the major ranger archery changes occurred?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sylviania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wold : no, that mean, like i previously said, that the ATK number shown under EQ is only the one for MAIN HAND MELEE WEAPON. It does NOT influence your off hand or range attack. <br />
best proof is to play with something that is not a weapon in main hand : H2H skill is used to calculate shown ATK value, but off hand and range attack are not at all effected and u still hit as much with them.<br />
<br />
There is not 2, but 3 separate atk : the main hand, the off hand, and the range<br />
<br />
main hand and off hand atk follows the same rules : based on offence, weapon skill, and str. <br />
<br />
range atk is calculated the same way, but instead of using the STR it uses DEX. <br />
That mean everywhere STR is used for calculation of melee atk, u use dex for range atk<br />
<br />
atk buffs and +atk items of course effects the 3 values<br />
<br />
for the parses, I am not even sure they are still there ( big cut through our boards a few monthes ago, a lot of things were lost), and i am too lazy to try to find them. I am just giving u the result : for range, str has no effect on damage output, but Dex seems to have the effect str should have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The major archery changes occured during Kurnak.  Anything since then has just be additions to the ability (Endless Quiver, Archery Mastery, arrows, bows, etc), but the major changes to the way archery works revolved around implementing Trueshot and changing the skill after introduction to alter the way bows worked with the skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Imgrunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know warriors are not real archers but common :)<br />
<br />
 Bow max damage is based on STR not DEX , i have 2 ranger BOTH with same gear , one has more dex , one has more str , the one with more str has a higher BASE damage , the one with more dex has more crits. FACT :)<br />
<br />
<br />
 Edit :  ow yea , git your ranger a shaman str buff to see :) had me one and added over 10 to my max damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lol<br />
well there you go. <br />
Of course warrior has way diff damage table, with max (240) archery skill I usually miss or hit for peanuts</div></div><hr />
