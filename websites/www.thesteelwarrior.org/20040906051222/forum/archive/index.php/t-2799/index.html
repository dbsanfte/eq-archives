<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Instead of adding new things, why dont SOE revamp some ability we already have ? those are :<br />
<br />
1 - disciplines (already treated 398 times so I wont argue again on those)<br />
2 - Skills : especially DISARM, the worse skill ever. Make it do something like delay the opponent attack. so if the mob have a delay of 25, his delay for 2 or 3 attacks after a successful disarm will be of 35-40 (for exemple)<br />
3 - AAs : some of our AAs could be revamped easilly. RAMPAGE could be a sort of toggle to allow us to AE fight (with a lowered delay). Warcry could use some added defense bonus (resists and ac).<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for idea #674880 !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Casters and hybrids have been getting hundreds of new things,<br />
as well as having them revamped and upgraded nonstop.<br />
Clerics even had their AAs revamped.<br />
And they got their whole spell system a gigantic upgrade.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile we got nothing... and I mean Nothing.<br />
<br />
After 5 years of getting nothing... why would you just want a change in our current 3 skills?<br />
Sure, change them if needed... but that's going to be very far from enough.</div></div><hr />
