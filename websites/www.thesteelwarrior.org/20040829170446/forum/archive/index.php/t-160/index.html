<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bodvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just dinged 50 last night and was wondering if I can do some turn ins for my epic now or was it lvl 51 before I could do that.  Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm fairly sure it's just 50</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zukobim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am fairly sure its 51.<br />
My chanter could not get some items untill he was 51 and it fits the kunark expansion that introduced the epics pretty well, since it was the one that raised the level limit from 50 to 60, so a level 51 would have to own the kunark expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's possibly I'm wrong, easiest way to tell would be to go up to whichever accepts whatever you're turning in and see if they will give you the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't rely on what level other classes can do their epic turn-ins but, as Hussar pointed out, go talk to the NPC's yourself. For example, you can't get a rogue epic till level level 50, but you can get a druid epic at level 46/47 (the right-click effect won't work till 50, but you can still get the leaf-blower at 46/47).<br />
<br />
Basically, it's different for a lot of the classes, and to add insult to injury, your own quest NPC may tell you to go hunt rats for a while longer, but they may talk to a like-level PC from another class; he may not give them the item or allow a turn-in, but he'll talk. (BTW, I'm referring to that Redblade guy in Freeport...he told my level 5 warrior mule to take a hike, but spoke at length about broken instruments with my level 5 bard...go figure.)</div></div><hr />
