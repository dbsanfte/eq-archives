<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMO the aggro weapon list which btw can be found in the library needs updating.<br />
<br />
Some of the weapons found there really ought to be removed. They were originally included because aggro weapons for Warriors were few and far between and a Weapon that generated any aggro with decent dmg/dly was vastly preferred to those that did not.<br />
<br />
Low end weapons like Sword of the Bloodsworn, Copper Hammer of Striking, and Great Staff of Thunder have squeezed out items like Frostbringer, Gualradek, etc. IMO.<br />
<br />
As a rule of thumb preference order is weapon that generate hate directly, stuns, and then probably slow.<br />
<br />
Still, it's one of the very best looking weapons in the game and if I had to choose between it or a GSoT (very fugly) there would be no contest in my mind.<br />

Nice try, but if you'll read it again, he says that 50ac beats the greatstaff of thunder.<br />
<br />
Which it does, since I recall a big ol' zero AC on the greatstaff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Serameth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for all the replies!<br />
<br />
Currently I use G,SotS for my 2hs.  Lost out on the SEWS about 4 times.<br />
<br />
my 1hs combo is BoC/Jaelens.  I know Jaelens isn't a good aggro weapon but I was 3rd on server to have one (or so I was told).<br />
<br />
A lot of the weapons listed are way beyond what I can get.  I no longer raid with my old guild due to time constraints.<br />
<br />
Reason I asked is because I seem to have problems with initial aggro, and that wasn't a problem 5 months ago when I quit.  Mezzed mobs get Incite, taunted, kick + attack but still get aggro maybe 1 out of 3 or 4.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Klozz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You need to SUCCESSFULLY taunt first and then incite.  You'll then find that you are then on the top of the hate list.  If you incite and then taunt unsuccessfully, you do not have sufficient hate to get the attention of a mezzed mob.  Incite alone is not enough.  You still have to have a successful taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nice try, read the thread, the poster is asking about AGRO, not overall use. the weapons i listed have better AGRO and as AGRO being the criteria for my judgement i dont care if gaudralek has 50 AC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have an anger 3 auged Gaudralek and it is awesome for aggro. I enjoyed it before it was auged also. And while I do have better aggro weapons I still find I may pull out Gaudralek. Why? While it may not produce the best aggro in my weapon bag it may produce enough for the occasion. Coupled with this, 50 ac, and looks(as some have mentioned already) - it's been a good weapon for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ah, and you've determined the Greatstaff of thunder has better aggro how?<br />
<br />
Oh that's right, you fucking haven't.<br />
<br />
A stun is a stun, and anyone who's got an IQ above severely retarded will choose a stun with 50ac over a stun with 10ac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">According to Lucy, Gaudralek (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31305) doesn't proc a stun, but merely a DD (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1366). Going by that I'd guess GSoT aggro to be superior to Gaudralek's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true.  I've used Gaudralek for years and found it to be &quot;okay&quot; at generating aggro but not really great.  One nice thing about it is that it does to some pretty hefty damage, or at least it did by the standards of the time it was introduced.  And if you get a good series of hits early in an encounter it will still hold aggro fairly well even without a proc.  I prefer it over the GSoT myself.  I won't claim there is a scientific rationale to it, but I just find for me it works better, completely my subjective opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">OK, nice, clean and simple Haass; and i'll even try my damndest to talk down to you as much as you like to talk down to others here with your 'superior knowledge'.<br />

I told all in the thread to chill the fuck out because you were sounding like a bunch of sniveling jacktastic fuckwits. Also; noted too; is that I said the topic of discussion was the only thing permissible to continue the thread; but no; your inclusions of continued stupidity just had to be known to all who contributed to the thread.<br />
<br />
Look chief; I couldn't give a flying rats ass if you need to have the last word in all conversations. I don't need to; don't want to; and simply will not allow it to happen when I say it wont; because ( unknown to you ) .. I said the hijacking has gone far enough. You felt the urge to continue; and I did as promised.<br />
<br />
Thing is; I will; and always; follow through with what I say. And on your whole discussion of my position here at TSW......if you honestly think you can use that as a fulcrum to base your entire arguement on...you need to go back home and think up a new attack because it's just too infantile to even take seriously.<br />
<br />
So, in closing; if you got a problem with me ( or anyone else ) who thinks you just need to chill the fuck out yourself and read the shit you babble on about....i suggest you go PM those in question.<br />

Don't litter up my forum up with your drivel. Keep it here in the Outhouse where you can spew shit out of your mouth until the cows come home.</div></div><hr />

Ticked off that what I said was basically ignored? Yeah. I'd go as far to say that. It's somewhat annoying that some of the more vocal and opinionated people who post here ( especially Haass ) choose bullying and badgering to get their point across rather than using their straighforward reply. Also; I really think Haass can be very straightforward and blunt with his responses; his choice of non-sugar coating responses is something more people need. But where do we draw the line? Is cursing and badgerng warranted? <br />
<br />
So basically; I apologize for flying off the handle there. But for pete's sake there is only one forum here where there is no limit to what is said...and it wasn't the one this topic was originally in.</div></div><hr />

there are a lot of weapons that semm to have a proc that is called &quot;flame shock&quot; &quot;ice shock&quot;, or xxx shock.  But if you look at further description there is no stun just dd proc.

<br />
Right, but Force Shock is not Ice shock.  It's not flame shock, and it's not lightning shock, or shell shock or what have you.  Force shock is a DD/Stun, and even the emote on Rage of the Sky is the same as Force Shock.  So bleh :p</div></div><hr />

wow goyan, i had no idea that 50 AC is good for aggro!<br />

its a good solid weapon no doubt but it wont hold you over till a blade of war, many dual wield combos with BF/BoC/HG/GBoS would be better and 2 handers like anathema would be overall better off pre RZtW mobs<br />
<br />
Lets compare for the causal raider.  BF and HG? rare drops alone and a rare chance to attempt.  Easily eliminated off the bat there.  Either way, dual wield out aggros 2hs aggro anyway.  Whats the point in arguing boc/gbos case? Absolutely none<br />
<br />
Anathema?  Why would you honestly bid on that if BOW is around the corner.  Gaud is a solid weapon for the relative easy Lord V.  Can you honestly tell me Lord V is killed within 5 hours of popping every week? No<br />
<br />
43/38 50ac 100hp 179dd unresistable is nothing to chuckle at.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Using one aug'ed with Anger III currently.  Snap aggro can sometimes be a bit of a problem but on long fights, I rarely have issues holding aggro with it.  The 50 AC is great and its always handy when it procs interrupting gaters.  Once I polish off my ID, gonna invest in PB and some more WA which should hopefully improve snap aggro when using it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shall we take a poll how many have a bloodfrenzy banked?  Perhaps you are the one needing to think again.</div></div><hr />

I'm not on your server, but I didn't.  Believe it or not, there are people out there who took down RZTW without even bothering with Ssra, and never taking down AoW (ok, we killed him once, but I didn't get a BoC :p )<br />
<br />
An sorry for the derail =p I own a GSoS and I think it's pimp as hell, but it doesn't come close sadly to any of the newer agro weapons.  Definately points for style, points for looks, and points for kickin @$$ back in the day!</div></div><hr />

On Terris Thule Server tho I knew of one such pitiful individual ( i might be one of very few on all servers ) :D<br />
<br />
I upgraded from SotB/Red Epic/JBoW to a Blade of War. Hell, I was still 50% in Skyshrine Armour too !!<br />
<br />
( *note: i did have a BoC on loan from friends for raiding only )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">my point was simply that if you can take out RZtW then your guild will have aggro weapons that are better than gaudralek. but the point still remains that on bertoxx i cant think of any warrior with a BoW that didnt have an EB weapon before (RNG &gt; The Company!! :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">there is no other sword currently in game that even comes near the looks of the Gaudralek <br />
I guess that is one weapon-graphic that will always remain special to it's owner. uniqueness <br />
<br />
actually, Vinecutter (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10476) has the exact same graphic =)</div></div><hr />

Are you just saying out of what people consider two pretty swords emp sword is better, or are you trying to saying as weapons emp sword is superior? Cuz if your gonna say that I can just as easily say VDD &gt; Emp sword.  You're comparing two diff era weapons, and two diff difficulty of acquiring the weapons.  BTW BF &gt; CHoS, need I go on &quot;Weapon of choice?&quot; Also there is no &quot;opinion&quot; on whats better aggro and DPS, they are clearly testable over periods of time are determinable. <br />
<br />
Emp sword and Vinecutter graphics are definately cool, I personally like the Ornate Greatblade with the gold look, now if only they had a black/red flaming sword... and who the hell designed BoW and DBoW, probably plays a paladin in game.</div></div><hr />
