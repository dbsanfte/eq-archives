I have all my currently available defensive AA done (101 AA) and have set aside 11 now in hopes that Sturdyness makes it. But, if it don't, gonna get some nifty offensive instead :)</div></div><hr />

I dunno why the mods on this board and a few others are so anal about the NDA. Some interesting beta info might even generate a few more sales/pre-orders for the damn thing, which you would think SOE would appreciate.<br />
<br />
Really, I didn't understand it either. Then I thought about it and found myself wanting to reply to posts with information which would break the NDA. I've only moved one post for this reason, since I can't find the NDA atm to check it.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing though, is that a lot of people agreed to the NDA without thinking.  I'd bet a huge percent of the people in the beta couldn't define NDA for you if you asked them. It's a rule to protect the stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uthuk</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe any NDA is pretty easy?<br />
<br />
Don't talk about anything concerning any Beta, that's common sense.<br />
<br />
The only thing this will do is to start huge threads of people that have heard Bill say that Joe say that Jill said and it is almost always wrong or at least incomplete.<br />
<br />
Beta is there for a reason to try out stuff, but when you try out stuff it just hurt everyone when people leak that information. The reason is simple, if the devs can't trust that their &quot;new&quot; features isn't leaked to every major fansite during beta they will just implement it untested or far too late to make any adjustments.<br />
<br />
In short, leaking information about unfinished material just hurts the state of the game tobe released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to put a little &quot;legal&quot; color on the argument that the person posting didn't break the NDA, so all is OK.<br />
<br />
Let's say Joe signs an NDA about GoD.  Bill knows that if he posts publicly, he can be sued for breaking the NDA.  So Joe says to Bill, hey Bill, I can't post about GoD, but you didn't sign an NDA, so you can post.  How about I tell you what I know, and you post it?  He does, and Bill posts.<br />
<br />
If all of that happens, SoE has a potential case against Bill for tortious interference with contract.  Also, SoE can sue &quot;John Doe&quot;, an unnamed person who violated the NDA, and then subpoena Joe, and force him to say, under oath, who told him about GoD, and whether he and Joe had conspired to break the NDA.  Once Bill is forced to cough up the name (and he can't refuse to answer, that would result in him being held in contempt of court), SoE could substitute Joe's name for John Doe's in the lawsuit, and go after poor Joe from there.  <br />
<br />
Will SoE do this?  Probably not, for several reasons.  First of all, the cost of enforcing the NDA would be greater than the value of nailing Joe, and perhaps Bill too, to the wall.  Second, the publicity would be negative.  If SoE really cared, they'd probaby send Joe a nasty e-mail from their lawyers, threatening all the terrible things that could happen to him if he doesn't keep his mouth shut.  And finally, minor breaks in the NDA, particularly as the release of GoD approaches, are actually in SoE's interest.  It raises curiosity and interest in GoD, gets word of mouth moving, and makes it more likely that SoE will sell more copies of GoD.  <br />
<br />
However, please don't say that everyone is in the clear, simply because the person who did the actual posting hasn't signed an NDA.  It's just not true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it is something that SoE likes and is amazing, but is broken at the moment. Mythic or whoever hears of the &quot;killer app&quot; and goes ahead and replicates it correctly before SoE can get on it.<br />
<br />
It doesnt really work in this case, as the info will be leaked 500,000,000 ways to sunday and that SoE doesnt even check to see if you are an employee of one of those companies most likely, but that is the spirit of the thing.<br />
<br />
anyhoo, its not really a big deal, OTHER than the fact that you sign your name to it, which in a perfect world means a lot even without the potential penalty of legal repercussions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This NDA talk is ridiculous:  we are talking about the SEVENTH  release add-on to a mature game.  The development cycle is months not years.  To claim there is tangible intellectual capital at risk is preposterous (I work in the securities industry).<br />
<br />
In short, leaking information about unfinished material just hurts the state of the game tobe released. <br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
Tangible user feedback by a larger audience is bad?  <br />
<br />
Arguing that &quot;that will lead to them releasing half baked goods&quot; is well... kinda equally ridiculous given the Verant/SoE track record over 4 years.  This is EXACTLY what they have done (see umbra technology in SoL or even more recently the vaunted Casino functionality)<br />
<br />
All that being said I can see the SW moderators points: out of respect for SoE trying to keep screen shots/detailed inside information off this board is a &quot;gentlemanly&quot; thing to do.  However, don't try to rationalize it by claiming there are national defense secrets in it (omg &quot;leak&quot; is this friggin Watergate?)<br />
<br />
Tangent: I think discussion of the tribute system would be extraordinarily healthy in ADVANCE of the release by a larger population.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I can understand why SoE imposes an NDA on beta participants.  They have an office-ful of lawyers imagining highly unlikely, barely plausible circumstances in which it could conceivably be valuable to have an NDA in place.  When the lawyers start throwing these doomsday scenarios around, the business people get risk averse and decide that it's better to have a worthless NDA.  After all, getting an NDA is standard operating procedure.  You aren't going to be fired for continuing a standard practice, but there are those highly unlikely circumstances in which you could get fired for not getting people to sign an NDA.</div></div><hr />

I can't give firm name but I'm a manager in the enterprise data management of a firm in downtown NY (about a block from NY Stock Exchange).  Used to manage trading floor systems (including the dreaded NASD compliance systems).<br />

Ya man by no measure was I meaning to show you any disrespect.  Your point is absolutely correct...there is little practical reason they would harrass folks over the NDA.  I was just venting frustration :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I worked in the computer game industry at one pont for many years. The NDA is exactly what it says. A company has a variety of reasons to ask people to sign NDA's. In exchange for signing people are seeing product before it is released.<br />
<br />
Hypothetical example -<br />
Think for a moment about WoW. Imagine it has a real neat feature that will differentiate it from other products. Bob signs the NDA, tells Bill about the feature, and Bill tells Bert who works for SoE. SoE says, hmm neat feature - let's put it in our next patch (btw as a designer this is one of the reasons why outside submission is avoided).<br />
<br />
Six months before that feature hits the store shelves it appears in a competing product. Depending on the circumstances and impact of an NDA violation a company could:<br />
<br />
1. Get back to the initial violator and sue his socks off.<br />
<br />
2. Decide to not allow anyone in the the outside Beta test program to test in the future - get a whole new group of outside testers.<br />
<br />
3. No longer do outside Beta testing.<br />
<br />
4. Only test parts of the product and withhold those exciting new features.<br />
<br />
Act like the NDA is meaningless, divulge information, provide a forum where such information is displayed publicly and you potentially affect a company's willingness to take a risk letting users see a product ahead of time and incorporating their feedback.<br />
<br />
There are professional third party Beta testers - they'd be glad to play EQ2 while y'all do not.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to clear up any confusion given my experiance.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Geeze....<br />
<br />
Okay I have tested some of the past expansions in beta for EQ but not this one. So I got lazy:)<br />
<br />
However I can tell you that there are 2 good reasons for NDA's.<br />
<br />
1.  To keep your competition from getting the jump on you.<br />
<br />
2.  To keep the public from receiving too much MIS-information as everything in BETA WILL NOT make it to the actual expansion.  So if too much garbage information is released to the general public before the expansion is released then there is a possibility that the general public may expect a lot of things that are not released.<br />
<br />
Also around 1-2 weeks before the actual release for the expansion the NDA will most likely be lifted and quite a bit of information will be released by players who did the beta testing.  This will also provide an extra boost to both first time sales and repeat customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you say is reasonable, Battleblade.<br />
<br />
However, SoE has gone through several expansions, and to the best of my knowledge they've used third party, unpaid beta testers for each one.  To the best of my knowledge, they've also gotten beta testers to sign an NDA for each expansion.  In spite of that, we all know that information has gotten out ahead of the date on which the NDA is lifted, for each and every expansion.  Have you ever heard of them suing someone over violation of the NDA?  So we know that:<br />
<br />
1.  People are violating the NDA;<br />
2.  It doesn't appear that SoE is suing anyone over it; and<br />
3.  SoE continues to use its customer base to do beta testing.<br />
<br />
Given all of that, it seems unlikely that the sort of disclosures that come up in this sort of forum would affect SoE's willingness to use its customers as beta testers in the future.  Particularly since we are so close to the release date (three weeks or so) already.</div></div><hr />
