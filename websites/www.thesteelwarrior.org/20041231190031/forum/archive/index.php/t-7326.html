<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up teleport foe as a power last night, and for the life of me I can't seem to get the damn thing to work.  I targetted several different types of mobs at various ranges and every time I pushed the button a white circle surrounded the button but nothing else happened.  No teleport, no message saying you're out of range, no message saying you can't teleport that kind of target, no message saying hey dumbass you don't use me like that, nothing.  So what gives?  How am I supposed to use it if it's not by pushing the crappy little button?  And what am I supposed to using it on if it's not cheesy outcasts and various other trash?</div></div><hr />

I think they are two differant powers that only work on with either yourself or the foe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if I certainly hope that in some delusional state I didn't click on recall friend when I meant to get teleport foe, I'll have to double check on that just to make sure.  But I &quot;thought&quot; it was teleport foe I selected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I figured it out.  It seems that when you target a foe and push the teleport foe button you have to take the additional step of left clicking where you want the foe to show up.  I was expecting the mob to just port right next to me, rather than my having to use the mouse to tell it where to land.  Maybe it's just me but that doesn't seem very intuitive given the description they give for the power.  Or maybe I'm just having a slow day *shrug*.</div></div><hr />
