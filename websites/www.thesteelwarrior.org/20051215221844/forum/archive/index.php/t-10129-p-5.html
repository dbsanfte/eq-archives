Horde outnumber Alliance 10 to 8 (or 5/4) on your server<br />
<br />
Any idea how accurate that data is?  The reason I ask is it shows close to 1 million subscribers...which seems high.  (or does that include European beta testers?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are about 1 million characters, not accounts.<br />
<br />
Consider even FF11 has 2.5 characters on average in Japan and it costs $1 for each character beyond the first one, it's not exactly a stretch to assume the average player has at least 2 characters.  Now obviously wowcenseus isn't able to capture every player in WoW but 500K subscribers seems like a reasonable guess based on the # of observed players.<br />
<br />
From what I know WoWcensus simply does a ton of /who (since /who is limited at 49) to cover the entire server (e.g. /w 1 troll shaman and so on) whenever someone runs it and then updates the people it pulls to the database, adding any new person it sees.  This won't get everyone on the server, obviously, but there's no reason to believe that the alliance just happens to be all on whenever anyone runs WoWcensus so the alliance to horde ratio should be pretty accurate.</div></div><hr />

Wow.  Interesting information, if correct.  From my own anecdotal experience, I'd certainly concur that hunters far far outnumber paladins on the Alliance side.</div></div><hr />

It seems they tally their population via cosmos.  The UI program Cosmos sends them data and it counts alts as well.  Granted this is only people using cosmos so a good majority isn't counted (I dont believe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is wrong.  The census just runs a /who script.  It'd be stupid to do anything else to determine the number of players.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's too incredibly smart, cross referencing..etc. Thottbot does get its data from cosmos tho.<br />

On topic however, I'm having a blast in WoW, no complaints here. My rogue is really starting to get fun. They do some sick DPS, and I can stil tank elites in a pinch at 21. Not that I do that a lot, but I have been lately due to quests. Its so nice not having to have a healer in tow everywhere I go. I hope it lasts.</div></div><hr />

Not only does it last, but rogues start ramping up in power in the 20s, it only gets better from where you are. :)</div></div><hr />

Just a hint....mining is the most lucrative tradeskill there is in the game.<br />
<br />
IE, a stack of copper still sells for 50s in the AH.  You can imagine the higher level ones.<br />
<br />
Just a tip for you who have trouble saving for horses....put down the smithing and sell your mined goods.</div></div><hr />
