<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read awhile back that something was mentioned at the fan faire like, the taunt button was put in the game and it should work... (way paraphrased and from memory)<br />
<br />
No one that I read has posted a summary from the FF.<br />
<br />
Has this been expanded on in any way shape or form, was there ever a follow up?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnok</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was at the vegas fanfaire and attended all 4 (i think) dev discussions. Your typical 'warriors aer teh suk' question came up and he did say 'If we give you a taunt button, it should probably work.' He also mentioned that warrior agro is broken as compared to the knight classes. His fix all response was that they will be revisiting melee balancing now that the caster balancing is over. I would be completely happy with a 'kick to the nads' ability that would suck all the mana from the nearest chain stunning paladin. I guess I'll just wait and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was the guy in the last session who asked them point blank if they think melee are balanced in power compared to casters. All 4 of them admitted they were not.<br />
<br />
The next round of changes are supposed to be in response to this disparity. I'm in &quot;wait and see&quot; mode.</div></div><hr />
