As a smith there is no limit to the amount of Mith I can use, and that is without the Mithril order talking to me. Add the fact that (as a given) I help gear guild warriors and hunters and 60 mith is nothing. I am using 56 to make 2 weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pretty much do what Haass does.  Friends and I say what quests we have, what instances do ya wanna hit etc., then we go do something.  I've seen a TON more content than I ever would have alone.  A lot of times quests aren't shareable because they have pre-requirements.  (kill X amount of blah then you get step 2 which is go to uber instance_01 and do...whatever)</div></div><hr />

And I'm only 28 , could someone tell me any other place's where I can go ?<br />
<br />
I'd check out any remaining higher level quests that may be worth it in Ashenvale.  I'd also recommend going north above Wetlands, including Arathi Highlands (Stromgarde Keep has some nice quests), Hillsbrad Foothills, Alterec Mnts. <br />
<br />
In a few levels you can hit of Desolace and Stranglethorn Vale - which keep you busy for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive seen much mention of Desolace, however Ive never been.  I picked up a quest to go there awhile back but never found the time.  Ive been splitting my time between Tarren Mill/Hillsbrad/Alterac and Hammerfell.  Im currently in Hammerfell but my quests there are Red/Orange.  Is Desolace a good place to build a couple more levels then come back to Hammerfell?<br />
<br />
Thanks folks.</div></div><hr />

If you're not adverse to grinding, the ogres at the Vul'Gol or whatever ogre mound are quite nice until about....32!</div></div><hr />

You think you're the only smith in the game?<br />
<br />
Might wanna rethink that statement.</div></div><hr />

You can experience content solely that you or your friends figure out by traversing the world. I and others will talk about locations and do research outside the game. At the end we'll compare notes <br />
<br />
So now would be a bad time to say that we got quests to go to Blackfathom deeps (Which was a shitload of fun..especially when the shammy lit 2 lanterns at once), and Gnomeregan, despite being Horde? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't care if you got quests to go there or not.  Doesn't change the fact that I didn't get quests to go to Wailing Caverns or Kraul or Shadowfang in the &quot;normal course of business.&quot; <br />
<br />
We actually lit all the laterns - figured it was required in order to open the door.  And then we all promptly died.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, sure, now he says it was fun.  I believe your words during and after said event was something more along the lines &quot;DON'T FUCKING TOUCH SHIT UNLESS WE ARE ALL READY GOD DAMN IT&quot;.  Orders I promptly ignored; must touch shiney things.</div></div><hr />

Also, ogres are petty much the gimps of the WoW universe it seems, I grind off them any chance I get. I've had to grind out  my past 2-3 levels solo, (ditched my two box for a bit to catch up with my guild so I can raid) and an even level Ogre Magi at 44 will die in four or five swings.  I read on the FoH boards they had a thread about strait grinding, unfortunately their site seems to be down right now.i</div></div><hr />

Still go to Desolace for the &quot;In the name of the light&quot; quest, which results in a win weapon for the level from SM!<br />
<br />
And ogres pretty much are the gimps. Half the time, they hit for LESS than their human counterparts, plus they often have less AC!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ogres are easy because they've a high percentage of mage/warlock types.<br />
<br />
The regular melee types hit every bit as hard as normal mobs, maybe even harder (Arathi ogres come to mind as especially bad).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice trick if your a warlock for killing casters (npc) is to use curse of the wreckless and then fear, almost 90% of the time they forget they have spell books as long as they are feared and you can force them to melee, and they wont run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in Desolace for quite a few levels and found tons of quests there. The &quot;light&quot; quest is important for SM, as someone mentioned, but there are probably a good 5-10 additional quests in Desolace and only three of them actually involve being underwater.  Of course I loved the zone also because half the shit there is skinnable.  Same with Stranglethorn, which is IMO the best low 30's to low 40's place to hunt.</div></div><hr />
