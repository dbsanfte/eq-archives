Every time we level up, we see an number of our stats going up. At least for Stm and Int, they do not have the expected effect of more HP/Mana. <br />
<br />
I figured that maybe they act as buffer stats, so that when debuffs land, less is lost. THat is not true either. <br />
<br />
Then add to that the base stamina you have--the first 20 points--do nothing for you. <br />
<br />
So the stat ups we get have NO visible benefit, or desernable benefit to the player. Your high stats--particularly stamina--means nothing. <br />
<br />
To me its a fundimental breach of trust--the numbers Blizzard give you don't mean squat. The are placebo or a rope-a-dope. And we are the dopes.</div></div><hr />

Sounds alot like EQ when it was released.  No one knew what AC did, or how Agi effected it.  Serp Bracer, anyone?  Atk?  It was nonsense, etc, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So where does it say that your base stamina will add 10hp per point?<br />
<br />
I just wanna be clear on where we're being lied to.<br />
<br />
When I level, I gain 62hp, and some other stats.  I don't give a fuck about those stats, all I know is that my helm is 15 sta and it gives me 150 hp.   Honestly, I don't give a fuck what it says when I level up..I get what they give me.<br />
<br />
Would you feel better if they didn't give you any free stats upon leveling?</div></div><hr />

<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Do we have all the in-depth info?  Nope, and I dont need it.  Im having a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what you are saying. When my rogue levels up, he gets like 17 hitpoints i think. Everytime I add sta from gear or spells, I gain 10 hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From Attributes: <br />
<br />
Stamina: Stamina effects your hit points no matter what class you play. However, characters designed to absorb damage, such as warrior and paladins gain more benefit from stamina than classes that have other capabilities, such as rogues and druids, who in turn gain more benefit than pure casters, such as mages. <br />
<br />
When in fact, the base 20 and every point you get from leveling add no benefit and everyclass benefits equally from race bonus and item stamina. <br />
<br />
But I am bothered that they are telling you are getting a benefit that in fact, gives nothing.<br />
<br />
The rogue is a great example:<br />
<br />
At level 2 a rogue will get +1 stm and + 17 hp.<br />
At level 3 a rogue will get 0 stm and+ 17 hp.<br />
<br />
And yes Haass I rather not get meaningless stats upon leveling up. Its the honest way of dealing with people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe this is pretty old news.<br />
<br />
The stats you get at level up have a very very very minor impact.  The seem to be there for padding against debuffs mostly.  Dont think anyone is 100% sure why they did this, but this is the way they did it.<br />
<br />
They rigged it so you get all your HP's from your gear's stats and not your innate stats.  Also, even though we do not get any HP increase for the sta points we are awarded at level up, I do believe the HP bonus is larger than other classes.  Not by a helluva a lot, but the games still young ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, they don't provide buffers against debuffs. I thought that too--and then I started to watch my stats when stm was debuffed. They work on the good stamina and ignore the useless stamina. <br />
<br />
The level up HP are bigger (we start at a base of 19 HP/level). Just to be technical (and weird) your base 20 don't count for HP, but your racial bonus stm (the number of points over 20 at 1st) do count for HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't necessarily incorrect.<br />
<br />
A tank benefits more from HP than a caster.  That's always been the case.  Why?  Because the tank gets hit more.  It might just be saying that &quot;Hey, knucklehead noob..if you're playing a melee, you might wanna look at the gear that adds stamina, and if you're not, look for other stats that might help your character out a little more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is a very viable way that could be interpreted.</div></div><hr />

good to know ;)  I gotta wonder, since I've never seen a debuff this strong, what the effect is once you are taken down past the number of sta points you have from gear.  Like say you have 50 sta points from gear, and you get debuffed -60 sta, whats that extra -10 gonna do?<br />

so you are saying the first 20 sta for all races means nothing but anything over that you get some hp per sta point?  Hehe I'm glad I picked a Tauren.</div></div><hr />

Take off all your gear.<br />
<br />
Go fight an elder mesa buzzard in Arathi (or some such similar creature with an effect).<br />
<br />
Get Fevered Fatigue<br />
<br />
Record results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably easier to do some duel testing--though I don't know how strong PC debuffs are. <br />
<br />
And no, the first 20 stm for every race and class and any stm from leveling up are useless/give no known benefit. The rest of your stamina, IE racial bonus and item stm all give 10/level. <br />
<br />
Haass while I don't disagree with your interpetation, I don't think most casual readers would read it that way. That interpretation only really suggests itself after you do some testing/reading of boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ahh yea, those damn buzzards.  Forgot about them.  I'll have to give that a try next time im in hammerfall and let you guys know what I find out.<br />
And no, the first 20 stm for every race and class and any stm from leveling up are useless/give no known benefit.<br />
somewhere on the WoW whine boards a mod posted that there is a benifit but its extreamly small.  might as well be nothing I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleh, fevered Fatigue is - spi and int.  <br />
<br />
I know there's a negative stamina effect out there somewhere.  Head crack is for sure, but it's duration is so short that it's not gonna be a good one to test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol I always assumed that the amount of hp extra you got was factored in with your stat increases too. You know, normally id get 16 hp, but with the extra stat point I now have 19 hp for this level! Ah well.</div></div><hr />
