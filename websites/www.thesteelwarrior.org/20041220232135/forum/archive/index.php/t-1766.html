<br />
then it shouldnt make any difference if u wait 12 secs to press taunt 2 times and then attack, or if u just taunt and attack ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason behind taunting twice is to account for failure.  Meaning, to ensure you have a greater chance at least one of the tuants got in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nowadays it's much easier to assist the mob to see if you have it's attention after a taunt attempt because of the 'switch to previous target' key. <br />
<br />
Double or triple taunt in the past was likely used on raids and in groups mostly because you had no way to get your target back without clicking on the mob again -  which can on occasion be a bit awkward if multiple mobs and other characters are around to mess up your targetting.</div></div><hr />

If the kick misses I can sometimes get another taunt in before kick refreshes. If it makes a run fo the chanter, then well I just hit taunt again and can usually get agro pretty easy.<br />
<br />
I get annoyed easily by waiting for taunt to refresh 2 or 3 times while it's mezzed. Sure it's only 12 or so seconds but it feels like an eternity :D</div></div><hr />

(Im lazy and usually don't have arrows, on top of that with my 56k where the mob is at isn't always accurate so I tend to miss the mob a lot if it's running)<br />
Just press taunt when it refreshes~ For mezs I taunt once, then once taunt is up I break and taunt again if it isn't on me.<br />
oh and that /assist shit doesn't work 100%. I've had it on the caster and hit me, I've had it on me and hit the caster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FD-tagged?<br />
<br />
I've done test, disarm does not generate aggro. It' flips some switch that says you are on the mobs aggro list, but other than that nothing. ( BTW the first person on a mobs aggro list gets a bonus +x hate, and if a person is fd they are well dead in the mobs eye heh. )</div></div><hr />

I get argo every time with that.  If I lose agro to the slower I have that person hotkeyed with /shield &lt;name of slower&gt;.  I hit taunt twice during that and by the time /shield is over I have agro agian.   I only hit taunt when I lose agro or feel like I am about to lose it.  <br />
<br />
Here's a couple things to remeber that might help if your losing agro a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Always try and do some damage on the pull<br />
Stand as close as you can to the mob<br />
Use taunt when you think you might lose agro (e.g. when you see Ilovetoovernuke begins to cast a spell)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always taunt immediately after the initial slow (wether I lose agro or not), and immediately after any resisted slows. If other high-agro debuffs like tash or cripple are being thrown on I taunt right after they land or right after they are resisted. If there is an early CH coming for one reason or another I'll usually save up taunt until that lands as well, wether I lose agro or not. But anyway, after the initial slows/debuffs, my taunt button sits unused unless I lose agro. Getting the slowers/debuffers to be close to you and the mob when casting helps a ton in reacquiring lost agro too =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bearking</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">perhaps i overkill with the taunt button :).  i am always hitting taunt wether it is time or not.  I play regularly with a 60 shammy and after he is done doing his thing he may gain aggro for a moment - but i can quickly regain aggro with constantly pressing taunt/kick.  I am kinda like a druid and their forage key LOL.  Anyway breaking mezzes i taunt twice and kick - if the mob goes for the chanter i taunt again and generally regain aggro.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jenguran</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On mezzed mobs, I taunt once, pause a couple seconds so it won't be an eternity before the button pops again, and then try to break mez with slam from behind the mob. If the slam lands, it usually stuns the mob since I'm behind it and gives me more time to gain agro just in case the taunt failed. For the mezzer to take a beating this way, I have to have a failed taunt and a missed slam, and even then taunt will be back up in 3-4 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you sit? Sit aggro is immediatly removed the moment you stand.<br />
<br />
I taunt, wait for taunt to refresh (or about) and then break. That way it's up if I don't have aggro already. But hey.. chanters have that no-reagent rune and shamans can take a hit or too. heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good idea Jenguran - I break mezzes with a macro that slams, attacks and calls assist automatically, but I'm ashamed to admit I hadn't thought of the slam-from-behind tactic.<br />

Going to be trying this out myself next chance I get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morgred</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Macro that has Taunt Kick and Disarm go off all at the same time.  Of course they only all go off if all of them are reset and ready to go.  I use this on mobs in the planes after slows have landed and have good success pulling mobs off my poor shammys in one attempt.  <br />
<br />
Disarm may not create much agro but it seems to work ok for me and I have no aggro procing weps.  This also tends to work on breaking mez because you taunt and do damage upon break.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The disarm argument has gone around for a while... so I just logged in to test it.<br />
<br />
I only used disarm 3 times, all on indiff mobs. 2 were unsuccessful, and the third I disarmed one of the guards in the nexus. Non of the mobs aggroed me. Whether they would have aggroed if I had kept doing it, I didn't test, but my assumption is, if Disarm is deemed hostile/aggroing inducing, by knocking the weapon out of a guard's hand, should he not have aggroed me?<br />
<br />
Breaking mezz, I always try to use multiple taunts and I always lead with a stun type attack (Slam/bash/kick) to get the extra couple secs of working on him.<br />
<br />
Taunt I only use when I think I have lost aggro (i.e. mob turns form me to Shammie).</div></div><hr />

Care to explain that?  Taunt doesn't do jack shit if the mob is beating on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klomck</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">taunt (if successful) gives you the aggro of whomever he is hitting, plus 1. if thats you, you wasted taunt. <br />
I hope you have a lucky 6 seconds until you get it back.<br />
disarm gives 1 point of aggro. try to disarm a green or non-kos, somewhere other than nexus, hehe... cant hit the mobs there, youll see. 1 point. use that button for something else imo. <br />
beg will only cause aggro if you roll the unlikely aggro, which decreases as skill raises. save that button too. <br />
<br />
In a fast-paced, zerg-the-mob-i-call raid, i taunt mezzed once, count to 3, SLAM from behind, if he aint lookin at me when he wakes up from slam (more often than not stuns now) i have taunt back. if its a mob that can OWN my chanter, i take the time to taunt, assist, assist... could probably make a macro to do that for me and use it all the time... ill do that today =)<br />
<br />
hope that helps you</div></div><hr />

I think what Aspit means is that by the time you see you lose aggro and want to taunt,the mob has run off and landed a double 500+ hit on your chanter/Shammy.<br />
That's why I as well hit taunt as soon as I see the &quot;Mob_01 yawns/slows down&quot; message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jenguran</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">taunt (if successful) gives you the aggro of whomever he is hitting, plus 1 <br />
<br />
That's a guess and a bad one, unless you work for Sony. Even if you did work for Sony, it would still be a guess ( based on the ignorant shit the dev team turns out).<br />
<br />
The leap in agro is probably somewhat higher than 1. Otherwise every time you lost agro to a monk, then regained it with a taunt, you would lose it again about 1 second later (unless you got lucky with a proc right after that taunt).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's inaccurate on two counts.<br />
<br />
1. As Jenguran points out, it's not +1; it must be some number a bit larger than that (but still a small one). Solinar/Hanadan has done tests showing this; he suspects taunt = top hate + 2*level<br />
<br />
2. &quot;aggro of whomever he is hitting&quot; can't be right either; it should be the hate of whoever was top on the the hate list, which is not necessarily the same person who has aggro (because of factors like proximity, etc). Hate =! aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;---- button masher since 1999<br />
<br />
I know that pressing the taunt key when you already have agro does nothing. I know slamming the keys harder doesn't make them more effective. Niether does getting closer to the screen and yelling at it. It won't stop me though. <br />
<br />
I've seen mobs spin as they turn to someone else, then switch right back to me as taunt goes off. I've seen mobs run OOR of a tank faster than they can reflex hit that unused taunt button. They then have a full cycle before the can get an 'in range' taunt. I've even tried extensive periods of waiting on taunt for the 'right' time. Feels like I'm slacking because I'm not mashing buttons, and I've noticed no additional benefit.<br />
<br />
If your mob is turning on the wrong person repeatedly, they deserve a slap from the mob to teach them to manage agro better. If it's not happening often, AET can solve that problem more reliably than taunt. I know people are gonna yell 'U R N3wB HAHA!!1!' because I mash buttons, but I'll just concentrate on tanking the last 3 remaining gods in PoTime and ignore them.</div></div><hr />
