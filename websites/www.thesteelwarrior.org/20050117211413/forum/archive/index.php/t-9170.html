The game has changed so much since I played my warrior with any seriousness that I don't even know where to start.<br />
<br />
I've picked up some things for him over the past couple years, but I don't know if I made good choices.  I don't play him often, but when I do I'd like to know that I am doing the best I can with what's available.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for huge and pricy upgrades.  Just what's acceptable for my level.  Appreciate any advice you can give.</div></div><hr />

Your ears/fingers are okay for now. You'll be looking at replacing the rings eventually, but the blood earring will keep you for a good long time.<br />
I don't know about dwarf-specific options, or what the agnostic armor is like for 'em.<br />
I'd get halas 10-pound meat pies and grobb liquidized meat. Cheap stat bumps.<br />
You BP is a little light; you might be able to find a different neck since you have other haste; your shoulders also seem a bit light to me.<br />
obviously, champions would be an upgrade for you if you were in Kael anyway, and apparently you know how to do the quest. Very cheap upgrades in some slots might be barbed ringmail (not sure dwarves can wear it but the shoulders, for example, have 19AC). Kylong shinguards are good. You'd need a bit of help, but the draconic pauldrons quest would result in a shoulder upgrade.<br />
Off the top of my head, my standard advice is to do the bazaar search thing.<br />
Lots of warriors like about 20 AC/level, which seems like a fairly good guide to me.</div></div><hr />

You sparked something for me.  I do have newer shoulders.  I picked them up in an LDoN adventure.  Can't remember the name, but I do have a few small updates to make to the Magelo.  Couple of resist augs to add and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I've got Kaladim Constitutionals and Halas 10lb Meat pies as well, jsut never added them.  Will do so.<br />
<br />
I figure I screwed up by not picking a deity, but not too badly.  I'll get by.  ;)</div></div><hr />
