<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harthina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to make a taunt hotkey that would allow me to actually say something at the same time as taunting.  However, the format of<br />
/taunt<br />
/gsay &lt;whatever it is I wanted to say while I taunted&gt;<br />
<br />
doesn't seem to work...I get something along the lines of &quot;this is an invalid command&quot;.  Is there a keyboard command for taunt, or is it something I just have to use the pre-made hot key for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fafrd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it would be <br />
<br />
/doability 3   (assuming taunt is the 3rd ability in your list)<br />
/gsay &lt;whatever&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/taunt isnt a command. use the /doability # command and play around till you figure out which ability Taunt is.<br />
<br />
That could get awful spammy though, I do see value in this - it could show just how unreliable Taunt really is, Shaman/Cleric are getting spammed by your Taunt macro yet the mob isnt budging... hmm Warriors might need some work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mmm good idea I thought Harthina.<br />
<br />
Unless you're taunting off a snaring ranger on every pull, if things are going well (fond hope) you shouldn't have to use this button THAT much, and it might help educate your groups as to how taunt's actually used.<br />
<br />
If you have a second tank in group it would give them a feel for when you've failed to taunt off a chanter too, so they can step in and help.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the post - I might just go and play around with this a little myself too  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Please don't do this.  Reasons:<br />
<br />
1)  Too much fooking spam, anyone thats even dinked around with a Warrior alt knows that every warrior is using their Taunt key.<br />
<br />
2)  This new SpamTaunt hotkey you make won't indicate when Taunt is ready to be used again. <br />
<br />
People will be /ignore'ing you in-group, I assure you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harthina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Darkoan, I wasn't planning on using the key every time I taunted...primarily for 1) when I'm main tank and taunting a mezzed mob before breaking it (I can't tell you how many times I've had..er...shall we say impatient young tanks break the mezz before me, so the mob made a bee-line for the chanter)...and again, not every time, just when I think it might be helpful for people to know....and 2) for roleplaying purposes...my character is a bit of a smart@$$ and I think it would make fights a bit more interesting if you can occasionally see just what the warrior is doing/saying to the mobs to taunt them.  <br />
<br />
And like Dakkin said, if things are going well and I'm holding aggro through fighting alone (which actually DOES happen when the casters know what they're doing), then I'll rarely have to taunt...and when I do it might help reassure a panicking caster and let them know that yes, I'm doing something about the big scary monster that's suddenly decided that they'd make a good snack....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe....I like this idea. Maybe a little bit of spam but hopefully there is a way to move it to another window. I would use it mostly for working with SK and Pali friends in guild so they could see just how reliable taunt is. Maybe once in a while in group whenever you get that one jerk that just doesn't believe you hit taunt at all.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1) when I'm main tank and taunting a mezzed mob before breaking it  <br />
<br />
What I always do is hail the mob. This lets everyone in earshot know what mob I have targetted. After a few mobs it also lets the others know that I'm prepairing to break mez momentarilly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Except in very specific circumstances, tanks only spam taunt if (a) they don't know what they're doing or (b) something's going wrong.<br />
<br />
Correctly timing taunt is an important event for a group, just like a complete heal or mez.<br />
<br />
Having tried it yesterday, it's nothing to be scared of and didn't lead to spam, but was much clearer than /hailing to identify the next mezzed mob, and and hopefully made the group more comfortable that I was doing my job when our chanter got aggroed.  It certainly made ME more comfortable.<br />
<br />
Also, when that substandard paly stunned himself into aggro and got bashed on bad, calling my taunt and then watching the mob flip onto me was VERY satisfying.  Made it clear there was a problem and I'd done something effective to fix it.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying everyone has to do it, but I liked it a lot, and I suspect it'd have been helpful for me if I was one of the other players in group too.</div></div><hr />
