<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kharse</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all- after a fun filled 44 levels together Kharse got himself deleted (gf was upset with me-) Anyway I thought for round 2 I'd try a Human or an Iksar Warrior. Stats are about the same and I think they both have decent looking models.<br />
(Except the Fungi tunic looks like plate on the Iksar-kinda cool).<br />
<br />
I am leaning towards Iksar but... <br />
1) How noticable IS the XP penalty? <br />
<br />
<br />
2)Am I going to be 60 with the Iksar when the Human (or another elf) would be 65?<br />
<br />
3)Also (and perhaps the wrong place to ask). My plans don't include a large raiding guild, (maybe no guild at all) I'd like to be able to solo (if needed) for a considerable part of the time until 65. Is a Shadowknight a better option?<br />
<br />
4)I do like the idea of being able to tank better, and like the idea of th warrior-but am I going to be able to solo higher end content with a warrior ? <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks (again) for any info and/or flames you can provide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do go with the Human I recommend getting a GLS until you get something with infra/ultra vision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think consensious is at end game doesn't matter what class you are .. pick the one you will have most fun playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really doesn't matter. Play both the class and race you enjoy. I play Iksar myself, but there is not a big difference. If you want to twink, go Human. <br />
<br />
60+ you most likely will not be soloing much for good exp. SK might be able to solo better, but you would have to go ask them. With a lot, a LOT, of utility items, you could solo some efficiently, but the warrior is a group oriented class. If you want solo and group while being a melee class, look at Bards, Beastlords, perhaps Ranger.<br />
<br />
Good luck in whatever you decide to do.</div></div><hr />
