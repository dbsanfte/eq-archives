<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From Here (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=60634) <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Welcome to the EQ Live Chat. We would like to thank you all for joining us here tonight. Tonight's topic of discussion will be Gates of Discord, we will be covering Gates features and answering Gates questions. If you would like your question to be responded to, please stay on topic.<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Private message me with questions you would like to suggest. <br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Joining us for this chat are, Paul Carrico, Brain surgery victim and Assistant Lead Designer, Jason Mash Assistant Lead Designer (and monkey boy) Ryan Barker the Spell Guy (just for you Magicians), John Troy, Designer, Oliver J. Smith Lead Designer and holder of the Nerf Bat, Jamey Ryan Lead Programmer and Bard breaker, Todd Schmidt Assistant Lead Programmer along with special guest, John Smedley.<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; Thanks for coming everyone. I am Paul Carrico, an assistant lead designer on EverQuest Live.<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; Hey everyone thanks for coming! I'm Ryan Barker, systems designer.<br />
&lt;JMash&gt; Hi everyone, thanks for coming! I am Jason Mash, an Assistant Lead Designer on the EverQuest Live team.<br />
&lt;jtroy&gt; Glad to see you all here. I'm John Troy, designer on EverQuest Live.<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Hi everyone. I'm Oliver J. Smith, the Lead Designer of EverQuest. Welcome to our chat.<br />
&lt;Hobart&gt; &lt;----- Todd Schmidt, Ass. Lead Programmer. Test Server Guy!<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; &lt;west02&gt; Is buying the expansion in the stores going to give you anything like LDoN did?<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; Hey all, I'm the Lead Programmer on EverQuest and the controller of the fun factor(haha)<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Yes. If you purchase the boxed copy of Gates of Discord you'll be getting an in-game item on launch day. This item will have a completely unique look.<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; &lt;----- John Smedley, President of SOE and giver-outer of Fiery Avengers<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Welcome Smed!<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Lisa_Veeshan* What is the concept behind the progression in GoD? Will it be like SoV where we work with 3 different factions? Or like PoP where we follow a storyline?<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Please excuse the amount of time it takes to answer these questions. We're answering them as quickly as we can. :)<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; The storyline continues the saga of the wayfaring brotherhood which was introduced in Legacy of Ykesha. You will be helping them explore the newly found continent of Taelosia. There will be a small amount of flags earned through the storyline but nothing as in depth as Planes of Power. The flags are directly related to the storyline but are a lot more forgiving than they were in the Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *depen_hoss* Will the 2nd installment of the melee revamp go live with GoD?<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; Another segment of the melee system is going to be going live with the next patch. It's not specific to Gates though. There's further additions to the melee system planned for the near future.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *LokshaldBrel* there are going to be 10 instanced zones, will there be points like LDoN, and will those points work in conjuction with LDoN points?<br />
&lt;jtroy&gt; No, the items in GoD will all be dropped and quested. The instanced zones will just allow multiple groups to experience some of the same content without blocking each other out.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Rilraak-Xev* Will GoD be the last expansion in EQ1?<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; No way. Big, big stuff planned and being worked on.<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; we've done a major engine revamp and plan on making that the basis for a lot of cool new stuff<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Raxinie* What is the targetted level range for GoD?<br />
&lt;jtroy&gt; Everyone will gain access to some of the new features, like Leadership Abilities and the Tribute system. The content is geared for 55+ characters, with quite a bit of it aimed at level 65.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Destructive* The battle cry line of effects looks very interesting and there is alot of speculation about how it actually works. The most common rumor is that it provides a type of over haste for the entire group that stacks with all other hastes. Can you please give us some insight on how the battle cry actually works?<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; The battle cry abilities do indeed provide a form of &quot;overhaste&quot; as well as an increased attack rating that will benefit the melee abilities of the entire group for a short time. It's just one of the advantages to have a berserker as part of your group.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Dyster* Will we be able to use our old no-drop items that are sitting in the bank as tributes for the new tribute system?<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; The tribute system does not allow no drop items to be turned into Tribute Masters for favor points.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Smed, where do you see EQ going in the future?<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; With EQ II coming out a lot of people have the idea we aren't going to continue to support EQ<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; the truth is it's going to continue to be a major part of SOE's future<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; and we plan on leaving the Dev team to make expansions for a long, long time<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; but we're not going to rest on our laurels.. we're going to push things from the design and technological perspective<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; and our nerfing days are behind us<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; all the people in this room swear<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Jerle_Minara* Do the Berserkers currently have an Epic/have a planned Epic?<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; I tested the Berserker Epic quest yesterday and it is a great piece of lore. Everything is ready for it to go, including a new awesome looking weapon. Additionally the Berserkers have all content added for them which is ready for release; Planar drops, Ornate Armor, Newbie quest armor, etc.. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Gorthag-ED* Is there any chance that the percentage of exp going towards leadership points will be adjustable, so that once a player fills out all their AA exp, they can put all earned exp into Leadership? (Or sooner, if they'd rather gain Leadership points than AAs)<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; The leadership experience does not work the same way that AA experience works. <br />
&lt;jryan&gt; Leadership experience is earned based on a variety of factors including the diffculty of the mob and how many players are in your group or raid.<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; There is slider for leadership experience like there is for AAs.<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; There is no slider for leadership experience like there is for AAs<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *shaman* My question is Will the new tradeskill quests be anything as complex as the Prayer Shawl or Solstice Earring quests for us tradeskill junkies.?<br />
&lt;JMash&gt; There are quests for almost every tradeskill in Gates, though they aren't as intensive as the shawl quests, they should prove to be beneficial and fun. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *tearabite* what is leadership experience? is it like AA?<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Leadership Experience gives the leader abilities that can be used in group or raid settings. There are several different abilities that the leaders can choose from. The system itself is similar to AAs, but the experience that is gained can only be gained by leading a group or raid.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *kizh* will GoD take a while for a guild to progress through like PoP, and for guilds that are about ready to leave Time can you see them living in GoD entirely?<br />
&lt;jtroy&gt; Yes, Gates has multiple zones designed for progression for guilds that are now in the Elemental planes or the Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Zanthus* When will the new trade interface we introduced?<br />
&lt;JMash&gt; The tradeskill interface will be released as a live feature with the update on February 10th.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *buck* can you give us the final races that will be able to be berserkers?<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; The races that can become Berserkers are Troll, Ogre, Vah Shir, Barbarian, and Dwarf.<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Feel free to continue sending your questions to Brenlo.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Smed, what is your position on the Yantis/IGE issue?<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; We have made our position on this issue very clear<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; we don't endorse the idea of selling items or characters<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; it's a violation of our EULA and more importantly it's not in keeping with the sprit of EverQuest<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; We are looking into this further and but don't expect us to go this way with EverQuest<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; and no, we do NOT condone it<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Ceryk* What can you tell us about the Berserker's summoned throwing weapons as far as abilities and such go? And how much money can Berserkers expect to spend on maintaining a constant supply of components?<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; The berserker axes are meant to give berserkers a bit more depth to their abilities. The basic axes are set up to provide a decent amount of ranged damage, although less then ranger archery. They also have a few special techniques that allow them to throw their axes at specific parts of their enemy to debilitate them. Examples include a short duration stun, and a snare, with the possibility of others in the future.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *PoekenInny* Will the graveyard zone go live with GoD?<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; The planned graveyard zone will not be going live with Gates of Discord. It'll be released in an upcoming live update.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Kretol* About how fast can we expect our leadership experience to rise? Is it sort of like AA *in that regard*, or will it be faster/slower?<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; The leadership progress will be unique. We have made an extra effort to make sure players feel they are progressing.<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Please continue to send your questions to Brenlo. However, make sure to stay on topic -- Gates of Discord.<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Folks please stay on topic. Questions about Class balance will not be addressed.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Rylena* Will new spells be quested, dropped, vendor solds, or will they be via a PoP-like system (runes/parchments)?<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; A few of the spells will be drops directly off of mobs, while there's also a few that will be available via a pop style turn in quest. Although there's one spell per class, per quest, so you won't have the repeats like you did in PoP.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Mordant-Dro* The benefical rewards from tradeskill quests- do you see these as being similar to marr cherries for the kejans, or quest that will have broad apeal and be worthwile to a large portion of the playerbase?<br />
&lt;JMash&gt; Without going into too much detail on exactly how the quests work... The tradeskill quest rewards will offer benefits with a more broad appeal for both the tradeskiller and the consumer of tradeskilled items alike. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Dubyah* what kind of transportation (old world boats? planar books? wizzy ports? druid rings) allows players to travel to the new continent?<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; There will be a new shuttle that will take players from Nedaria's Landing to the ship city located in Abysmal Sea. Farstone magic is also available in the Wayfarer camps that will let you teleport from any Wayfarer camp to Nedaria and also to the beach area of Taelosia, Natimbi beach.<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; What was that? A question about raising level limits after G.O.D?<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; no comment<br />
Action: PCarrico cries.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Firriann* will the new GoD zones will be like the LDoN zones? or will we be able to change groups on the fly, more like the old dungeon crawls of the old worlds?<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Someone is impersonating Smed. Call the authorities<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; We have provided functionality to add and remove group or raid members after the instance zone has started up to a point. Once you get passed a certain point, you will no longer be able to.<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; stay tuned ;)<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *nurok2* What levels is the tribute system supposed to be usefull for<br />
&lt;JMash&gt; The Tribute benefits will be available to all players, beginning at level 10.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *JohnGaltSS* for that matter, will new disciplines need to be quested after like spells, or readily available on vendors?<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; There aren't any new disciplines going in that are specific to Gates. If you mean the new combat abilities then yes they'll be available in a similar manor as spells are. So quests and drops.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *tearabite* Are berzerkers a pure melee class or will they be a hybrid such as Paladins or Shadow Knights? Also, will Gates of Discord contrain newer spells for existing classes?<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Lorindar* will there be any changes to current trivial levels or skill progression with the new UI?<br />
&lt;JMash&gt; There are no plans to make any large scale changes to current trivial levels or skill progression to any recipes due to the introduction of the new Tradeskill Interface.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Jaeden* What is the motivating factor for the increased price for AAs in GoD?<br />
&lt;jtroy&gt; You can gain xp at a much faster rate nowadays than you could when PoP was released. The increased group bonus, higher zone mods and availability of high level NPCs all mean you can gain AA's much faster now. The higher costs reflect that.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Rhubeus* Gates of Discord being a new expansion, any new servers to launch with this release. New Rulesets seem to be the buzz lately with Discord taunting folks with a new twist in EQ gameplay<br />
&lt;Hobart&gt; Berserkers are considered a pure melee class. They don't get spells similar to hybrids. They also have the option of using throwing as a primary form of damage along with 2 handed weapons.<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; There are no plans at this time to launch a new server with the release of Gates of Discord.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *waldina* are you Brenlo the Moderator today?<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Yes I am!<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; There will definately be a continuation of the lore that started as far back as Planes of Power. You will have to play through Gates of Discord to see what Morden has in store :)<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *VaylinIs1337* Will we see any advancement in EQ lore? Will that ugly barbarian Morden Rasp return the stolen stone? Will the valiant trolls reclaim their homeland?<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Reverse that order please.<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; Me response was for Vaylin:)<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *jhazard* will there be new spells for existing classes?<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; Yes there's several spells available in Gates for each of the existing classes.<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; Gates is actually signaling the return of Ancient type spells if you haven't heard it around on the messages boards already &gt;:)<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Aelenadrinal* Are zerkers going to be limited specifically to 2Hslash weapons with Axe graphics only?? Or will a selection of 2Hslash weapons be useable?<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; Berserkers will be able to use any two handed weapons, this includes two handed blunt weapons and two handed piercing.<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Jason Mash can you tell us some of the effects you can gain from the Tribute System?<br />
&lt;JMash&gt; The benefits that you can expect to see from the Tribute system include effects that can be used to increase health and mana regeneration, vision enhancing effects, among other beneficial effects.<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Smed any word on community message boards for EverQuest?<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; Absolutely. We are going to be reopening the EverQuest community boards on a MUCH broader basis in the near future<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; and the Devs will be around daily to answer questions on these boards<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; and they will be free<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Corae* will leadership experience have a separate bar, as AA experience does?<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; Yes, leadership experience will be a unique way to advance your character independent of AAs and you regular experience.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *halindrome* Is there a new druid ring?<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; Yes there's new portal locations on the new continent for both druids and wizards. There's also a magus that will teleport you to the new lands if you happen to be on good terms with the Wayfarer's Brotherhood.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Govaleo* Will the Taelosians be hostile to evil races or good and will they be added as a new race in future expansions?<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; Taelosians will be dubious to players when they arrive on the continent. They have been seperated from the races on the known continents for so long that they do not have any past history to base their preconceived notions on.<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; There are no plans to add them as a playable race at this time.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *doddil* will the tribute system be limited to people with deities only, because having just clicked through at the beggining, im already screwed for my armor and not being able to get the cheap good stuff like fierce heraldic, and i am forced to save up for ornate<br />
&lt;jtroy&gt; No, the tribute system is available to everyone.<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; &lt;cough&gt;<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; um<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *HellChild* is SoE and EQ staff scared of what Blizzard is bringing to the table ?<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; well.. let's dodge that question for now ;)<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; the designers all want to<br />
&lt;Smed&gt; ;)<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *curtree* What type of zones are we in treat for? Outside? dungeon? If outside, what type of scenery?<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Gates of Discord will have a variety of zone types available. At the start of the expansion players will find themselves on a large ship city. From there they'll be able to move through an underground sewer system that'll target small group settings. Further in the expansion players will find themselves in a temple area that'll specifically target raids.<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Everyone will be able to see indoor zones, outdoor zones, and underground areas as they adventure through the Gates of Discord.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *azezel* What kind of abilities can we expect to see with the Leadership expirience system?<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; There are abilities such as visually marking multiple NPCs, gaining health or mana enhancements for your group or raid, and regen enhancements.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Garlin* will adventure points from gate of discord differ from those of Ldon? or will they all tabulate togther<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; There are no points for the instance zones in Gates of Discord. They do not carry the same restrictions that LDoN zones did.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Vermourn* is the berserkers &quot;berserk&quot; power going to be structured as a combat ability like lay on hands, or as a personal spell buff?<br />
&lt;Hobart&gt; The new berserker skill is called Frenzy. It is an actual skill attack and is not a buff.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Rathelon* Will GoD instanced zones be timed?<br />
&lt;jryan&gt; For all intense and purposes, no.<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Okay folks, we are only taking 2 more questions.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Rynthemage* What difficulty level are GoD raid zones tailored towards? (VT, Elemental, Time or beyond)?<br />
&lt;jtroy&gt; There are some encounters tailored for the Vex Thal level and several zoned tailored to be difficult for Elemental and Time equipped characters, with correspondingly better loot.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *Tounces76* How long will &quot;Tribute&quot; buffs last, and do they auto-recharge themselves?(Aka deduct more pts to refresh)<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Every ten minutes favor points will be deducted from your favor pool. Different tribute buffs require different favor costs. Your buffs will last as long as you have favor points to pay for them.<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; *XaX* is GoD equipment a big upgrade from time level equipment?<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; There is definately equipment on Taelosia that is an upgrade to gear that can be found in time.<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; By the way we do have some exciting news. EverQuest is about to get even better as we make changes to the EverQuest engine which will allow us to provide you with the great game you have enjoyed but on a much more stable platform. All you have to do is install DX9 and we will do the rest.<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Now a note for those of you that have not yet joined us in the 21st century, you may find that your older video card will not be compliant with DX 9. <br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; If you find or suspect that your video card is not DX 9 compliant, you can go to your manufacturers website or visit the EQ Tech page (On Eqlive.station.sony.com) and check for any issues and the latest known drivers. Also stay tuned as we are putting together a deal with Nvidia and eVGA.com to give current EQ Subscribers access to discounts on several different Nvidia powered 3d accelerators.<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Remember every one of you will want to have your latest video card drivers ( No Drivers from 6 months ago are most likely not the latest drivers).<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Thanks for coming everyone. We hope your questions were answered. If you would like to know more about Gates of Discord, you can go to www.gatesofdiscord.com.<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Thanks all and have a good night.<br />
&lt;OSmith&gt; Thanks for coming!<br />
&lt;Rbarker&gt; Thanks for coming everyone, I hope our answers were informative!<br />
&lt;PCarrico&gt; Thanks for coming all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wtf.  Why are they rewarding the people who buy it late, and not the more dedicated people who buy a preorder.  I guess they think they might be able to get people who weren't going to buy it to do so with the special item, but it still seems fucked up to reward the semi interested players instead of the dedicated ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious how they came to this conclusion...  I was at the chat, too, and you couldn't see what was being asked, thus I had no idea what, if anything was being dodged. ;)  Maybe in the giant ball of spam after they unmoderated the channel or something, but just trying to look at that made my head hurt, so I can't blame the devs for not answering the 20 questions per second that were intermixed with the idiots typing random garbage over and over.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I pre-ordered the boxed version...  Get it day of release and get my eye-candy staff, too.   :)  Although I don't think my 3rd computer is actually going to be able to run it with the DX9 requirement. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The chat was to talk about GoD, so obviously any question related to class balance or non-GoD content is going to be ignored.

If the president is giving a press conference on the war and somebody asks a question about animal rights, he's going to ignore them too.<br />

My theory on the reward for buying the game in the store is that they're throwing stores like EB a bone to keep relations good since they can easily just cut them out with this download model and they want to keep their shelf space at the games stores stores for their other titles.  Just a guess, I really have no clue.</div></div><hr />

Ah, got ya.  I'd go with an Abit IC7-G or an IC7-Max3 if you wanna dump $50 more for some bells and whistle that don't mean anything.  Abit's are nice and stable, if you get the urge you can overclock the hell out of them and they have the fastest memory sub systems on the market.  Also you'll need to make sure that the P4 processor you get is 800Mhz FSB as well.  And make sure you get 2 sticks of the same Ram, i.e. if you're going 1Gig ram, buy 2 identical 512 modules.  Reason for this is if you fill 2 or 4 slots with the same ram you can enable dual channel mode which with give you faster memory access speeds.<br />
<br />
Also, 800Mhz FSB is the fastest stock FSB currently.  To get 1Gig FSB you have to overclock.</div></div><hr />

I have to ask what you meant by this. I bought a pair of 512 sticks and didn't see dual channel mode in my bios. I tried Turbo Mode, and it just reboots me on start-up. Also, a search on the internet for turbo mode produced no information as to what it does. Any tips?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First we'll start with what Dual Channel mode is.  DualDDR is effectively a 128-bit interface with two 64-bit controllers working together. Latency is lowered as well by this method. Think of this scenario: The first controller can be gathering information, while the second controller is publishing it. Basically, both hands are working independently of one another, while still working towards the same end result. Therefore, latency is effectively cut in half.<br />
<br />
Second, as long as you have a MB that supports Dual Channel mode, it will be automatically enabled as long as you have 2 or 4 slots filled with ram.  Be carefull here though.  If you mix and match Ram to fill the slots, this can actually decrease the overall performance.<br />
<br />
Third, &quot;Turbo Mode&quot; places agressive timing on the ram, which you're ram probably can't support which is why it crashes out with Turbo mode on.  You need higher quality Ram that is up to the task for that.  When you shop for ram, look for it's CAS Latency, It will have numbers next to it in the form of something like 3-4-4-8.  The lower those numbers are the faster the ram can be accessed which lowers your latency.</div></div><hr />

If you own WC3 TFT, play the orc campaign and you'll see how i know that WoW is going to be a great fucking game.  Grinding levels is not an option.  Camping loot is not an option.  Acquiring said things thru *gasp* ACTUAL ADVENTURING is an option.<br />

WoW is one of those things. <br />
<br />
I think people are expecting WAY too much from WoW, and are doomed to be disappointed.<br />
<br />
I've played nearly every Blizzard product that's been put out. Yes, they put out good products, but WoW isn't going to be the be-all and end-all of MMORPGs. It's not going to be the magical knight in shining armour to save them from EQ that everyone seems to make it out to be. Good, yes. But it's not gonna be all that and a bag o chips.<br />
<br />
Here's an example. Diabloe and Diablo 2 are both Blizzard products. BOTH of the online games were riddled with some pretty horrible duping and hacking bugs, bugs that make the EQ duping look like a child's prank. Yet, they let these far worse problems go on far longer than EQ's simplar bugs.</div></div><hr />

 Why don't you just take a stroll back to the halcyon days of 2001. Look at what your top of the line processor/vid card/sound card was for starters. Then look at your OS and tell me that if they've kept what they were originally showing in 2001 that it's going to compare favorably to, oh, say, the Luclin update and/or the latest update going in with EQ.<br />
<br />
 Duke Nukem Forever, as I've mentioned, is the closest thing to WoW we've seen - since it was announced, they've scrapped the graphics engine not once, but twice. Unless they've done a MAJOR overhaul, it's going to look dated, it's going to sound dated, and it's going to feel dated in it's playstyle. Odds are that's NOT a formula for success. Of course, if they've done a major overhaul, hopefully for your sakes they've managed to hammer out all the bugs before release, hmm?<br />
<br />
 Oh, and Haass, you're absolutely right, I didn't play it. And you know how much of an insight that gives you into a game you've never played? Jack and squat. Or, to put it more elegantly, as much insight as I've got from NOT playing it.</div></div><hr />

You are correct.  Any game that relise on data stored on a users local system is always going to be highly suseptable to hacking.  This is one of the reasons why WoW has had such a long development cycle and why Blizzard has chosen to make their client little more then a dummy terminal, which is why those people that got ahold of the &quot;l33t WoW alpha build&quot; got nothing more then an interface and some graphics.  The success of the game, in part at least, hinges on it's ability to keep a level playing field for overyone.  I'm not saying WoW is gauranteed to be the greatest thing since astroglide and masturbation, but I believe that if SoE can do it, and lets not forget they've had their fair share of dup and pp bugs, then I expect Blizzard capable of the same.<br />

The difference between creating a good single player game and creating a good MMO game is mind boggling.  Ask any game developer what it takes to make that leap and bring a lunch cause it's gonna take awhile.<br />
<br />
It's amazing that you can take one small aspect of a game, and yes the graphics engine is a small part of an MMO, and damn the whole game based on your conjecture.  The MMO development is not in the graphics engine, that can be changed, scrapped, rebuilt and reused in a matter of months.  It is no issue at all for Blizzard to change the graphics technology as it progresses, even SoE has managed this one.<br />
<br />
However, that being said, this entire conversation is pointless.  Neither you or I know first hand almost anything about WoW and untill we do, neither of us can either praise or denounce Blizzard for anything.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh, and Partha, if you had ever played the Orc compaign of Warcarft III you would know why it is very relevant to the topic.  You might even be interested in finding out what an MMORPG could be like with the same ideas applied instead of dismissing something out of hand before you know anything about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Well, i'm never gonna change the naysayers minds, so there's no point in arguing with people who think that EQ couldn't possibly be improved on and done correctly.<br />
<br />
For everyone else tho, if you haven't already, load up the ol' TFT CD and play the orc campaigns.  After you're done with the campaign you'll understand exactly why and how EQ sucks, and how the guys who made WC3 (Who coincidentally are the same people making WoW) know how to fix the fucking problems and create a game you WANT to play, not feel like you have to.<br />
<br />
There is no camping of loot.  You don't head over to the fucking centaur camp and hope for some claws of attack +15.  Doesn't happen.  You can do it if you want, but you're gonna be there a LONG ass time.<br />
<br />
There is no grinding of XP.  Like above, you level so slowly that if you sit there and watch your XP bar, you're going to become very frustrated very quickly.  <br />
<br />
However, if you do what they want you to do, which is talk to people and figure out what they need help doing, and then help them accomplish it, you'll get :<br />
<br />
A) Shitty loot, and then mediocre loot, and then phat loot as a reward for helping people (&quot;Questing&quot;, if you will)<br />
<br />
B) XP.  You level while you're doing other things.  You're so engrossed with what you have to do for the next quest that you don't even notice that you gained a level in the process.<br />
<br />
C) More interesting things to do as time goes on.  Sure, everyone starts off doing menial shit like running to Thunder Ridge to collect a few herbs for the local Farseer, or cleaning out a Kobald cave so that mining can commence, but eventually, if you prove yourself capable enough, Thrall asks you to lead his army into battle against the evil humans.  <br />
<br />
How the fuck you people can prefer camping XP, camping loot, and killing things just because they're there over a system that is obviously well thought out, and then well designed on top of that, is beyond me.  But, like I said, keep camping shit in EQ and killing mobs for no reason other than they drop loot....more room for the people who actually want to play a game that fits the term &quot;Ever Quest.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Haass, you're showing a knowledge of the game that you can only know if you're designing or beta testing the game, in which case you're breaking an NDA. Considering beta applications just opened a few days ago....<br />
<br />
Unless, of course, you're saying the game is going to play just like the RTS, which just won't happen. RTS games are designed to be done in hours, MMORPGs to last years. There's gonna have to be some pretty huge changes for that.<br />
<br />
I'm HIGHLY skeptical that the game is THAT good, a year before its scheduled release.<br />
<br />
No, WoW is more than likely going to be a good product - Blizzard has a rep for releasing quality products. But is it going to be everything EQ could never be? Considering the history here, only time will tell. How many other MMoRPG's have come out that have been hailed by various players as &quot;the savior from EQ&quot;, or &quot;the next EQ&quot;? And how many have come back, disappointed?<br />
<br />
Only time will tell. one thing's for sure, designing a MMoRPG is completely different from a RTS or even a game duch as Diablo. And Diablo 2's level grinding past 35 was just disgusting. not only that, past level 30 you got no new abilites for the next 69 levels.<br />

I, too, look forward to seeing WoW... but, I'm not going to get my hopes up TOO high.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The orc campaign was specifically DESIGNED to show off the RPG capabilities that the blizzard dev team has.  By continually arguing that fact without having played it, you're just making yourself look foolish.<br />
<br />
Play it.  All will become clear.  If you don't want to play it, then stop arguing how I know that WoW is going to outclass EQ upside down and sideways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">...so it is conjecture based on Warcraft 3. I get it.<br />
<br />
I'll freely admit I haven't played the orc campaign for TFT... yet. I have played Warcraft 3, RoC.<br />
<br />
I still stand by my statement that ANY MMoRPG is got to have to be considerably different from a RTS, just due to the difference in playing time that's designed in it. <br />
<br />
Kinda like saying how LoEQ gives you an idea of how EQ goes.<br />
<br />
I'll have  to borrow TFT and play it though. Don't think it pushes the envelope any more than any of the custom RPG maps available for the game, but I will see... For example, there's a RPG map out for Warcraft 3, where you can play the whole first act of Diablo2, in one map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">It's not an RTS.  In the orc campaign, you control 1 guy....and the world it set up like an MMO world....thus an RPG.<br />
<br />
You can zone between different areas, you have a bank, you can buy and sell items, and you level far more slowly than heros in WC3 do.  It's not conjecture based upon an RTS.  It's logical to assume that a company that knows what they're doing, and can make an RPG OUT OF an RTS, can only possibly get better when they actually have a MMORPG engine to work within.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of WoW fanboys, for sure.  But there is enough information out there from Blizzard, and from the people who have been invited to see WoW by Blizzard, that you can do some research and decide for yourself.  This team has their head screwed on straight...from knowing how the game should work, to knowing that you don't want to sit around camping shit and being bored.  Have I played WoW?  No  God willing I'll get into the beta tho, and at that time, I can't see paying for EQ anymore.  Blizzard has a reputation, and they have also displayed that they know how to make a GAME.  Sony has neither at this point.  WoW can not possibly fail based upon the logic that the monkeys at Sony have managed to keep EQ running for so long.</div></div><hr />

Just go buy it and play it (or rip a copy and play it...omg can I be arrested for saying that?)...its is illuminating of the THOUGHT PROCESSES AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES that Blizzard is bringing to bear in the next game...if you will indications.

<br />
As for people tearing into Diablo/arch decisions: IT WAS 1996.  Dear gawd a thick client was all they had to work with.  <br />
<br />
Also as far as technology goes I'd not be concerned not as much with video technology changing as I would transport layer technology changing.  If they followed good tech design principles (which I imagine Blizzard has) everything should be extensible.</div></div><hr />

WoW will have its share of problems just like any other new product out there.  Until 60-80,000 people start pounding on a game every day, no one will be able to figure out all the bugs in the code.<br />
<br />
For me it will be down to game play.  I expect, and hope that I am right, that the game play in WoW will be different from EQ.  Haass has given some insight into what it may be like.  If that works out to be true, then it will be interesting to see how the players react.<br />
<br />
People that play games are no different then people who buy other products. They stick to what they are comforatable with and getting them to change can sometimes be difficult.<br />
<br />
I see that if Haass' predictions on game play are true, then those who love to power through the levels or hate questing may not find WoW to their liking.   Those that like to quest or have a purpose should find that style more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I, for one, am intrested to see how WoW plays out.  A good showing by WoW will only strenghten the competition and hopefully get other gaming companys to push the envelop even further.<br />
<br />
EQ will remain the benchmark that other MMORPGs are compared to until another takes its place.  To me, it is sad that after 5 years nobody has been able to do it.<br />
<br />
Maybe WoW will be that game....only time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Haass, you're showing a knowledge of the game that you can only know if you're designing or beta testing the game, in which case you're breaking an NDA.<br />
<br />
I bet it's even more nefarious than that ... I bet he actually read THIS (http://www.gamespy.com/previews/january04/wowpc/index.shtml)<br />
<br />
Haass, you're a dirty cheater.  Obviously.  Or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Kaplan: One of the single most important aspects to any MMO is the player community. Anything that encourages or facilitates player interaction needs to be put in the forefront. Guilds will play a key role for players to bond and enjoy game content, as well as normal social interaction within World of Warcraft. Also, at the higher levels, there will be raid content, which is being designed specifically with guilds in mind.  <br />
<br />
 Yep, it'll obviously be MUCH different from EQ. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Yeah, one fuckin quote in the goddamned encycolpedia of information on this game definitely means it's gonna be exactly like EQ.<br />

Your fucking logic has gone straight into the shitter lately Partha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">It's not merely one quote, Haass, it's simply the starkest one from that article.<br />
<br />
 I'm seeing a system whereby advancement could easily end up not in cookie-cutter mob camps but cookie-cutter questing so everyone gets the quests with the best rewards. If I had to compare it to what we've got now, LDoN with maybe varying rewards at different levels is what the low end system is like, and then in the high end.....well, that's his own words. Guilds, raid content geared for higher levels. And just for fun, they'll also make that integrate with high level tradeskilling to make SURE there's no such thing as a low-level crafter with any real skill or any real means of income, because the best made items will require groups/raids to get to the place to make it.<br />
 <br />
 In short, looks great for powergamers, gonna get old REAL quick for those who aren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">but EQ is designed for Powergamers partha.<br />
<br />
powergaming is &quot;teh win!!1&quot; .. if you don't powergame you get NOTHING, NADA, ZILCH, ZERO except for some l33t roleplaying gains and/or the few_and_far_between piece of halfass l3wt.<br />
<br />
most mmog's these days are designed for hardcore gaming; or why would great items as a reward ever exist?<br />
<br />
as a comparison; Ferraris aren't for everyone. Yet they exist. Who owns them? rich people ( powergamers ); rich people's kids ( PLed alts or EBay's ); or people that steal them ( l33t hax0rz ). They're not for everyone but if you work at it; it can be yours.<br />
<br />
But I agree with ya. This ain't the EQ we all bought 5 years ago. It's too far into it's lifespan to ever offer anyone &quot;New and Exciting&quot; content and it's only means of keeping interest towards it's playerbase is to cater to it's most dedicated ( in SoE's eyes ) powergamers who can afford to spend hundreds of hours/days/weeks investng time. Sure; there's the occasiona new gnoll mdel or some new giant model or some pixelated piece of desructive power..but the means of obtaining it is only exponentially longer and harder but EXACTLY the same repitious keyboard presses as all the other timesinks EQ offers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I completely 1000% disagree with you Partha.  WoW is going to be far more friendly to casual players than EQ will ever be.<br />
<br />
Fuck, check out my magelo.  That's it, that right there is as far as you fucking go without joining a guild of 30+ and raiding 5 nites a week.  I'm at the top of the casual gameplayers.  I know what I'm doing, I have friends that know what we're doing, and when we're online, we don't fucking waste time.<br />
<br />
Want to go farther than us?  Too bad, need 3 groups online, so 6 groups in your guild.  Only got 1 cleric?  too bad, need 3 or more for even the easiest rotations.<br />
<br />
You think everyone is going to be doing the best quests?  I don't think so, because the quest rewards are given to you when you start the quest.  You know exactly what you'll be getting out of it.  2 weeks into ANY serious testing of the game and they're going to know exactly what people are doing and why.  Not doing quest A because the reward sucks?  Okay, minor edit there. <br />
<br />
All in all, I find it really odd that a guy who's staying 63 and working on AA's can say that EQ doesn't have any serious competion.  You prove the fact that it's borked merely by existing.  If EQ had enough to offer, everyone would be 65 and doing things that being 65 had to offer, but it doesn't, and people like you stay 63 so that you have things to do.  That's not a good game, that's a shitty design when people think like that, and you've just been pulled into the trap and now you fucking believe it.</div></div><hr />

 Well, in my Magelo I'm still 63 'cuz I'm lazy and haven't updated. I also worked AA's not because I don't wanna run out of content but because I made some pretty fucking bad design choices when I started this game - shit like 5 points in INT to start so I could tailor. :rolleyes:  AA's helped me rebalance and gave me an edge in doing content my guild was (and is) doing.<br />

 As Shik put it, the game I first logged into toward the later part of Kunark is long dead. Now, for most of the cabbages on each server, it's a mad dash to max level, the right flags, the exact gear, and the quickest route to the endgame, and screw everyone else. And ya know what?<br />
<br />
 Those are the people who bitch about EQ being stagnant and are waiting for WoW. The min/max assholes. You REALLY think you'll be getting away from uber progression idjits with a new game? Ha and double Ha.<br />
<br />
 And no, the current game offers plenty to do, both for me AND my guild. I have plenty of zones I haven't seen, mobs I haven't fought, and loot I haven't snatched, and some of it MAY even be an upgrade to what I've got, too. Don't push your grubby, full-of-EQ soul off on me, buddy.<br />
<br />
 Are there things wrong with EQ? Damn right. Is it still numero uno out there. Damn right. You think my opinion is gonna change with some fluff pieces on the internet and a couple of windy assertions about a completely seperate game to give WoW the belt before it even hits the shelves? Not fucking likely.</div></div><hr />

So, being new to Warcraft an all *played Starcraft and loved it, still play it occasionally*, which games/expansion set exactly do I need to buy to see this orc campaign ? <br />
<br />
The orc campaign in The Frozen Throne is the RPG exhibition, so you need Warcraft 3, and the expansion set, The Frozen Throne, and then patch up the game and you'll get the complete orc campaign.  You can probably get both WC3 and TFT in a box set at Best buy or something for like 40 bucks.<br />
<br />
Trust me, once you play that campaign, you'll understand why a company with those ideas for a RPG can not possibly fail.  EQ is all about grinding...the arena is all lit up with people happy to fucking grind again.  Grinding is bullshit.  Doing things is what I'm interested in.  Grinding XP just for the sake of grinding XP is a fucking cop out way to keep people buying expansions and playing the game.</div></div><hr />

 I've heard the 'can't fail' line about a thousand times in my not-so-short life anymore, about a thousand products of a myriad of different kinds that went and fell straight on their ass. So forgive me if I take very little stock in 'Trust me'. 'Trust me' is the line people tried to use to get me to play Daikatana. :p <br />

 Blizzard is a company that's put out some very good single player games. Unfortunately, they've also had some REALLY slow reaction times to playability issues with any online component of those games. To add on to that, this is their first attempt at an MMORPG, and it's more than a tad annoying to hear every fifth post on an EQ website that it's all that, it'll kick EQ's ass, and will be the greatest thing since sliced bread without ONE hour of time released to the public yet.</div></div><hr />
