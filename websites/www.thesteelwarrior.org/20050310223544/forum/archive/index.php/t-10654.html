<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DoN's scheduled down time is 13 hours.  I just cannot fathom a reason for this.  Good development would have put EQ on a Unix/Linux box and they could of patched while people played.  SoE claims they have to install the new builds on each server and then individually test them on each server.<br />
<br />
I just don't see why, they have a beta server for a reason.  You work to a stable build test it and implement it.  Even if their are issues from server to server it shouldn't take 13 hours to implement a new expansion.  There should be a team of 2 to 3 per server doing the installs, they don't need to be experienced as long as they know the basic routine of doing the setups.  Then you have 3 or 4 &quot;gurus&quot; go around to any server that is having a problem.  I can't help but feal atm they are doing the patch server by server by server.  Its the only way I can imagine it would take so long.<br />
<br />
But then again maybe I am expecting a bit to much from SoE Techies....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rigeld</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Patch time is also normal maintenance time.  IE hardware.. that CDRom drive that failed isnt a reason to take the server down during play time, but during a patch window it is..<br />
<br />
Or upgrading hard drives, or changing other internal configurations....<br />
<br />
Oh, and the OS has nothing to do with it.  If youre playing on the server, and they update, now youre out of sync.  Since youre running windows, they have to either a) kick you off and have you patch (which is what theyre doing) or b) leave you out of sync which would introduce a whole nother set of bugs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically the servers were patched by 7am and they have been play testing them in house since then.<br />
<br />
Nice to be able to put a face to a name for the devs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For major content patches yes servers need to come down and patch, but on routine maintainence the servers simply do not need to come down. Thats a fact.  Thats more what I was referring to, and as far as sync goes, you can do minor update patches without forcing people to log out for repatch.  EQ is setup in a multi-file structure where information about the game is in the various hundreds files.  Patching while online is no problem since there is no need for a game restart since the files will be updated correctly when you open them. If programmed correctly you can change the zone model while people are in the zone. You just stream them an update and force a redraw. Flicker of lag and your done.<br />
<br />
As far as servers being up since 7AM and in-house testing.....WHY?? Thats what beta is about, if you wanna do in-house testing and need another day push the damn patch back a day and bring the servers down in the wee hours of the morning and not throughout the day.<br />
<br />
BTW, didn't they have a maintenance patch on the 9th, 6 days ago?</div></div><hr />

They require a degree, which I don't currently have. Once I finish up school here next year I will prolly look into gaming companies like this.  Although the market for these jobs is pretty competitive.  These jobs being programming.<br />

Oh, BTW.  I appreciate you calling me a genius and all, but in reality I have only a small amount of server experience.  Which is why I find it amusing they can't get this right.

And this is why you think it would be so easy.<br />
<br />
Unless all of the Beta servers use exact mirrors of the live system (and of all live systems I might add) then you will never know for sure what effect your patch will have.<br />
<br />
It is better to give a set down time, than to say &quot;Oooops, something slipped through on Beta and now 25 of our servers are down for the next 18 hours as we do a full re-load. Sorry about the time you spent today being wiped!&quot;</div></div><hr />

 Isn't that what used to happen, and people bitched to no end?<br />
<br />
I can be fairly confident in telling you (to the original poster) that you have no clue what it is like in the rl when dealing with servers, software, and users. There are gremlins, and they will break things that you never touched.</div></div><hr />

Do you there's any chance that the people doing this job, who presumeably have the degree that you so far do not, might possibly know more about how to patch their own servers than you do?  Possibly?<br />
<br />
If not then maybe someone at SoE will see this post and get in touch with you to teach a seminar on how to patch with the server up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In any case I said in my post I didn't know everything about it and was looking for someone to give a decent reason. So I don't know what you thought you were trying to say in your post since I had already made pretty clear to anyone who can read what I was asking, yet your responded to it like I was claiming diety status when it comes to servers.<br />
<br />
Its ok though, a lot of people latch onto a viewpoint here and can't let go of it.  I'm sure we are all guilty of it at some point during our posting.  <br />
<br />
All I know is I asked a question, and you took up this defensive position for SoE.  Rather then answer the question, or provide your server background to even make an informed decision on the topic you just decided to redicule me.  To what end Brutal? Prevent people from asking questions of SoE? mebbe I just don't get it.  But you can feel free to PM me and explain where your coming from, really prefer not to derail this thread anymore.<br />
<br />
I think you completely missed his fucking point.  <br />
<br />
I think you missed mine. Sarcasm? nm, not worth it<br />
<br />
And for Pag0.<br />
<br />
And this is why you think it would be so easy.<br />

When I say a little server experience I don't mean I have seen one once in some office an it was SHINY!<br />
<br />
I mean I have worked with them, setting up 3 servers as part of one program running different aspects. A project large enough that one of those servers spends most of its time running pint jobs, b/c everything MUST be printed in a very precise order for mailing discounts etc. They been up for a year w/o crashing so I guess i know something about it, eh? Don't even ask why its 3 servers, has to do with HIPPA compliancy stuff.<br />
<br />
Now I totally agree with giving yourself plenty of time to finish a patch so people aren't pissed if you have something unexpected. And I have plenty of things to do to keep me busy when the servers are down.  But I happen to know for a fact that anything but major updates (probably like an expansion going live). Can be done with the servers up. So I posted and asked a question hoping that someone with MORE experience then me would post with an answer.<br />
<br />
So if you don't know the answer then don't post....and ya know what /gasp if nobody knows the answer the post dies.  And life goes on =P<br />
<br />
In the case of EQ the answer may be as simple as, they aren't running Unix/Linux on the servers.  Which are the only OS's I know how to do it on, but I am told its doable on one or two others......definately not windows though.<br />
<br />
Regardless, please don't post unless ya have an answer you can back up.  I have no desire for this to be another one of those 20 page flame fests.  Fully expected the second post to be &quot;they are dumb and running WinS2k&quot; and that would of been the end of it =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snasty</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tamener go back and read your first post. You did not ask any questions you instead made comments and stated your opinion which were both rude and condescending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kxorth</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt any non-SoE employee is qualified to answer your questions.  Also, &quot;they are dumb and running Windows 2000 Server&quot; is a pretty vast oversimplification.  My guess is that the server side EQ software requires them to take everything down for the update, and the downtime has very little to do with whatever OS they happen to be running.<br />
EQ is setup in a multi-file structure where information about the game is in the various hundreds files. Patching while online is no problem since there is no need for a game restart since the files will be updated correctly when you open them.<br />
I assume you're referring to the EQ client.  In that case, your statement is wrong.  Binaries and dynamic libs (e.g., eqgame.exe and the .dlls used) can't be updated while the game is running.  Zones files, texture data, and sounds could be but you'd be adding complexity for not much benefit.  In the end, it's just a lot easier to have people restart their EQ client.<br />
I just don't see why, they have a beta server for a reason. You work to a stable build test it and implement it. <br />
Don't think it is as easy as this, testing it on a beta server won't expose all of the bugs, especially when the beta has a much lighter player load.<br />
I can't help but feal atm they are doing the patch server by server by server. Its the only way I can imagine it would take so long. <br />
Why would you draw this conclusion after saying you have (essentially) no knowledge of the process?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay.. so on your software thats never crashed (and if one of the computers is only running print jobs, Im not surprised its not crashing), lets say you had to do an update.  Go ahead and stream it out there, while the software is running, and dont allow it to restart.  Think youll still have the 100% uptime youve had so far?<br />
<br />
As far as updating the client without forcing a restart, ever tried to manipulate a .dll while its being used?  No?  You cant without making Windows do things it doesnt like to do.  If the client itself gets updated, that better force a restart.. thats the out of sync issue I was referring to.  If the server sends a command and the (old) client cant respond correctly because it has now idea what that command is, without a huge amount more code to provide work arounds, its going to cause problems.<br />
<br />
I assist in managing a few hundred servers.  We push updates out to many of them daily, and we have a weekly maintenance window that allows us to do things like huge patches to server side software like this.  Want EQ to go to a monthly maintanence window format?  Not that it will lower the patch time; itll just make it more predictable.<br />
<br />
<br />
As an aside, you do know that each server is a cluster of 30+ right?  Im sure it was revealed pre-OoW I remember, but I dont remember the actual number.</div></div><hr />

&lt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
as far as I know both EQ2 and WoW can have small client/server patchs without being brought down...<br />
<br />
keep in mind that everquest's code base is still 6 years old in some areas as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brutal can't tell if your being dense or just deliberately an asshole. <br />
<br />
Knowing me, it's probably a little of both!<br />
<br />
I don't know crap about servers.  I do work in electronics though, and I know things like this are usually more complicated than you think they are looking in.   I also know how to think logically.  I know that the people running the EQ servers have been doing it for 6 years or so.  I know that they take the servers down to patch.   It would be nice if they didn't have to.   According to you it is simple to patch with the server up, and totally unnecessary to take it down.  You say that they don't know this because they are idiots.   <br />
<br />
Now it is possible that the people in charge of SOE's servers really are so completely incompetent that they have not learned something simple about their servers after running them for 6 years.  That they are so hopelessly stupid that after 6 years of doing this job, they still do not understand something basic about these boxes that they presumeably put together and got working.   <br />
<br />
The other possibility is that there IS a good reason for taking the server down, that YOU don't know what you are talking about, and that your post was just so much loud mouthed jackassery.  <br />
<br />
Based on the fact that the SOE servers, while not perfect have been relatively stable and reliable for 95% of the time over the last 6 years, it seems unlikely that it's being run by a group of complete fools.  You on the other hand, don't have 6 years of 95% reliability on the topic of servers behind you, so I made an assumption and ran with it.  Several posts in this thread lead me to believe that the assumption may have been correct.   My apologies if it was not.</div></div><hr />
