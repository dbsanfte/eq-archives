<br />
 The thought of a lvl 65 warrior running in fear is quite unrealistic to me. Its a very minor issue i know but i really think warriors should have this also . We are supposed to be the masters of battle. <br />

<br />
But then once you see how well they tank those, it kind of makes you wonder why people don't use Knights to tank EVERYTHING.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hadn't even heard about that AA, we get something like that though, don't we?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We get fear resistance, but even with it maxed we still get feared plenty... it doesn't really seem to work too well IMO.  A few of our wars have it maxed and I have ZERO in it, and I think I get feared about the same amount as they do.<br />
<br />
Heh, not my sig, I liked it so much that I stole it from Daemon...something... on this board ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Umm sorry, I lost it for a second...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i want mgb warcry!!!!<br />
<br />
humm /disc fearless then when its over pop warcry thats umm 20 seconds i think but you cant use other disc for a while like a hour or smehing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cazic Thule's melee is exceptionally low for a Time god.  A Ranger can probably tank him if they have Fearless.  <br />
<br />
Fearless isn't nearly as important on Innoruk since Seething Hatred is cast much less often than Timeless Panic, and easier to resist as well.  That said, I wouldn't be surprised if Knights can tank everything in Time, especially the longer fights where you spend a significant time without disc.  Actually, if someone can use a Knight and tank all the Time gods, that'd finally stop all the pointless suggestions about improving warriors.  Why would you use a warrior at all if a Knight can beat an encounter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghworg</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye this has pissed me off for sometime, i hate being near useless on CT and Inny in time.  Even with fear resistance 3 you get feared ALOT....and warcry..well that is a joke.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion they should change warcry to be the the same as the knight fear immunity.   For as many aa it costs to buy for full it should darn well give immunity :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knights get Fear resistance, according to the &quot;Classical Role&quot; EQ has implemented into the game from a ROLE PLAYING perspective, because they are Holy/Unholy Knights.  They get their powers from a divine power. <br />
<br />
Warriors on the other hand, are basically generals, hence Marshal (Which, if you look up the word, means general).  When was the last time you saw a general do anything but sit on his horse in the rear with the gear.  Fuck gettin beat on, im sitting out if i can help it, and letting the other stupid schmucks get the tar beat out of them. <br />
<br />
Its our turn to sit back and rake in loot like the knights have been doing for so long.   Let them actually work for something for once.</div></div><hr />
