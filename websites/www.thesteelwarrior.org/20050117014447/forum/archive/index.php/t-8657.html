Is there a site somewhere that talks about GOD events? Am in Tacvi atm and really would like to understand better about what the heck we are fighting. And really , just some raid encounter information in General for GoD, :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm suspicious, generally speking guilds who are in Tacvi at this point aren't really searching the net or posting to it looking for strats/understanding.<br />
<br />
What guild are you in that's in Tacvi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hes a recruit for a guild, he probably wants to try to find out information on preTacvi stuff so he knows his enviroment better on raids....<br />
<br />
Just ask Phantron!<br />
<br />
Although this topic is prob more overloads sanctuary - not warroom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santy</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh Madronne we blazing new ground as you know.  Even Saden isn't 100% on all this stuff. Yea , I hate going places that I am not really familiar with though looking at the threads , it doesn't appear a lot of others are also.<br />
And I think it a bit nutso to be suspicious of a post. OMG it reminds me of the old days in EQ , when people first broke into Fear and no one wanted to talk Strats or even let people IN Fear raids as they were afraid that others would find out how to win there.<br />

btw- Hiyas Madronne</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you've been playing this game since Fear was first opened, you really ought to know that strats for whatever the current leading edge of the content is don't get posted normally.  High end raiding guilds are not eager to share info that just took them weeks of hard and usually painful work to acquire.<br />
<br />
Also, speaking as someone who's guild is currently working on Inktuta, I don't want to see spoilers on Tacvi.  Hats off to those of you who are already there, but please don't spoil the tiny amount of unknown content left in the game for those of us only two zones behind you.</div></div><hr />
