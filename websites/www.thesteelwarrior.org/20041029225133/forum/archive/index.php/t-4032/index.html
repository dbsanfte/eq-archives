<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mi guild just mastered BoT towers. We are reinforcing our members with the nice loot that can be obtained there. Since our raiding force is about 20 - 25 players max we still cant engage terris, agnar, rallos and those first division guys, so we are wondering what would be our next step.<br />
<br />
Someones think ssra is our next logic achievement.<br />
<br />
Others think we should do the tedious VT farm and get some decent loot there, but this may take many weeks.<br />
<br />
Others think LDoN have much to offer to a guild on our current lv<br />
and think we should focus there.<br />
<br />
So what ya think comrades? any advice welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think it will be kind of hard to skip straight to VT with <br />
  a) only 20-25 people<br />
  b) only farming bot...<br />
<br />
i think your next step is to farm ssra... you will get nice loot....and if you can kill HP you can kill Emp...so use that as a bench mark....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">VT with 25 ppl would make half of those ppl o quit EQ if they dont do so while pharming keys. I am not saying it would be hard to claer VT with that. It would just be so bleeding booring for soooo long that ppl will go mad.<br />
<br />
Ssra nameds definatley are an option that is if you can catch any of them up. Also try pharming Kael as well as any other luclin nameds you can catch up. I dunno much about LDoN since I quit eq in August.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm with 20-25 people I would try working on the following mobs<br />
<br />
In velious<br />
<br />
Kael named: Tmax, statue and Vindi will be push overs, AoW might be possible if you can get enough clerics and have a good MT<br />
<br />
Yelnik / WToV mobs other first brood dragons for ST keys to get primal weapons<br />
<br />
In Luclin<br />
<br />
Minor named like Itraer Vius in AR<br />
<br />
Ssra named you can probably handle creator and arch lich.  Try cursed and HP if you want, but HP might be too hard unless you have the exact right classes<br />
<br />
Seru is doable with 25 and he has some of the best loots in luclin<br />
<br />
VT I would say is impossible for you guys.  Until you can flawlessly take down the high priest in ssra you aren't ready for the emperor.  Plus all the key camping for emp and VT might burn some people out and clearing VT with 20-25 will take a long time even if you can get in<br />
<br />
In PoP<br />
<br />
After BoT towers you can do minor mobs like Paffa in CoD, Mujaki in PoN and maybe xanamech in PoI.  Non of the boss mobs like grummis or behemoth are really doable with low low numbers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Terris may be doable for you guys, if your tanks are quite solid: that was our first step after BoT towers.  She's roughly the difficulty of a bot tower named w/ 4 very ugly adds, and a few more fun tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont see Teris doable with 25 the 4 adds you mention are nothing its other ones that you have to watch out for and that make the encounter much harder then BoT. Not to mention that TT's loot is kinda shitty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Our first Terris kill we had about 5 groups. Terris herself has the DPS of a BoT krieger. The hordes of butterflies are stunnable- 2 enchanters and the right strategy and they're a non-threat. For the dispell, you have to MGB Virt/Focus/Haste... Or withdraw past dispell range at 52%, ranger her down to 49, and switch tanks/rebuff one tank. Again, relatively trivial to deal with. The only real threat in the fight is the gargoyles. <br />
<br />
First Brood dragons are also good: Yelinak and Sontalak are much weaker with PoP standard DPS, and Zlandi and Klandi are even gimpier. <br />
<br />
IV and THO should also be easy for you to drop, and while the melee loot from them is relatively sorry, it's a solid boost to the casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MrMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think my guild is at a similar spot as Krorghar's...well the suggestions you guys are making for him we have all done anyway...<br />
<br />
Vindi, Xanamech, Rumblecrush, Doomshade, are all getting pretty easy for us but we have not hit BoT Towers yet.  We typically have a raid force hovering around 30 (slightly above or slightly below...) with average level of 61 or higher.  My question is would BoT be good place for us to hit?  I was always under the impression BoT Towers was much harder than what we are doing now.  We are typically low on wizards (lucky to have one solid wizard) but our melee DPS is usually decent with a few rangers and such.<br />
<br />
Also, what is minimum clerics and/or druids that you would go after AoW with an 8k MT and 7k RT?  I think what most tell me is 6-8 clerics and maybe a handful of druids for the RT.  I love how helpful the people on this forum are BTW.  Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Oh one other thing!  Arathena, you feel that TT can be done with low numbers with decent CC and solid strat...we have at least 3 65 enchanters with around or more than 100aa's and awesome players...you think if we can come up with a way to deal with the golems we can take down TT?  Again our MT is around 8k hps and our other tanks around 7K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Key everyone up for POTactics using the diaku quest in POStorms, then you will have many new options open for you.  Hitting the minibosses in Tactics (Anival, Glykus, Overseer, Vinta, etc.) with 24 is a fun challenge, there is almost always at least one up.  And Tactics is a quiet zone, since the bigger guilds move on fairly quickly and never look back.  Your guild will enjoy equipment and AA upgrades by spending time there.  A reasonable goal would be to eventually try Tallon Zek with 24.</div></div><hr />

There are quiet a few AoW posts on this board, but he doesnt rampage so you don't need to worry about a rampage tank.  For a decent attempt at AoW I would say that a 7.5K-8K MT is good, along with 6 clerics with maybe a few druids mixed in for the CH chain.  You need to keep a 2 second CH chain going for maybe 8-10 minutes to kill him depending on how much dps you guys can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Vallon Zek is very nice RvR...He is easily stompable by 12 let alone 24. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AeaenSabriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The other option, as I see it, is to consider an alliance with one or two other guilds on your server in a similar situation to your own. If eventual PoP progression is your goal, at some point, you will simply need more people to make it work. If you can increase your raid force by just 15 or 20 decently equipped players through an alliance, I'd say you would have a decent shot at Terris, Saryrn, Carprin, Xanamech, the Manaetic Behemoth, and the Tactics named, possibly Tallon and Vallon as well. <br />
<br />
If an alliance is not an option, I would follow other's recommendations here: Ssra, other Luclin named (IV, THO, maybe Servitor), Kael dudes (Vindi, AoW progression, TMax), and First Broods for Primal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Xanamech and Tactics named as AeaenSabriel mentioned, are not your next step.  I'm in a similar guild to Krorghar...only we usually field 15-20 people, and we crush Xanamech and Tactics named without much effort.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule, Sarynn, and Vallon Zek are doable with smaller forces (definition of &quot;smaller&quot; is highly dependent on your guild's makeup), and are probably you're next progression.  Certainly in the 25-30 person range.</div></div><hr />
