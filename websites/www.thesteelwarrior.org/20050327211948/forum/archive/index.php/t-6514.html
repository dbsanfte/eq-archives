I was wondering if any of the normal mobs in PoT drop ornate gear. I am talking about the Diaku Warriors, Death Knights etc. I have heard that they do but looked the mobs up and did not see ornate listed on their known loot list. Any information is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Hunted in PoT last night for a bit and we did the room to the right before you get to pit. Our MA pulled to this room. Does anyone know if it is poosible to pull the pit to this room or do you have to set up camp in the pit ?<br />
<br />
Also what is the stampede and is it triggered ?</div></div><hr />

Basically if you are in the way of the pigs you die.  :D But there's a possibility of a named spawning down there, enraged warpig I think?</div></div><hr />

You should keep on moving down in PoTactics to the pits.  Basically, the room you were in, overlooks the pits.  You can get down there the quickest if you levitate / invis and head to the far right or left sides (tunnels there).  You can also work your way down to the pits the 'long' way by continuing past the room you were in and working down the hallway off of that room.  It takes a little bit, but if you are bringing the DC pet from the zone-in area, you pretty much have to head down this way.  So, it is pretty impossible to pull the pits to up top due to all the mobs in the way and their respawn cycle.  Perhaps if you had a raid force you could train to them, but one group, no way.<br />
<br />
Once in the pits, you keep the whole area clear and you have a chance of a named spawn.  Also (I believe) just killing mobs (pigs perhaps?) results in a 'stampede' occurring.  Basically a mass of level 65ish pigs spawn and make a sorta train through the tunnel areas inside the pit.  If you fight in a pit corner, you will be fine as long as you aren't fighting right at the tunnel.  A zonewide message occurs, something along the lines of 'you hear the pounding of hooves' and this is your clue to be on the lookout.<br />
<br />
There is 'a stampeding piglet' inside the pack of pigs and he qualifies as a named that can drop ornate.  I have no tactics on pulling him as I just avoid it alltogether.<br />
<br />
I have not gotten any ornate off the named that I've spawned in the pits (Zelrin Morlock - 4 drops of war magus arrow guard) after roughly 20 hours in the pits, keeping pace with respawns and pretty much only 2 mobs up at any given time, due to the clearing pace.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, keep in mind that the 'a young war boar' is DC'able by enchanters and druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Tactics, it pays well to move down to the pit (or to one of the tunnels directly off of the pit) as a starting point.  You can jump down and survive, if you don't lag badly while falling, but it is better to use levitate.<br />
 <br />
The easiest mobs in Tactics are in the bottom of the pit.  The only prerequisite is crowd control since there are so many of them.  It's better XP per hour than BOT.<br />
 <br />
The ogres in the surrounding hallways &amp; balconies are the next harder mobs.  Those are what you were killing on your first trip.  They are nice for kiters, but are less efficient XP than the pit.<br />
 <br />
The elite/decorin/gindan/hindan ogres are the hardest.  They are only found in the Zek wings and top floor.  Avoid them unless you eat hard LDONs for lunch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 mobs in pits drop ornate, Anival the Blade drops ornate (on path to VZ I think), as does armorer/supplier.<br />
<br />
All the minis drop bp molds as well, various type for each mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qaladar</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anival the Blade does not spawn in the pit.<br />
<br />
Simple way to pull the piglet is camp the south tunnel.<br />
<br />
When you get the emote for stampede, everyone hug the walls.  Have an enchanter mez the piglet as it runs by.  Nothing else will aggro. Wait till all the boars go by (make sure they're all gone... theres a lot of them) then engage and kill.<br />
<br />
Piglet can drop some ornate pieces as well as other decent drops (WMBS, Tactician's Bulwark, etc.).<br />
<br />
Named in the pits random spawn... Enraged War Boar, Zelrin Morlock can also drop some ornate pieces and at least Zelrin, maybe Enraged too can drop glyphed runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nobody ever said Anival did spawn in the pit. Grendon pointed out, correctly, that there are 2 mobs in the pit that can drop ornate, as well as Anival, on the way to VZ, and the minis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of great info guys. If I understand correctly while in the pit and you see the message for the stampede as long as you are against the wall you are ok.<br />
Obviously if you are engaged with a mob you will get aggroed.</div></div><hr />

Frig,<br />
If you are in the pits and in a corner, you are safe from the stampede.  If you are in a tunnel off of the pit, you have to hug the wall and cross your fingers.<br />
<br />
You can be fighting a mob in a corner in the pit and not get aggro, but I doubt you can do the same in the tunnel.  I avoid the tunnel simply due to the fact the stampede makes it way down them.  I don't make it a habit to stand in the middle of train tracks, either  :)<br />
<br />
Also, you have roaming ogres to deal with in the tunnels, so couple this in with the stampede and you're just asking to go ker-splat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never heard of the Stampeding Piglet dropping ornate. He can drop Blood Earring of Rage (50hp earring), Tacticians Bulwark (decent baz caster shield), and War Masters Bladed Staff. Usually how he is nabbed is simply by being rooted or mezzed. He mostly is at the back of the pack and if your rooter is away from the rest of your group and/or can FD, its not too hard to try.<br />
<br />
Zelrin and the Enraged War Boar in the pit can both drop ornate (bracers if I remember correctly) but its not a given. <br />
<br />
Diaku Armorer and Diaku Supplier are both yellow cons at 65 but a Stonewalled warrior can tank them down easily. Both can drop ornate as well (have seen silk arms and hats and plate hats in here).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jyynnie</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about the Overseer? We attempted him with 2 groups but the AE rampage tore everyone apart. I have heard about the chanter + 2 clerics method to doing it... but that makes any other class useless and pointless in being there. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only reason the Overseer was not mentioned is that he does not drop plate.  He drops chain tunics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have done the overseer a couple times but its either use 2-3 charmed ogres to tank him, or have good, tight healing for any tank you send in, and make sure your DPS know how to avoid his rampage. Works best with ranged damage over melee. Not a lot of HP but a goodly chunk of DPS.<br />
<br />
Not if he drops the chain tunics or not but if he does, its easier to do Brynju Thunderclap in the NE/Fire Tower in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jyynnie</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the info.</div></div><hr />
