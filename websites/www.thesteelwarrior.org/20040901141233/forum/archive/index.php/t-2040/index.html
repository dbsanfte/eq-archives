<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ChrystianVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know or hear anything about the new gobbies in Droga give a bigger Chardok hit than the old ones?  Cuz i was conned into killing my faction before i got my ring because a few clerics needed epics =p.  Kinda sucks that i can't train 50 gobbies to an AE team, but at least get xp now.  But i'd really rather not have to live in Droga to get to ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mobs remind me of CT mobs.  Hit like little boys but have ALOT of hitpoints.  Some casters, wizards casting IC and aoe spells.  They do gate and they do al run on low health.  Not &quot;hard&quot; just time consuming kill these mobs, again remidns me of CT mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ChrystianVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just really worrying about the faction hit, the mobs are gimp =p.  I want my spirit wracked cord and regal band, but really don't wanna have to live in droga to get the faction =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I didn't quiet answer your question first time :/  Anyways, I do not know their faction amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say it's easier now.  I wasn't kos last time I went to chardok.  It's actually a big improvement from how it used to be.  Now you can get good exp and nice loot while you're factioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i went down there once. no named mobs so i need to revisit. it'll be good to be able to get exp and faction at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hailed a female NPC in the FV outpost that asked for that earring together with 3 three drops from certain mobs there too.<br />
No idea what the reward is though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just remembered that I have not deleted my log files for some time, so I made a search and came up with this little piece of text.<br />
<br />
Gillia Brissok regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this fight.<br />
You say, 'Hail, Gillia Brissok'<br />
Gillia Brissok says 'Greetings friend, it is good to be freed from the clutches of those evil creatures.  Tell me are you willing to help me bring some justice to them?'<br />
You say, 'I am will help you bring justice to them'<br />
Gillia Brissok says 'For justice to be brought to them you will need to strike at some of the most powerful goblins found there.  Seek out the goblin cave lords deep within the Temple of Droga and bring me back three Sashes of the Cave Lords.  Also I will need the Earring of King Dronan.  Do this and you will be well rewarded.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wow too bad I never saw a single sash drop.. thx broken quest ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Was at the King camp for a few hours the other night and have yet to see a sash drop.  We did get two rings off Drogan, but no copper hammer for me....just a couple of devastating mauls dropped for us. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gillia Brissok in the Jail in droga is broken too.  She asks for a goblin ration, the shackle key and a drogan restorative so that she can make her way home, but she says that the goblins will surely try to stop her.<br />
<br />
I got all that crap, handed it to her, she continued the dialogue, but I didn't get faction or XP, 3 goblins spawned outside her cell, I wasted them, and I didn't get shit for my time.  She doesn't change what she says, doesn't say anything else to you, she doesn't despawn, and none of the goblins even carry plat.<br />
<br />
So I got jack and shit except about 8%aaxp for 3 goblins (They were pretty goddamned hardcore goblins).  I was really starting to like Droga too, until they fucked up the quest and wasted an hour of my time with a few fuckin 60khp goblins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Um dude, you are freaking out over a quest that isn't implimented yet; give it a few patches for em to get everything ironed out.  The event she sets in motion is actually a ring event, and since you've done it last they have improved it a bit (i been told), in which it is a couple waves of mobs, with a boss at end.  The only problem is, the boss doesn't drop anything yet.<br />
<br />
As far as sash of the cave lord goes, it does indeed drop, and they are already being hoarded on BBane, but I don't know honestly what the final quest is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">are they tradeable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Um dude, you are freaking out over a quest that isn't implimented yet; give it a few patches for em to get everything ironed out.

<br />
If the quest hasn't been implemented, then the NPC shouldn't be up and shouldn't be asking for items.  That's called shitty craftsmanship.  I'm sick of waiting months for patches to fix shit that should be working when they fuckin implement things.  THIS WAS EVEN ON LEGENDS FOR A MONTH.  There is ZERO excuse for this zone to not be functioning properly at this point.  You may think that's A-OK, but I PAY for this game, and when things don't work, I bitch about them.<br />
<br />
Second, I did this thursday.  So they've somehow managed to imrprove it quite a bit in a day and a half huh?  I don't think so pal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL.. that was pretty funny.<br />
<br />
<br />
Droga is my new favorite place to play. My 58 druid and I have a great time down there. I even picked up the Copper Hammer and Bloodsworn. I have gotten quite a few idols and such down there including the ring off and king and something else off the guy that dropped my Bloodsworn (Ice Master Fucknut or something).<br />
<br />
Ice master was easy to do with me and my druid but for King I needed a cleric and chanter to help clear room. Luv this place. Plus the gobs each drop almost 20pp each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I went there for a bit mobs are soooo damn ez. They just have &quot;legends xp whore&quot; branded on their forheads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vathoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, this has nothing to do with the question about faction, but I'm going to share this anyways.<br />
<br />
I found Droga to be a great place for xp(and loot) when you have a few friends that want to xp, but no slower and dont wanna hastle with getting one for PoP. <br />
<br />
I camped Bone Knight Runri(http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12456) for about 5hrs last night with a 55 rogue,sk and a 53cleric. had no trouble at all and walked away with 3daggers and 1 belt. At right around 4.8khps buffed I usually needed a CH and a Cele per mob. The fights werre very fun and rather easy but, you gotta watch out for the gaters... they like to bring friends back. <br />
<br />
Snare is your friend here as well, trust me.<br />
<br />
A tracker and an inviser are also nice to go gank other named that might be up =) seemed to be on a 20-21min spawn</div></div><hr />

I am so glad these mobs exist mate, tier2 mobs rip me a new asshole, even the very weak 409 max hit birdies in torment. I love droga and veksar for my personal 56-61  exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>daoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">if you are looking for slightly easier faction work, check out nurga.<br />
<br />
my 51 warrior and 50 cleric exp there now, everything is dblue to them, exp at that level is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
I have not tried droga yet, waiting to get a few more levels first.</div></div><hr />

THANK YOU!! LOL<br />
<br />
I am playing a 51 Shammy with my RL wife's 52SK....yea yea, not a warrior there, but this site is INVALUABLE, and the SK site blows.  My main being a bard, tanking info here is MUCH better than tanking info on the bard sites, and yea, bards make 'decent' tanks, tho have low hp.<br />
<br />
THANK YOU AGAIN!! This will be my new exp spot too, and mebbe droga afterwards.  Was too much of a coward to risk a nasty death going there, but I will be giving Nurga a shot for sure.</div></div><hr />

Is a decent caster only FT2 neck piece.<br />
The sashes are extremely rare, I have seen one drop in a lot of camping in Droga.<br />
Good luck<br />

<br />
Well the problem is you started an event and didn't finish it. The 3 goblins are the first of 3 waves. Next is 3 plus a minor named, then 3 plus the big boss of the event. The quest is to free her, allowing your finger wigglers to turn in sashes/earring for their FT2 neck item. So yes you get nothing from the goblins, because all you are doing is freeing the chick.<br />
<br />
We did this event with 20 people, average level 60. Level 65 cleric spell pacification works well on these for single pulls. Final named quads about 500ish. Used a 60 warrior for main tank and I rampage tanked ( 57 war ). Rampages every other round or so and has a disgusting amount of hps. We had a 60 and 65 cleric rotating on MT and a 56 cleric healing me for rampage damage. Sorry to get off subject but since someone brought it up....<br />
<br />
Also, there are other events to release other prisoners for different quest turn ins. I plan on exploring these and posting my findings in the appropriate thread.</div></div><hr />
