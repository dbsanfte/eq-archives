Curious if anyone has info b4 I attune it. <br />

Im still using GBoS and CHoS as agro combo at 68 :) and dont raid much anymore, so upgrades are limited for me as far as weapons go.  <br />
Any info would be great!<br />

Almost a no-brainer to replace the CHoS with this in offhand and keep the GBoS Primary.  I guess I was just just hesitant because they are showing 100k+ in bazaar and seeing I dont raid much saving money for a BoC is 1 of few options I have for Mainhand.  I guess my best bet is to attune it for offhand and continue to save for a BoC to replace the GBoS or seek out the SoMWV from Proving Grounds.<br />

Thanks again...<br />

I prefer  Blade of Stratagy over Copper Hammer of Striking for my offhand weapon.  I was thinking about replacing my Blade of Stratagy with this Mace of Memories.  Weapon looks like Soulstripper in inventory I am wondering if Memories looks like Soulstripper does when weilding it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
was wielding BoC and MoM in off hand with no augs and had trouble with agro for some reason, switched the MoM out with a CHoS and agro got somewhat better but that had a anger 2 aug on it also, switch the CHoS out with obsidian scimitar from VZ and gained better agro control with it and dps</div></div><hr />

Why don't you distill the anger 2 aug and put it in the mace?  Seeing that you attuned the MoM you cant sell it now and you would be able to sell the CHoS.  I cant see how the MoM would be less agro once you put anger 2 in it.  Unless I am missing somthing about the Ykesha proc vs. Force Shock agro, I thought they were the same (not certain).  Also, the delay should not matter as much  in secondary right?</div></div><hr />

might just me my mind playing tricks on me  :)</div></div><hr />

I mainhand a BoC w/A3 and had a Sotbs w/A2.  This MoM was a nice upgrade from my droga sword, though before I aug'd it aggro did seem to be down a bit.  I just used incite a little more, that's all.  Now it's got  Anger 2 and it's all good.  It does look like a soul stripper, but on an ogre it's pretty mean looking.  Nice stats too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">10-02-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up a MoM for 50k and replaced mainhand CHSD with it, moved CHSD to offhand to replace CHoS.  To me it seems great. Have Yak augs in both MoM and CHSD.  Just looking at its stats is what convinced me.  Compare to a BoC its got exact same ratio, though bit slower.  Less AC, but 5 more HP and some Dex (usually my lowest stat) and better saves.  And Yak proc vs EB, while less aggro / proc is still great aggro, and since its about 250k less than a BoC, well...  :D <br />
<br />
I highly recommend it over CHoS, SotB, CHSD or red epic if you're still using one of them.</div></div><hr />

Bah, I haven't seen the Sword of Midwinter's Revenge or the Mace of Memories for sale in Drinal yet.</div></div><hr />

There are MoM's for sale on Luclin for 110k and no one is buying them.  There are SoMR for sale from 150k to 350k, not seeing many of them sell either.  I think the main reason BoC has always been a cash cow is that you can twink, or re sell it.  These attuneable things must go for less because of the non droppable once equipped factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just bought a Somv for 70k + helanic tundra bp/bracer = 80kish. I've only seen a few for sale and the most it was going for was 125k. I saw a MoM for 80k and haven't seen one that cheap since. The same guy has been trying to sell his for 105-115k for a while though.</div></div><hr />

There are less SoMV for sale, and they have been going for 125-220k, and as such I have a MoM now but no SoMV.  I've been thrilled with my MoM so far, nice offhand weapon and seems to be a very nice compliment to the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaghal</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I bit the bullet last night and sold my BoC when I got a SoMV.  I was previously using BoC and MoM, which held aggro REALLY well.<br />
<br />
The reason I sold the BoC was two-fold.  To start, I hate the lame graphic it had; and secondly, now that higher end SoMV type weapons are easily available, as well as Anger augments, I predict the market for BoC's will be dying down and I figured I'd sell BoC now while i could still get a good amount of money for it.<br />
<br />
Do I miss it? Yeah.  Even after throwing an Anger 2 aug on the SoMV I still had to hit the incite button more often than usual.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, if i can drag my buddies out of OOW, I can get an anger 3 aug for the SoMV and move the Anger 2 to the MoM, which is currently just using a Jagged Permafrost chunk (100 DD)<br />
<br />
Am I happy? Yeah, the SoMV graphic is awesome and the MoM looks hot too, especially while in Skelly form. The ratio on SoMV is better than BoC, but I wonder if the 5 point difference in delay between the 2 weapons (SoMV being 19 and MoM being 24) versus the 4 point delay difference for BoC (20) and MoM (19) makes a difference in in how many times Dual Wield Succeeds.  I haven't parsed it, but I don't seem to see as many hits with the offhand weapon now that there is a larger disparity between delay times.  Anybody have any ideas on this???<br />
<br />

Until a substitute comes into play that has an inate EB proc (or equivalent agro) this wont be true.</div></div><hr />

But I guess if you're happy, that's all that really matters.<br />
<br />
You should still go get some though, they're a pain in the ass to get at 1150 each, but definately worth it.</div></div><hr />

People also tend to forget that the BoC is the ultimate twink agro weapon.  It's a 15/20 weapon with 100hp and no recc or req level.  Add in resellability, and dropping from AoW, and that weapon will stay really expensive for quite a while even with better weapons available for high end.</div></div><hr />

Do any of you have any thoughts on whether the disparity in delay between the 2 weapon combos has any impact on performance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to. At one point people said dual wield checks didn't go off except for when primary swung, but I'm pretty sure thats been disproved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm considering doing the same.  I feel a BoC is still better aggro than the SoMV but not by a huge amount.  With Anger 3 I'm sure it will be fine.  I could sell my BoC and get both the SoMV AND a HoRZ in exchange.  This OoW gear all lacks AC and I don't want to give up too much AC in the quest for more HP.<br />
<br />
The MoM was an easier decision, since it dropped from a named my group killed.</div></div><hr />

To answer your question, you are A) merely seeing things, or b) just seeing a lower proportion of your hits being your offhand, as your mainhand is now faster than it once was. Your offhand gets a dual-wield check every time that the delay comes up. No mainhand will change that.</div></div><hr />

I've been eyeing that Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance, but I've been too timid to equip one and flag it as no-drop.  They're selling well still, so I've been selling them to upgrade other slots until I find a definitive answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a related note, when would you drop the SoD for another buyable weapon like this?The minute you can equip a CHoS or SotB sell that SoD for way too much plats and buy some armor. Either of those weapons is 95% as good as a SoD for about 2% of the price.<br />
<br />
As easy as attunable gear is to get right now, I wouldn't spend a single plat getting anything right now. Go camp it yourself, you'll likely get everything you want is a few days if you have decent groups. I have yet to leave a group in WoS or MPG were we got less than 1 item per person.</div></div><hr />
