I joined some old EQ friends on a different server from which I started and they're about 5 levels higher than me currently. I was wondering if I can group with them now or if I should keep pounding out levels til I'm closer.</div></div><hr />

Outside of instances there doesn't seem to be a limit. The lower level will get exp. Just very limited exp. Inside instances if one person is too high the lower person will get kicked from the instance.</div></div><hr />

Not that I've seen anyways.  The kicking problem arises from when someone isn't in group.<br />
<br />
I would say optimal grouping is within about 3 levels or so of the highest level mob you're fighting, any less and the lower members can't reliably land skills/spells, and any higher and the content starts to become trivial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I take newbies and twinks through ragefire and WC pretty frequently at 60, and have yet to encounter this problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if you're level 1 and someone is level 60, you're not exactly getting very much.</div></div><hr />

A 15 warrior was lfg to kill the boss and I agreed to basically clear it for him. He got exp from everything, even though there wasnt a mob short of the boss over level 20. It wasnt GOOD exp, but it was fast and safe for him lol. Oh, and I grouped with a 59 warrior in scarlet monastary at 35 and didnt get booted from the instances, there was a 30 warrior there too, he didnt get booted, and thats nearly a 30 level difference. Sounds to me like you were bugged.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been kicked from an instance because of this.  But it's not as simple as being too low vs. the highest leveled person in the group.  Something more complicated going on there.<br />
<br />
For example, when I was level 23, my brother's character was something like level 32, and a friend of mine was level 28.  Can't remember the exact levels we were at now right off hand, but the point is that I was a lot lower than the both of them.<br />
<br />
When all 3 of us grouped together, we could do instances no problem.  But when just my brother and I (23 and 32) tried it, I got kicked out everytime.  Something about the level 28 being there bridged the gap in the criteria, allowing me to stay.<br />
<br />
The error message booting you isn't very clear about it either.  It says that you're not in the current group's instance, and are being removed.  So I don't think it's the actual instance that's causing the real reason for the booting, but rather something in the grouping mechanics that's not counting you towards being in the group (which then of course triggers the instance to boot you).<br />
<br />
Or possibly it was a group bug like someone else just suggested.  We tried grouping and regrouping many times and entering, and I got booted every time.</div></div><hr />

Yep...a friend's 45 shaman was helping my new 25 warlock do some quests and although I was only getting 30 xp/kill (instead of the 150/kill I get solo), I think the overall xp rate wasn't that much slower when grouped with a high level.  <br />
<br />
Plus, I was able to complete the quests in a fraction of the time.   :p<br />
<br />
Edit:  I went through Shadow Fang Keep last night with my lvl 26 warlock and a 50 warrior...I got xp.</div></div><hr />
