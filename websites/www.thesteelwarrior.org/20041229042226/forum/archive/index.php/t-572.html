<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After a week after trying vindi. and not knowing exactly how to post this. It's one of those situations where you are happy and sad at the same time. Your sad because your allies and your guild didn't get a second chance at Vindi but your happy because you got the bp. Now i'm sad&gt;happy. What happened: We got our vindi raid going 50 people. we wipe one cleric camps (while i get my butt kicked) all sk's/monks/necro's FD. so we get back and get ready. Another guild comes in saying they getting idol to get to AoW and would give us chances. Unfortunately ANOTHER guild comes in trying to beat the one about to let us have a second chance. They decide they can't wait they pull vindi. chomp him down. pull statue bye bye statue pull idol bye bye idol pull AoW bye bye AoW. Now in the midst of all this chaos. Their guild leader is talking with our raid leader apologizing about that and hoping we would understand. At first we where mad at the guild that killed em all but then we noticed it was the second guilds fault. Ok vindi dropped BP and ST key part. We roll on bp after praying I get a 981 and win. Me almost fainting run to other side loot and hug their ogre leader. They also let us have a 17/25 hammer (congradulations to Baylin from GWM). Now in the end it was extremely sad for all those who came their for nothing besides the armor that dropped. I was happy but still sad. What would you guys think/feel/do?</div></div><hr />

You got a nice bp, be happy about it.  Next time you want to try Vindi, chances are the Statue/Idol/AoW won't be up and you can kill him without any interference.  Vindi is  up all the time, next time kill him when the AoW guilds won't bother you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we weren't planning on Idol spawning or statue. I know but we had this thing ready a month in advance 60 people. they took it away we've never had forces like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shit happens :) Dont be sad, its part of the game.<br />
<br />
Be happy you had the numbers. Be happy you got the BP<br />
Vindicator managed to avoid you this time. Wont do it for ever.<br />
Vindicator will always be there when you get the same numbers again.<br />
<br />
The local big guild giving you time to do vindic was cool and fair play.<br />
But hey, you cant expect them to loose AoW because they let you have Vindicator.<br />
The 2nd big guild showing up is part of the game too.<br />
(Donc think they are the bad guys, you cant imagine the competition at higher levels)<br />
<br />
Ok they killed your mob (i've done that like 10 times), but thats the way EQ goes.<br />
I hate KSing mobs, but sometimes either we KS or we loose our target.<br />
(KSing and giving the loot of course).<br />
It happens a LOT with Vindicator &amp; Cursed Cycle &amp; Raghs in SSRA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ubers dont like to go harass small alliances. Its useless and counter-productive.<br />
They will always try not to bother you, but if you are in their way<br />
(which was the case), they will just sweep over you.<br />
You are in their way. Period. Its not personnal, its business.<br />
<br />
If you want a quiet shot at vindicator ...<br />
** Either try and plan a raid when statue or idol isnt up <br />
(thats very very often they dont live long)<br />
**Try work a deal with the guild there <br />
(like you had until the 2nd guild showed up)<br />
** Try asking for help, a high lvl guild may be willing to go out of its way if asked nicely.<br />
(Like off tanking vindic, while statue is pulled, its easy &amp; painless for them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye it is sad that you did not get the second chance at Vindi. I would look at it like this. Set up another time (even though you guys did set it up so far in advance) and try again. You can really not fault either of the other guilds and the fact that they gave you the loot was very cool on their part. Keep trying and you will get it done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going to say the exact same thing Brutul said.<br />
<br />
It's an 8 hour spawn. Be happy, and then give him another go when someone else isn't trying to race people to the bigger spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm throwig my hat in with the 8 hour spawn thing.  As mentioned also Ubers don't want to mess with people, but they have lives too and need to kill what they need to kill.  Waiting for a guild to kill something and wiping and all can be very frustrating.  <br />
<br />
I think the Ubers did the right thing in killing Vindi then letting you guys get the loot.  It shows they really don't care about Vindi and need to get to AoW.  <br />
<br />
Don't cry over spilt milk and don't hold too large a grudg over the other guilds, you will run into them again and credibility and an ability to stay on good terms with other guilds always works out in your favor in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to mention now with the loot you will be that much more likely to drop him next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm not crying over anything. but when your usually raid force is 25 and you get 65 then have another guild kill it for you it sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The suckiest part about it is that you didnt get the ST key piece lol.  /nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dobbo, dont be frustrated, it will be soon enough that you can take Vindi with your 25 people raid.<br />
That said, I agree with what everyone else is saying.<br />
The days of competition over Vindi spawns are almost over (sometimes smaller US guilds on our servers compete for him on weekends).<br />
When we do AoW, its usually that Vindi is just a hindrance as almost 100 percent of the plate classes that can use the bp have statue/vindi bp or better.<br />
Went as far as it going to twinks/alts (we are a dkp guild so unless noone bids it wont rot) and people hoping for boots.<br />
For some odd reason i havent seen boots drop off KT in the last few months (not that we kill him that often anymore, maybe 6 to 8 times in 4 months or more for ST key).<br />
Competition over AoW is fierce sometimes and even if its to finance the peridot fund of the local uberguild (all droppable loot off AoW sells for 100k+ and the rest is still some upgrade - unless the bow drops).</div></div><hr />

Just keep at it. Soon youll be farming him on a regular basis and wondering what at the fuss was about.</div></div><hr />
