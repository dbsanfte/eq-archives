<br />
I had this thought, that if i put 20percent of xp into AA for 60, when i hit 61 i could spend 2 aa and get PB1<br />
<br />
PB sounds like a nice little kick to have and i could continue straight xp to 65.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any opinions on doing this, whether or not its a waste of time, and what percent would i need to set to get 2 aa out of the 60-61 grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get 61 FIRST.  60 is a VERY short level, and losing 20% exp on a death is rather disheartening.<br />
<br />
60 is about as long as 53 or so, so something like 30 or 40 to regular would be what you would need to get 2 AA in the time it takes to get 61.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't see any reason to grind out AA at 60, since you can get to 61 so fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get 61. You get a very nice chunk of hp at 61. Then get 62 for access to more planes. Then get 63 so you can get in level 65 LDoN groups. Then get 64 and 65. <br />
<br />
<br />
Then do aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id head straight on past 60. also dont waste time splitting normal exp and aa exp. either do one or th eother. if you need aa stop at 61/62 and get your basic 6  and then AE taunt then head on up to 65. along the way maybe also pick up ND3 for the hps boost. <br />
<br />
personally, i  didnt work on offensive AA's like PB until i had  all my defensive onex maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you need aa stop at 61/62 and get your basic 6 and then AE taunt then head on up to 65 <br />
<br />
Slight correction, you'd have to get 18 before the 5 for AE taunt which can honestly wait until 65 also. About the only reason I can think of to not get 65 before any AA would be run3 since it comes in handy all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can forgive anyone runx3, and then 3 more for the title.<br />
<br />
Thereafter, go go go for 65.  When exp groups are looking for warriors, they look at your level.<br />
<br />
I'd never recommend splitting exp between AA and real.  This simply maximizes the time required to get either AA or real exp benefit.  100% to one, or the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AA's are good to work pre-65 if you KNOW your gear is subpar. In those cases, getting IS5, CS3, and the like will help quite a bit. Of course, this also presumes you're like me and not going raiding anytime soon.<br />
<br />
 But, yeah, get 61 before you AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got 18 AAs at 60, run3, sta3, CS2 ND2, and they helped a ton on the way to 65.<br />
At 62, got a few more like CS3 and ND3, then all the way to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My thinking is turning to a gear answered solution. If you can keep up with something in the lines of 20 x level in buffed AC (IE over 1300 at 65 with Virtue) then go pure XP. If you gear is hurting, going heavy into AAs (and plat) may be the way to go until you get yourself into tanking condition for your level. <br />
<br />
Now that we have incite and the rage dis (every blow causes more agro) in the low 60s I think that AET as a requirement for 65 no longer applies (though It hink it should be the first thing you aim for after you hit 65, and PE being the next).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azunias</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 51 for me .... wondering &quot;where&quot; to start dropping points. (Just popped my first AA point). <br />
<br />
Magello is to the left.<br />
<br />
Haven't LDon'd yet nor am I PoP flagged. It can be a pain not being guilded. <br />
<br />
Yes ... I know ... my gear is not the best it can be either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting AA before 65 is a waste of time unless your gear is seriously subpar. The only AAs I would recoommend before 65 are run3+3 others just to get your title. If you get any amount of flags at all, you can do most of your first 6 without ever turning on AA exp. Once you have your title, head for 65 before you ever do any AA. As long as you have your title, there is no way of knowing just how many AA you actually have, and most people won't bother to do the math to figure out you must have less than 24 total. When people put groups together, they will take the higher level warrior, it's human nature to take the bigger better number. No one ever asks how many AAs you have, they just do a /who all lfg 65 and pick from that list.<br />
<br />
There are tons of other tangible reasons to get 65 as well - more HP, better mitigation, better taunt, more DPS, better chance to resist spells, and more AA options are just a few.</div></div><hr />
