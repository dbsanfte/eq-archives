<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've already taken a good deal of heat over even considering postponing Stand Down.  I'm sure many of you will be angry, I know your passion, I've tasted it this last week.  So lets hear it.. flame on!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CplTom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think I will &quot; flame &quot; you , but please know that postponing the stand down was the first thing I have felt strongly enugh to finaly make a post on . <br />
<br />
I am sorry , but you are being led around by a carrot on a stick now .  Sony will never again listen to us because they know that they can just put a live chat up when people get angry and let them vent there and then ignore everything that was said and done .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm glad you DID stand down Dark - it was the logical move.<br />
<br />
 100% support bud, and if they throw bullshit at the Dev Chat, everyone feel free to stand with me Midnight of the 25th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's safe to say that the Standdown even if it never regains it's momentum, DID get noticed, DID show exactly how pissed off warriors are and DID show SOE that they needed to get their collective asses in gear. Absor was visiting these boards one hell of a lot more than usual, he can't have helped but notice the grass roots level of support, the Gm's were watching the massive turnouts on some servers even prior to the big day.  <br />
<br />
Going through with the actual 'official' protest is really rather secondary to that - they know it 'would' have gone ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yesod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thing is it was well arranged, and many people were set.. and the Sony come out and says: ok ok we will talk to you, and we just stop, right there just stop. Dont expect the same 'support' or gathering next time you wanna do something like this again. <br />
<br />
That was our chance to have so many people there at once, it wont happen again.<br />
<br />
am I pissed? no, and frankly I dont care... expansion is comming out and will fix a lot of things, they know warriors got it in the ass and they will fix most of this mess, wether we stand down or not, it will happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Podling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, it will happen again.  All those that voted for postponing the stand down will go ballistic if we're fed a load of crap at the dev chat.  All those that wanted to go through with the stand down no matter what will be even more angry if we're fed a load of crap.<br />
<br />
SoE is putting their neck on the line and I think they know it.  Let's hear what they have to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Darkoan made baby Jebus cry!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Twotons</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally I think it's a good call.<br />
<br />
And if they screw us over....I'd say the possibilty is there for the turnout to double. It would be blatant enough for many non warriors to join us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yesod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Happen with what? half the number (or even less) of people who were all pushing for it only to be put down again when SoE says again: ok ok, last chat and we will settle it once and for all.. yeah right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's funny to see people flame Darkoan over the postponement. He's been the first to do something like this that's just for warriors. You don't have to be happy about the delay, but none of us (me included) had the gumption or cojones to organize such an event. Lay off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CasEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aye, give the man a break, No one else stepped forward to lead the charge. I for one will back the postponing until the 2nd if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wise move young Padawan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mashin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I could care less if no one else stands down on tues I Will, why? because I said &quot;I would&quot; do it on that day.  I would never spam a channel, so im not thinking its going to ruin me to be afk with my message. you asked for our support on this day and now you got it and you going to ask us all to wait on it? whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>TRACKFINDER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Smart move, Darkoan.<br />
Earned you some respect on my part.<br />
And all depending on how the chat develops, I might even be there and back you up the 2nd if Sony keeps being vague about this.<br />
<br />
As you know I did not support the first Stand Down but I can assure you that you will have my support this time if Sony wont be more concrete.<br />
<br />
I really hope you warriors will get in game tools to match your passion for the class so you once again will find enjoyment in playing.<br />
<br />
Best of wishes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">He still made baby Jebus cry!!!<br />
<br />
Hehe jk man just like my first post <br />
<br />
But seriously folks,  Darkoan did all the work and if he deems it necessarily to hold off until after the 24th than so be it.  I f SOE backs out than my friends We will rape thier Villages and Pillages their women....or something like that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Yesod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you are refering to me Cas/Iska that I am flaming Dark, then you are very wrong with this assumption, I give my salutes and my total support to Dark (and above all, teh Ogrely love). I am merely stating the obvious, of what SoE will end up doing, and if we just postpone it the stand down now or tommorrow or in a month from now, you'd think SoE will rush the changes for us cos we were nice enough to wait for them to give us some more bs? Is it not quite clear that we got the boot in the ass? For sometime, I thought I was a whiner maybe, but after talking to many of the wars on my server and comming here, hell, we all share the same feelings about our class, currently; and its not funny anymore. I believe we waited a full year for the changes to happen, instead, LoY comes out, LDoN comes out ..etc..etc, and what do we get? Jack and Shit. I am just very frustrated and pissed off, that now my job is to /shield a friggin tanking knight. FFS, is that what we are now, shields to knights?? and to be told by a knight to stfu and to let him do the tanking and just be a dps class (/giggles, a dps class eh?), all the respect is gone, and with it my rage keeps growing.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am with Dark and the warrior community, I for one am hurting every time I log on my warrior to see me being replaced by a knight doing the tankage, and for that my friends, you see me standing side along with yous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I say it's worthwhile to turn our cheek one more time.  Let's see what bullshit they are going to try and pass off as &quot;upgrading&quot; on the next patch.  If it blows goats we stand down.<br />
<br />
Simple enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mongo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Mongo think it good move to postpone. <br />
<br />
We've been given a date, and I think it will serve our best interests to wait and see what they have to say. Considering the number of people who parked their characters in front of the stone last week, I think it likely there will be a small presence on many/most servers throughout the week anyways. <br />
<br />
It might be worthwhile to change the AFK message to something along the lines of &quot;Chat scheduled for November 24th to discuss melee changes...&quot;, etc. and become something of a billboard to keep people informed. <br />
<br />
And if Sony misses the mark, we can always say &quot;Sony had 10+ months to balance us, and all we got was this lousy &lt;insert token change we get offered&gt;&quot;, and begin the official standdown immediately.</div></div><hr />

One of the first resets of calming the massess, is to hint at new information. <br />
You guys are being played like a fine instrument...?&gt;)<br />
If you had gone through with it, you would have shown that the issues are overly pressing and any talks are too late, you need action, not tounge and cheek.<br />
Now you have shown them that the issues aren't that sever and that you can wait to talk.<br />
Grats, youve proven that the warrior community is long to anger, and quick to pacifiy...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">By putting it off for two weeks they aren't being &quot;played&quot;. They're showing that warriors (and other supporters) aren't just an angry mob. If they just wanted to cause trouble and lag up a zone, the stand down would still be on. The stand down was created for a reason, and that reason isn't to fuck with people. It was to get a response from SoE. Some of you need to read the thread again, because nothing was being demanded except a response - they got that. <br />
<br />
Giving them two weeks loses nothing. In fact, if SoE DOESN'T deliver, I'm willing to bet the stand down gains massively more supporters from all over. <br />
<br />
I think it was a good choice, I guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tanise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aye Raaj.<br />
<br />
Our request has been granted. Though I must admit I'd prefer they set it for prior to our orignal date, they have to save face too.<br />
<br />
If I get fed bullshit and sugar in the chat I will be there on the second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">^^^ what Raaj said<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't like it. I think SOE is just lumping this thing back into a general melee issue instead of a pure melee but. I am willing to give the a chance also.  Thanks Dark for this effort.   <br />
As Dark said  &quot;Flame On&quot; I think this is where he was looking to see the flames...Peace</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just wanted to add it was very cool seeing yourself and a decent size turnout (much bigger than I would've guessed) at the PoT stone in PoK.  I spoke with a number of friends/players/guildmates and most folks thought the stand down was plain stupid, a number of folks also didn't know about it and were curious why warriors were doing it.  I did my best to pass along the msgs you have already posted.<br />
<br />
Between guild duties and my own apprehension that it would net us anything, I didn't have time to attend much.  I must say though, after seeing folks there and hearing from you that SOE would be holding a chat session I was overwhelmed!!  <br />
<br />
People shouldn't miss the fact that the standdown has achieved the first step of what it was after.  We've received a confirmation that there are issues (duh), that SOE 'may' have been working on this all along.  We know how long system changes take and if they're nearing some sort of beta/release phase then I'll bet they've been working on it for some time now.  If they are merely discussing the idea, then we can thank Standdown/WoW for the changes.  <br />
<br />
I think stopping the protest was the right thing to do.  We need to take their offer at face value and assume they'll do the right thing.  The results of the chat session is where we need to decide if the right thing is being done or if more needs to be done, resulting in more pushback in some way.<br />
<br />
We got a big part of what we wanted, SOE is going to hear us and provide a (hopefully) constructive chat session covering the issues.  If they follow through with some of the mentioned things, then we will have achieved a major game revamp for a class(es) that desperately need such a revamp.  I think I am optimistic about this...  just so hard after so long.</div></div><hr />

Two thumbs up for organizing the Stand Down in the first place and ... erm ... two more thumbs up (/em lops a couple thumbs off of a nearby kobold) to you for postponing it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">You lost the steam that was built up.<br />
<br />
Postponing the stand-down is only going to add CONFUSION to the general populace.<br />
<br />
A lot of people already got the ORIGINAL dates mixed up (hence why it all started early). <br />
<br />
Postponing it is just going to mix everything up further.<br />
<br />
You should have gone ahead with it as scheduled. They did not RESPOND. They just said they MAY respond.<br />
<br />
What's the difference between hosting a moderated chat that answers only THEIR questions that THEY choose, and cutting and pasting the same BS on the upcoming changes part of the dev corner?<br />
<br />
On November 25th you're going to want to stand down again. And then you'll have already &quot;cried wolf&quot; and will have a much harder mobilizing people.<br />
<br />
The time was ripe. The energy was there.<br />
<br />
Now it's dissipating fast.</div></div><hr />

There's been nearly 120k views on the stand-down topic, On this forum alone! There had been people standing already.<br />
A message has been delivered, regardless if it was the way he meant to do or not.<br />
<br />
Ball is in their court now..wether or not the outcome will soothe 10 months of &quot;we'll look at it&quot; remains to be seen, and its really a waste of energy right now to play guessing games. Let them have that chat, you can still always flame the outcome.</div></div><hr />

I will continue to stand day and night when I'm not raiding (my guild is my alliegence).  I'm not disrupting anyone or causing anyone harm.  I'm simply standing in protest until they actually deliver.  They have been promising and &quot;working on it&quot; for 10 months and counting.  Now we have a promise of a promise.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">This (http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-443916624) just in from Mobhunter.  OMG could it be another statement out of the blue from Sony to another EQ news site?!?! (One that just happens to have been vocal about STAND DOWN).<br />
<br />
Next up, I got this e-mail from John Smedly today as well, detailing some specifics on things I've talked about recently.<br />
<br />
Couple of thoughts for you:<br />
<br />
1) Although we haven't talked very much about it, the team has been working very hard on the Melee changes. Expect something in mid-December (we'll announce it and discuss it in the upcoming chat) that far exceeds what people are expecting. The bottom line is our major goal was to completely revise the way melee combat is done in EQ. You can look forward to the Melee types becoming much more interactive and able to do a whole lot more cool things during combat.<br />
<br />
2) Lords of EverQuest - we're giving existing subscribers that register 30 days of EQ for free as well as an invitation to the EQ 2 Beta.<br />
<br />
Probably the most interesting bit in that is saying it will far exceed what people are expecting. For some reason, at the same time that raises my expectations and lowers them. I guess I'm expecting some sort of stamina/mana/melee bar sort of thing with different attacks/abilities, but saying it will exceed peoples expectations, makes me think that they just might have a lot up their sleeve that no one has thought of.<br />
<br />
Yet another reason STAND DOWN has been POSTPONED!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">new thread on mobhunter is on the frontpage here too fellas :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Zolanoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Postponing the warrior strike was clearly the right move, I really can't see any point in going forward with a strike aimed at getting SoE to do something about warrior balance a few days before a scheduled talk about melee changes - they already gave us what we want...<br />
<br />
... yes if it turns out to be only so much BS, go forward with the strike 1 week later. We've been screwed since PoP came out, why not wait the extra week to give SoE a chance to respond? If we keep kicking and screaming even after they agree to talk, we just look like whiney fools, but I really do think that we have some serious grievances that we need to present properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Silsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I think postponing was the right thing to do at the time. If anyone can get the info on where the chat will be held, please pass it along!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Actually I think postponing will increase the numbers if Sony fails to deviver, because of people like Drag etc standing AFK at the Karana PoK stone general questions have been raised and answered in OOCs and tells.Only people I notice flaming it in OOC are the Pallys and SKs .Everyone else either is too stupid to have a clue what &quot;balance&quot; means or agrees.<br />
If Sony fails to deliver even more will be aware of it</div></div><hr />
