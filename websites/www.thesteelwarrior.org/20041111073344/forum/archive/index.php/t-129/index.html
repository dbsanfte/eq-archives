<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>-Kai-</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive never really seen this discussed on a message board..but my opinion has always been that small races avoid better....larger races mitigate better.  I have no evidence to back this up other than discussions with small races tanks in my guild about dmg intake against certain mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Urban Legend or Might it be real? <br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">urban legend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Legend.. nothing more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Would have been nice if EQ had that kinda depth.  I was actually sad when I found out it didn't...way back in the day.<br />
<br />
Maybe next game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Undafut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aside from stats, vision, regen, and skills (bash, hide, forage, etc), the only racial advantage of which I'm aware is the ogre's frontal stun immunity.<br />
<br />
I fought side-by-side with a barbarian warrior for 33 levels, we were near identically equipped.  No real difference taking damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">in the end their all the same even a aa lets you not be stuned :( race has become just a visual thing<br />
<br />
in the past large races had more hp, large armor hade a cupple more ac. ogre smithed armor still does but most drop and quest stuff is all race, and end up just the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xocin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't kid yourself, its obvious humans get a natural bonus, I'm not sure what that bonus is just yet, but dammit, we get it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yup, Humans get the extra bonus of being ugly as well as blind :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mymn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Humans get to start right near the EC tunnel for easy twinkage too......o wait, nevermind that now, yup humans have no advantage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Humans start in two of the cities in which half elves can start. Being that close to greatness has to count for something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Small races only fly farther when I kick em ... gnomes most of all.<br />
<br />
Dorfs tend to spill their beer when I toss em, and that pisses off the dorfs, and wastes good beer, so I dont kick em anymore<br />
<br />
Halflings tend to have sneaky friends, that have sharp daggers, so I dont punt them anymore<br />
<br />
Gnomes make shit, that tends to make really irritating sounds, and they have a tendancy to beat on my shins, I still punt them.<br />
<br />
Frogloks break too easy.  So I just cut off their legs, and make some food.  never kicked one.  Put a firecracker in a frog's mouth once though.  Never did find that frog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">half elves get the women....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't see how those fat drunk dwarves, that constantly trip over their way too long beard are supposed to avoid better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Kater, you ever seen Jackie Chan's Legend of Drunken Master ... nuff said.  Dwarves may look clumsy and shit, but its just an act.  Its cause they are always drunk, cause it gives em power.  Dont mess with drunk dorfs bro, youll end up with a beating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ahh the drunken master such a great flick. Going to rent it agin havent seen it in awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah well us half lings have half of half elves name yet we are 5X as great. explain that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jemort</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">dwarves get a MR bonus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">half elves get the women.... <br />
<br />
the bearded dwarf ones. MAYBE. if your lucky and pay them then yes. but yeah would be kinda cool halflings do get hide/sneak and it does help then ogres with stun trolls with stoopidity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Um what? Check this out hafring!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kalantek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i think the legend of small races avoiding better, and large ones mitigating better might come from stats<br />
<br />
large races tend to have more stam, so the larger HPs in the low game  it may *look* like they are taking less dmg cuz their bar doesnt move as far<br />
<br />
and then the smaller races tend to have higher agility meagerly increasing some armor and how fast they learn defensive skills,<br />
<br />
in theory this legend prolly came from a small race capping defense skills faster, and a large race having more HP</div></div><hr />
