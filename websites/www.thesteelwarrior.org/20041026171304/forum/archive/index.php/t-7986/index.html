<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been wanting to give 1 of these a shot for awhile now but can't really find out much info on them so figured I'd ask here. My guild is currently at the point where we can farm pofire/poeB mold droppers easily and have killed FRo a few times. I'm wondering what would be a fairly easy LDoN raid to kinda get used to how they work before trying some of the tougher ones later on. I'm not looking for walkthroughs or anything just sort of general info on what to expect so I can drag the guild off to try something new.<br />

Try the EC one first, it's not as hard.  These raids, except MM are pretty straight forward.  In MM, all 3 of the bosses must die at the same rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have even better advice for you - don't waste your time doing LDoN raids. The RvR sucks huge donkey nuts. Concentrate on farming the crap out of the elems so you can get in to Time as quickly as possible. You will get more loot out of a single Time clearing than you would if you beat every LDoN raid. Spending 3 hours to get an AoB aug and an FT3 aug is a serious waste of time.</div></div><hr />
