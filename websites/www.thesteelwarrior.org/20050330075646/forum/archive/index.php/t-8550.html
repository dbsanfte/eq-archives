More Avoidance or more Shielding? For some mobs shielding wouldn't help at all, however avoidance always will. Post your experiences or thoughts  :)</div></div><hr />

There's some fights where the mobs just do insane spike damage (cough xxeric), but alot of fights the named don't really pump out all that much damage, and you might benefit more from the avoidance then you would from the shielding.</div></div><hr />

I would have to agree avoidance is a bit better in uqua, most of qvic, and most of the ikkinz encounters save the quad 4k beasts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Avoidance adds a flat amount of equivalent HP to your tanking stats.  For example if you've 10K HP and you get hit 49% instead of 50% due to avoidance, that's the same as adding 200 HP for all practical purposes.  The effect of shielding, on the other hand, depends on what the mob hits for.  You can estimate it by (# of hits you expect to get hit before you die) X DB X shielding %.  But this number varies greatly depending on the mob.  For example on the Aneuks in Txevu if you have say 13K HP you can expect to take 13 hits before you die, so the value of shielding is 13 X 1000 X 1% = 130 HP per shielding.  Of course, the Anueks are a pretty extreme case.  I'd put each point of shielding at about equivalent of 50 HP versus most ubers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
                           When a mob min hit 560 ( DB 500 ) and max hit is 6k I don't see what shielding will do exactly, even if you had 100% shielding it would still be 60 5400. Lots of GoD mobs have very low DB making the mod useless and thats only talking about raid bosses because xp mobs DB is even lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd put each point of shielding at about equivalent of 50 HP versus most ubers.<br />
<br />
ok... so u think 1%shielding is equivalent of 50HP how about avoidance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1% more hit avoided is worth between 200-280 HP (depending on what your max HP is) if using the assumption mob to hit = 50%.  I think parse says 10 avoidance = 1% hits avoided so each avoidance would be about 20-24 HP.  Of course, avoidance tends to come in larger #s than shielding.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall the % avoided is constant under discs so that means the effect of avoidance under evasive is multiplied.  If you assume you get hit 33% of the time in evasive, then you're looking at 1% avoided hits worth about 300-420 HPs, so 1 avoidance = 30-42 HPs.<br />
<br />
Avoidance is almost guaranteed to be better in the long run versus shielding except against extreme cases (mobs with extremely high DB and low DI) but there just isn't that many good tank items with avoidance on them.  You end up sacrificing other stats for avoidance, whereas there's almost no bad tank item with shielding.  Thus my gear setup favors Shielding, but I'd certainly try to get avoidance if at all possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone check my math here but according to what I've seen avoidance is almost always superior to shielding.<br />
<br />
Let's run some numbers here:<br />
<br />
- I'm assuming that 10 avoidance = 1% more misses.<br />
- to make the equations look simpler I'm defining x=1d20(DI)<br />
<br />
10 avoidance = 0.01(DB + x)<br />
1% shielding = 0.01DB<br />
<br />
For 10 avoidance to equal 1% shielding you have 0.01(DB +x) = 0.01DB so x has to equal zero. So we know that 10 avoidance is always better than 1% shielding because for them to be equal, DI would have to be zero.<br />
<br />
The most shielding I've ever seen on an item is 5%. <br />
<br />
10 avoidance = 0.01(DB + x)<br />
5% shielding = 0.05DB<br />
<br />
For those to be equal, x must be 4 times DB so DB has to be 20% of the total damage. So any time a mob's DB is less than 20% of it's total damage 10 avoidance is superior to 5% shielding.<br />
<br />
To me that makes it fairly obvious that avoidance is almost always superior to shielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhm not sure what your logic is but avoidance 10 is a 1% reduction in the mobs actual hit rate ala if a mob hits 50% of the time with avoid 10 he will hit 49%.  This number is then multiplied by the mobs average hit for a dps figure.  To calculate shielding simply take the mobs DB x the shielding x the number of hits over the same time period and divide that number by seconds for a dps attributable to shielding.  You simply cant equate the 2 given the equasions you are using since one is a direct reduction of damage only if you are hit and the second is a direct reduction of hit % or average damage.  You also have to consider the effect that avoidance has on shielding, if you have avoid 10 then shielding will be less effective since you are hit 1 raw % less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see what your objection is unless you are referring to the fact that 1d20 will not be purely random since it is skewed by an AC vs ATK comparison.  My equations are still correct but the 1d20 portion of damage will be higher if your AC sucks and lower if your AC is good.  I just wrapped that whole portion of damage up as &quot;x&quot;.  That number is going to depend on your AC and you really need parses to get a real world comparison.  I was just trying to come up with a generalized comparison that fits.  If you plug in your own numbers for DB and &quot;x&quot; from whatever parses you may have done it all works out.  The ratio of DB to total damage is what I was interested in.<br />
<br />

<br />
Your logic is flawed here.  You're correct that avoidance reduces the amount of damage that shielding will prevent, but shielding also reduces the amount of damage that avoidance prevents.  Shielding reduces the average you are hit for.  Avoidance reduces the hit% against you.  The amount of damage you take over time is (hit%)*(average damage).  The average hit has still been reduced regardless of whether I was hit or missed.  By the same token, my chance to be missed has reduced the potential damage I take regardless of the fact that every hit will be for less because of shielding.  If my hit% goes down by 10% and my average hit goes down by 10% then I take .9*.9=81% of the damage I normally would have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also dont take survivability into consideration which is a very very large x factor as shielding reduces spike damage and avoidance encourages it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sythrak</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's one particular boss in Tacvi that having max shielding is quite handy.   Considering how rare avoidance items are (and some are becoming outdated) it's not something to really worry about.   I think the max we can get is 55 avoidance currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarian Silverthorn</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do your clerics heal you based on the mobs average damage? Answer is hell no or you will die a lot. They have to heal with spikes in mind not average. Thus in a lot of ways Shielding is superior to avoidance. Shielding is guarenteed to lower the total damage a spike can do. Avoidance only lowers the chance of a full spike but when it comes, and it will, you will take a harder spike than the shielding would. I would wager that 99% of you in GoD die only when a mob gets a spike past the spam H Lights. <br />
<br />
Lets take a mob that has db of 500 and a DI of 125<br />
If you got 25% shielding you are protecting yourself from 125 damaged per swing with the shielding. Having 50 avoidance would make him hit you less but when he did get a full quad on you, you would take 475 more than the shielding person in that quad even if all hits were for minimum or if they were for max. Basically in the end it comes down to living thru a bad spike when it comes cause no matter what your avoidance you will still get full quaded sometimes and those are the times you live or die based on your mitigation not your avoidance. <br />
<br />
Overall I look at it like this.<br />
Shielding is superior for mobs that have high enough spike damage that your clerics do not use c heal at all.<br />
Avoidance is superior for fights with lower spike damage to the point that c heal is actually used as the standard heal instead of spam style lights.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that depends how well geared you are I guess.. <br />
<br />
I'm guessing alot of Tacvi+ MTs will be hitting the 35% shielding cap in the coming months once OoW is released and Tunat/Tacvi north wing is beaten.<br />
<br />
Once you are at the shielding cap you can then start to consider on which slots you want to give up some shielding in favor of other mods, like avoidance or Improved Dodge/Parry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While of course avoidance will bring better overall DPS reduction (assuming you have focused<br />
as much on it as on shielding). And reduce the impact of Shielding (less hits)<br />
<br />
I prefer knowing :<br />
I will take 200 less per hit from Mob01 than I will get hit 46% of the time and not 50%.<br />
In my mind shielding reduces spikes, avoidance reduces DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
I regret some of my choices (passing avoidance to get shielding) because as it turns out<br />
its really really hard to reach decent avoidance values.<br />
Shielding is very very easy to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah that's why I jumped on a few avoidance items as soon as I could.  So far I have 12% shielding and 30 avoidance.  The avoidance will be pretty hard to raise much further.  The shielding will be pretty easy to increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO RZ Cloak &gt; Quarm cloak, because RZ Cloak is pretty competive with other cloaks in the game, (Little low on HP side, but it has more AC then most cloaks too)<br />
<br />
while most other avoidance items you generally sacrafice quite a bit more HP/AC/other stat wise (Like Globe of Mystical Protection)<br />
<br />
Of course with how deep time tables are, sometimes you can be really lucky and see a lot of cloaks, then not see any till your done, I wouldnt be overally picky on which one you pick up, (In my personal experience Quarm cloak was more common, but thats probably mostly RNG)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totally your RNG.  For us it was 8 RZ cloaks vs 3 Q cloaks.</div></div><hr />
