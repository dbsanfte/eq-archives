<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I attended an open MB raid yesterday and although we wiped at 8 pct on MB due to the MA calling assist before establishing agro (thanks to HoTT Leadership AA in my group, I never saw the MA on the target list before I died).<br />
<br />
Now, one of the things I experienced when noticing at MB w/ 75% health was ping-ponging all over.  So I tried taunting and AET (I was SA), I don't think AET ever gives a failed message, it just does what it does silently and we have no way for sure of knowing what happened if said mob doesn't immediately come say 'hi'.  However, I definitely saw a message saying taunt failed because I was silenced.  I never thought of taunt being voice only (gestures, kicks, elbows, etc) so I was a bit surprised.<br />
<br />
My question is, what else does Silence affect for warriors besides Taunt?<br />
<br />
Do disciplines still work?<br />
Does AET really still fire or does it fail, but still trigger timer?<br />
Do weapons still proc?<br />
Do our clickies still click?<br />
<br />
I'd also like to apologize if I missed an existing thread on this and for sounding like a raiding newbie, but I just never faught any mobs that cast silence before.<br />
<br />
P.S.  MA was wielding a sword of bloodsworn and a 13/19 hammer w/ mirror proc (no LDoN procs on either), but had 350 more hp, 100 less ac than me.  It had never occured to me before, but I've never seen an open raid inspect the warriors agro gear before, should they?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I should clarify, I do not know if it was AET or regular Taunt that failed (I did both as neither one got me agro immediately), and I've yet to see any message relating to AET's success or failure).  I only found this out when I scrolled up after wipe trying to figure out what happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE taunt can easily miss targets, especially mobile large ones. You basically have to be in the center of the mob to have a very good chance of it working. Sometimes it just misses... It sure sucks when it does though!</div></div><hr />

You can't Incite or proc while silenced.<br />
<br />
You can activate discs and use ae taunt while silenced.<br />
<br />
This is likely what it will return too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ack!  That was my fear...even if I was MA and wielding a BoC and a BF with Anger 3 / Anger 2 that my procs would not work, thus leaving melee DPS as the sole source of agro for mobs that do AE Silence (of course, if there is time between AE's to proc, it would still be good).<br />
<br />
This also confirms that for these fights, having fresh haste before engaging is important (I noticed when I died on MB, I had no haste and I don't think it was overwritten by a DoT as there was just an empty buff slot).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the best method for tanking (retaining agro) these type of mobs (any advice from old school tanks)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first thing you need to realize is his AE silence is radius 100.<br />
<br />
The second thing you need to realize is he has 4 stackable dots, 900/tick, all radius 100.<br />
<br />
The third thing you need to realize is, if the raid gets dotted, blood aggro will be a major problem.  You can't taunt off of blood aggro.<br />
<br />
The fourth thing to realize is supernal remedy is range 200.   Clerics can stay outside all the AEs and heal using remedy.<br />
<br />
The fifth thing to realize is MB only has like 150k hp.  If you have a stable fight, you can take your time killing him, with a small number of people.<br />
<br />
Raid force: 1 group on each corner to keep all the spiders dead.<br />
                  1 MT<br />
                  4-5 clerics<br />
                  a group of rangers.<br />
<br />
When MB goes live, tank runs in, beats on him a bit to get aggro. Pull him to the MIDDLE of the south wall.  Don't pull him to a corner, or he will be able to AE people out in the hallway through the wall, as it is an outdoor zone.  Once aggro is established, the rangers run in to the north wall, where they are also out of the AEs.  Then they plink him dead.<br />
<br />
MB is not a zerg fight, it's a ranged fight.  All you have to do is set it up right.  Use your knights on the corners to keep the spiders dead.<br />
<br />
The alst thing to realize about this fight is that when MB is dead, you haven't won yet.  often you will have spiders still aggroed on the corners.  You need to extract your raid force from aggro fights so they can hail the gnome, without having tons of spiders aggro the raid and wipe you.  So, once MB is dead, the rangers then run to a corner, and kill spiders til the group is clear of aggro. Then run to another corner and do the same thing.  Work your way around to each corner, until there are no more ongoing fights, and all the spiders are peaceful.  Finally, have a monk tag the gnome and pull him out into the hallway, and FD.  This way people won't take 4K DD from going in teh room to hail him.</div></div><hr />

Gnomos if there was a shortage of Rangers w/ AM ... any reason Wizards (and possibly other nuke classes) could supplement the ranged attackers?<br />
<br />
Also, what is the official status of pets for MB?<br />
<br />
I'm asking, because I'm kinda sick of people leading open MB raids and saying ok, we zerg and hope our dps is enough.  I've read the Strat Guide from SoW and it pretty much agrees with what you said (well, one of the listed strats does) and it makes sense to me that what you say would work.  I just know open raids can't rely on AA's or # of ppl of a class.<br />
<br />
I also assume your method should work with zero enchanters even?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went into MB room and measured it using loc.  Its 250 units from door to door.  If MB is in the middle - dead in the middle - , and his AE is 100 units, you should be able to have the MA hold him there and clerics stand in the doorway and heal him.  Range attackers do same. <br />
<br />
Has anyone tried this?  By my measurements its fine.  I don't see the need to position him on the south wall.<br />
<br />
After going on someone else's raid with an alt (that wiped horribly) i read a bit and decided that the strat of having ONLY the MA in the room and then range DPS on MB was the way to go.   But if his AE extends out into the hallway, its bigger than 100 distance units, and i'll have to rethink my strat i was planning.  Clerics need ER item for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We used to use a furious rotation and full burn on MB. Been a while but as I recall used MGB HoT's a la grummus as well as pally/cleric group heals. MA would tank furious, when it was up SA would AE taunt, furious. Used to use about 3-4 tanks back when furious lasted 9 seconds. Aggro with tanks using Furious wasn't a problem.<br />
<br />
Course, I think the people I did this with were a little more Pally heavy then most raids, YMMV. Our problem in first few attempts was MA death, not ae damage. With 4 warriors in rotation and 12 sec furious, you're looking at a raid DPS of something like 3k to pull this off, I beleive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I ran an open MB raid tonight (Wed) with some assistance from a monk who claimed to have done MB for a win before.  Here is a recap:<br />
<br />
It was tough getting them, be we did end up with 4 enchanters, with a bard stationed at each door to MB to catch any spiders that slipped through.<br />
<br />
There were two level 65 warriors on raid, I had the most hp/ac/aa of the warriors and more hp/ac than the hybrid tanks.  Thus, I was MA for MB (I made hybrid's MA/SA on trash to make it quicker moving from place to place).<br />
<br />
We put an enchanter in each corner, did 3 groups in each corner except the clerics, MA and a Monk (who was helping me).  After positioning each set of groups, I showed the pet classes where to park pets (in room with blue light that drops spiders) to avoid any possible AE agro.  I also had each set of groups pick their own corner MA for spiders.  I also told groups to not rely on clerics for heals, look to druids and shaman.<br />
<br />
I put the clerics next to bards and told them to use remedy for heals, no chain healing, also told them to load a stun in case a bard missed a spider (just a last ditch effort if it came to it).<br />
<br />
Warned everyone that no casters should enter MB room ever (we'd monk fd the gnome out if we killed mb), and that if they got to close they would be silenced, dotted, etc.  Also warned melee to leave about 5 slots open for MB AE's and any HoT's.<br />
<br />
After MB became targetable, I made sure all clerics (roughly 4 - 8 clerics) were at doors, then I went in and did incite, furious, defensive and then aet (to make sure I was above any healers agro right before calling assist).  I was in there I think about 30 seconds before calling assist, MB was at 98 pct health.  Apparently some melee snuck in before I called assist (I'm told they ran in behind me), so this was perhaps partly to blame for the problem I experienced.<br />
<br />
At around 73 pct life on MB, I complete lost agro.  Even incite would not get agro back.  MB went for hallways, I sat down to try bringing him back, but I couldn't hold agro after standing up.  We had MB down to 18 pct health when raid wiped.  Although the cc teams were starting to have problems with spiders before complete wipe (we did have an FD necro who rezzed a cleric back after wipe, but couldn't get everyone back due to corpses in MB's room to try again before despawn).<br />
<br />
I'm told from my wife (a cleric) that the clerics did not get hit by any AE until after I lost agro and MB decided to go visit some casters.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking the single biggest problem is that I lost agro too soon.  I'm sure having melee run in before hand didn't help.  I'm thinking that melee should keep clearing spiders until I have used up roughly 40-60 percent of clerics mana pool or until MB is down to 85% health and then switch to mezzing and call in all out dps.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind, since it's an open raid, I can't count on more than myself for warrior tank with AET.  Nor can I count on my rangers or wizards with 100+ AA.  Additionally, I do not have, nor know anyone I can rely on that has HoTT Raid Leadership AA.  It also occurs to me that I did not assign anyone to MGB HoT, but I know there were very few there that had MGB, so after Kazad, not sure we had an MGB'er.<br />
<br />
Any help with what I did wrong or what I could do better or should have done would be most welcome.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I was raid buffed to roughly 8000 HP / 1500 AC and did not die until MB around 22% health and was horrified and frustrated that I could not hold agro even with a nice ramp up of 30 seconds (mostly) alone time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iyacc</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what we finally came up with way back when we were learning this, and it's how we still do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
CC is key. We put enchanters in all four corners outside MB room and a bard and druid on each side or each corner if enough. Everyone kills spiders til MB becomes targetable, then enchanters start to mezz new spiders and we clean up any existing ones by the doors. Once both sides are clear of agro, we engage.<br />
<br />
MT goes in and pulls MB to north wall, everyone else goes in and goes to south wall. <br />
<br />
Melee engage him with MT at north wall and keep him there, all ranged dps hits him from south wall - rangers, mages, wizards, necros, etc....<br />
<br />
Healers are south using long range heals.<br />
<br />
As soon as he dies, everyone exits room on same side (we use east.) Monk tags gnome out and loses agro.<br />
<br />
CC groups either gate or die. <br />
<br />
We use bestow DA or bard DA on whoever wins drops to run back in and loot their item.<br />
<br />
MB dies now in less than a minute, but for new people who need the flag they will have lower dps so two minutes probably for the fight. You need good CC to keep a half dozen or maybe more spiders mezzed for a couple minutes. We use bards as runners outside. They can help mezz, or they can pickup spiders that get missed and bring them back to the enchanter, etc...  Druids with enchanters can heal if needed and can also snare or root spiders. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another strat the pickup raiders use on my server is all out DPS and load up on SK with improved HT, necros with lifeburn and wizards with manaburn. It's crude, but they win sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with this is you have to keep opening the door for the rangers, it eats up some of their trueshot time.  It's better to just move him to the south wall so the range attackers can get inside.<br />
<br />
As for nuking, if you use bolts or other longer range spells, or have an extended range item, then the more DPS the merrier.  Just try to keep enough DPS on the corners to keep the spiders dead too.<br />
<br />
And yeah, you can do this mob with 0 enchanters, although KEI/VoQ is nice for mana on clerics and nukers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as you don't pull him east or west of the center line, the hall is safe (except for the knockback proc, which is radius 200 or 300).  The point of moving him to the south wall (which is easy enough to do when you don't have aggro problems) is so the range people don't have to deal with the door closing all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess Cuthbadth is someone got AEed, and got blood aggro.  Once he runs out in the hall and AE dots the raid, you're in deep doodoo, because you'll never get everybody cured.  He will go from person to person who has blood aggro from the dots.  I guess what you can do in this situation is for the clerics to run out of range of MB, keep healing you, and use RC to cure themselves.  Once all the dotted people die, you might get control of teh fight again.  Often what happens though is the clerics get dotted and then killed, then the raid wipes.<br />
<br />
This is particularly a problem on pickup raids, which tend to be large.  The more people you have there, the more dot victims there are, and the more likely that you will have some fool get dotted and drag MB to the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramelus</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys are way, way, way overthinking the encounter.<br />
<br />
It's not difficult at all.<br />
<br />
First of all, keeping a group at each corner to fight spiders is a waste.  That's 24 people who could be hurting the mob.  Just use 4 enchanters.  The spiders are mezzable, and light blue to 65.  Just keep them out of the room for 90 seconds and you're golden.<br />
<br />
Keep the mob in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
Use MGB heals before you rush inside, not after.<br />
<br />
Procs have always been blocked by silence, it was like this back in Velious fighting that stupid tree in PoGrowth, Aten Ha Ra in VT, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I went on another MB raid (I did not run it).  We had a 10k tank (and 9k SA SK) and the outcome was worse than the raid I led, MB was down to 67% when the entire raid wiped.  I know it wasn't a spider aoe'ing.  This raid was led by a person who has over 10 MB wins, yet no lev was cast on anyone to combat the knockback and assist was called for melee within seconds of the MA engaging.  The MA never had sufficient agro as MB was out in the halls at 90 some percent health (an early indicator of the wipe to be).<br />
<br />
So, my major question I guess is, how do you make sure the MA has enough agro before calling assist on a mob that taunt won't work and weapon procs don't work?<br />
<br />
Let's assume only one tank with AET (as if MA dies, MB is on the clerics fast and one of em will have blood agro in a heartbeat on an open raid).<br />
<br />
How much 'alone' time is sufficient to retain agro either throughout the fight or at least until MB is at 70 percent and FULL BURN is called?<br />

Besides getting an SK to cast an agro enhancing spell (which I did not have on the raid I led and perhaps it might've made a big enough difference), what else can I do besides hitting incite everytime it pops up (or tell the MA to do, if we have another 10k tank again...because a 10k tank = useless w/o agro)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer is don't give MB a reason to go in the halls.  Put the whole raid in the room before he wakes up.  Aggro management does not require procs... Incite works while silenced; give the MT Voice of Thule ahead of time for aggro; use SCS3 healers for the early heals.  Give the MT 20 seconds and then call for full burn/disc, no point waiting until 70%, time is your enemy there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread is pissing me off, it bugs me everytime a guild tries to zerg this encounter just running everyone they can into the room to get hossed out by his AE Silence and AE DoTs.  As such I'll give you a brief summary of the strategy I have formulated for my guild for this encounter, ever since I have formulated the strat we have never ever lost nor ever come even close to losing.<br />
<br />
First thing you have to realize is that the Manaetic Behemoth has very little HP.  In fact you could 2-3 group the retard if it werent for his script.<br />
<br />
There in lies the key.  You CAN 2-3 group the behemoth, and you do.<br />
<br />
First I start off with the MA group.  The WAR who is gonna tank behemoth, a cleric or two, and then any RNG WIZ MAG we have.<br />
<br />
From there I just fill up as many groups as we can as we have RNG WIZ MAG.  I usually toss a CLR/DRU or two in the groups to kinda &quot;reserve&quot; them for being on spot heals for the WAR.<br />
<br />
At this point you will have everyone who is going to actually be bothering with the behemoth grouped up.<br />
<br />
1x WAR, all RNG MAG WIZ, whatever CLR/DRU you want to be spot healing you (4-5 is more than enough).<br />
<br />
It's at this point you throw everyone else into spider groups.  First I toss 4 invites to people i know are competant enough and tell them to form the most balanced group they can.<br />
<br />
This sets up the 4 core spider groups. NE SE NW SW corners.  From there I just have people form up as many balanced groups as there are people left over.  I usually set them to &quot;wander&quot; groups I have them if i only have 1-2 extra.<br />
<br />
So now we have 3 types of groups<br />
<br />
DPS Groups (all WIZ RNG MAG, 1x WAR, whatever spot healers you want)<br />
Spider Groups (4x): NE SE NW SW corners to kill spiders.<br />
Wander Groups: I usually set them West or East walls and have them split up evenly at first to their corresponding North/South spider groups.  They are the people who are &quot;on call&quot; for their side.<br />
<br />
By on call I mean I ask all the spider groups to let me know asap if they're backlogging, I will then call the resident &quot;Wander&quot; group to go help them temporarily.<br />
<br />
So now we have the raid setup.<br />
<br />
Go place them in all 4 corners, two corners per side of MB room.  They have that little lamp in them.<br />
<br />
The DPS Groups setup on the West wall directly in front of the behemoth's door.<br />
<br />
After everyone gets setup, you make the call to start killing spiders.  It's at this point everyone except your DPS groups start hossing spiders.  This is otherwise known as &quot;Yay, look at the raid leader xp move&quot; mode.  You commence this for 10 minutes or whatever the timer is to get him to become &quot;live&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is a secret method I use here which negates any possibility of a wipe, accidental agro, overagro, etc.  It enables my raid to disc/burn from the second the MA engages and its virtually impossible to take agro from him.  However that is the part of my strat I will keep secret (at least for now).<br />
<br />
But that little method is not needed.<br />
<br />
Next you have your MA run in, pop defensive, blow Incite, and start hossing the hell out of him for about 10-15 seconds to work up agro.  At this point you call rangers disc and light nukes.  At about 80% Call full burn.  I also tell all the shadowknights in the raid to break from their spider group, run to the room, blow Harm Touch, then resume to their spider group.  Thanks to the DX9 patch no one has to keep the door open for arrows to hit, but somsone should anyways just for visual purposes.<br />
<br />
Basically the only person in the room is the MA.  Your 3 groups of DPS (2-3 work fine) blow up the behemoth like butter, and grats a flawless kill.  The important thing is to KEEP KILLING SPIDERS even after he dies.  Leader runs in, checks loot, awards it quickly, people loot it quick and return to spider groups.  Once you're done with the corpse you call ALL MOVE TO EAST WALL.<br />
<br />
It's at this point EVERYONE in the raid regardless if they have spiders or not.  It's critical EVERYONE moves no matter what is going on.  They just run through the behemtoh room if they're on the west side, and condense down to the behemoth door if on the east side.  This will place your entire raid right at the flag gnome.  You then tell everyone to kill any spiders that are agro, but do not attack new ones.  Once you're clear of spider agro hail up your flags.<br />
<br />
Here's a fun thing I do that I don't really see many other people do.  I'm more comfortable explaining this secret because its really not that special.  However it will help out.<br />
<br />
The fun thing is, unlike the Planar Projections, Giwin can be agrod and run around.  After your raid hails you have a good 15-20 minutes it seems (he stays up longer than PP's) to extract any flags from him.  So what I do is I have the raid plow back out to the zone in.  My main is an enchanter so I tash Giwin and bring him with us, and park him at the zone in via memblur.  I tell everyone to login alternates or guildmates they have access to for backflag purposes and run to zone in (i try and have them pre-camp there prior to raid call though).  It's funny to see people try and leech free flags by hailing him up, but since you can't flag unless you're in the raid that got credit it's all good.  I then just sit there and invite guildmate's alts/latecomers/boxed guildmates and just leech as much flags as I can from him.<br />
<br />
This should help you out in both killing the behemoth trivially as well as maximizing your flags so you don't have to backflag this guy as much.  The most annoying part of this raid is setting up your groups properly and getting those people to get to their designated spots (people are dumb).<br />
<br />
Hope it helped.  Maybe sometime in the future I publish my full even more in depth strat on this with homemade maps included ;) I do very in depth strats for my guild and post them for every encounter we do.  Whenever I quit I plan on making them all public.  But people trying to zerg behemoth pisses me off too much I couldn't wait for this one ;P Using this method I have lead something like 7-8 behemoths without even a little scare that we may wipe.  All of them completely flawless kills.<br />
<br />
--<br />
EDIT: Oh yea I forgot two little things.  <br />
<br />
Number one, it is wise to fully resist buff your MA with FR/PR/DR/CR(The 4 types of AE DoT that the behemoth will randomly spawn using ONE of them, diff each time) and MR for the AE Gflux that he always has.  You will also want DMF on him as well for one it helps PR and for the levitate so your tank can keep the guy still easily.  <br />
<br />
Number two, NO PETS.  I know I have Mages in the DPS groups, but pets will screw your warriors ability to keep the mob positioned well enough since he's the only one there, and you may end up pushing him too far to AE the East spider groups, or even OOR of heals, or what not.  NO PETS they're not needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot!  I led (with some help from two people) my second MB raid to success!  Thanks everyone for your input, I found most of it very useful.<br />
<br />
I want to say I agree that it seems very plausible that this mob is doable without sending in all the melee, however people seem very reluctant to try this and we had 9 (yes, 9!) enchanters on this raid (and a couple bards), so we had mezzing power to spare.  If I ever do this again and we do not have enough enchanters, I'd have little hesitation to use that tactic.<br />
<br />
Changes I made from first attempt:<br />
* Changed level of open raid from 55+, to 60+ preferred (a few ppl were 57ish)<br />
* Clerics (and Wizards, to keep them from temptation of nuking spiders) are at MB doors...ranged dps (rangers, nukers, etc.) once mezzing began<br />
* We used as little mana as possible killing spiders<br />
* Made sure everyone had lev and melee haste was fresh before agroing MB<br />
* Made sure MA had SK agro buff (Voice of T...)<br />
* Clerics used remedy to spam healing, MA went in with HoT<br />
* MA was alone with MB til 95% (completely alone, no other melee)<br />
* First assist at 95%, we did mgb heal over time both sides, melee dps only (inc. rangers)<br />
* At approximately 50 - 60% health, SK's HT'd and melee went offensive<br />
* At 30 - 40% we called for full burn dps (nuking begins at full throttle)<br />
<br />
In the end, there were fewer than 5 people that may not have gotten the flag out of 72.<br />
<br />
Things that I still need to learn:<br />
Best method for handling post MB kill 'messiness':<br />
* Not everyone listened about returning to spider corners and clearing out mezzed spiders<br />
* Best way to handle getting people safely to mb's corpse after flagging is done for loot (personally I was happy with getting the raid flagged, but there is always someone that's gotta b*tch about loot).<br />
<br />
If using enchanters to mez, is dragging any corpses out of mb's room and then doing mem blur the best way?  If so, do you restart killing spiders to handle looting?<br />
<br />
*** Edit *** Just say your method for moving Giwin, definitely interesting, we just used monk to drag to gnome to raid after rezzing (just some confusion due to spiders post MB kill) ... so you do loot first, then handle flagging at zone in?  I assume you must have any that died (although few, if any, should, using your tactics) rezzed before having raid move clear back to zi due to the 10 minute despawn timer on gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The gnome stays up for what I would guesstimate to be 25-30 minutes.  It's a lot longer than a conventional Planar Projection.<br />
<br />
We would as I say in my strat, we would KEEP killing spiders and I'd award loot quickly (may not be that viable for a pickup raid situation to award that quickly, i dont know).  Then we move the entire raid East to where the gnome ends up.  At this point we're done with the behemoth corpse (I usually leave the parchments up because they piss me off).  So no one has a need for being in that room.  Then we bring whatever spiders are currently agro to taht location, finish them off, and then we're all de-agro'd.  Since no one died, we don't have to worry about rezzing but the occasional retard dying to spider agro in the process of this has happened and thats where we rez.<br />
<br />
It's at this point we hail and get flags for everyone who is in that raid.  So we are just east of MB room, where giwin ends up, all hailed, all done.  As far as the Raid on MB is concerned.  Everything is done, all have their flags.  It's at this point giwin has at least 15-20 min left on his timer.  I then tell the raid to plow out of the factroy to the zone in so I can run Giwin to the zone in.<br />
<br />
Then any latecomers, alternates, or boxed guildmates can meet me there who were unable to attend the MB raid itself, and I invite them for flags.<br />
<br />
I hope that make sense.<br />

<br />
Or instead of wasting an AA that not a lot of clerics will have (or should have unless they've got a lot of other AA first).  Just take 3 minutes and keep doing whatever Crowd Control you had been doing and award loot.  Don't overcomplicate things.<br />
