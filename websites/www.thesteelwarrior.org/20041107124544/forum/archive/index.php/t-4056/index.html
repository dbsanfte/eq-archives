i just read the patch message and now every char has 200 Sense Heading. I think thats a slap in the face for all of us who worked so hard to raise that skill. Now every noob gets it for free....<br />
Why dont they give like every noob a lev 60 char with good gear so everyone can just kill gods without any work for it?</div></div><hr />

Binding it to a movement key = hard work? ;)</div></div><hr />

I've had some time to think about this, since this thread (http://thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3702) started.<br />
<br />
I didn't work hard on Sense Heading ... I just mapped it to a movement key and &quot;wiggled&quot; for 10 minutes after every ding.  I'm not gonna miss losing two hotkeys cuz unmapping the movement keys from them is more effort than it was worth, to me.<br />
<br />
They've taken a quick, low coding approach to removing one of the more needless skill checks in the game, IMO.  If it took months to code it and develop it, I'd be incensed that they spent time on it instead of tuning class balance.  But it looks to me that all they did was a minor database change, and I've done more complex tasks waiting for the coffee to brew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was too stupid to tie my Sense Heading to a movement key (more proof that PAL is not an INT hybrid).  Nonetheless it wasn't hard to keep my character's SH maxed unless I was shamelessly PLing them.  <br />

Still I am happy for this change.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They should have made this skill unbindable to a key way back....this is just the latest extension of that flawed design IMHO (its too hard to do good design....lets punt!).  <br />
<br />
No sense (pun intended) crying over spilt milk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was somewhat unhappy that they were making things so easy for newbs.  But really, how hard is it to know which direction you're facing?  I think it was really just a needless skill at this point of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Look at it this way, with maps the skill really is kinda worthless.  Technically, they just removed the Sense Heading skill.  Since the compass is based off the skill, they just moved everyone to 200 skill to &quot;remove&quot; it.</div></div><hr />

I think the new changes were good ideas.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure they may be gimping the game down from when we played, but come on:<br />
<br />
Did you learn anything scribing and memorizing your spells for 5 minutes?<br />
Did you learn anything sitting on your ass and healing without bandages?<br />
Did you learn anything while clicking on a key?<br />
Did you learn anything while mapping your hotbuttons?</div></div><hr />

exactly, it was trivial to max it anyways. there are much bigger problems with noobs being spoiled these days, Sense heading definatly is nice. I absolutly hate maxing it on all chars.<br />

I agree with ya, but what about no CR till 10, no exp loss till 11 ?</div></div><hr />

Gotta keep them playing. Remember, when EQ came out, there wasnt much in the way of competition for  game like this. Now there is, and whoever has the most user friendly beginings wins the extended payment plan~</div></div><hr />

Sure, I learned what was comfortable / uncomfortable as I mapped / remapped on my first character.  Seems stupid, but try to think back to when you were first learning EQ.<br />
<br />

Give 'em a stack of newbie beer with the bandages and bag or 50 alcohol tolerance.  Both ideas make sense and do nothing to game balance.  EQ has lost all concept of flavor and roleplayer (if it ever had any)</div></div><hr />

One of my favorite memories in all of EQ is back when I was totally new to the game, a gnome wizard.  This was back in the days before you could actually change your clip plane or turn up your gamma correction.  Night time was actually DARK.  I had very little feel for where the noob area in steamfont was back then, I was lucky to find it in daylight.  Well, I died to a couple of kobold runts, and was fortunate to get a higher level (6, gasp!) necro to locate corpse for me.  As this helpful little gnome ran to my corpse, she continually cast spells (failing of course, since she was moving).  What utility was this?  Well, it left a blazing trail of light through the black night as she ran up and down the hills directly to my corpse, making a trail that was impossible for me to miss.  I think the dumbing down and demystification of the game has definitely degraded the game.</div></div><hr />

/em meanders off quietly remembering those fond memories of dinging 60 in Fungus Grove after playing since 1999 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Roks01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I miss the days of the lost corpses ;/ no more suspense while checking out new zones.  I was always worried about what big huge monster was going to kick my ass if it saw me and i would lose my corpse, but it was exciting exploring new things even with the risk involved.  Risk was real back then, there is no risk now, except being steamrolled by someone else if you fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kaluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I remember the days when lev 50 was the highest you could ding :). And I remember they made a big deal for the first one who did it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm...makes me think to when they did the best of the best in the LR arena.  I specifically remember an Afterlife (I know big shock there) Myrmidon won the warrior one.  Got a nifty title to go along with it too.</div></div><hr />
