<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenlaien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 3 or 4 Choices for my back Slot.<br />
1. Cloak of Greater Pernicity (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18979) <br />
2. Steel Wrapped Cloak (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19996) (this is what I have now)<br />
3. Lodizal Shell Shield (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4061) <br />
4. Cloak of the Maelstrom (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3998) <br />
<br />
I'm trying to find a good balance with Stats/AC/Resists. Some of these don't offer resists, but some do, which is why I included Lodi.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hierophant's Cloak (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1622) <br />
<br />
It may be a kunark era cloak, but it still owns... no saves on it, but wayyyyy more hps than any of the other stuff you're talkin about, especially when shaman buffed to max stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree 100% Grendon.<br />
<br />
Unless you have back haste, Hiero cloak is the best value for your PP. It has reached it's bottom price on most servers so it is unlikely you will lose any plats when you upgrade it eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hiero cloak is the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hiero cloak is good, but if you already have Lodi Shield, save it for raids you need EB on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i like my pernicity cloak...especially with all that non +str gear that my myrmidon armours have.<br />
i guess if your max stamina than the heiro is nice; although i got my pernicity cloak tonight for 8K in the bazaar.<br />
click me profile to the left to see the results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Iksar Hide Cape .... ac 10, 75hp/mana, 15pr/dr.  Give up 4 stamina (over Heiro) for some quality saves, good deal to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kenlaien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yea, I guess I should have mentioned her stam is dreadfully low.<br />
<br />
We're talking &lt;150... well &lt;140... &lt;130... yea it's 129 unbuffed. I'm doin anything and everything I can to raise Sta... including buying a bracelet of fortitude ASAP.<br />
<br />
PS: Her magelo can be found here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=171880).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I vote for the pernicity cloak.  I'm also quite a bit away from capping stamina buffed.<br />
<br />
Don't worry too much about having resists in your normal gear.  The times when you need resists you can swap gear out.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't go for the cloak first though.  I would recommend saving up for a haste upgrade to something like a soulscream (which is getting pretty cheap nowdays).  After that, you can look for things like a belt, earring (solstice), bracer, SS gloves MQ.  These things would be cheaper than getting the cloak, and are more of a pure upgrade (rather than exchanging hps/ac).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">pernicity cloak gives you 11 more hps over heiro, i would go with the higher hp cloak for long term.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think what the proponents of the Hiero are saying is this.  You won't have to upgrade it for a LONG time!  Pernicity would show up on the &quot;needs to be upgraded&quot; list sooner as it has less raw HP's.<br />
<br />
All things being equal HP's&gt;STA imho.<br />
<br />
Even tho my STA is maxed w/ shammy lubbins, I only very recently retired my hiero cloak :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you don't mind a bit of questing, look at the Loyalist Shield of honor.  50ac some STR and 75hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you don't mind a bit of questing, LOL. Wow is that even an understatement, that is unless 'a bit' = countless hours. 50ac 75hp is pretty sweet for a back slot, but you could upgrade 5 or 6 other slots camping gear in Droga/Veksar/Chardok b.<br />
<br />
Anyway, like Khana said, a Hiero cloak is a long term upgrade. You might be hurting for STA now, but a couple of months from now when you can max STA with shammy buffage, the Hiero will be the better cloak.<br />
<br />
Also, there quite a few other slots you could upgrade and get better results. Here are some ideas:<br />
 <br />
1. Ear - Earring of the Solstice (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28771) <br />
2. Gloves - Gauntlets of the Myrmidon (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=31186) <br />
3. Shoulders - Draconic Pauldrons (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12557) or Forged shoulderpads (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=13689) <br />
4. Wrist - Cultural bracer (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=23807)<br />
5. Neck - clattering bone neck (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6418) <br />
6. Belt (haste) - Soulscream belt (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65570) <br />
<br />
You should be able to camp or buy all of these items pretty easily. All of them but the belt are cheaper than the cloak you are looking to buy. For the price of the cloak, you should be able to buy all 9 earring of the solstice gifts and a cultural bracer and maybe even a clattering bone necklace if prices are low on your server. You should be able to camp the belt in Veksar, the drop seems to be fairly common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/shrug... we finished 3 of them in about 6 hours total, from start to finish.  Had the named pop back to back in TM, and once more 4 hours later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">wow. Unless they have changed the spawn on the named vamp in TM, getting 3 in 4 hours is nothing short of miraculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Good substitute for the Forged Shoulderpads is Mantle of Ill Omen.  Little less AC, more hps and saves.  I would likely have the shoulderpads but the amunches on my server are trying to rip warriors off (18k my ass).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kenlaien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I haven't done anything with the cloak as as of yet.<br />
<br />
Last night however I got a Bracelet of Fortitude, and quested the Draconic Pauldrons (Really nice considering it took me all of one hour to do).<br />
<br />
So I raised the stam bar by 27 for around 4k and 1 hour of killin.<br />
<br />
As far as the Pernicity/Lodi cloaks go.<br />
<br />
I have all the quest pieces except the horn (which sells for 5-7k on Quell) for the Cloak, and my ranger is wearing a Lodi cloak as of now. The idea was to finish up the Pern quest and either give her the Pern or Lodi and my ranger take the other. Cloak of the Maelstrom got tossed in because it's a cloak I could take some friends and get as a drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aluamilli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks for all the help and suggestions everyone. Ken is busting his hump to get me geared up. In a little over 2 weeks he's got the amulet, belt, greaves, bracer, helm, boots, shoulders, and another bracer for me.<br />
<br />
I've went from having just barely over 100STA to having over 150 and gained alot of AC/HPs in the process.<br />
<br />
The Soulscream belt is my next goal. I saw another post about it and have been keepin up, the mob who drops it spawns in the Shop in Veksar right? Beside all Golems and the one &quot;Massive&quot; Golem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics19/Loyalist_Shield.jpeg <br />
<br />
It calls to you, sings to you, ruffles your pillows....<br />
<br />
Seriously, spend the time and do this quest.  I did it and would do it again in a heartbeat if I had to.  It's not a hard quest.  The final fight is not difficult.  You may find yourself spending many hours on the balcony of the castle in the Tenebrous Mountains, but do not doubt the vanity of doing so.  In the end, it will more than pay off.<br />
<br />
And no, they did not change Heratius Grolden's spawn time.</div></div><hr />
