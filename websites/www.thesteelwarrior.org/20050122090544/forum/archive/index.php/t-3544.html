<br />
I was also tempted to put Lifetaps on my Primal.  Glad I haven't messed with any Augs yet.  As with all expansions they need major tweaking and bug fixing after release...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just guessing here, but with another good proc,  a primal weapon became a very viable offhander, and they probably want them to get swapped instead of basically being permanent Avatar + a good weapon.<br />
<br />
Also, the BFG went from being a primo endgame MT weapon back to just a useful toy. :(<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
obligatory hint if you didn't understand that 2nd item: bfg equips in mainhand, but did ranged attack damage... with proper aggro preparation and a high end hate proc, it was perhaps the best MT weapon in the game for 1 rounder mobs.  Too bad, I hadn't saved up enough APs to buy a yke or hate proc for mine yet. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
A fucking SWG / Quake / Doom weapon that accidentally mad eit into EQ, and should have been retroactively rmeoved form the game the second it was discovered.<br />
<br />
Great idea (knockback clicky), ridiculously horrible graphic (sci-fi gun).<br />
<br />
solution - make it a magic gnomish crossbow....</div></div><hr />

FYI normal crossbows belong to the ice dorfs and are not useable by anyone but them for some odd reason.</div></div><hr />

But I agree w/ Brutul.... SOE/VI have always considered primals to be overpowered.<br />
<br />
Now if they would just make an Avatar/Ferine Avatar augment-proc, however.... :D</div></div><hr />

BFG = Breezleboot's frigid gnasher, homage to the &quot;Big Freaking Gun&quot; in Doom.  Has a fairly unique graphic, one of the earliest &quot;animated&quot; weapons.  Also does archery damage when used in melee, which can actually be situational very useful... very low aggro tho because the dmg/dly is pre-kunark level.  Popping on a big aggro taunt proc would have been quite... interesting.<br />

<br />
If you want agro get an  agro proc  (Anger 3 or a/an Ykesha proc). If you want a little (very little) help healing get the lifetap proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Archery can't be parried, or more importantly, cant be riposted.  All a mob can do to an archery attack is dodge.  Your damage wouldnt be as high as with a 20/50 sword, since archery damage doesn't calculate like melee.<br />
<br />
But the real reason it was nerfed, I suspect, is because it was ranger usable a bow that gained all the benefits of melee attacks (double attacks, not bothered by geometry) and all the benefits of archery (Trueshot).  A ranger in my guild had one and would frequently equip it while using his disc in NToV.  Add in Archery Mastery 3 in the next expansion and that 20/50 weapon might become just a bit over powered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are very easily attainable bows that would blow the BFG out of the water for archery damage though so that couldn't be it.<br />
<br />
I suspect it'd still be very difficult to maintain agro over a large raid using one with an Anger3 augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing about the BFG was the click knockback.  It's a big knockback and it's pretty exploitable.  I know my old guild used one to blast the IV into a corner and kill him in early Luclin.  Lots of stuff like that has been done with BFGs.<br />
<br />
Really though, I think they nerfed the quest just because they don't want everybody running around with that goofy-lookin weapon.  If they were that worried about the archery stuff or the knockback it would be easy to nerf it to range slot only and change the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;There are very easily attainable bows that would blow the BFG out of the water for archery damage though so that couldn't be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Bows in the ranged slot don't get Double attack... the BFG in the mainhand did, and still used Trueshot 2x damage and the 2x archery damage for rangers on un-moving targets.  Basically a 20/50 mainhand weapon with 4x damage and double attack and no geometry limitation like normal archery.<br />
<br />
The best bows attainable for the same effort at that time where the velium bows from DN, which ranged from 30/40 to 30/36 iirc.  They couldn't keep up with a double attacking BFG.<br />
<br />
I can't recall though if it also used the arrow damage in your ammo slot to figure total damage like a bow normally does.  I think it did, but can't be certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always thought it was the clickable Knockback that caused the BFG to be nerfed, or the quest for it nerfed so no one can get them anymore since they stopped dropping even before AA's were put in if I remember right. But being able to add a proc to it now i guess would have made it that much better for the few that do have one still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hola-<br />
<br />
Actually, it got nerfed a bit a few months ago as well- since it's knockback has a DD component, you can now no longer use it on yourself.  They &quot;protected&quot; people from nuking themselves to death by accident, this was a byproduct of that I guess.<br />
<br />
Used to be a hell of a lot of fun (and, in certain instances, quite useful) BFGing around the zones.  Still works with PVP vs. others, but gets resisted a LOT since they made resists actually work. :/<br />
<br />
Dunno why so many folks hated this weapon so much, I thought it was fairly nifty.  And when it first came out and had a 2 second click, it was DAMN fun. :)<br />
