<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its pretty much been decided/worked-out that the chance to proc with a given weapon is fixed per minute. This implies a fixed chance to proc per swing, presumably based off of some model number of swings per attack round.<br />
<br />
However this takes no account of flurry, PB, Ferocity etc AA's. <br />
<br />
I propose therefore that chance to attack is indeed fixed per your delay but that these aa's will increase the number of procs per unit time.<br />
<br />
E.G. You proc twice per minute with A-2h-er-weapon-00 but with ferocity 3, pb3, flurry6 you attack 20% more often you will proc 20% more often.<br />
<br />
Another reason I suggest this is because of ripostes. When YOU riposte a mob cannot possibly be calculated into the chance to proc value. Therefore double riposte should also increase your number of procs per unit time if by a small amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In summary I propose:<br />
<br />
The chance to proc is a fixed value based on your attack delay, for most weapons equating to 2 procs per minute.<br />
<br />
Ergo the more attacks you can get from AA's per unit time the more procs you will get per unit time.</div></div><hr />

All ive seen here are people with anecdotal stories or someone referring to some other post he saw somewhere else. I have never seen anyone show with real evidence that you get the same amount of procs in a given time period whether you are hasted or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just cause you did not see the thread where the results were discussed, does not make them invalid.<br />
<br />
Pretty easy to find the old discussion I would think (shaman crucible is a good place to start), and really easy to test yourself as well.<br />
<br />
See how many times you proc while attacking for like 30 minutes straight, no haste. Then get 100% haste and repeat. It is easy to do.<br />
<br />
You will find the more you are hasted, the less likely it is you will proc each swing. In the end, it fairly well balances out and the net result is generally 1 proc every 45 seconds. This does not take into account special weapons like cleric hammers, but haste and slow certainly is.<br />

I agree that procs/time are a constant. The important thing is that it must be calculated for some model number of attacks. Now all those offensive aa's don't increase your number of hits by a massive amount, at the most it would be 10% more hits, so with most weapons this wouldn't show up much. One more proc per 5 minutes or so with a normal weapon.<br />
<br />
Where it does show up though is when you rampage or use the riposte disc against large numbers of foes with a slow weapon. e.g. unhasted with an earthshaker or norge`tal etc. I've used riposte disc against 40+ spiders in velks and you definately do get a lot of procs during it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it doesn't have to be calculated for some modal number of attacks.  It could be calculated as simply as a check every N seconds.  Now if you could test using riposte disc against spiders and say what the proc rate is, you might even be right.<br />
<br />
And the shaman have done some extensive testing on proc rates.  Read about it here:<br />

Double attack would also make this interesting. It would be interesting to see if a character with double attack would get more procs over a given time period than one without.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Proc &quot;rate&quot; seems to be a % chance to proc per individual attack, with a set base value, modified by:<br />
-the effective weapon *delay* for that swing (which is determined by raw dly, haste, etc.- slower = more likely to proc).<br />
-what seems to be a modifier for 1h vs. 2h weapons (and perhaps primary vs. secondary?? need to test...)<br />
-any weapon-based modifier (Bloodfrenzy ruuuuulez)<br />
-some dex-based modifier<br />
<br />
That seems to be it.  Required no state-machine-like tracking of individual events, etc.  Isn't tracked over time at all.<br />
<br />
I think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Remf that's exactly what I was getting at. It's fixed per swing based on your current &quot;attack rate&quot; so getting more attacks in (via riposte/riposte disc/flurry/lucky rounds/rampage and not by increased haste) should lead to more procs. If this weren't the case you would rarely see a proc during riposte disc but you do, you see a lot.<br />
<br />
What you say Gimmel is also what I was getting at, increasing your average number of attacks per round ought to increase your number of procs, but this is why I introduced the idea of a model number of attacks per round, based on your level/class. I believe procs over time remain the same before and after you get double and triple attack, but to conceive that verant also calculates in what AA's you have in Ambideterity, PB, Flurry, Ferocity would seem too complex, and thus these aa's ought to give you more procs. As I said though they will only increase your attacks by 10% tops so 1 proc per 5 minutes with a normal proccing weapon is well withing Standard Deviation and would be hard to detect.</div></div><hr />

Get Rampage.  Get Slowed.  Equip an Earthshaker.  Pull the whole mistmoore zone.  Hit Rampage.  Watch 30,000 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well if I understand that thread right then weapon procs are not effected by #of swings much. I mean higher number os swings should just provide more even proc rate over same time period since u cant proc unless you swing. Some interesting things you learn. Still who knows maybe AA effect proc rate. Would have to do some testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You didn't understand it right then Casai. It's not number of swings, proc rate per swing is affected by the effective delay of the weapon, DEX, and the item's inherent proc rate multiplier. The vast majority of weapons have the same proc rate multiplier. <br />
<br />
AAs that increase the amount of swings you get will increase the amount of procs you get over a given period of time. Getting hasted will not increase the number of procs you get over a given period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You argue that you  think your thought is valid.  I would say &quot;valid&quot; is incorrect.<br />
<br />
Saying that an argument is valid is equivalent to saying that it is logically impossible that the premises of the argument are true and the conclusion false. A less precise but intuitively clear way of putting this is to say that in a valid argument IF the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.<br />
<br />
Arguments of a valid FORM are valid even if they are completely absurd. For example, the following argument is valid:<br />
<br />
All women are cats.<br />
All cats are men.<br />
Therefore,<br />
All women are men.<br />
<br />
This argument has false premises and a false conclusion. This brings out the hypothetical character of validity. What the validity of these arguments amounts to is that it assures us the conclusion must be true IF the premises are true.<br />
If an argument can be valid and yet have a preposterously false conclusion, what good is validity? Why should we be concerned with validity at all? The answer is that a valid argument is truth preserving. Truth in the premises of a valid argument is preserved in the conclusion. Of course, if the premises are not true to begin with, then even a valid argument cannot ensure that the conclusion is true. But ONLY valid arguments are truth preserving. An analogy might help clarify this point. Roughly, valid arguments preserve truth like good freezers preserve food. If the food you place in a freezer is spoiled to begin with, then even a good freezer cannot preserve it. But if the food placed in a good freezer is fresh, then the freezer will preserve it. Good freezers and valid arguments<br />
 preserve food and truth, respectively. But just as the former cannot preserve food when the food is spoiled, so the latter cannot preserve truth when the premises are false. Nevertheless food freezers and valid arguments are worth having because they do preserve something good when one has it, and without them one may wind up with something rotten even when beginning with something impeccable. Thus validity is to be desired and invalidity is to be eschewed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casai, what Graal and others are saying is that basic attack speed adjustments - and the increased number of swings provided by them - are taken into account by the game engine and the proc rate percentage is adjusted to smooth out the procs to be equal per unit time. <br />
<br />
It's posited that AA skills and ripostes which add additional swings cannot be accounted for in advance by the engine (or the designers didn't bother) and thus such AA's etc do provide 'more' procs per unit time... though the difference will be fairly minimal.</div></div><hr />
