<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally got me a piece of Tak armor and augmented my type 2 with the +40hp augment.  Not sure exactly what type 3 augment to put in it.  Dodge, AOB, Regen, Vengeance?  Any recomendations would be helpful.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Considering that once yur strenght is maxed you can't increase ATK I'd go with vengence, assuming you dont need some utiltiy like see invisible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's really personal preference.  I went with AoB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I know you have 41% in your neck and the best LDoN is 36%, but that way you sacrifice NO AC for your haste item.  I am within 2 wins of adding haste to my Royal Sands Helm--so my haste item will give me 39 AC, etc.  Then you can probably find a neck that is significanly better than 8 AC/50 HP.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I would seriously look at going cultural for your belt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes i worship RZ and I have Helmet of Rallos Zek for Ultravision and See invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since you don't have + Dodge mod on any of the other pieces, I would imagine that one would be nice .... skill mods don't stack though, AFAIK.<br />
<br />
Apart from that it's all preferrence I think.<br />
Regen is nice if you sometimes farm greenies.<br />
Vengeance = ATK = More damage, which is always nice.<br />
<br />
If you stand undecided between regen and vengeance, I'd say AOB would be just you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I put dodge on my ldon bracer. . .hell if i know if it does anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">dodge mods and the such have been shown to have no statistical value.<br />
<br />
In general, I would say vengeance is the most worthy of augments. Followed by UV, EB, Regen, AC and HP.  As for haste, its certainly worth considering depending on your potential upgrade path, 36pct is more than enought with chanter haste to cap.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: and ultimately CHA is good, then resists etc. la~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">dodge is a one shot deal, and like any combat aug you would need to parse it 8+hours to see any effect . the difference being veng ect will stack and have a cummilitive effect. i bought dodge just because when i upgrade i wont lose to much and not realy feel that bad about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">dodge mods and the such have been shown to have no statistical value <br />
<br />
Actually I think the conclusion was that it had a marginal impact...that is different from NO impact...too lazy to hunt down the thread.<br />
<br />
To answer the orginal poster: I'd do Veng (unless you can mod haste somewhere and sell a droppable haste item...can't see Magelo from work)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I bought the +8 dodge for my legs and when I realized I was dodging at most 2-3 times per fight I bit the bullet and replaced it with vengeance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got a shield of pain-2 to up my DS-damage... will prolly do vengeance if I take another Ldon piece... or maybe something else that grabs my fancy at the time... :)</div></div><hr />
