But i have heard that thier a random world drop not a specific instance drop. so at around what lvl monsters will start Droping them or even drop any epic items at all? i have done only a few instances right now im working on cleaning out SM but i have yet to see any epic items.. I know thier really rare hence the name Epic but still i just want to get an idea of drop zones.<br />
<br />
Also i heard that when battlegrounnds come out so will artifact items what the deal with that and how are they better?</div></div><hr />

indeed, look at its drop rate (http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=871) listed on allakhazam.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, wait 7 more levels and go to muradon. That thrash blade is even better. Flurry axe is something that mainly a shaman would be using at that level as the other melee classes can actually USE swords. I wish I had been able to get it back when I could have used it. Now im hoping to get an ironfoe! :p</div></div><hr />

Ok, well last time that i posted i was lvl 38, i just hit 45 an trying ot get thrash blade :)  But i got ripsaw which is same as well close ot thrash blade other than the fact the effect with thrash blade. see im looking for diff weapon combos see as a warrior i carry things like these. 2h weapon for dmg 1h with shield and 2 1h for duel weild. so and flurry axes seem to do well so idk.</div></div><hr />

As far as I understand it in WoW the faster atk rate the more procs you get. Correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">04-13-2005, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya I've noticed speed is better like higher lvl rogues will use speed weapons with dmg like 32-62 dmg but get huge dmg so I do want tflurry axe and I just saw on in AH for 300gs I would rather just farm in maudron until one drops</div></div><hr />
