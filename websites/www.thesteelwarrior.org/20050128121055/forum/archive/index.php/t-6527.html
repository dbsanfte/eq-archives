<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had it.  I've played since beta 4 and while its funny to think that the instability we are now facing is just like the original game, it's also very real and totally unacceptable.  I'm going to cancel my accounts until the game returns to at least its usual (in)stability.  I urge everyone else to do the same.<br />
<br />
I'm not quiting, I'm voting with my money.  They don't delete characters, or they would have deleted the canceled accounts with all of the duped platinum that Yantis sells.  When they return the service to reasonable levels, they get my vote again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If since Beta you haven't realized that massive changes like this or Luclin take a couple of weeks to pan out, then perhaps cancelling is the best option. <br />
<br />
As for me, I'll wait out the glitches for a bit (by which time your subscription may have run out), and continue on with a better game for it.<br />
<br />
If I was losing revenue over this I may feel what you do, but at 41 cents a day I'm not getting worked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my take on it, it has been maddening, the service as far as GM staff and tech support has hit all time lows.<br />
<br />
I really have to wait and see, if the new egine(when compeletly finished) blows me away, or somewhat impresses me and i can still run the game, then it was worth it, if tech support improves(im thinking the department of SoE that runs everquest has a fixed budget, if the coding and art department are working overtime, their service goes down, when they arnt working on an expantion and arnt changing the game engine their tech support is decent)<br />
<br />
if they pull it out of a nose dive and at least does enough work on the game to justify the down time ill keep playing, if not world of warcraft looks stellar, ive played every blizzard game and i know for a fact they are not money whores  (they run B.net servers for years and years after their game stops taking shelf space, diablo 1 is still supported, and they just put out a content patch for D2 just to be nice, that is a company that is cool, one that doesnt want money for the littlest things)<br />
<br />
not to mention they have a great amount of experance with networks and servers thanks to warcraft 1-3, diablo 1 and 2, and the starcraft series and its expantions, i have alot of confidance in them, so to rap up the rambling<br />
<br />
1) i hope they do something to justify the shitty preformance latly or im going to WoW<br />
2) even if they do fix it and make us all happy with a new system, im still going to get a WoW acount and keep my EQ acount<br />
3) if WoW can put out more effort than EQ, then i will switch completly, its a market and EQ needs to keep up to market standards of tech support and game addition rates</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">because he doesnt want to quit, but he doesnt like the fact that they have had connection problems for 3 days, and at first they said it was &quot;your fault&quot; and on day 2 it was &quot;your ISPs fault&quot; and on day 3 &quot;thanks for bearing with us, we are trying to narrow down the problem&quot;<br />
<br />
sony SUCKS at its public relations because they dont want to take the time to say sorry, because saying sorry means they have to show they know they caused the train reck, baxter probibly doesnt want to quit, but doesnt want to feel stepped on, i feel the same way, i finally was able to log on today after 3 days, but im still crashing on half of my zoning, and i have a 200$ card that is VERY dx9 capatable, he wants something like a stand down to make sony aware we are not going to be complacent and accomidating while they take our cash for time we cant log in, he has to remember the stand down was IN game.<br />
<br />
tiny ya have to be around TSW for more then a week to understand the kind of rants we get here, this is a nice open place were we can share how we feel(and that includes flaming)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The end does not justify the means in any environment outside of dictatorship.  If/when the engine goes back to normal and the new featres come out, then they get my money again.  Until then, I'm not going to whine about a refund for lost service like most piss ants do, I'm just not going to pay to fund their live beta.  Past errors were tolerable, but if you expect me to keep putting up with it, and expect me to sanction it as 'normal' or simply 'business as usual' then you're absolutely out of your mind.<br />
<br />
I seek only to give words to the frustration I am sure others feel.  If this is a following, I don't know what anyone would expect me to do after this.  It's just a trigger, not a movement.  Was the Warrior stand down some whiner seeking a following, or were we all independantly and collectively right in asserting our place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i feel ya bax, but im willing to give em time, ive seen some screen shots of the system with some of the new tree/building textures, and a bit of other stuff, tho because of the problems they are having now they may just give up on the new textures to avoid further pissing us off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We can only hope that they make the right choice between their precious eye candy only they can see, and basic functionality which we do not have.</div></div><hr />

This is actually quite civilized compaired to some.:D<br />
<br />
Personally I haven't been affected by the changes since they let me know months ago it was coming and I saved my plat and got ready. I know a few folks that are just now reluctantly upgrading and able to play. The login server thing is a totally unexpected fly in the ointment for SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya, that is what they get for letting the intern trip over the power cords :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashbomba</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wrote to sony complaining about the amount of time that it has taken to fix this &quot;issue.&quot;  If there is no reply to my request for reimbursement then I will cancel my accounts. my computers meet/exceed the recommended minimum.  This is just outrageous to me that we are expected to just sit back while this is occuring.<br />
<br />
I guess its time to dust off my DAoC CDs and play that till the problem is solved or I cancel my EQ account permanently.  Hopefully there will be another game that captures my interest as long as EQ has.</div></div><hr />

Heard from a friend of mine who's close to a GM and they mentioned Sony's down to twelve paided GMs for all thirty-six servers at least until the India outsourcing is complete. Then more than likely they get the boot as well. Take it with a hefty grain of salt but it sure seems like there aren't any GMs to go around anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i beleave it, look at all the names that have gone unchanged, if half the GM staff(and soon to be ALL the GM staff) do not know who the hell frodo baggins is what do we expect? how are they expected to know our leet speek and slang terms that can be VERY offensive, if they move it all to india we will get some shitty service</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nevermind the culture differences.  Its going to be hard to believe that techs half a world away are going to give a damn when stuff goes down prime time when they are tucked into bed or just getting up.  Outsourcing is the devil.  Sony would rather hire and train people without a clue for pennies than hire local folks who have a much better chance of knowing what the product is about and , god forbid, paying someone enough to live. <br />
<br />
I miss knowing the GMs on my server. Every good one got promoted, moved to EQ2/SWG, or outright layed off.</div></div><hr />

There's 52-ish servers or so now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually its fourty-eight servers not counting test or the servers outside the USA. My mistake. Thanks for making Sony's GM coverage look more pathetic for me :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No sympathy from me. Go whine somewhere else... like the pally boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I certainly hope they get the error 1001 fixed asap. I'm only paying 13 bucks a month for this product, so obviously that's not going to get me much contact with paid employees, but it would be nice if the product were reliable. <br />
One way to look at this is: if you subscribed to a magazine--and there are lots of them that charge you about what SONY does for EQ--how often would you expect to talk to an editor? Probably never, but on the other hand: how often would you expect the magazine to arrive in your mailbox with the pages stuck together so that you couldn't read them?<br />
I don't want individual customer service; I want the product to work well enough I don't need customer service.<br />
As it stands now, I'm pretty cautious about going a lot of places with my main. He and his friends can get into places that it's darn hard for me to get out of by myself. Going LD and not being able to get back in until the next day means that a bunch of people have to organize themselves to come get me. Bleh.<br />
I've been playing baby alts instead. But last night I was grouped with some very nice folks, some of whom I'd convinced to come fight on their alts, and then I went LD/error 1001 and couldn't get back in. It was only an alt group, but still felt like I let the side down.<br />
The lexicon of the English language contains well over 500,000 words. Quite a bit of room to describe nuanced meaning. After careful review,  I find that I need only four words to describe how I feel about convincing some people to spend their time going somewhere, only to disappear on them without explanation into the land of error 1001: it pisses me off.<br />
Personally, I don't think warriors should whine ever. However, /snarl is a different matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not interested in GM support, I gave that up as a possability long ago.  Somehow we have managed to survive without their glorious presence.  I also don't think I am whining.  Perhaps if I were quiting, then this might be some kind of desperate attempt to garner support for the cause of rebellion.  As it is, I have no intention of leaving the game, I simply do not want to pay while they are developing at the cost of my gameplay.  I don't for a second think they will care about me, but were many others to cancel their subscriptions, even if they have a year left on them, I thought it might send some kind of message.<br />
<br />
I know I'm right because this is the same thing everyone else is always saying in their heads when they talk about how pissed off they get playing, or about how much they hate the game in general.  I enjoy playing EQ when it works, as I have enjoyed UO, LoK, NWN, and IoK in game generations past.  When people had had enough of UO's hackjob at programming, they started leaving, and Origin steped up to fix things.  Granted, they still didn't know what they were doing, but I have some semblance of faith in the SoE staff, at least until I get into the WoW beta.  I don't care that they're opening Sleeper's Tomb and Vex Thal to non keyholders, or if they open the whole damn game, we are having to fight against the the everpresent uncertainty that half our raids will fall under the world or go LD, while the mobs themselves are blinking all over the place.  They can fix it tomorrow, its a matter of resources, just not mine until they do.</div></div><hr />
