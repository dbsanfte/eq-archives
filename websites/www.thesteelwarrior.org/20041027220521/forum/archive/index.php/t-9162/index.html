<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>delpi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sony managed to lose my OoW expansion today and so I log in to find myself deleveled to 65.  <br />
<br />
I log out and back in and see that OoW is not registered so I click buy now (AGAIN).  <br />
<br />
After petitioning with the information in there that I had registered again, they answer the petition saying they can't do a thing until I register the expansion.  Can they read?  <br />
<br />
I didn't work my tail off since OoW was released to be lvl 65 again.  The freaking GM's on chat said they are discussing the option of replacing the XP lost.  Are they kidding?   My account is about to be permanatley removed if this doesn't get fixed.  I already will never purchase another peice of software from Sony.  They are about to get me to not even keep paying for the single one I do own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This happened to a guildie tonight also. <br />
<br />
A similar bug happened when LDON was first announced...when people would pre-order, it reset all of their expansions, so they would wind up at level 50 with no AAs. Everyone got fixed though, so try not to worry about it too much; you will get your levels back.</div></div><hr />

This, after the site itself said that everyone who had this bug ARE getting their XP back.<br />

That is exactly the kind of lame ass dumbshit response I would expect from SoE.  A customer is aggravated and inconvenienced through no fault of their own, but rather completely through the fault of SoE's product.  And rather than attempting to make it right and alleviate the aggravation, they simply add to it by poor internal communication and a disregard for the customer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If that happened to me, I'd take it as a sign from above. That I wasn't meant to progress beyond 65. And I'd quit. The game was fun a long time ago. But is it still fun? Do those of you who've worked to level in this new 65 to 70 era and then had that work destroyed and told it won't be restored by GMs who didn't even work for the company when you dinged 60 ... do those of you find this crap fun?<br />
<br />
:(<br />
<br />
My heart goes out to you. That's horrible customer service. I hope your problems get fixed. But your story makes me glad I did indeed quit this game.</div></div><hr />
