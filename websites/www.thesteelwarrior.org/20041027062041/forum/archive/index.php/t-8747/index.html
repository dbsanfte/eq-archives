<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just curious as to find out what is the most hate in order of the following 3 weapons and how it would be determined?  These are lower level weapons and not uber but affordable in the bazaar.  I am also stating that these are to be judged without any augments on them.  All 3 of these can be had in the bazaar for 5kish each on my server, Tarew Marr.  <br />
<br />
1. Copper hammer of striking- this is staple among many 50ish warriors and above, affordable and by word of mouth works for aggro.  Does not yet proc for me at 48 but ill be equipping it at level 50 MH.  <br />
<br />
2. Sword of the Bloodsworn- Nice aggro producer thus far tho I see a lot of rangers using it with more than ogre dex to become annoying and drive me to further hate rangers.  This can also stun high level mobs.  <br />
<br />
3. Reinforced- sandstone hilt sword-I have been enjoying this as an offhand to my sotbs as my chos will not proc until 50.  I do not see many wielding this and I wasnt quite sure why.  The proc &quot;rocksmash&quot; carries a negative 100 resist adjustment and the sotbs has a zero modifier.  The sandstone also does not have knockback either from what I have noticed, has a 2 second stun as opposed to the zero time stun on sotb.  <br />
<br />
I am wondering why the reinforced sandstone is not so well known or used or ever talked about.  Could the sandstone be even better than both of the other 2 weapons?  DPS aside, hate only concern.  I have been MH the sotb and offhanding the sandstone now for awhile and I am confident that the chos I will use at level 50.  I am inquiring as to how it is figured that the sotbs owns the sandstone sub level 60?   I wonder if MH sandstone and offhanding sotb would be the best for aggro before level 50.  Then again maybe everyone knows but me that the sandstone really sucks.  Is a stun a stun?  Or does a certain type of stun (planar strike vs. say rocksmash) generate an x amount of hate?  <br />
chos and sotbs seem to be the standard for bang for the buck aggro, could the sandstone be a new addition?  <br />
<br />
Well thanks for reading, just thought id bring up some questions.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stun procs do aggro even resisted or immune targets, then if resisted you still gain the stun aggro, if not you get the stun+dmg of the procs, but the sandstone weapon is quite good, escept wielded by a ranger wich snare and use his stun spell proc, then he drives aggro all the time (dead ranger p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jearom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You do not seen the Sand Hilt sword used much because it has the required level of 45.  The SotBS procs at 40 and the CHoS proc starts at 50.  So many people pick up the SotBS to start using at 40 and in the long run the CHoS is a better ratio weapon so they pick that up next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stun aggro = ~ 450 hate.<br />
<br />
For comparison purposes.</div></div><hr />
