<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dibdab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was just woundering how to determine the dps of the weapon in your off hand. I already know how to determine the dps of the wep in your primary hand but i have always been curious about the offhand. I've herd that it dapends on the ratio of the weapon your using but  I've herd outher stuff to like that it has to do with you skill in dual weild and how often it will make you swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spikela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Magelo works wonders. Install the weapon you'd like to see on your hand, record your old item, check to see your NEW DPS, then switch the weapon back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How does Magelo tell you your dps?  I've never seen that in there (although I don't discount that I may have just overlooked it a million times)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Magelo doesn't show DPS anywhere, it does show ATK however if you swap weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use yalp instead. http://www.yalp.org/ It doesn't crash all the time, nor does it run a 1gb comp out of memory on a 150mb logfile. The newer version seem to have a monitor mode that works well too. I haven't figured out how to see who was healing me, and how much for as nicely as eqc does though.</div></div><hr />
