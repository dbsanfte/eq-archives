<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Posted this on the EQLive forums, crossposting here to see what ya think.<br />
<br />
There are very few things in the game today that are as unbalancing in the game as defensive and evasive.<br />
 <br />
These two abilites are so powerful, content in the game is balanced in the game specifically so that it is challenging, WITH the use of defensive and evasive. Along with clerical complete healing, it has been breaking the game for years now.<br />
 <br />
Nowhere is this so apparent than with the recent GoD issues. With content being designed FOR the use of defensive, the other two tanks are in danger of being marginalized in favor of warriors. This situation is exacerrated by the ever more commonly placed defensive requiring mobs that are placed in new expansions.<br />
 <br />
Defensive is overpowered and unbalancing. In their quest to make new content challenging, the devs are breaking the game. Content that is challenging for knights to tank, is trivial to a warrior with defensive. On the other side of the coin, content that is fine for warriors with defensive to tank, is excessively difficult for knights to tank. Defensive is breaking the game.<br />
 <br />
What is on the lips of many players of the game, is giving a lesser form of defensive to knights, so that they may be given an improved ability to tank mobs that are balanced for warriors with defensive. I feel that that is the wrong approach. I believe that for the health of the game and for the ultimate happiness of the players, it's time to get rid of defensive and evasive in its entirely. These problems are just going to keep occurring over and over again until the problem is fixed.<br />
 <br />
Here's how I feel it could be done.<br />
 <br />
#1: Give warriors a permanent further increase in damage mitigation and avoidance, so that the remain clearly the best choice for tanking nameds. Not nearly as much as defensive and evasive give, of course, but enough to offset the fact that defensive is gone, but that this increase is on a permanent basis. I feel that a 7.5% bonus to mitigation, and 5% to avoidance, is a balanced amount to give.<br />
 <br />
#2: Rebalance named mobs by reducing the DB and DI. Reduce these numbers by about 25%, so that while they hit a little bit harder to a warrior with no defensive or evasive but improved mitigation and avoidance capabilites, that is offset by the fact that they will still be getting hit for that 3.5 minutes later, when the pre-changes warrior would have defensive wear off, and be taknig the full force of the mob's attacks.<br />
 <br />
#3: Compensate the loss of defensive/evasive from the warrior's ability set by giving them some abilities that allow them to contribute to the group in places where the warrior's superior ability to take damage is rendered irrelevant and useless. After all, in most groups, as long as the tank can take damage &quot;well enough&quot; to not die, they don't really care HOW much better he is than the next guy. This is why you hear beastlords, rangers, and monks tanking in groups in content that is considered trivial. They tank &quot;well enough&quot;, but they add significantly to the group in other ways.<br />
 <br />
Specific suggestions for the warrior ability sets are short duration (think bard song) affects that are endurance based and add some affects, alone or in combination, to the group:<br />
 <br />
War Cries:<br />
 <br />
-minor attack and/or v3 haste buff (Warrior's getting the morale of the group up with a rallying cry)<br />
-minor HP and mana regen buff (10HP/tick, 5mana/tick) (warrior causing the hearts and minds of his compadres to race and flow quicker)<br />
 <br />
&quot;Called Shots&quot; with a heavy endurance cost, possibly replacing the melee attack for that round with a single hit)<br />
 <br />
snare (IE, tendon slicing, charley horse, smash the kneecap)<br />
Short duration stun (boot to the head, smash the solar plexus)<br />
armour smash (no damage, but AC reduction)<br />
 <br />
etc, etc.<br />
 <br />
Removing defensive/evasive from the game in favor of a permanent, lower bonus to mitigation and avoidance would mean that content could be balanced much easier now, and in all future expansions. Warriors would still remain the undisputed king of taking damage, without taking it to such extremes. Mob damage would be kept down to sensible levels, enough that knights can still take the damage being put out if they are required to. The extra abilities given to warriors would give them a reason to be in a group that doesn't really care about having the beefiest tank possible. <br />
 <br />
These aren't firm or complete numbers and ideas that I'm putting out, by any means. What this is, is an initial idea, subject to lots and lots of ideas, balancing, and testing, but ultimately to the betterment of the game.<br />
 <br />
I don't believe it's even too difficult to rebalance it, when put up against the fact of exactly how much it can do for the game. You're only, after all, changing the NAMEDS by probably very close to a set amount for each, not every mob. Probably don't even need to adjust all of them either.<br />
 <br />
Defensive and evasive has been breaking the game for years. for all of it's usefulness, it's time for it to go, I think.</div></div><hr />

I think Zerkers got all of those, at least, all the &quot;opening&quot; abilities we were gonna get, they sorta got em. Even the War Cry, exactly as you described it, but the haste component is bugged atm (or so a Zerker I grouped with told me). The Axes have all those effects (snares,...).<br />
<br />
I really would like to think further, I think the permanent bonus would prolly benefit the warriors on xp groups, while the inexistence of defensive will close the gap between a warrior and a knight tanking a named, still keeping the warrior higher. The % can be or will be argued upon, its a matter of opinion.<br />
<br />
By retuning the nameds I hope you dont mean the high end, Time-GoD, leaving out all the other expansions, because Defensive / Evasive has been used all along them, and it would be screwing every warrior that is not high end (I cant speak about the high end, just talking from my small guild position).<br />
<br />
But I think it's not a totally crazy idea... as long as is coherent. For fights shorter than 3 min, we will tank worse, at least on numbers, and any kind of ability or whatever you wanna add, wont change that. For fights longer than 3 min, numbers can be tuned so the overall dmg taken with defensive (for the initial 3min) and no defensive the rest, is equal to no defensive from start to end, that would be somehow fair I think? Im not gonna just say &quot;Ok, take out defensive&quot; without thinking Im getting something to equalize the lost somehow, or it would be simply stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Removing defensive and evasive. If they do this they just seen my last subscription payment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are major problem with removing defensive, it would decrease even further the stackability of warrior in raid, ie just need 1 war, when before you would switch when def down, or anyway MT would die when def down.<br />
You'd need to balance warrior so that they remain the best tank in raid, and not marginaly, warrior would mitigate 15% better or so than knight in any situation and that would push the balance further for the warrior in single group situation, when at the moment, outside defensive a knight is equivalent to a warrior roughly.<br />
Anyway I don't think this topic is revelant. Warrior will keep defensive and evasive, that's the way developers want it, and that make sense. The fix they haven chosen is much better than completely changing the warrior class, that would bring endless balance issues.<br />
<br />
They just need to make sure the attack of named mobs in single group content is so that defensive is a minor mitigation boost if you have the proper gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not only is the topic ill concidered, the recommended changes are not well thought out. In both of these areas its remarkably like a post by Seventhsword asking for a show of hands by Paladins that think the class should get full Defensive.<br />
<br />
SoE has determined that Defensive is a class defining ability that should not be shared. Since it's a class defining ability, I think it goes without saying that not only should it not be shared, it shouldn't be removed from the game.<br />
<br />
In the past, an intended Warrior survivability advantage was erroded over time by equipment. SoE helped insure this wouldn't happen as easily in the furture by giving Wariors &quot;-1 DI&quot;, in essence a small piece of the Defensive ability available at all times.<br />
<br />
In the same way, Defensive insures the Warrior survivability advantage is held as a thing apart, unshared, sacrosanct, and unaffected by equipment creep and argument by Knights.<br />
<br />
Defensive is:<br />
<br />
*** a class defining ability ***<br />
*** that Warriors are intended to have ***<br />
*** and should not be shared with other classes ***<br />
*** or be eliminated from the game.***<br />
<br />
Aeka recently posted the flat out mis-representation:<br />
There is no amount of gear that makes a Paladin tank like a Warrior.<br />
But we know better. When gear can allow a Knight to MT ALL of PoTime, it's pretty darned clear just how &quot;like a Warrior&quot; Knights can tank.<br />
<br />
&quot;-1 DI&quot; and 40AA for 500HP's is not a very big differnce in tanking ability. But for Three Minutes of Glory for which Warriors give up LoH, 1500HP heals, the ability to buff more HP's than a Cleric, 90% Resses, etc. Warriors are without a doubt unmatched in the ability to survive the most brutal battles.<br />
<br />
Knights sir are to be balanced against the environment and the mobs they face performing their role.<br />
<br />
Warriors have a different role - unmatched survivability in the most brutal battles. A role Knights do NOT have.<br />
<br />
GoD was NOT a class balance issue no matter how hard you Knights try to say it was - it was a content issue. SoE has said so, and SoE is adjusting the content.<br />

<br />
I'm not so sure of that. Isn't the whole premise of tanking in an experiece group, that as long as you do it &quot;well enough&quot;, who cares just how much better you do it? This being borne out by the complaints of the monks, rangers, beastlords tanking in trivial content... they can tank &quot;well enough&quot;, so getting the traditional plate tank to tank, really doesn't matter. It's something that definitely would need testing, though, by impartial people.<br />
<br />
[By retuning the nameds I hope you dont mean the high end, Time-GoD, leaving out all the other expansions, because Defensive / Evasive has been used all along them, and it would be screwing every warrior that is not high end (I cant speak about the high end, just talking from my small guild position).<br />
<br />
No. I mean all nameds. There's a lot, I know, but it's not like I'm asking for ALL MOBS to be retuned. <br />
<br />
I'm talking Luclin, the top mobs in Velious, and PoP, as well as God. Luckily what would make the job easier is that they'd all be retuned by about the same amount. This mob has a high DB, drop that a little more than the DI. This one has a high DI, drop that a little bit more than the DB. All the mob's DB-DI ratio would remain the same, just of lower values of about 25%. It's not like they'd be retuning whole ability sets, I don't think, just the melee damage.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's a lot of mobs, but it's also, IMO, not a tough job. Just reducing some numbers. It could certainly be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they did this, it would cause more imbalance, which leads to more imbalance. Meaning you have to change more and more shit, changing the whole game.<br />
<br />
It's fine the way it is. The only way I could see an ok issue to improve with knights is them getting a mini defensive of 10-15% that stacks with BoV.<br />
<br />
Get over it. We are unique. I'm proud to be unique.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it doesn't go without saying. It goes without saying that anything that unbalances the game should be fixed. Defensive unbalances the game. It should be fixed. In this case, the best way to fix it is to remove it and compensate.<br />
<br />
In the same way, Defensive insures the Warrior survivability advantage is held as a thing apart, unshared, sacrosanct, and unaffected by equipment creep and argument by Knights.<br />

*** and should not be shared with other classes ***<br />
Correct<br />
*** or be eliminated from the game.***<br />
Here, you're stating your opinion as fact. I could state my opinion as fact that it should be removed from the game, but that doesn't make it true, does it?<br />
<br />
But we know better. When gear can allow a Knight to MT ALL of PoTime, it's pretty darned clear just how &quot;like a Warrior&quot; Knights can tank.<br />
They can. After, you'll note, they've already been through the content and farmed the crap out of it, to get the gear.<br />
<br />
&quot;-1 DI&quot; and 40AA for 500HP's is not a very big differnce in tanking ability.<br />
With how much you post here, and how much I post here, are you SERIOUSLY expecting me to accept that? <br />
<br />
The difference in warrior tanking ability is NOT just the -1DI. The warrior tanking difference - proven by parses - is actually about 15%. Of which the DI is only 5%. You know, and I know that the difference is more than you're trying to claim, and you know better. Just like the difference in HP is not 500... the difference given by Sturdiness. For that to be true, paladins PRE GoD had to be the same in HP as warriors. And you and I both know that's not the case.<br />
<br />
Why are you being so intellectually dishonest?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BB, you are really fond of quoting that phrase about unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles, mentioning it like that's all you need to say, and your entire point is made. That doesn't apply here. And I'll tell you why.<br />
<br />
In my solution, warriors would maintain unmatched in (your favorite phrase comin right back at you) &quot;the ability to survive the most brutal battles&quot;. They maintain the tanking advantage that they have now, PLUS they are given an additional bonus to compensate for the loss of defensive. It closes the raid level gap, BUT maintains a warrior advantage.<br />
<br />
Knights sir are to be balanced against the environment and the mobs they face performing their role.<br />
<br />
No sir, they are not. Overall, they are mostly balanced, yes, with some minor adjustments. HOWEVER. In GoD, the mobs they face need retuning. This is acknowledged by the devs, and already in process. In raids, high level raids most especially, they have been marginalized to the point that they CANNOT tank the named when they have to, they are marginalized in favor of a disc. This would return SOME ability to tank nameds, but warriors would still remain &quot;unmatched in the ability to survive the most brutal battles&quot; and still be the tank of choice on nameds, if they are available.<br />
<br />
Might I suggest if you wish to keep debating this with me - which I'd like - that you cease with the intellectual dishonesty and rhetoric to make your points. In this, you are just as guilty as some knights that I've seen, that are fighting for a hybrid defensive.<br />
<br />
Debate it on its merits and principles, instead.</div></div><hr />

Just had to point out, that when you agree with the fact that defensive should not be shared with any other class, you are doing exactly what you chastized BB for in the next question (rightly), stating your opinion as fact.<br />
<br />

<br />
  God, I think clerics would love it. I sure would. No single spell in the entire history of EQ has screwed things up more. A level 39 cleric spell... It's worse than slows. Every heal around right now is still balanced around CH. Remember CH rotations? How rediculous. Getting rid of this silly spell along time ago would have been the smart thing to do, but it's still here...<br />
<br />
  Back on topic. I'm personally undecided on this. I'm not saying it's not possible, or even reasonably healthy for the game. I'm just not sure it's actually worth the effort. It's not just boss mobs that we defensive for, it's bad pulls, harder mobs (BoT kriegers, for example), or just when the healer's mana gets low. This WOULD mean a retune, or at least re-evaluation of every mob, every encounter in the game. A permanent bonus to mitigation would make all experience group content able to be tanked by much lower level/lower geared warriors than currently possible. The level of gear gap required to tank between knights and warriors would be widened. These aren't unsurmountable issues, mind you, but they are far reaching.<br />
<br />
  Do try not to hold on to status quo with both hands. Balance generally requires moving both sides to the middle, and defensive simply doesn't allow for that. It is a very powerful ability, if only for those couple minutes. This could be done, though difficult, so that it doesn't diminish our relative tanking prowess. Chill out and think about it, see if you can get your head around the idea. If you find a fundamental flaw, other than the removal of defensive destroying your mental niche, post it.</div></div><hr />

There is still one thing I dont understand, and maybe Im a tad slow hehe. Which additional bonuses? You mean the abilities you expressed on the first post? Or you mean the raising of current mitigation and evasion %s? If you meant the abilities, I replied all those were given to Zerkers (again, I dont know still why they put that class into the game, it looks like they used the opening abilities we were gonna get to give em theirs). What kind of abilities could we be getting to compensate the loss of defensive? Like Fitemore stated, Defensive / Evasive is more than just for boss tanking, on bad pulls, when healers run lom,  when the shit hits the fan, you use it too, and it can be a normal xp group (AET + Def/Eva saved the day a few dozens of times).<br />
Im not meaning this as a flame or something, just curious of what kind of trade-off do you propose :)</div></div><hr />

The additional bonuses that I'm talking about, revolve around the average higher AC that warriors have, the average higher amount of defensive tanking based bonuses (on gear), the higher defensive caps, and the like. Taken all together, it drops the average damage a warrior takes to less than what a knight takes, but about 12.5-15%.<br />
<br />
I'm not totally sure about exactly what kind of bonuses, and how much of them to give. This is really where they shot themselves in the foot with the addition of berserkers, as a lot of those abilities could have been used in conjunction with named melee rebalancing, as justification and compensation for the abilities of defensive.<br />
<br />
Still, berserkers and warriors could share many of those abilities of slightly different types, just make sure berserkers are markedly superior DPS to the warrior's markedly superior DEfense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dude. what the fuck are you smoking. What the fuck is wrong with you. And where can I get some of that shit. <br />
Defensive and evasive are not broken. They are not for sale, They are not to be taken out of the game. Its what makes warriors tanks, And well the game has been designed around it since Kunark and there is no way the game can be rebalanced around warriors not having defensive. It will kill off the majority of smaller guilds, and none elemental plane raiding guilds as well. <br />
<br />
What your suggesting is A. Some garbage so you can drama queen. B. Something you didnt even bother to think about when you wrote it down.  <br />
The only possible way to make the game retain any semblance of what it was is. Warriors would need an additional 30% mitigation all the time and an additional 25% avoidence all the time.  And then the game would be horribly fucked up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Panazule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Or maybe the solution to all of this is to accept when you created that Knight that you created an inferior tank that added more utility to groups that was able to handle MOST jobs thrown at them but not all.<br />
<br />
If you need two clerics in a group or even more where a warrior needs one, oh well, you signed up for a class that was a hybrid, deal with it or roll a new toon.<br />
<br />
Where on the box or eula does it state that SoE promises that Knights will be able to comparably tank all mobs?<br />
<br />
Everything was cool in PoP when knights were preferred tanks and with new self buffs Paladins were shooting up in HP and with the use of shields and high end 1h's their AC was sky high with no real loss in dps but now an expansion comes out where the warrior shines as the tank and it's a problem.<br />
<br />
Tailor the group to do the trial you need to do, which might even include bringing a warrior along OR stop trying to do the trials before you have progressed to the point and have the gear that you SHOULD be doing the trials to begin with.<br />
<br />
This is all ego, that's what it comes down to.  The idea of grouping with a warrior to get through certain trials or mobs just doesn't sit well and oh well get over it or roll a new toon.<br />
<br />
If you wanted a warrior you should have made one, you gave up certain things to be able to snare, root, loh, fd, group heal, mana tap and so on and yet even with all those things your still kick ass tanks.<br />

Defensive is acknowledged as Warrior class defining by Warriors and SoE.  There is in fact a presumption that Defensive, a Warrior class defining ability, will not be removed. That's what a class defining ability is - an ability that is PRESENT in the game, has an effect on the game, and is essentially unique to a class.<br />
<br />
You move from one flawed assertion to another - that unless tanking is near equal Knights and Warriors can not be balanced.<br />
<br />
Let's start with the opposite presumption. Warriors could have a permanent &quot;-7 DI&quot; and be far and away the best MT vs. any high DI mob lacking any special abilities to preclude Warriors from MTing it. There could be absolutely no chance whatsoever of Knights MTing such most brutal mobs in the foreseeable future - and the classes would STILL be balanced.<br />
<br />
We do not have the same raid role.<br />
<br />
Yet, because Defensive is not ever present, does not last the entire duration of most raid boss fights, and mobs have a range of DB and DI values - Knights are not forever precluded from raid MTing. SoE can make Knight prefered raid boss mobs. As Knight's gear up and raids get more familiar with raid boss mobs, Knights can MT that which formerly required a Warrior. There are difficult mobs that do not require a Warrior yet do require more than one group.<br />
<br />
Knights and Warriors can still be equally desireable for experiance groups.<br />
Warriors are MT's vs. most raid boss mobs until they become moderately trivial.<br />
Knights are raid add tanks and have other raid sub-roles.<br />
<br />
Knights and Warriors do not have to be and should not be balanced in the ability to tank vs. all content. Balanced as group MT's, yes. Each having a well defined and separate raid role that each class can excell at, absolutely.<br />
<br />
I chose to be a 100% Tank and I'm entitled to be the best at it.<br />
<br />
The Warrior/Paladin healing/buffing/ressing gap is in fact much greater than the tanking gap. Yet Warriors do NOT have a case to narrow that gap. The ability to cast priestly spells while being an effective group MT and raid add tank is the class defining ability of Paladins and we are NOT entitled to share it.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree. Defensive is NOT &quot;unbalancing&quot;, it in fact defines what the roles are and how balance is to be achieved. Warrior=Tank/Tank. Paladin=Tank/priest. SK=Tank/Necro. Guess which class is and should be the most effective Tank.<br />

<br />
Um. No. If you read my post, you see how I ensure that there is actually a substantial tanking difference that is maintained even with the loss of defensive. Or is 27.5% not substantial enough for you?<br />
<br />
Yet, because Defensive is not ever present, does not last the entire duration of most raid boss fights, and mobs have a range of DB and DI values - Knights are not forever precluded from raid MTing.<br />
<br />
Yes, just for far too long. And defensive is so powerful that even when they CAN MT on nameds, they're usually not, in favor of warriors with defensive. Almost to exclusion they're only used for the reason they were used with Afterlife.... to prove a point. Such is the imbalance and the disparity.<br />
<br />
You're right they're not icluded forever. They are included ONLY after the content has been cleared by warriors initially, and time and again afterwards. They have no chance... none... until the content is farmed the crap out of. Until then they are useless and along for the ride on the named. If warriors die before this period of time, they cannot even begin to step up, they get smashed into the ground.<br />
<br />
Knights are severely underpwoered vs named to the point where they are nearly useless ONLY until such time as the content is farmed the crap out of. MY change would actually give them a chance to make a difference when they must, but warriors REMAIN unmatched in &quot;their ability to survived the most brutal battles&quot;, and that advantage is unquestionable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are MT's vs. most raid boss mobs until they become moderately trivial.<br />
<br />
So you think it's fine that only when content is trivial that knights should even have the opportunity to tank. Methinks you're over defensive about anything regarding defensive.<br />
<br />
Knights are raid add tanks and have other raid sub-roles.<br />
Of course, but that should not preclude any other role, just as warrior offtanking should not preclude the MT role.<br />
<br />
Knights and Warriors do not have to be and should not be balanced in the ability to tank vs. all content. Balanced as group MT's, yes. Each having a well defined and separate raid role that each class can excell at, absolutely.<br />
<br />
You have GOT to be kidding me. You're actually trying to claim that being balanced is something that SHOULD NOT happen? <br />

<br />
The Warrior/Paladin healing/buffing/ressing gap is in fact much greater than the tanking gap. Yet Warriors do NOT have a case to narrow that gap. The ability to cast priestly spells while being an effective group MT and raid add tank is the class defining ability of Paladins and we are NOT entitled to share it.<br />

Talk about your intellectual dishonesty, you're still continuing it.<br />
THIS WHOLE IDEA is predicated around the idea that warriors will still remain &quot;unmatched in the ability to survive the most brutal battles&quot;, as you're so fond of quoting. Warriors still remain the best tank, unquestionably.</div></div><hr />

I'm afraid if you look like a duck, walk like a duck, and quack like a duck people may jump to the conclusion yer a duck.<br />
<br />
In truth your post echoes stuff written by several Paladins on PoN, even down to the same flawed arguments and logic. Even your responces to my arguments - each and every one of them - are weak, don't respond to the point made, and evasive.<br />
<br />
Brenlo pointed out that Warriors are intended to be superior tanks to Paladins and SK's. Class balance does not require Knights to have &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (and Spellbok Superiority).<br />
<br />
Sure, Knights can be allowed to tank the vast majority of all the mobs in the game with the same result as obtained by a Warrior - the mob dies. SoE only has to remove thier spellbook entirely.<br />
<br />
Most Warriors don't have a lot of interest in a near meaningless boost to DPS (I've let that +4 DMG aug rot rather than pay DKP for it) or some random abilities like Tendon Slice in exchange for the loss of tanking superiority vs. difficult mobs. Create tanking parity among the tanks and you do re-make Warriors as Knights without Spellbooks or just as bad Knights with Incredibly Inferior Spells (I like 1500HP heals with the 40% focus bonus in those GoD Paladin arms myself).<br />
<br />
Given the superiority of a Tank with a Priest Spellbook over any other tank in an EQ with &quot;Tank Parity&quot; it is not a mystery why some Paladins push for &quot;Tank Parity&quot; AND nerfing Cleric melee whenever there's a chance it might be anything more than an amusing curiosity.<br />
<br />
Don't bother removing CH. Give it to Shamans and Druids - why should Paladins be able to exceed it with LoH and cast it 5 times with Soulfire, but the real secondary healers can't. Upgrade Clerics to a 12k HP heal and make the greater HP's of Tanks truely meaningful.<br />
<br />
Think outside the box? WoW and FFXI have a different box and even different contents inside if yer unhappy with how this one is fundamentally designed and implimented with regard to class defining abilities and roles.<br />
<br />
And Gimmel, some Paladins will never cease wanting Defensive (or some of it) or if that's not going to happen to have it removed from the game. I think that's part of the Class Description - I'll have to re-read it to be sure.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm especially interested to see that when I use that very same phrase that YOU are so fond of quoting to support the warrior's position, and show how that same phrase that you feel justifies everything... showing that THAT PHRASE still holds true for warriors after this fix, my arguments are all of a sudden weak and evasive.<br />
<br />
Very interesting, indeed. Especially when you start talking about the mythical &quot;OMG TANK PARITY!&quot;, when I show that the significant advantage in &quot;warrior's unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles&quot; WOULD STILL EXIST.<br />
<br />
Are you even listening to what I say? Because it sure doesn't look like it.<br />
<br />
And you know why you feel it echoes off stuff over at PoN? It's in large part because you're paranoid aboud losing defensive, and feel threatened and attacked about the loss of it. It's extremely apparent in your posting history, especially recently.<br />
<br />
You've been defending against the paladins asknig for defensive for so long, the mere sight of anything that threatens warrior only defensive in its current amount is enough to make you go automatically into /defensive yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've never really liked how defensive ended up being used.  However, it has been a major part of the game for a number of years and most raiding is designed around it.

It seems to me that then Paladins would become the tank class of choice, since they'd have all the &quot;bonus&quot; abilities they have and tank pretty close to on par with a Warrior.  Do you really think that once evasive and defensive are removed from the equation that Warriors retain enough of an advantage in tanking alone to be that attractive?  I don't.<br />

<br />
Because warriors would remain &quot;unmatched  in their abilities to survive the most brutal battles&quot;. In other words, warriors take the pounding better, and STILL would. It's just an always on ability of a lesser amount than a stupid disc that poofs after a set period of time.<br />
<br />
  It seems to me that then Paladins would become the tank class of choice, since they'd have all the &quot;bonus&quot; abilities they have and tank pretty close to on par with a Warrior. <br />
<br />
That's assuming A: Warriors aren't given enough of a mtigation/avoidance compensation, and B: That they are given nothing else to their skillset. BOTH of which assumptions don't apply to my fix, because MY fix is based on the assumption that it's rebalanced to give enough of both. Now taking those objections out of the picture, what else can you come up with?<br />
<br />
Do you really think that once evasive and defensive are removed from the equation that Warriors retain enough of an advantage in tanking alone to be that attractive?  I don't.<br />
<br />
IF they are given no permanent bonus to mitigation/compensation to compensate, they wouldn't be. BUT, you see, they WOULD be given a permanent increase to mitigation and avoidance. This is addressed in my post... did you read it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Balance could be achieved this way, probably, but really, that would mean to modify every single encounter in the game, then you would have to balance warrior and knight, what % should they be better ? <br />
If the % is too high then warrior would be so much better than knight even in xp group that knight would be even more inferior to warrior than at the moment<br />
If it's too low, warrior would really have nothing to offer.<br />
<br />
In my opinion it's very narrow-minded to want knight and warrior to be as close as possible in their tanking ability. Perfect balance  in any given  situation can only be achieve if you have 1 class. Class balancing should not be : 'We should be more alike' but, 'We should be even more different'.  See, Wizard asking for more sustained dps, rogue for more burst dps, and what in the end ? Wizard and rogue being equivalent ? bah<br />
Then it's up to the developpers to be sure than every class has it's utility when they design the content. Clearly, in GoD the 1 group content in KT, Ikkinz and Vxed to a lesser extent has been poorly designed.<br />
<br />
Yet the tremendous amount of bitching for ikkinz trial were while  making the assumption that everyone would need them in order to get flagged for Qvic. In fact we don't. Therefore it does make some sense to have a very very hard trial tuned for the best tank, best dps and so on. Was it a good idea ? 6 people working for the others. We can discuss this, but now that we know for sure we don't need those for everyone, we can only consider those events as 'guild flagging' and as any guild flagging event, you have warrior tanking, cleric healing, it makes sense to have those trials designed for specialists, it's just a test of gear.<br />
<br />
Now comes the problem of the loot in those trial. Maybe they should just remove them completely, or they should just drop Kod Taz / Yxtta augment, anyway the reward is the guild flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors already currently have an edge in mitigation outside of using defensive.  How much did that help us in PoP?  We might still get groups, because many times a group is just looking for a reasonable damage absorber and most any plate tank will do.  But if youi gave Warriors enough of an innate mitigation advantage to make them attractive for boss mob tanking then you make them overpowered for group tanking.  Or if you lower boss mob DPS  enough so that you don't have to make it a huge mitigation advantage then you make it more common and probable that Warriors are replaced on raids by Paladins.  I don't see how you can reasonably address it without huge overhauls which would still leave the question of balance in serious jeopardy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Warriors make few enough choices. Defensive is remarkable for giving Warriors an ultimately surmountable raid boss mob tanking advantage while not affecting normal grouping.<br />

If Warriors would be unmatched with it removed, it is also true that they are unmatched with it still in the game. Your goal sir in removing it is to change things - and for Warriors not for the better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The problem with your original idea is that it, effectively, gives every class in the game a 20%+ mitigation bonus in all situations EXCEPT for warriors in a MTing situation in the first 3 minutes of a fight. They get a hefty mitigation decrease instead. The idea itself isnt without merit but your proposed implementation is quite horrendous. Shaving off large portions of DPS means that not only knights, but everyone effectively just got their 25% defensive.. only its on ALL the time with no penalty or repercussions. Ignoring any boosts to warrior tanking, that change in itself would have trivialized tanking for hundreds of encounters at all levels of the game for guilds of all skill levels.<br />
<br />
The whole idea is a balance nightmare, this isnt something that could be fixed with a couple of algorithms to fix numbers across the board, it would need to be looked at on a per-encounter basis. With wildly varying encounter lengths, thousands of unique encounter abilities/spells/situations any sweeping change would have wildly differing results depending on the sort of encounter youre dealing with.<br />
<br />
Simply put, Sony is unlikely to remove defensive because doing so would mean much more work. Which in turn means they would need to hire many more staff then the skeleton crew they have currently working on fixing old content/balance issues.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Here's wh yI feel defensive breaks the game. I'll give a situation.<br />
<br />
High DB Mob hits quad for 3000.<br />
<br />
Tank A with 11KHP goes evasive to tank the mob. Total damage per round 12000. Evasive avoids nearly half of the hits, probably on average gets rid of 5000HP in damage average end of the round, tank is alive with several KHP left, and has a survives. <br />
<br />
Tank B doesn't pop evasive with 11KHP. Tank B takes 12k damage and dies.<br />
<br />
Tank C doesn't have defensive and has lower HP. Tank C also dies.<br />
<br />
The ability to survive is almost entirely attributed to the disc, and not the tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
**When the disc is more important than the tank, that I believe is brokenly overpowered**<br />
<br />
<br />
It pisses me off that I owe my survival not to my gear and the virtue of being the best tank in the game, but because of a single disc. When a significantly undergeared (compared to me) tank is a BETTER thank than I am due to ONE thing and one thing only, that's broken. As it stands, an elemental warrior is a better tank with defensive than a Time+ warrior is without defensive. That's wrong, and that's too much of a gap.<br />
<br />
A Time+ warrior should ALWAYS be a better tank than a warrior that is in elementals. It should NOT depend solely on a single arbitrary discipline.<br />
<br />
The important of having defensive is going to become more and more over-egaxxgerated as it has been in Velious up to PoP.  That's due to exactly how much more powerful these abilities are going to get as they shed more and more damage on the harder and harder hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
This is oversimplified, but in Velious, against AoW, defensive was mitigating 500 per hit. The hits were quad, so 2k damage a round or so. In PoP vs Quarm, That's being done EACH HIT, or EIGHT THOUSAND per round. In the new exapnsion, the numbers are going to get ever larger. <br />
<br />
HP increases on the tanks have not kept pace with the HP mitigation increases that defensive provides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet most of the time you owe your survival even more to a spell called complete heal that Clerics receive at level 39.  If you're upset that you're surviving because of reliance on a discipline you received in the 50s, shouldn't you be even more upset that a level 39 Cleric would do almost as well at keeping you standing?  Yet no one is saying complete heal should be pulled from the game, because too much is built around it.<br />

Instead they should give knights better mitigation and avoidance and this affect should be taken out so as the knight would be taking the full force of the mobs attacks and not interrupting melee through stuns. <br />
<br />
#2: Rebalance named mobs by reducing the DB and DI. Reduce these numbers by about 25%, so that while they hit a little bit harder to a KNIGHT with no stun but improved mitigation and avoidance capabilites, that is offset by the fact that they will still be getting hit for that 6 seconds later, when the pre-changes knight would have stun wear off, and be taknig the full force of the mob's attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Ok, sorry for asking this here.<br />
<br />
I agree with you when you say that knights shouldn't be able to tank big raid bosses, until they are either A: properly geared (IE. after your guild farms quarm and other PoTime bosses, knight A has enough HP/AC to tank boss_07) or B: they boss is so gimped right off the bat(what they plan to do to god content RAID wise).  <br />
<br />
The issue goes further than knights not being able to tank SINGLE group content, they no longer have a job on a raid in GoD.  In PoP, it was offtanking adds (our good snap aggro), but now since warriors have good snap aggro, and defensive, they offtank adds more.  I have also heard that the trash mobs in GoD can one round a knight, which is why a ranger with thier disc is chosen to offtank over a knight.  What do knights bring to raids in high end GoD?<br />
<br />
Note: these are all my opinions and understandings of the problems from posts on SKO, STW, and EQlive forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I think knights do need some changes but I think it is with their spell book that changes need to be made. A stun that works at higher levels would be nice, maybe a little better mitigation, not sure the other spells but seems there are a lot that either need fixed or reworked. The problem is that instead of looking to changes with existing class features it always comes back as we want all warriors abilities.<br />
<br />
The other problem I can see is GoD is being looked at by most requesting changes as the standard groupable content. With the exception of GoD I wouldn't think knights were anywhere near those kind of problems in other zones I might be wrong.</div></div><hr />

For SK's I guess it would have to be something with the snare lines. Same thing, maybe change it to be disc based instead of a spell so that it would be landed and put some modifier on that funtion that gives them a little better mitigation. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Content that is challenging for clerics to tank, is trivial to a knight.<br />
<br />
Not if the cleric has a clue, and the content isn't bleeding-edge. I've tanked plenty of BoT and a little hard ldon with nothing more than my own heals and Quiescence, and I'm only barely over 6kHP buffed with weak AC; though I take zero riposte damage, since my 28dps hammer isn't worth it. That's on a druid(priest)-avoidance table, with 75 dodge and no riposte or parry. I've soloed in fire and albeit slow, it's doable. I've said for years that most clerics are dumbasses and that's why no one understands what the class is capable of.<br />
<br />
Removing defensive discs from the game and retuning will allow clerics and plenty of other classes to tank much more difficult content than we should, including named mobs; stunability has nothing to do with cleric aggro-lock since we have better hate spells, and even if for some reason I couldn't channel heals on a boss mob (I channeled CH for almost 2 minutes against a ldon-easy assassinate mob when our war went LD), single-target heal spells aren't viable to use just for aggro, since they do zero aggro too often. Clerics are slightly above paladins and slightly below shadow knights in terms of aggro in groups; we just have to stay alive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defensive and Evasive are both pretty powerful for tanking bosses, but I would argue that warriors need that edge in boss mob tanking to offset the edge in utility that knights have available to them through spells.  The smaller the group, the more valuable that utility is.  I've been in groups with paladins acting as main healer, main crowd control, only res, only spell interruption.  <br />
<br />
Warriors can't fill any of those roles.  There may be classes who can do all of those things better than paladins but the fact that they can do those things adds value that warriors don't have.  To compensate for that advantage you either need a number of small but similarly useful abilities or a single, more powerful ability.<br />
<br />
Basically to give knights defensive, you have to give warriors a spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I'm not suggesting to give knights defensive.<br />
<br />
I think to give warriors a &quot;spellbook&quot;, all you need is abilities such as the berserker has.<br />
<br />
A berserker is much like a warrior with a larger DPS role, and no tank role at all. The abilities they have seem to make up the difference rather well... .I don't see a requirement to have any more kinda of abilities for warriors than berserkers already have.</div></div><hr />

At this late date, the only way to balance around the removal of defensive and CH would be to just start over and code a new version of EQ. I think the game would have been better off without em both, but it's too late.  Speaking, of course, as a knight without a spellbook ...<br />
<br />
As far as giving CH to druids or shamans, it's the supernals I miss more often when I'm grouped without a cleric, not the full CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">This is oversimplified, but in Velious, against AoW, defensive was mitigating 500 per hit. The hits were quad, so 2k damage a round or so. In PoP vs Quarm, That's being done EACH HIT, or EIGHT THOUSAND per round. In the new exapnsion, the numbers are going to get ever larger.  <br />
<br />
..and yet, I end up tanking quarm without defensive up 2/3 of the fight (including 2-3 reslows due to head falling). Ive been doing this since the very first time we killed it and rarely have I died. I wish people would stop using quarm as an example in dps/tanking assessments, he probably does worse dps then the unslowable stonegolem in p3 to the MT.<br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting to give knights defensive. <br />
<br />
No, what youre suggesting is FAR more far reaching then that. You are suggesting mini-defensive for everyone, ALL the time. It would require rebalancing every encounter in the game from the ground up where there was any chance of anyone but a warrior being hit. You think this is going to happen when it took them almost 2 months to make a single zone worth of encounters work properly?<br />
Im not saying that removing defensive/evasive would be bad for the game IF they spent the time to do it properly. The problem is that investing that amount of time and effort will never happen (and sorry, your implementation is shit and wouldnt work).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Well sure, in hindsight defensive was not that great an idea, especially for how much damage its migitates.

<br />
Its the exact same argument when people said FD was not designed to be a pulling tool, or that people were not supposed to kite mobs.  Fact is regardless of their initial intentions so many things have been introduced, balanced and tuned around these abilities that the whole game would have to be revamped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">The additional bonuses that I'm talking about, revolve around the average higher AC that warriors have, the average higher amount of defensive tanking based bonuses (on gear), the higher defensive caps, and the like. Taken all together, it drops the average damage a warrior takes to less than what a knight takes, but about 12.5-15%.<br />
<br />
Funny, particularly if they go turtle with a shield, and unlike most warriors they can do it while holding aggro just fine, most knights I know can get MORE AC than comparably geared warriors.  So I don't know where this AC advantage is coming from.  Nevermind the SK self buffs that can really boost the old AC.  Aura of... whatzit....  I forget the name.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I noticed on the SK board that they like to claim warriors had an innate mitigation advantage before the -1 DI went in.  Prove it.  I've never seen it.  You're saying something similar with this 15% better thing.  Where's the parse?  And don't just link the parse that monk did with mostly partially Time geared people against an HoH trash mob.  It's an interesting parse and has its uses, but I've picked it apart already as being unsuited to accurately compare knights to warriors.<br />
<br />
I'm with those who favor the disciplines for warriors.  They absolutely should not be removed.  The ability to, at times, pop an ability that gives warriors a large advantage in survivability is to offset the much greater utility of the knight classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Sure, I'll prove it.<br />

<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5868<br />
<br />
And no, sorry, you can't pick it apart enough to show that that difference does not, after all, exist. I'm familiar with the arguments that could be used, and it doesn't make enough of a difference for my purposes. That 15% difference WILL still be there. <br />
<br />
It's not the only parse out there, for sure, and it backs up commonly held beliefs in the community, as well as the other parses. There isn't a parse that I've seen that doesn't show a definite warrior advantage in similar gear.<br />
<br />
Considering I can show proof that backs up what is already commonly held beliefs, the burden of proof is actually on you to show that there is NOT, in fact, a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Except those parses show that the difference is 5%<br />
Warrior has 15% shielding, 2200 AC, average hit : 223<br />
Paladin has 0% shielding , 2000 AC, averae hit : 255<br />
If you just had shiedling, it's <br />
Warrior 238<br />
Paladin 255<br />
255 / 238 = 1,071, a paladin is taking 7,1% more damage than the warrior. But the warrior has 200 more ac, so it's probably just 5%.<br />
Where are the 15% ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">To start with, you need  to take a look at overall damage taken, not just how much you're getting hit each time. OTherwise you're ignoring half the picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Let's do some math again :<br />
The Shadow Knight has 1861 AC, avg hit : 268<br />
The Paladin has 2066 AA, avg hit : 255<br />
The Warrior has 2271 AC, avg hit : 238<br />
<br />
Let's make the assumption that the effect of AC is linear (it's wrong, but if the difference are small enough, it's a fairly good estimation). Shadow Knight and Paladin are on the same mitigation table, and Warrior are not.<br />
By increasing AC of 205, the knight reduce DPS by 4,8%<br />
So a knight with 2271 AC would get hit for an average of 255*0.952 = ... 242 !<br />
Therefore the mitigation difference between warrior and knight is statisticaly insignificant.<br />
<br />
Why is this ? why don't we even find the supposed 5% coming from the neg 1 DI ?<br />
We'd need the distribution of the hit, but we have an idea with an estimation :<br />
The Warrior is hit for 238 in average, DB is 102, DI is 21 , therefore the average x in dmg = DB * xDI is x=6,5 so the average 'gain' of the 5% is less than 7 damage.<br />
So the actual difference between warrior and knight in this set of parses is roughly : <br />
7/238 = 2.9%<br />
<br />
A few note : this difference will decrease as AC of both increase. 3% is not suprising considering the edge of warrior over knight is only on the DI, and that plate tanks are caracterized by their high probability of being hit for the minimum, so DB is quite a big part of the mob dps, and therefore the warrior has nowhere near 5% edge over knight.<br />
Lastly those parses seem to prove that there is no difference between knight &amp; warrior regarding effect of AC, IE, if you remove the 5% DI mitigation, knight and warrior are the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Actually, Defensive isn't too powerful.<br />
<br />
Most fights last longer than three minutes, some much longer. In such fights Defensive often isn't even needed. Witness the ability of Knights to MT all of PoTime.<br />
<br />
In some fights, AE damage, DD, DoTs, DS, innate procs, etc. do as much damage as any thing else. Defensive does no damage reduction vs. these sources of damage.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere there is a long list of older mobs. While in many cases the DB and DI values are such that Warriors should use Defensive, in many other cases Evasive is suggested.<br />

SoE can design mobs and determine how big/or small a role Defensive should have.<br />

Actually, defensive has been breaking the game for a long time now, and I've known it. Just as Cheal has... witness, ALL named encounters being designed for the use of two things... defensive/evasive and CHeal. Such a complete dependance on two this is game breaking, it's been this way since... Velious.

<br />
At least it shows me that any fact you present should be taken with a grain of salt. It may not be a fact, but just your opinion masquerading as fact.<br />
<br />
Does that give me Arbosch syndrome? No. I'm a warrior, not a hybrid plate. I'm suggesting this for the good of the game, not necessarily to make Paladins better, that's a secondary consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Daemonwynd, SoE just got done saying that defensive is a class defining ability for Warriors that won't be shared.

Sorry, but I'm exceedingly dubious.  IMO it's far far too late to even contemplate anything of this nature.  Too many expansions and too many encounters are designed with defensive/evasive in mind.  And those two abilities have kept Warriors from receiving much in the way of upgrades for far too many expansions for them to dump them, go back, and redo the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

SoE can determine how much influence Defensive has on the game. Therefore the only two reasons to remove it are:<br />
<br />
1. SoE developers are too constained by it's existance - something none of us are in a position to answer, but the evidence suggests otherwise. There are plenty of ways to limit the impact of Defensive.<br />

You say Defensive is broken... even if it were, so what? I think there are things that much more fundamentally affect the game in a negative way - melees that can cast anything beyond the most trivial spells for example and think they should still tank anything even close to a Wariror..<br />

Ah, but in this game as it stands, defensive/evasive is always used. Whether they have less of an effect or not, everyone puts the defensive/evaisve tank in front of the mob. NOTHING they've tried in the game so far has changed that fact. And they've tried some pretty good stuff. Therefore your point is irrelevant because the game is still played the same way, despite the best efforts of the devs.<br />

Do me a favor and take a look at the top AC's on EQ rannkings, and see where almost without exception paladins have a significant AC disadvantage vs a warrior, and get back to me on how much or how often paladins have an AC advantage over warriors.

Shielding exist for both paladin and warrior and are (roughly) equaly hard  to get for knight and warrior, and anyway very soon all high end knight &amp; war will have it maxed, so yes comparing knight &amp; warrior at the same level of shielding is revelant.<br />
<br />
Except you are conveniently ignoring that hybrids don't have the benefit of being able to concentrate solely on tanking effects, they need focus effects as well. Therefore hybrids nearly without exception have less melee enhancing gear than warriors, even with the knightemization advantage.<br />
<br />
So, you used this as a proof, I showed you it prove the contrary of what you were assuming, and now you ask for more parsing ? duh ? Why should I parse stuff since this one prove my point ?<br />

The paladin in my guild thats equipped about the same as me beats my AC easily, at least 1 who is in worse gear then me also beats my ac easily.

Man where are you pulling these lies? Paladins have at least equal opportunity on acquiring shielding items, and infact AGAIN they have it better off because they can get away with using a 1h+shield combo(with 4% shielding). The only item so far with a shielding advantage for warriors is 1% on a TimeBP vs TimeBP comparison (again this is pre-qvic, I havent seen most the paladin items from there yet). Knights give up NOTHING to pursue the same tanking items warriors get. These items almost universally have focuses, atk, FT and/or useful rclick effects on them in addition to shielding/avoidance. Smart buying of gear nets a knight everything they could need to have equal or better AC/defensive mods as a warrior and STILL have good FT/focuses/atk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I realize my guild isn't in Time yet... but you know what, Time+ guilds DEFINITELY aren't the only ones that matter especially in the context of this discussion.<br />
<br />
Your whole argument was that defensive is becoming increasingly unbalancing as mob DI's get higher and higher. I know that your perceptions are rooted in your own tier of play, as are mine. However trying to say that the issue you addressed isnt PRIMARILY with Time++ guilds is false. Which guilds do you think are fighting these mobs with increasingly larger DIs? Its not EP guilds, not VT guilds, its not family guilds. There is no AC/defensive mod gap for paladins and warriors who have farmed Time, this is a fact. <br />
<br />
EP itemization, while pretty ridiculous with molds as loot and bad drop ratios.. did get 1 thing almost right. It didnt give hybrids EVERYTHING that they could possibly need. It started the problem, but Time really was where knightemization blew out to ridiculous proportions. You do realize that all those mangelos of warriors using shields isnt what they are actually using during the course of play right? You do realize that the corresponding ones with knights using those same shields ARE what they use during the course of normal play? You do realize that EP items didnt fuck up itemization, it was shit from Time and beyond? Right?</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I did not check your Magelo before replying. Not that I'm certain it matters.<br />
<br />
Actually, there are several raid boss mobs where many guilds do not just simply and reflexivly use the Evasive/Defensive tank - CT and Inny in PoTime fear and are often MT'd by Paladins. Greig Venficus is at a much lower tier and commonly MT'd by Knights as is TZ in the pre-planar RZ script - so it's difficult to attribute your lack of knowledge to the fact you aren't in PoTime.<br />
<br />
Top Knights don't absolutely require FT or focus items to MT and certainly do not favor these items over Tank items. However, 7FT+ is not uncommon and of course Trydan's BP, the most common PoTime farmed Paladin BP, has Marr's Blessing - a 30% Healing focus. For those Paladins that don't skip content and farm VT/Ssra/Seru thoroughly before moving in to the EP's they in fact can obtain FT, etc. without giving up very Warrior-like AC and HP's. For example, this Warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=853958) and this Paladin (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=853954). Not knowing that PoTime Knight items like Trydan's BP can have  +Reposte, Healing Focus, and Shielding as well as decent AC and HP's is I suppose understandable if you haven't been to PoTime. Am I to understand you haven't extensively farmed VT/Ssra/Seru either?<br />
<br />
Knight tanking is less than Wariror tanking both to take into account that their spells have value, but also to insure that they do not get versatility as a free bonus. In addition, as Brenlo pointed out recently:<br />
Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. <br />
Knights are entitled to have near equal acceptability in experiance group and a raid role. They are not however entitled to tank as well as a Warrior. Traditionaly with vastly superior gear towards the end of an expansion, they can MT more raid boss mobs, but this is actually more because the mobs have become trivial than because Knights closed the tanking gap with Warriors.<br />
<br />
Some might not like EQ's design. But all of this has been in place since Kunark and is very unlikely to change.<br />
<br />
Warriors could have 10 minute Defensive/Evasive and it would change nothing. Knights are NOT Warriors and do not share their Primary Tank raid role. Knights get to tank raid boss mobs when their equipment makes it possible for them to do so, not because they have &quot;caught up&quot; to Warriors. It's PvE, not PvP (if it was PvP, Warriors would take a terrible drubbing).<br />

<br />
<br />
I just did out of the 100 top player by AC, with authentic magelo, guess what ? about 50 are warrior, 40 knights and 10 bards + clerics, and even if it's just a coincidence, the 1st one is ... a paladin. Of course this is making the assumption that the proportion of authentic magelo is evenly distributed among the classes, but this assumption is much more likely to be true than the one 'there are as much fake warrior profile as there are fake knight profile'<br />
This is exactly what I observed in my guild btw( DKP guild) knight have in fact, higher AC with their tanking gear than warrior with their tanking gear (warrior tanking gear does not include a shield, sorry, it's just a magelo booster.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Except you are conveniently ignoring that hybrids don't have the benefit of being able to concentrate solely on tanking effects, they need focus effects as well. Therefore hybrids nearly without exception have less melee enhancing gear than warriors, even with the knightemization advantage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is mostly untrue, it&quot;s at most 1 or 2 items in a knight's gear, which is balanced by the shield, and by the way shields have 3-5% shielding that make it up for the 1% difference on BP and the 2-3% on the items with focuses.<br />
You don't know much about post elemental gear, do you ?<br />
<br />
<br />
It does NOT prove your point, and the burden of proof is on you, because YOU are challenging commonly held perceptions. If you can't provide proof, then that's fine. That just means you can't prove your point.<br />
I mean seriously, it's not like YOU have to parse, just find a prase by someone else that proves your claims. If you cannot, well, we know what that means. <br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you claim. Now prove it.<br />
<br />
Can't come up with proof? Well, that in itself is proof of a different kind.<br />
<br />
So in other words, put up or shut up.<br />
<br />
Man, you're throwing this 15% difference in mitigation between warrior and knight out of your ass, you have NO fact to back it up, I call it what it is, bullshit, I prove it using the data we have, and it's still up to me to do more parsing ? Why would I shut up when you miserably fail to prove anything, when you make huge mistake in your analysis of data ?  <br />
I would  like to know what you call 'common' knowledge when it comes to parsing ? Is it a way to make it sound like you did not just invented 15% but it's something that is easily seen ? Easily seen where ? where are the parses showing 15% difference ? There is no such a parse in TSW.<br />
<br />
It is YOU who claim there is a difference between a knight and a warrior tanking, even developpers disagree, and this is why they gave the bonus on DI mitigation. The difference is more or less 5% depending on mob's attack, and it's just coming from defensive skill caped slightly higher (mobs hit 2% more a knight) and the 5% bonus on DI mitigation (~3% damage mitigation)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Like I said man, this only backs up what we ALREADY KNOW... the burden of proof is on you to show there is no difference, trying to pick apart a parse doesn't cut it.<br />
<br />
It backs up nothing.  You linked the exact parse I expected you to link that has already been thoroughly picked apart.  It is NOT a good representation of knight versus warrior tanking.  Others have already explained how your assumptions about AC and Shielding levels are just plain wrong, so I won't bother.  <br />
<br />
So find better parses for what you're trying to show or stop making the claims.  It is not backing up what WE already know.   You think it's backing up what you already believe to be true, but many of us, a) don't think it backs up your claims at all and b) don't agree with the &quot;facts&quot; you think are common knowledge in the first place.  <br />
<br />
I will easily make the same claim:<br />
<br />
As others have shown in their analysis of the parse you linked, all it does is back up WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW and that's the fact that the difference in dps taken between knights and warriors, non defensive, is only about 5%.  That of course assumes that the mob cannot be stunned by the paladin.<br />
<br />
You are the one who thinks something should change.  So the burden of proof is on YOU to back it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not as simple as that Flair, the problem is that melee damage mitigation from defensive and AC come from the same factor, if you limit one you limit the other. Makeing it so warriors and knights will take close to the same damage means that AC will have little effect and avoidance will become the main way to avoid damage makeing monks the premier tanks.<br />
<br />
The problem is that while everyones spells only got a minor boost in GoD defensive went from mitigating (as a guess) 250DPS to mitigating (another guess) 500-750DPS in effect defensive got 100% better while everyone else in the game saw a minor increase in power of perhaps 10%.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
Defensive is every bit part of the game as CH, slow, or mez.<br />
<br />
CH - reduced in effectiveness by 25 since first put in often too slow requireing fast healing that is higher mana cost and less healing.<br />
Slow - on many mobs mitigates to 17% and many mobs are totaly immune and many mobs require newer higher cost slows.<br />
Mez - Built with inherent blocks that make the earilyer mez spells usless in the current end game with the latest expansions haveing higher mana costs or limited effects.<br />
Defensive - now 100% better, same low cost, same long duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Those that believe Defensive/Evasive are too powerful are entirely capable of not using them. Convince the rest of the Warriors in your guild and you can have a version of EQ that suits your &quot;needs&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes, rather than give Warriors another 500HP's every expansion and every level, Verant/SoE opted to give us a scalable ability. Mind you, if I were at 20K HP's and CH wasn't tampered with Knights would be severly hurting. As things Defensive/Evasive are used when needed. This allows SoE to tune mobs and expansions to decide who tanks what.<br />
<br />
Mobs can proc, DD, DoT, DS, Fear, self-boggle, Knock back, DT, etc., etc. SoE is perfectly capable of deciding these mobs are cutting edge raid boss mobs and prefered tankable by Warriors at first and these other mobs are tankable by anyone with the equipment, spells, and abilities to manage.<br />
<br />
CT and Inny in PoTime are good examples of SoE's ability to in fact make raid mobs not Wariror prefered if they wish. Perhaps players that haven't reached that stage in the game are unaware when they insist otherwise.<br />
<br />
What is really being said is that some players don't like SoE being able to decide and would prefer it was all decided by equipment and spellbook vs. equipment and limited disciplines.<br />
<br />
Having recently seen a level 65 PoTime flaged Paladin purchased in Player Auctions and apply to an EP guild, I'm kinda glad that had that guild not said NO it's Warriors at least have Defensive so as not to be displaced by a Knight with more hitpoints, more AC, and a book full of spells.<br />
<br />
With full equipment tranfers being increasingly common, accounts being sold and given to friends, some players being willing to accept a content step down in order to MT, etc. it's a good thing that Warriors have a place in raids that's not easily usurped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">So if defensive, which drops DPS by ~20-30%, mitigates 250-500 more DPS, it follows that 50% slow would mitigate 625 more DPS, right?  Seems to me that Slow, even if mitigated, scales just as well as Defensive.  Granted more than one class can slow, but the fact that it scales is apparently the problem.<br />
<br />
It has already been mentioned that Defensive is not all powerful.  It has no effect on spells.  IMO, this is the flip side of the coin where Knights should shine.  Call it Spiritual Purity if you want to RP, but the principle is simple.  Warriors, being a melee oriented tank class, should be the best at mitigating melee DPS.  Knights, being a magic-based tank class, should be better at mitigating magic DPS.  In other words, give Knights an ability that works like Defensive against spell damage.  The problem with that is that the content isn't designed like that, so at this stage it wouldn't really make much difference.  I can't think of any mobs in the game where the tank takes more spell damage than melee damage (well, possibly Velk for the first few minutes of the fight).  Imagine a boss that nuked for 6k (every 4 or 5 seconds) but only hit for quad 300s or so.  Had the mobs in the game been designed to work more like the players, this concept would have worked, but unfortunately it wasn't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Actually, Paladins do get things that are effective against &quot;magic&quot; damage as well as melee damage. They are heals, stuns, and DA.<br />

Do Paladins complain that DA is not the right ability for a melee or SK's complain FD isn't appropriate? Noper, most Paladins that speak to this issue don't say take away DA and give us an auto parry discipline like other Warrior based hybrids get. I seriously doubt an SK would want to give up FD.<br />
<br />
Some Knights want their ability to evade damage (DA and FD) PLUS their spellbook PLUS a defensive-like rune/vie self-buff, parry, and/or reposte ability<br />
<br />
Many mobs do non-melee damage. A tank that heals or lifetaps can, unlike Warriors, deal with DD damage, DoTs, Damage Shields and innate procs. For the vast majority of mobs where Defensive/Evasive aren't used and even when they are used - at the end of three minutes, Warriors have &quot;-1 DI&quot;  going for themselves while tanks with spellbooks have a spellbook and a manabar.<br />

If true, this doesn't surprise me.

<br />
No. i'm just pointing out your flawed assumptions.<br />
<br />
Then knight DO get the same AC as warrior, often better even for 3 reasons : <br />
A) The top loot is ALWAYS plate / all (PoTime / VT / NToV ...)<br />
B) Self AC buff stacking with everything<br />
C) Knight will use a shield, when warrior won't most of the time, and if they do they lose a bunch of hate generation and dps, this is not the case for knight.<br />
<br />
more often than not, pallies WILL NOT get the same AC as a warrior. You know those shields you're trumping so much? Guess what, pallies often don't use shield for the same reason warriors do... less riposte and more damage. You know that claim about how many warriors use shields that have them in their magelo? Guess what, many pallies do that same thing. Not quite so many, of course, but a very significant number.<br />
<br />
Therefore my comparisons were revelant.<br />
<br />
Shielding exist for both paladin and warrior and are (roughly) equaly hard  to get for knight and warrior, and anyway very soon all high end knight &amp; war will have it maxed, so yes comparing knight &amp; warrior at the same level of shielding is revelant.<br />
<br />
No, it's not, if you want a true comparison. For the same reasons why you can't compare the AC's as the same.<br />
<br />
So, you used this as a proof, I showed you it prove the contrary of what you were assuming, and now you ask for more parsing ? duh ? Why should I parse stuff since this one prove my point ? You will ask for more evidence until you find a parse that suits you ? You won't find one.<br />
I also pointed out that the result of those parse were common knowledge, ie the only edge of a warrior over knight is :<br />
A) 5% DI reduction<br />
B) Defensive skills caped higher<br />
No matter how you count, it's not going to be 15% damage mitigation, defensive skill is 1 or 2% less hit, and DI bonus is 2-3%, no matter what mob or situation, it's not 15%<br />
<br />
It shows me all I need to know. All you can do is pick apart something, and bluster that you &quot;don't need to&quot; prove anything. Shows that YOU cannot or will not even prove your own point. You've got nothing, so all you can do is go on the attack.<br />
<br />
You haven't &quot;proven&quot; jack. All you've proven is that you're good at picking apart what OTHER people say.<br />

<br />
Want the text? IM me for the proof if you're REALLY that concerned about it.<br />
<br />
PLUS you need to take in the warrior avoidance advantage, there's your goddamn 15%.<br />
<br />
Shut the hell up and listen to people who actually know what they're talking about, and have been around and seen these things hashed out, instead of trying to pick apart proof that's offered and claim that that picking apart is proof that you're right and they're wrong, instead of actually offering proof of your own to the contrary.<br />

Shut the hell up and listen to people who actually know what they're talking about, I can do it to, but unlike you, I can show you, that every single 'fact' you use is used wrongly, and prove the exact contrary of what you think.<br />
<br />
<br />
FYI, every single paladin that had a chance to get a hopebringer took it on my server, and guess what ? they all use it for tanking purpose. Of course you don't know this you have only seen PoTime in pictures. <br />
<br />
Your comment on the 'riposte' is at the very best laughable, have you ever played, or well just SEEN a paladin tank ? I don't think so when I read this. A knight will spend most of his time casting, in fact he could tank without even attacking the mob, and beside check hopebringer ratio.<br />
<br />
Then if you still don't understand why knight have as much shielding as warrior, I can't do anything for you. Failing to aknowledege this just show either your total ignorance of the matter or your dishonesty, in either case, you should just shut up instead of making a fool of yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Ah you gave my another idea with your riposte shit, considering a knight  can hit mobs at least twice as less as a warrior, this will mean that the warrior will get riposted twice as much. But anyway riposte doesn't matter now, do they ?<br />
This is just 2 - 10% dps reduction (and also spike reduction, we all know riposte = spike, and spikes are bad)  depending wether slow is landing or not, but well that's still something.<br />
<br />
But anyway, here is another way of seeing the problem, maybe simplier for you to understand :<br />
Given a mob with X dps.<br />
If X is low, then without any doubt the knight and especialy the paladin will be able to tank it much better than a warrior.<br />
If X is very high then without any doubt the warrior will tank is much better than a paladin.<br />
<br />
For what X does (or should)the paladin tanking ability equal the warrior tanking ability, and then how should mob be designed around this number.<br />
<br />
No matter what you are going to do, even if the warrior has 1% more mitigation, potentialy, there will be mobs that a warrior will tank better.<br />
<br />
So now the questions are : what should be this limit, and how should mob be designed around it ?<br />
<br />
In my opinion the answers should be :<br />
If a mob can be handled with a single healer, knight should be superior (ie, giving knight and offtanking edge)<br />
If a mob require multiple healers, then warrior should be superior (ie raid level bosses)<br />
<br />
A cleric can heal 850 dps, so in my humble opinion the limit should be there, a knight should be able to tank a 850 dps mob with less heal than a warrior, and a warrior should tank a mob with over 850 dps with less heal than a knight, in the extreme case, a warrior can't solo (ie fight with no heal), and paladin can't tank the top bosses of the latest expansion.<br />
<br />
You will note that it does not mean a warrior won't be able to offtank, nor that a paladin won't be able to tank anything with more than 850 dps, it just means that it's going to be harder.<br />
<br />
Now it's up to the developpers to not fuck up with the content, they should know what are the real numbers, and design stuff accordingly, which was not the case, and should hopefully be so now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's your point? Paladins with Hopebringers make up probably less than 1% of the pallies on any given server. So it doesn't prove jack. Not every paladin on the server has a Hopebringer. <br />
<br />
Your comment on the 'riposte' is at the very best laughable, have you ever played, or well just SEEN a paladin tank ? I don't think so when I read this. A knight will spend most of his time casting, in fact he could tank without even attacking the mob, and beside check hopebringer ratio.<br />
<br />
ROFL... your statements get more and more ridiculous the more you post. Do you REALLY think that paladins don't care about ripostes at all? Even more laughable, you state possibilities about tanking without even attacking the mob, and bring up the hopebringer yet again... that's a possibility, not reality.  You seem to specialize in theory, yet I have yet to see you come up with ANYTHING hard to actually prove a single thing you're saying. It's quite obvious that you can't.<br />
<br />
Then if you still don't understand why knight have as much shielding as warrior, I can't do anything for you. Failing to aknowledege this just show either your total ignorance of the matter or your dishonesty, in either case, you should just shut up instead of making a fool of yourself.<br />
<br />
Again, you're completely full of it. I took the top 3 paladins and the top TWO wariors on my server's top guild, who are just aboutdone farming time. In those magelo's, I counted up the shielding present on the warriors and on the paladins.<br />
<br />
In those magelos, I counted 10 total shielding points for paladins (3.3 average) and TWENTY FIVE points between the TWO of them, for 12.5 average. <br />
<br />
This is FOUR TIMES what you claim, that pallies and warriors are equal.<br />
<br />
No, you're the one that's talking completely out of your arse.</div></div><hr />

No, I don't misunderstand that at all. You were the one to open it up by referring to the Hopebringer's ratio. And no, you're not going to try and cast at every opportunity. I hear paladins whining all the time about how much stuns cost and how you can't sustain chain casting on it. That's just another BS comment you're making.<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll intermix stuns with melee if they're REALLY all that concerned about taking as little riposte damage as possible, but what MOST paladins (yes, even many Time Paladins, because not EVERY Time Paladin has a Hopebringer, much as you would have us believe otherwise.) will do is just melee and stun every once in a while.<br />

Not a bunch. A few. More exaggeration on your part. Your credibility is slipping with each successing statement that's so full of BS.<br />

<br />
I said they're ALMOST done. You know, full Time rotations, and progressing in GoD with better drops an all that, they're starting to transition. Secondly, do you REALLY seriously think that there's only 35 shielding in that guild, when I stated the &quot;top three&quot; paladins, and even more tellingly, the &quot;TOP TWO&quot; warriors? Come on, 35 points of shielding on 5 characters, and you're jumping on that as 35 points for the &quot;whole guild&quot;? Who exactly are you expecting to NOT laugh at that?<br />
<br />
10 shielding is the minimum any plate tank should have at quarm's level, ie 3 out of shield / legs / bp. If a guild doesn't have an average 15 shielding on their tank they are faaaaaar from being done with time / ikkinz.<br />

<br />
Tell me then... if that is actually in fact true, which as I've already demonstrated is highly unlikely... How would YOU figure that a guild that has been farming time for several months now, with most tanks staying the same, NOT be higher than that?<br />
<br />
No. I think you're talking out of your arse. Again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">You are stating that paladin have usually lower shielding, I do not contest this, it's likely to be so, especialy in non dkp guild where shielding is going to be given to warrior first, but can occur in dkp guild also, when warrior are hording for dbtow bp or whatever, or not wanting to upgrade their phase 1-4 items for phase 5, low end GoD.<br />
<br />
What I stated is that : IT IS NOT HARDER FOR PALADIN TO GET AC AND SHIELDING AS FOR WARRIOR. This means they can achieve the same AC and shielding than a knight by spending the same amount of dkp, and getting the same item as a warrior. IS IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT EXCEPT 2 ITEMS IN THE GAME EVERYTHING WITH SHIELDING ON IT CAN BE WORN BY BOTH WARRIOR AND KNIGHT ? and those 2 items exist in knight version with a whole ... 1 less shielding.<br />
<br />
Now for AC, PoTime armor, except BP, can be worn by both knight and warrior, raex has still a bit more ac (usualy 1 /2 more AC per item, sooo much) but significantly less HP.<br />
BY SPENDING THE SAME AMOUNT OF DKP AS A WARRIOR A KNIGHT CAN GET THE SAME AC AS A WARRIOR.<br />
<br />
This is what I meant, and should not be too hard to  understand, nor to figure even for you by checking PoTime loot table and ikkinz loot table, and realizing every single item is plate / all. <br />

I'm aware of what those cost for mana, thank you. I'm also aware that those two ALONE cost more mana than raid buffed Paladins regenerate. I'm the're not using just those two if they're casting as much as you claim for them to do.<br />
<br />
Yes, but what you're ignoring is the significant recast time on them, as well as the fact that you're not getting the stun on the lower level one.<br />
<br />
If a Paladin is casting at &quot;every opportunity&quot; as you claim, they CANNOT *just* cast the lower mana cost one. Instead they have to go to the 200 mana QWOS as well as AFoC, to be able to do that. And THAT is enough mana usage to be unsustainable.<br />
<br />
So what statement is wrong, because they cannot both be right... are they &quot;casting at every opportunity&quot;, or are they using enough stuns and using enough mana to not be able.<br />
<br />
Either way, you're proving one of your OWN claims to be wrong, which one shall it be? Shall it be the &quot;twice as much less ripostes&quot; due to &quot;casting at every opportunity&quot;, or the sustainability of &quot;casting at every opportunity&quot;?<br />

Pal/SK dont rally need to attack to hold agro while offtanking ..<br />
Thus riposte = Non existant<br />
<br />
I demand to see 1 Pal/SK in EQ that while on tanking duty (main tanking or offtanking)<br />
That has GBoC/Vazanir and 1H+Shield using the 2H combo. (Ok exept VZ/TZ in Time)<br />

You do realise that &quot;The average Time+ 2H&quot; is not much slower than &quot;The average Time+ 1H&quot; ?<br />

As you continue painting youself to be an arrogant fool who can't and won't actually provide any proof for your claims, and whose argument style is to ignore and kind of good point made and only pick apart percieved weak points in the argument. People like you never add anything real, or positive to a discussion.<br />
<br />
Whoops, I didn't put a word in there. Instead of &quot;CANNOT cast the lower mana one, it should be &quot;cannot JUST cast the lower mana cost one&quot;<br />
<br />
And btw, I DO use Lucy, I refer to it on a regular basis. And yes, they may use the lower level spells if the mob is unstunnable, for example, in among the combo, if the mob is actually non stunnable. MAY. They'll also use QEWoS if the mob is stunnable. Because that's eyet another thing YOU are ignoring, it's not just about hose three things, it's also to what level is tuns the mob. If a pally's worried about damage, he's going to use stuns that actually stun the mob if he can.<br />
And most paladins will not &quot;cast at every opportunity&quot; as you claim, they'll melee as well as maintain aggro with stuns. I see it happen all the time with paladin's CC'ing non mezzable mobs.<br />
<br />
As for showing who doesn't have a clue, YOU are one that's contradicting himself, and showing that you cannot and will not actually back your claims up.<br />
<br />
Reamer: I hardly think a 5% mitigation fot he knights is going to make everyone else scream. I mean, really. It's NOT going to break the game, my proposal will maintain difficulty while brining hybrids and warriors closer together, yet still maintaining a warrior advantage. As for there being &quot;few&quot; mobs that actually require defensive... That's shown to not be true by the very call for and rebalancing of GoD because there ARE lots of mobs in GoD that required defensive to tank.<br />
<br />
As for whether this change will actually happen or not, it's very doubtful that it is. They're too focused on pushing out the next expansion and making more money. Doesn't mean it shouldn't happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Thats all we needed to see you have no clue at all how pal/sk work.<br />
Its sad to see you even made it to the EP.<br />
<br />
I'll give you a hint ...<br />
Pal/SK dont rally need to attack to hold agro while offtanking ..<br />
Thus riposte = Non existant<br />
<br />
&quot;don't need to&quot; and &quot;don't actually do it&quot; are two totally different things.<br />
<br />
Therefore, they CAN take little to no riposte damage, but since many of them melee as well, there IS riposte damage in many situations. It all depends on how hard the pally wants to work. It's more work to chain stun, than it is to a few times and melee I see very few paladins that actually do nothing but stun to CC. And most times, a few stuns to set aggro and melee is all they need.<br />
<br />
I demand to see 1 Pal/SK in EQ that while on tanking duty (main tanking or offtanking)<br />
That has GBoC/Vazanir and 1H+Shield using the 2H combo. (Ok exept VZ/TZ in Time)<br />
<br />
Um. Where did I ever get that specific and claim that? That's right, I didn't.<br />
<br />
Of COURSE a SK, say, with a 28 delay 1h weapon and the 2h delay reducing AA's, isn't going to worry too much about the extra 10 delay on a Vanazir when offtanking. That's a &quot;well, DUH&quot; situation. It's all situational. That's another &quot;well, DUH&quot; statement. Good thing I never claimed they ALWAYS used 2h instead, now, isn't it?<br />
<br />
GOGOGOGO PLANKTON &amp; EMP 2H !<br />
<br />
Please. Way to take it to ludicrous extremes. Plankton is a terrible ratio weapon, and wouldn't be used very much -if at all- because of it. Taking less ripostes only goes so far for rational people, you know.<br />
<br />
You do realise that &quot;The average Time+ 2H&quot; is not much slower than &quot;The average Time+ 1H&quot; ?<br />
<br />
2H : GBoC  33 /  Vazanir 38<br />
1H : Paladin 25 and 30 / SK  28 and 30<br />
<br />
Granted, in some cases. But certainly not all. And DO keep in mind, I'm not ONLY talking about Time, as I've stated MANY times in this thread. <br />
&lt;cough&gt;Hopebringer&lt;cough&gt;<br />

Do yourself a favor, and actually take a minute to comprehend what someone is posting, instead of thinking they're saying something they're not. Your post was ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">QWoS : 200 Mana 2.0 Sec (24 Recast)<br />
FoA : 65 Mana 1.0 Sec (12 Recast)<br />
Akilae : 90 Mana 1.0 Sec (12 Recast)<br />
Holy Might : 60 Mana 2.0 Sec (18 Recast)<br />
Stun : 35 Mana 1.0 Sec (12 Recast)<br />
<br />
Lets suppose he's cycle casting his 3 most efficient stuns ..<br />
Holy Might , 4 secs , FoA , 4 sec , Stun , 4 sec ... = 20 seconds (player lag included)<br />
Thats 60+65+30 = 155 Mana used in 20 seconds<br />
<br />
Thats Something like 50 mana / tick (give or take something)<br />
Considering KEI &amp; FT5 (which should be the ghetto minimum)<br />
The raw loss of mana is like 30 Mana / Tick<br />
<br />
A Paladin with a 4K5 Manapool could sustain 3 Stun Cycling for 150 ticks ..<br />
Thats 15 minutes, chain cycling every time they are up.<br />
<br />
75% Uptime group (Normal LDoN Zerg pulling) , thats 150/0.75 =  200 Ticks<br />
He's got  SPE &amp; MP4 Item right ? So thats 10% mana saved.. 220 Ticks<br />
<br />
Now he doesnt have to chain cycle all the time does he ?<br />
I mean lets face it after 3 stuns in 20 seconds, the mob will stay on the paladin.<br />
Of course he can push it to 3 stuns in 10 seconds, but i'll stick to cycling timer.<br />
Assuming there is a 50% cycle stun rate (the mob lives 40 seconds).<br />
The paladin can last 40 minutes.<br />
<br />
So in a 75% Uptime, Casting 3 stuns at inc when the 40sec lifespan mobs inc...<br />
The paladin can last 40-45 minutes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Do you actually mean that there is a non raid situation where a paladin has to land 1 stun<br />
every 2.5 seconds to keep agro and that for an infinite amount of time ?<br />
<br />
Lets face it... Agro is not an issue.<br />
<br />
However i do agree, if they wish to mitigate dmg via stuns, then its quite expensive.<br />
But the trade off is there : Instant DMG Mitigation , Instant Casting Interuption.<br />
<br />
IF (and thats a big IF) Paladins are supposed to be balanced in XP groups using stun<br />
cycling for DMG mitigation, then yes for the average paladin, there is a mana problem.<br />
<br />
He just cant keep up to the manacost.<br />
<br />
But hey lets face it .. If he casts 1 QWoS per 40 second lasting mob.<br />
He's getting a 25% DMG REDUCTION (assuming fixed duration).<br />
And can sustain that 1 QWoS per mob 40-60 Minutes.<br />
<br />
That leads to another problem : BLUE CONTENT &amp; Paladin Stacking.<br />
<br />
Get 3 Paladins, Chain casting  QWoS &amp; Akilae...<br />
And you have reduced your targets DPS to ZERO<br />
<br />
Get 2 Paladins doing the same things .. 50% DPS Reduction<br />
<br />
So IF QWoS lasts 10 seconds (IF), having 2 Paladin in a group<br />
means you can cut down the mobs DPS from 25 to 80%.<br />
<br />
And thats another balance issue problem.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Delay reducing AA's&quot; is a bad choice of words, by the way.<br />
<br />
Knight's Advantage is an increased chance to double attack, and Speed of the Knight is a small chance to score an extra hit (i.e. a single would become a double or a double would become a triple).  Nothing knights get, other than haste items, affect weapon delay.</div></div><hr />

when you said:<br />
Nothing knights get, other than haste items, affect weapon delay.<br />
While technically true, Paladins get a self haste buff. Obviously if they can get better, they do. However, in a pinch and with no outside help, Paladins do have more haste than Warriors lacking special equipment.<br />
<br />
Naturally, like Warriors matching Knight aggro, we can match the Paladin haste advantage with equipment (Ornate gauntlets, Eyepatch of Plunder, Belt of Marvelous Visions) by expending DKP, pp, or the time and effort needed to camp the item.<br />
<br />
Every guild I've been in awarded and camped spells continuously - as they should. That spell, like virtually every other spell, costs knights a lot less than the equipment Warriors must obtain to try to compete.<br />
<br />
Not acknowledging that spellbooks have value and the only thing that counts is tanking ability is disingenius for members of classes that chose tanking and spellbooks rather than Tanking alone.<br />
<br />
Oh sure, perhaps some day SoE may give Knights a version of Defensive. I hope they are fair and as compensation they take a poll and give Warriors their choice of 5 spells from each of the Knight spellbooks/set of abilities. After all, Knights don't even seem to find spells like that self haste buff worthy of mention.<br />

Yes, and in my fix, knights won't get defensive. So therefore it won't be shared now, will it?<br />
<br />
Secondly, my fix also maintains a warrior superiority in tanking over knights.<br />

No, it's more like I'm a shadowknight (you know, that other class everyone seems to lump in with paladins) and forgot about the paladin haste buff, rather than an attempt to downplay hybrid abilities.<br />
<br />
Even counting that spell, it has nothing to do with my main point that knights get no delay-reducing aa's as previously mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">But you missed the part where it's &quot;my fix&quot;. You're not a developer, they are.

<br />
Well, as Brenlo observed - the fixes are in and we can check Knight comments are actual results to see if they suffice. Like it or not, Warriors are supposed to tank better than knights and SoE, not Daemonwynd, Gilfalas, or Kaev decides how much better. Thus far the majority of comments have NOT been that Knights can't tank in GoD but rather laments that 7500HP unbuffed Paladins can't tank advanced content as well as a Warrior. Of course, they never could - a terrible injustice. They should let Knights give up the spellbook and become Warriors.<br />

<br />
You wont because you cant. Thats very simple.<br />
While my numbers may be off,  they do express a reality :<br />
<br />
1) A Single Paladin with KEI can generate absolutely SICK Agro FOR EVER<br />
2) A Single Paladin with KEI can cut down a blue mob's DPS by 15-20% Easily FOR EVER<br />
3) Stacking Paladin Can lead to mob Lockdown<br />
4) Increasing Gear is just like Staking Paladins<br />
<br />
I never bothered to test or ask if QWoS actually did stun for 10 seconds.<br />
IF it does last for 10 full seconds every time (or some very decent average like 6+ Sec)<br />
Then you are blind to see how overpowered it is.<br />
<br />
2 PHAT Knights can lock down a stunnable mob almost FOR EVER.<br />
<br />
Now thats even more of a balance issue than defensive. <br />
(Poor SK lol, they dont even have stuns).<br />
<br />
Which means a shitload of mobs have to be flagged immune to stun.<br />
To prevent Paladin Chain Stuning (Anyone remember AE groups ?).<br />
Which means Paladins get fucked because they cant stun (thus mitigate) shit.<br />
For SK its even worse, since they cant ever stun or heal (ghetto mitigation).<br />
<br />
There is VERY VERY INTERESTING/EASY way to balance Pal/SK Tanking.<br />
1) Increase stun lvl caps, Make almost all mobs stunnable, ADD A RECOURSE (see MB/LD)<br />
2) Give SK a LDoN Bullwark Rune Clone that costs mana &amp; drains mana (that will stack with VIE)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps : I know SoTK isnt a haste or delay reducer, but since it increases the number of hits<br />
using a 2H,  it can be simplified to &quot;reducing 2H delay&quot; for comparing reasons.<br />
A 30 Delay 2H will hit more often than a 30 Delay 1H .... <br />
So it kinda acts like it had lower delay (its extra bonus swings i know).<br />
But when counting ripostes, extra bonus swings is just the same thing a lower delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">You wont because you cant. Thats very simple.<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
I'm just not going to do it because it's not worth my time fighting about it.<br />
<br />
That's not saying I can't, because I could, for example, point out this &quot;player lag&quot; you include that is fairly rare to see, especially to that extent, which conveniently lowers the mana usage per tick. Most people with that kind of lag would complain about it and try to fix it instead of continuning like it.<br />
<br />
That's just ONE thing. There's more. But no, it's not worth my time.<br />
<br />
That's another incorrect assumption, that it's because I &quot;can't&quot;, not &quot;won't&quot;. Just like your &quot;don't have to&quot; and &quot;don't actually do it&quot;.<br />
<br />

Warriors chose to be a 100% tank.<br />
<br />
Now who do you suppose should be the better tank?<br />
<br />
Despite this, if you read PoN (god help yas) and SoE's Paladin Class board you'll recognize a consistant thread in most posts.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's Knight pride that makes some 10K buffed Knights feel they should step in front of a 12k HP buffed Warrior who has Defensive and try to wrest the aggro from da Warrior and grab that mob that WAS under control till they started ping ponging it.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's Warrior pride that make them think that in a raid they should be more useful than a level 55 Rogue that fights from the front.<br />
<br />
Doh, the Warrior is a better tank. Give us Defensive!! Doh, Defensive will not be shared. Give us something LIKE Defensive!! Doh, SoE will not &quot;balance&quot; Knights by victimizing Warriors. REMOVE Defensive from da game!!! And give Warirors weak versions of the Beserker abilities!!!! I respond - KMA.<br />
<br />
Make the two classes play well together in a group!! Newsflash - they compliment each other awesomely in a group. Just because your eqo is bigger than your mitigation and YOU never noticed doesn't make it untrue.<br />
<br />
Give Knights a &quot;role&quot; in raids. OMG are YOU such a lame Knight that you DON'T have a role in raids? Your spellbook plus your tanking ability gives Knights value in raids. A heck of a lot more value than a #5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 Warrior in almost every raid in the game. They make you sit out raids so Beserker twinks can contribute more that you? Yeah, right.<br />
<br />
The #1 most requested Warrior utility service is......................Shrink please. Inappropiate? Pleeeeeeease SoE, take it away, I'll even eat the 20Kpp I paid for a Cobalt Bracer. Warriors shouldn't have utility - we're 100% Tanks.<br />
<br />
Who says Warriors should be the #1 raid boss mob tank??????!!!!! Hello, McFly??!! /bonk /bonk The class descriptions sir and common sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fixing&quot; Knights should be done by looking at the contributions they make in groups and in raids. Not by focusing exclusively on the fact that Warriors tank better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Well I have read thru the majority of this thread. (Yes I just skimmed thru parts) The main argument seems to be that Knights are not able to MT some of the real high end mobs. I personally cannot speak about this since I am only lvl 64 and in a family type guild. My other char is a 65 Shaman which I normally box with my war.<br />
<br />
Ok back to the main argument Paladins cannot MT some high end mobs. So what !I am guessing that having a knight in the grp along with a war is doable. I assume most of these GoD trials are being done by people in the same guild together. I would hate to think my guild would not allow me to come along to help with a mob that is unslowable or not let me be apart of getting a flag just because that particular mob does not allow me to assist as much as say a cleric or a wizard.<br />
<br />
Each class to some extint has its own special abilities that allow them to really shine against some mobs and yet be less effective against others. If this was not true there would only need to be 3 or 4 classes.<br />
<br />
When my guild did Vindi my shaman was basically useless. I patched healed yes but we had more than enough of a CH rotation.  I also debuffed and dotted. However when ever we do the named in UP or Griegs alot of times my ability to slow the mob makes the difference. Same with stuns for pallies when the mob is stunnable they really can lower the dps of that mob. If the mob is unstunnable then fine do what dps you can patch heal LoH whatever is needed of you. This is called teamwork. Just because you are not THE MT does not mean you are not a usefull tool in the group/raid.</div></div><hr />

But when most of this thread is about people contesting what you call 'basic knowledge' and can't even come with anything to prove those assumption are true, we can't take your point seriously.<br />
<br />
What a load, I've offered a parse and a post by a dev as proof. No, you want to talk about not having facts to offer, that would be YOU and Callon. See, you offer nothing whatsoever. Pot, Kettle, Black.<br />
<br />
As for having me &quot;define tanking ability&quot;... come on. Did you really need to ask?<br />
<br />
Tanking ability is mitigation and avoidance put together. In combination, they mean how much less damage tank A takes over tank B.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to bother replying to either of you any more unless you come up with something solid like I have, IE a parse. i'm perfectly willing to listen if you actually have something of substance to add. Until then, there's aboslutely no reason for me to continue taking what either of you have to say seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">if that is your definition of tanking ability, then no, you won't end up to 15% or 12.8% I've proven it.

Which is in no way representing the reality of a warrior and paladin with the same quality of gear.  This fact contradict your point.</div></div><hr />

You haven't proven jack, Gurgeh. All you've come up with is theoretical arguements of what &quot;may&quot; be possible in the game. You haven't proven anything as to what the realities are in the game, as to gmaeplay differences or non differences between &quot;real&quot; hybrids and warriors.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you don't understand the difference between theory and reality.<br />
<br />
As for your &quot;all other things being equal&quot;, it stemsfrom your not understanding the difference between theory in reality. Because paladins in reality don't match the theory that the AC is the same, you try to wrongly eliminate differences that in reality exist in AC between warriors and hybrids. Therefore your &quot;proof is invalid in two different ways, both stemming from your lack of understanding of the difference between the two.<br />
<br />
You remind me of exactly why companies don't like to hire kids fresh out of university. They may know how things are supposed to work through book learnring or theory, but they have to be taught all over again the differences that exist in reality. A guy who has work experience already knows this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">It's not how it is supposed to work, it's how it works. When you are asked for fact, you say this bullshit (ie : all this theory is annoying me, I don't understand it). You have STILL not provided any kind of fact that would let us believe that there is indeed 15% difference, except that you think it's &quot;obvious&quot; or &quot;common knowledge&quot;. <br />
<br />
So you don't deny that a knight with same AC / shielding / Avoidance as a warrior will just mitigate 5% less damage than a warrior. <br />
Now your point is since most paladin (well maybe half of them) don't focus only on tanking gear, they should be given BETTER mitigation than warrior in order to stay just close behind warrior.<br />
Could seem fine in theory, but then what ? the best tank will be the paladin with full tank gear, since he will get both benefit of the tank gear and the 'knight mitigation' advantage.<br />
<br />
I fail to see what you want changed and in what way, do you want is both defensive removed AND knight mitigation beeing higher than warrior with the same stuff ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">Not as simple as that Flair, the problem is that melee damage mitigation from defensive and AC come from the same factor, if you limit one you limit the other. Makeing it so warriors and knights will take close to the same damage means that AC will have little effect and avoidance will become the main way to avoid damage makeing monks the premier tanks. <br />
<br />
Actually its even easier AND SIMPLER than all that talk: take the encounter out of the game for everyone.  Replace the current flags with (yet another) corny ass ring event.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">BB, what you're not seeing in your statements that the dev's are the ones that judge whether or not something is too powerful or not, is that the devs are demonstrating in their game design that THEY feel that defensive is too powerful. Design where mobs proc as big of a DD as their melee, for example, is an attempt to make defensive less powerful.<br />
<br />
Remember BB, this isn't so much about making knights tank closer to warriors, as it is about removing an ability that is too powerful (as devs are apparently agreeing with me with their design that attempts to get around defensive), and rebalancing content so that the content still remains challenging. I stated this in my very first post, and I stand by that. It's not &quot;OMGZ paladinz r useless and need defensive or it removed from the game&quot;, it's &quot;defensive is overpowered and it needs to be fixed for the betterment of the game.&quot; If I was really one of those knight sympathizers as you claim, I wouldn't be banned from PoN for disagreeing with their official &quot;party line&quot; of &quot;OMG paladins are teh useless, we need defensiv!&quot;, now, would I?<br />
<br />
I think the only reason why the dev's haven't removed defensive already, is that at this point it's ingrained into the game, and it would be a significant amount of work to change it without screwing up raids, or the warrior class.<br />
<br />
In short... yes, the dev's are the final authority on whether something is too powerful, or how powerful something should be. However, their past and current encounter design is giving every indication that THEY agree with me in this instance, that defensive is overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Reamer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">So In your  example to BB, it Would make sence to have Palidins and shadown Knights able to better midagate those big Ass DD and have mobs that thyey can fight and Have us remain with the  supior ability to take Physcal punishment? =^)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Where do people get this idea that defensive is too powerful and somehow messes up the game balance?  You know that if they really thought defensive is too powerful they could just put in more mobs like Custodian of Righteousness (1300-1400).  And if Evasive is a problem, they can put a mob that hits for exactly 1K and never misses too.<br />
<br />
The game does not need your help to protect itself from imbalances.</div></div><hr />

You were banned because a month ago you took a different stand than you take now.<br />
...their past and current encounter design is giving every indication that THEY agree with me...<br />
GoD was not changed because Defensive is too powerful. It was changed because SoE did not intend Warriors to require two healers to do the content. The content was too hard.<br />
<br />
The fix was not changing DB/DI values to negate Defensive, but rather apparently to manipulate attack so mobs wouldn't hit for max as often. Such a change does not diminish the mitigation provided by Defensive.<br />
<br />
Contrary to another of your assertions, mobs that produce a significant amount of damage through innate procs are a rarity, not a new direction chosen by SoE to diminish Defensive and it's role as a centrally defining Warrior ability.<br />
<br />
I believe wishful thinking has caused you to misrepresent recent design direction and fixes to overly challanging content.<br />
<br />
Even the majority of Paladins don't appear to think Defensive is too powerful, they just want a piece of it. Sure, failing that they would settle for it being removed from the game. It's pretty obvious why either would suffice.<br />
<br />
Afaik, Warriors did not opt for DPS or utility. They opted for being the Pimary Tank. The only dificulty at all is insuring other tanks can get experiance groups (they can), flags (they can), and have a raid role (they do, tanking not-brutal mobs that don't require Defensive, plow tanking yardtrash, and deep utility and versatility).<br />
<br />
IF SoE focused on making Knights as much like Warriors as possible, rather than unique classes that are equally prefered in experiance groups but with different raid roles (Warriors MT brutal mobs that require Defensive, Stonewall, or Evasive) SOME wanabe Warriors with Spellbooks would no doubt be pleased.<br />
<br />
But, I believe enhancing unique (among melees) capabilities makes the game richer, more interesting, and fairer to those who chose their class because the differences meant something every time they logged in. Right now they do.<br />
<br />
I think that's exactly what one developer meant when he said (paraphrasing), 'Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.'<br />
<br />
And what Brenlo meant when he said (paraphrasing) 'Like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Pallies and Shadow Knights.&quot; Not said was the other half of the equation, 'Like it or not, Paladins will always buff, heal, and Res better than Warriors and SK's will always debuff, &quot;snare&quot;, DD, DoT, and HT better than Warriors.<br />
<br />
We are different classes. One of the centrally defining differences is that Warriors have Defensive AND are unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">GoD was not changed because Defensive is too powerful. It was changed because SoE did not intend Warriors to require two healers to do the content. The content was too hard.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
That is true, however that's not in contention here. <br />
<br />
Contrary to another of your assertions, mobs that produce a significant amount of damage through innate procs are a rarity, not a new direction chosen by SoE to diminish Defensive and it's role as a centrally defining Warrior ability.<br />
<br />
But the thing is, BB, that's just the TYPE of thing that they're doing, it's certainly not the only thing that they've done, it's just one of things they've done to try and address the issue. It doesn't stop there... things like Flurry, Rampage, unslowable hard and fast hitting mobs, DD's, big AE damage, high DB +low DI mobs are all things that devs have concieved of as ideas to make content challenging even for a defensive warrior, or the raid that the defensive warrior is supporting.<br />
<br />
Try to look past a specific example, and understand what I am bringing up that specific example as indicative OF. When you take all these things into account, it's not a rarity, but the way almost all encounters are designed.<br />
<br />
I believe wishful thinking has caused you to misrepresent recent design direction and fixes to overly challanging content.<br />
<br />
And I believe that you're not seeing the true picture. I almost certainly cannot prove it by finding the specific quote, but I've seen dev comments at just around the beginning of PoP era, where they've admitted that they have to design and tune encounters specifically taking into account, and for defensive. Then when you look at how they've designed it, they've done many things to try and minimize the power of defensive, which interestingly enough, is exactly what you've stated earlier in this thread.<br />
<br />
Even the majority of Paladins don't appear to think Defensive is too powerful, they just want a piece of it. Sure, failing that they would settle for it being removed from the game. It's pretty obvious why either would suffice.<br />
<br />
Yes, either of them would suffice... sort of. It just wouldn't completely address the issues, if you just give knights partial defensive. But first of all, one's simply not going to happen (a la the dev comment you so love to quote) and secondly, NOT doing the other one IMO would shorten the life expectancy of the game. <br />
<br />
Afaik, Warriors did not opt for DPS or utility. They opted for being the Pimary Tank. The only dificulty at all is insuring other tanks can get experiance groups (they can), flags (they can), and have a raid role (they do, tanking not-brutal mobs that don't require Defensive, plow tanking yardtrash, and deep utility and versatility).<br />
<br />
None of which would change, even with defensive removed from the game, other than warriors gaining some utility. I have this sense I've mentioned this before...<br />
<br />
IF SoE focused on making Knights as much like Warriors as possible, rather than unique classes that are equally prefered in experiance groups but with different raid roles (Warriors MT brutal mobs that require Defensive, Stonewall, or Evasive) SOME wanabe Warriors with Spellbooks would no doubt be pleased.<br />
<br />
Why are you so utterly and completely preoccupied with the warrior vs hybrid issue, even when I tell you this isn't necessarily ABOUT knights vs warriors, but rather how defensive itself is overpowered? Wait, I'll answer my own question... it's because you're pre-occupied from the defense of defensive from what you regard is an attack on it by hybrids.<br />
<br />
But, I believe enhancing unique (among melees) capabilities makes the game richer, more interesting, and fairer to those who chose their class because the differences meant something every time they logged in. Right now they do.<br />
<br />
Yes, but you know what, it could be better. Some differences are too wide, and some are too small. You know, the constant quest for balance that SoE is on.<br />
<br />
That enhancement of unique abilites should happen regardless of whether or not defensive is removed from the game. In fact it can be done in tandem, to give warriors NEW unique abilities which seperate them from the rest.<br />
<br />
I think that's exactly what one developer meant when he said (paraphrasing), 'Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.'<br />
<br />
Well, as you just told me, it doesn't really matter what you think, it's what the developers think that matters. It is, after all, they who decide.<br />
<br />
And what Brenlo meant when he said (paraphrasing) 'Like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Pallies and Shadow Knights.&quot; Not said was the other half of the equation, 'Like it or not, Paladins will always buff, heal, and Res better than Warriors and SK's will always debuff, &quot;snare&quot;, DD, DoT, and HT better than Warriors.<br />
<br />
...and that wasn't said because that wasn't a point that was under contention.<br />
<br />
We are different classes. One of the centrally defining differences is that Warriors have Defensive AND are unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles.<br />
<br />
And if defensive was removed from the game, they would STILL be unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles, and given other differences that seperate them from the other tanks.<br />
<br />
Sorry, you keep trying to pull this &quot;unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles out as your trump card... but you know what, it's old, worn out, and irrelevant in this case. Why? Because as I've said a thousand times, every time you've pulled it out, I've stated, ya know what, they STILL would be unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles. <br />
<br />
You use the defensive ability being a core part of warrior abilities like the fact that they have it is enough reason why they always must have it. That's not a reason to continue to have it. If you can show me a compelling reason why warriors should continue to have it in its current form in the face of it being overpowered, INSTEAD of having content rebalanced, and of top of which they can retain an advantage is it was removed from the game properly, then I'm willing to listen. But basically using the reason that &quot;they have it, so they should continue to have it&quot; is not a real reason at all.<br />
<br />
Enough with the rhetoric, already.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong here. I'm a warrior, I like defensive when going up against a mob. But if I can maintain a significant advantage over hybrids while NOT having it, and having the encounter being not significantly tougher than it is already, then I don't have any real complaints. Just so long as I'm STILL the one taking the beating, I'm STILL the one tanking the named, I'm STILL the one &quot;surviving the most brutal battles&quot; and I'm not being replaced by a hybrid, there's really nothing for me left to complain about, is there?<br />
<br />
And this is what it's all really about. It's about removing defensive but leaving the warriors the undisputed #1 kings of tanking. It's about removing an overpowered game breaking ability but having warriors being undeniably &quot;unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles&quot;.<br />
<br />
So this is the question I pose to you:<br />
<br />
If defensive can be removed from the game, while still keeping the same raid role as MT on the named, maintaining the current difficulty level of the game, and still with warriors remaining &quot;unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles&quot;, what, exactly, is your problem with removing defensive?<br />
<br />
And please, don't give me any rhetoric about &quot;defensive is a warrior defining ability&quot;. If defensive is gone, but warriors still retain the same raid role... a raid role that defensive is by far the single greatest reason for allowing warriors to retain the MT on named mobs, then warriors will STILL be defined by their role, and defensive being gone doesn't even matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">If defensive is removed from the game you'd either be complaining how Knights are better or you'll be complaining about whatever that's put in the game to replace defensive.  There is no substitute for better tanking and Warrior tanks absolutely better than anyone else.  If there's no defensive it'd be something else.  If defensive is too powerful they can tweak the DB.  If evasive is too powerful they can tweak the hit rate.<br />
<br />
If anything raising mobs so that more of them are yellow/red hurts the Knights more than it does before.  Mobs are never yellow/red in Vxed/Tipt for one so they are always stunnable, which is considerable mitigation not to mention on demand.  Sure the mobs are easier to tank now but you also can't stun them anymore, so it's not clear to me whether Paladins come out ahead.<br />
<br />
There's also no particular reason I see why Knights should do better than Warriors versus spells.  We do start with a higher MR after all (which does matter now that a lot of mobs are red.  Red Anueks can snare and even mez people with considerable MR).  Aside from the shield issue (Knights give up almost no DPS to use a shield), the Knight versus Warrior is fine, at least on the high end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">Daemonwynd,<br />
....what, exactly, is your problem with removing defensive?<br />
Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.<br />
<br />
Concidering that:<br />
<br />
1. SoE can determine how effective Defensive is on a per fight basis.<br />
<br />
2. SoE has already demonstrated that Defensive does not unbalance the desireablility of any of the tank classes in normal experiance groups.<br />
<br />
3. Knights themselves aren't for the most part contending that Defensive per se is broken - rather that they want a piece of it or failing that some Knights would like it removed.<br />
<br />
4. The &quot;Tank Parity&quot; clique has suggested, as do you, new class defining abilities for Warriors. On SoE's Warriors boards there are NO suggestions for new Warrior class defining abilities - WE ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT ONES.<br />
<br />
So, why don't you give it a rest. This reminds me soooo much of Frodlin's push for Knight Defensive. The flip side - revoving Defensive from the game is even much LESS likely to happen.<br />
<br />
Remove the central Warrior class defining ability from the game? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
I suspect SoE will give Knights a short duration auto parry or reposte discipline like other hybrids get. No doubt this will be in addition to their FD and DA &quot;escape&quot; abilities. Interestingly enough I also suspect this will not make many of them happy. They're OK with a Warrior being &quot;unmatched&quot; so long as they can match them.<br />
<br />
Phantron,<br />
I suspect SoE did due diligence. Paladins could stun most of the mobs effectively in some zones. Add a Monk with a Staff of Transcendence and there could be a whole lot of stunning going on during the whole fight to the boss mob. Having asked that unfair advantages be narrowed based on having select classes in a group, Paladins may have gotten their wish - in this case fewer MT stunable mobs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.<br />
<br />
..../sigh. And again you start with the rhetoric, taking my question completely out of context so that you can argue it out of context. This isn't looking promising.<br />
<br />
Concidering that:<br />
<br />
1. SoE can determine how effective Defensive is on a per fight basis.<br />
<br />
To some extent. Can they lower it's effectiveness? Yes. Can they make it ineffective? Also true. BUT at that point the warrior switches to evasive, and all that effort is for naught.<br />
<br />
2. SoE has already demonstrated that Defensive does not unbalance the desireablility of any of the tank classes in normal experiance groups.<br />
<br />
Absolutely wrong. Case in point, GoD content, which until very recently nearly required a defensive warrior, if the group wanted a reasonable chance at success, this growing more so true, the higher the single group content is/was.<br />
<br />
3. Knights themselves aren't for the most part contending that Defensive per se is broken - rather that they want a piece of it or failing that some Knights would like it removed.<br />
<br />
Only because defensive has become so ingrained into the game, and many people so used to it, that it's difficult for many people to see it for what it is.<br />
<br />
4. The &quot;Tank Parity&quot; clique has suggested, as do you, new class defining abilities for Warriors. On SoE's Warriors boards there are NO suggestions for new Warrior class defining abilities - WE ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT ONES.<br />
<br />
That is a matter of opinion, and is certainly not fact, much as you might present it as such. Again, you're presenting your opinion as fact.<br />
<br />
So, why don't you give it a rest. This reminds me soooo much of Frodlin's push for Knight Defensive. The flip side - revoving Defensive from the game is even much LESS likely to happen.<br />
<br />
And you're reminding me of Battleblade's push for everything remaining the same as it is.... oh wait...<br />
<br />
Remove the central Warrior class defining ability from the game? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
That's all you can offer to a situation presented where defensive is no longer needed in the game? &quot;I don't think so&quot;??? /shakes head... you're demonstrating yet again how closed minded you are on the entire issue of ANY change made to defensive of ANY kind, for ANY reason.<br />
<br />
It's closed minded people like you that are the very reason why these changes are not very likely to occur, no matter how warranted.<br />
<br />
I suspect SoE will give Knights a short duration auto parry or reposte discipline like other hybrids get. No doubt this will be in addition to their FD and DA &quot;escape&quot; abilities. Interestingly enough I also suspect this will not make many of them happy. They're OK with a Warrior being &quot;unmatched&quot; so long as they can match them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">Daemonwynd,<br />
<br />
I said:<br />
2. SoE has already demonstrated that Defensive does not unbalance the desireablility of any of the tank classes in normal experiance groups.   <br />
You replied:<br />
Absolutely wrong. Case in point, GoD content, which until very recently nearly required a defensive warrior, if the group wanted a reasonable chance at success, this growing more so true, the higher the single group content is/was.<br />
I suppose we'll have to differ on this. Not every group activity is a normal experiance group. To me, a normal experiance qroup is one focused on moving the experiance or AA exp bar as rapidly as possible with the least amount of risk or downtime. Because they are intentionally trivial, LDoN group adventures would be included.<br />
<br />
True, a named mob hunting group wanting to do a BoT tower named a few months into PoP might have a strong preference for a Warrior, but that's always been a factor with tougher new mobs and many old mobs that once took a raid to kill. At the same time Paladins did, when the content was newer, have a preferrence in the KC Basement, CoD, and Miraguls/MM/Guk LDoN. <br />
<br />
Also true, a 6k HP unbuffed Knight will still have trouble finding a PoFire Picnic Table or PoEarth group - the undergeared always have problems finding groups doing harder content.<br />
<br />
But, you would have some difficulty convincing me that a 10.5KHP Knight can't find a high ZEM zone to get exp anywhere in GoD.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the recent changes have diffused the argument that forced 6 person content HAD to be done for flags. Now, a few of the tougher mobs are optional if you want the loot or to complete a quest.<br />
<br />
Mind you, the changes won't be concidered enough - it's never enough. But, I imagine SoE will continue looking at GoD and adjusting where necessary.<br />

<br />
Remember BB, this isn't so much about making knights tank closer to warriors, as it is about removing an ability that is too powerful (as devs are apparently agreeing with me with their design that attempts to get around defensive), and rebalancing content so that the content still remains challenging.<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
Wait need to quote this little gem again:<br />
<br />
the devs are demonstrating in their game design that THEY feel that defensive is too powerful. Design where mobs proc as big of a DD as their melee, for example, is an attempt to make defensive less powerful.<br />
<br />
So the devs must be demonstrating in their game design that THEY feel that nukes are too powerful.  Design where mobs are completely immune to spell damage is an attempt to make nukes less powerful by your logic.<br />
<br />
Wait wait there's more....<br />
<br />
So the devs must be demonstrating in their game design that THEY feel that melee is too powerful.  Design where mobs are completely immune to melee damage is an attempt to make cleaving less powerful by your logic.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm....<br />
<br />
So the devs must be demonstrating in their game design that THEY feel that slow is too powerful.  Design where mobs are completely immune to slow MUST be the devs deciding that slow needs to be removed by your logic.<br />
<br />
/yawn...<br />
<br />
So the devs must be demonstrating in their game design that THEY feel that root and snare are too powerful.  Design where mobs are completely immune to root and snare is an attempt to make root and snare less powerful by your logic.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason that some mobs have a DD as large as their melee, in an attempt to make defensive less effective, IS FOR VARIETY.  NOT because the devs want to get rid of said ability that the mob is immune to.  How fun would it be if every skill worked every time, exactly the same way, on everything in the game?  This is for variety, requiring people to figure out and know their encounters.  It's not some conspiracy to get rid of said ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting theory.<br />
<br />
Now prove it by showing any indication that they would do it for THAT reason instead of the one I'm stating... or even that variety is a primary consideration to designing content that's challenging for and with defensive.<br />
<br />
I think it's just logical to think that the dev's place far more of a priority on creating challenging content to make it so that guilds have to take time to progress, than mere variety. After all, the only time when variety matters in regards to challenging encounters is the very beginning when strategies are being developed.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that they don't do this ALSO for variety, but I think that's far far more of a secondary concern than the concern of making content challenging for the player base. I think that they do multiple things firstly and foremost *to challenge defensive*, knowing that only doing one thing would only slow a guild down so much. That's why they do the variety of things, ALL to challenge defensive, knowing that throwing different things into the mix will slow people down more than just doing one thing over and over. After all, if you know you're always dealing with ONE thing, you get very used to and very good at dealing with it.<br />
<br />
Your post seems to be saying that they do it for variety and variety alone. If that's truly what you're saying, that's just not right.</div></div><hr />

Aye, if it's required for every player to get flaged to progress it absolutely is. This explains why SoE agreed some of this content was too difficult and needed to be changed and some flag encounters are no longer required of every guild member to progress.<br />
<br />
We'll have to disagree about your reasoning behind variety. I think SoE is trying to present different challanges to make the game interesting. Things like the Riddler or the 4 Key Room of Death in Uqua aren't difficult - just attempts to introduce some variety.<br />
<br />
Merely making things difficult is easy. Sometimes SoE does too good a job of that and has to ease up a tad  :).<br />
<br />
Making unique encounters is a bit more challanging. There is a tendancy for every raid to be - we killed 150 yardtrash mobs, got to the named, and kills0red it. Sometimes different is FUN or a real challange to everyone in the raid. Sometimes it's just a pita. I don't think SoE stays up nights saying - Defensive is too powerful. We'll negate it by DTing the MT every 60 seconds. OK, maybe once they thought that, but every encounter is not Pegasus Isle in PoSky.<br />

<br />
Sorry it's 12 point whatever % mitigation, 15% total that you're claiming, Daemon.  Whatever, both numbers are wrong even by the very parse that you linked because, as countless people have pointed out, that parse is NOT comparing similarly geared tanks.  Everyone points that out to you and explains what's wrong with it, and you don't care because it doesn't back up your claims.  You haven't addressed the problems with that parse to anyone's satisfaction but your OWN, but you keep using it like it's proof of everything you're saying.  <br />
<br />
What's even more amusing, is you're so desperate to pick apart what I've said, that you're attepmpting to pick apart points that I've ALREADY ADDRESSED.<br />
<br />
Again because we think your feeble attempt at addressing those points was worthless.  The points stand, though I guess reiterating them to you was a waste of time.

But we dont think youve proven a damn thing either, Daemon.  Again, you are the one wanting a drastic change to the game.  So the burden of proof is on you to justify it.  You have not done so in any sense of the word.  Your parse does more to prove our side than it does yours.  Yet you just go on and on and on, convinced in your righteousness in the face of the idiotic masses.   :rolleyes: <br />
I think you just like to argue.  <br />
<br />
 is that the devs are demonstrating in their game design that THEY feel that defensive is too powerful. Design where mobs proc as big of a DD as their melee, for example, is an attempt to make defensive less powerful. <br />
<br />
Its perfectly normal in game design to make challenges that will circumvent the players usual way of dealing with things.  That helps make the game interesting.  It doesnt mean that a skill is overpowered.  It simply means that sometimes youll need to learn other strategies.  edit: Alisdahre already addressed this point better.  You blew that off too with a ridiculous (paraphrased) &quot;prove they do it for variety!&quot; statement.  Sigh... (sarcasm on) yep, you caught them, Daemon.  Sure they may make the non slowable mobs, the melee immune mobs, the high MR or immune to magic mobs, etc. etc. for variety, but they make mobs that make defensive less effective because it's overpowered!!!  <br />

<br />
See, that's how debate works. I've shown current mob design and abilities as indicative of being done because of and for defensive. That's certainly not the ONLY reason, that's a &quot;well, duh'&quot; kind of situation, but that's certainly the overriding concern. The burden of proof now rests upon you to prove how it is not done for defensive, but only for variety, which is what you appear to be claiming.<br />
<br />
You can either A: Prove how it's not done for defensive by showing how non defensive tanks can do it, or b: prove how it is only done for variety, instead.<br />
<br />
I hold current encounter design in requiring a defensive warrior to tank as self evident that they design encounters for defensive, and not designed merely for variety.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">I beg to differ.<br />
<br />
I knew from the outset that attempting to convince the warrior community was almost a hopeless task. Warriors after all, have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.<br />
<br />
Devs, on the other hand, not having the direct vested interest in keeping things the way they are, and having the necessity of looking at things as what's better for the GAME, and not what's better for a specific class, are far easier to convince than the mostly biased warrior community. In fact, I think that what's by far the biggest reason why the dev's haven't done it already, is fear of facing the outrage from the biased warrior community that wants to keep defensive, no matter what.<br />
<br />
So, your statement of having the community HERE supporting the idea being easier than convincing a dev is, as with most things you say, full of it. You know, using the term &quot;let ALONE the devs&quot; means that the devs would be tougher to convince than warriors.<br />
<br />
Of course, I expect you to come back with a &quot;NUH-UH&quot; on that as well.<br />
<br />
I love your excuse btw for not showing proof as &quot;we don't care to&quot;.

Heh, I've seen it before, and now I'm seeing it again. It's one of the copouts some people use when they've got nothing solid to back themselves up with.<br />
<br />
So... Callon, Gurgeh... prove me wrong. Come up with some proof that backs up your claims. Because if you don't (or can't, same thing) show me anything, it just validates everything I've said all along, that you HAVE nothing.<br />

<br />
Except those parses show that the difference is 5%<br />
Warrior has 15% shielding, 2200 AC, average hit : 223<br />
Paladin has 0% shielding , 2000 AC, averae hit : 255<br />
If you just had shiedling, it's <br />
Warrior 238<br />
Paladin 255<br />
255 / 238 = 1,071, a paladin is taking 7,1% more damage than the warrior. But the warrior has 200 more ac, so it's probably just 5%.<br />
Where are the 15% ?<br />
<br />
The warrior is NOT going to have 15 damage taken off of every hit. <br />
<br />
As shown in this discussion, it works completely differently:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6581<br />
<br />
To summarize, shielding takes 1% off the DB damage. It doesn't affect DI damage at all. A warrior with 14% shielding has stated that his damage reduction is around THREE percent.<br />
<br />
So, recalculating for that alone and removing the shielding advantage altogether (of which, I'll note, warriors will in almost any situation have an significant advantage in having more shielding than the pally, so it's not even really fair to even do THAT), the warrior STILL takes 10.8% less damage with mitigation alone. Let alone better avoidance skills. Hell, it may be as low as 12.5%, but it's certainly not FIVE percent like you claim.<br />
<br />
Nope, like I said, you haven't proven anything. Even your &quot;proof&quot; in picking apart a parse, can itself can be picked apart and shown to not really prove anything at all, except for being highly suspect.</div></div><hr />

Alright, I was right in the application of how shielding works, but wrong in the application for this instance (due to not being aware of this mob's DB)... the warrior WOULD USUALLY not have a flat reduction of 15 points off the total damage taken, and ONLY in this instance with a mob with a DB of close to a 100, is it actually true.<br />
<br />
Therefore, that is only valid for this particular parse, and depending on the DB/DI relation of the mob, the shielding would account for more, or less. Amusingly enough, I'd be right in nearly every other instance, and onlybecause the mob's DB was close to 100, was I wrong. IE if the mob's DB was 50, it would be 7.5 less average damage, and not 15%. Same token, if the DI was higher (which it usually is, Valorian Guards are a low damage mob) shielding would make, again, less of a difference.<br />
<br />
Toss me a link on the source you got the DB info from, please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'm shown something SOLID to prove me wrong, I'll freely admit when I'm wrong. Course, then I learn from it and move on.<br />
<br />
In this case, I was only wrong because this mob was one of the very few that actually has a DB that almost exactly corresponds to a 1 for 1 DPS reduction per shielding mod. Any other situation, I'd have been right.<br />
<br />
See how easy it is when you can actually provide something more than hot air?<br />
<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for that dev post, I'd be seriously reconsidering the size of the warrior tanking advantage.

<br />
I do not dispute the parse results of Brodda, the tables presented are quite accurate. And I find it unlikely he would have miscalculated the DB.<br />
<br />
But if you *do* want another source of the DB, I guess I could head over with my trusty shaman alt and parse it out. Give me a few days to find the spare time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">So, here's the next one. I really doubt I'm wrong with this one, since I went right back to the numbers and recalculated.<br />
<br />
You see, Gurgeh, you can't take the average hit taken and start directly comparing the classes right from there. It just doesn't work that way. <br />
<br />
Removing shielding from the picture altogether, which isn't right but I'll do it anyway, and recalculating average damage taken by that warrior by adding 15 to the average hit and multiplying by the hit percentage, shows an average damage taken of 116.6265.<br />
<br />
Paladin average damage taken is 131.2.<br />
<br />
Dividing 131.2 by 116.6265 equals 1.1249, OR 12.49% better damage taking by the warrior over the paladin, WITH shielding removed.<br />
<br />
Now, we go source #2, the dev post, and the dev states that warrior mitigation is 12.8% better than the hybrids. A POINT THREE percent differential. It doesn't get much closer than that, folks.<br />
<br />
I rest my case. Revising only the 15% number I stated earlier to 12.5%, which I suspected it might be, and have posted on other boards that it's somewhere between 12.5% and 15% better damage taking.<br />
<br />
Start pickin', Gurgeh. Or have I finally gotten through to you, that you are, in fact, wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u175"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p175">You're right I barely even look at what you post. You've shown yourself over and over again to be full of nothing but hot air, and having no credibility because of it.<br />

<br />
Your numbers are correct but your definitions are muddled up.<br />
<br />
Decide what it is you are arguing: is it 'tanking' (personally I don't like a loose term like that) or is it 'mitigation'.<br />
<br />
If the answer is 'mitigation', then the following applies: Warrior takes an average of 238.3 points per hit from the aforementioned mob. Paladin takes 255.1 per hit.<br />
That is exactly how good they mitigate damage.<br />
<br />
If the answer is 'tanking', then the following applies: Warrior takes an average of 116.6 points per swing from the aforementioned mob. Paladin takes 130.4 per swing.<br />
That is exactly how good they tank.<br />
<br />
Mitigation: 238.3/255.1 = 93.4% That's 6.6% lead, 205ac difference.<br />
Tanking: 116.6/130.4 = 89.4% That's 10.6% lead, 205ac difference.<br />
<br />
Tanking &gt; Mitigation because of inherent advantages in defensive skillcaps.<br />

And if you're going to draw gamebalance conclusions from this, I suggest we all buckle down and redo this parse with Equal AC warrior vs. paladin.<br />
I am leaning towards that warrior mitigation advantage over paladin (and thus, also shadowknights) is very close to 5%. The tanking advantage I predict will land somewhere between 8 and 9%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">The tanking advantage I predict will land somewhere between 8 and 9%.<br />
<br />
I've seen between 5 and 12% bantered around.  Just the -1 DI difference alone should give us about a 5% on mitigation.   Still and all, even if it's 12% that's hardly what anyone could cal a HUGE difference.  Significant?  Sure.  Game breakingly huge?  Hardly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">If I hadn't made myself clear previously, I'm referring to the overall tanking advantage, which is made up of both mitigation and avoidance.<br />
<br />
What I'm concerned about here, is how much better warriors tank overall than hybrids, not just how much they mitigate, as mitigation is only half the story.<br />
<br />
Work?<br />
<br />
And one thing here, I belive you did the division wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;better than&quot; paladins means using the hybrid as a reference point. Therefore, you need to take the one you want to compare it to, and divide by the baseline, or the reference point.<br />
<br />
In this case, dividing the comparison by the baseline, you come up with the proper comparison number.... it should always be 1xx.xx. it's the same for any class.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to see how much better a warrior tanks than a, say, druid, I'd divide the warrior damage taken by the druid damage taken, subtract 100%, and you have how much better the warrior is than the druid. What I would NOT do, if I wanted to see how much better the warrior is, is divide the WARRIOR damage by the DRUID damage. That would not give a positive, or &quot;better than x&quot; number.<br />
<br />
Or to put it a different way and just compare numbers, and hopefully that makes it clearer.... If I wanted to see by what percentage 100 is greater than 75, I divide 100 by 75 and come up with (1)33.3%. 33.3% of 75 is 25, and 25+75 = 100, so we find that that statement is true. If we divide 75 by 100, we get 25%. 25% of 75 is 18.75, 18.75 +75 does not equal 100, so that statement that 100 is 25% greater than (better than) 75 is false.<br />
<br />
As always, if I'm wrong (and I'm fairly sure I got it right, it just makes sense to me) any of you folk that are more familiar at math than I am, feel free to step up and show me how I'm wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">Then we're clear. The best answer obtainable to date is 10.6% less damage taken at 205ac advantage, or from knights' perspective 11,8% more damage taken at 205ac disadvantage, out of Brodda's data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">sorry, pulled a fast edit on you. heh<br />

And actually, yeah, it is 11.8. Right math, wrong number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">No, I did not do the division wrong, and here's the reasoning:<br />
<br />
Everyone accepts that the -1DI out of 20 is our hardcoded 5% advantage as a warrior, and it's against this that most stuff is compared. For this 5% to actually be 5% you have to set it up as: 19 possible DI/20 possible DI.<br />
Having it set up your way the DI advantage is 20/19, or 5,3%. Might seem a small difference, but the error is principal. References should always be applied in the same direction.<br />
<br />
There is no 'right' or 'wrong' way about seeing this, you just have to make sure you state up front which way you are taking it. I have no problems with viewing the -1DI as knight classes taking 5,3% more damage per hit, it's just a tad more awkward to remember.<br />
Your basic reasoning is sound however, comparison with something should have the correct baseline. I chose to deviate from that however to show something I believe many miss. 'Better' is such a vague term.<br />
<br />
edit: editted above post to show the difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">I hear what you're saying. <br />
<br />
I added a blurb in that post, what, two back or so, about how your comparisons would work if they were just comparing raw numbers, I think that might help you understand why I belive it's mathematically correct to do it the way I did it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as for your statement about how to treat DI... to all appearances, that's how Brodda Thepp is treating the mitigation change in his parses, as well. He's treating as the 5.3% increase, or &quot;better than&quot;, not the straight 5% that you would use in your math.<br />
<br />
Would be nice to know why he did it that way, and not the other way.... I would have to guess that the different amounts that he's getting hit for only work out that way in the math, and not the other way.<br />
<br />
Or is he doing it thtat way? Ugh, I'm too tired to think. Sleep now. Think later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">The math's fine, I've no problem with it, being decently proficient in it myself, it's just the correlation to 'better' that is up to each individual to decide for himself how to relate to.<br />
<br />
11,8% more damage taken for a knight doesn't mean warriors tank 11,8% 'better', it all depends on the value you put in the word.<br />
Same case for the inverse number, 10.6% less damage taken doesn't imply warriors tank 10.6% 'better' - my point was that I think most people readily accept the latter for the sake of convenience, and makes the much accepted -1DI =5% a valid number.<br />
<br />
I've derailed enough for now, carry on with the opinionated flaming ;) <br />
<br />
Shutting up now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">What you choose to omit Daemonwynd is that with Defensive and any avoidance/mitigation advantages Warriors might have already in the game, SoE provided Warriors with the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change in the Phase 1 Melee Update. Further, disciplines were selectively uncoupled. This update was described as needed to restore balance.<br />
<br />
SoE didn't just arbitrarily do this. Warriors are intended to tank better than SK's and Paladins.<br />
<br />
Later, the narrow innate ~586HP Warrior advantage after AoTC was addressed with a very very expensive Studiness AA ability.<br />
<br />
To conclude SoE described needed improvements made with Defensive in the game somehow establishes a baseline advantages justifying in some perverse way the removal of Defensive is just putting forward another aurgument that flies in the face of established fact.<br />
<br />
Add the argument that SoE can't if they choose make Knight prefered raid boss mobs - another fallacy...<br />
<br />
Add the argument that creative encounter design is attributable to needing to design around Defensive - given numerous creative encounters where Defensive is far from negated, but is pretty much required to succeed....<br />
<br />
Season with other Aborsch-like comments - &quot;Idiots! Defensiv is broken!!&quot;<br />
<br />
And the result is yet another Warrior mistaken for a Paladin on another board. I hope ultimately you will see why. Campaigning for Defensive, a central Warrior class defining ability, to be shared or removed from the game is not ground-breaking insight. It's something regularly done on PoN by posters who's only class balance thought is to tank as closely as possible to Warriors by whatever means.<br />
<br />
There is one way to tank exactly like a Warrior - roll one.<br />

<br />
This frequently gets stated as 5% less per hit as well.  It isn't.  It's about 5% less DI.  The base damage is the same, so the actual percentage depends on how high DI is relative to DB.  I usually say 3-4% average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u186"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p186">So we end up with 10.6% less damage with 200 and some odd more AC on the warrior?  The avoidance plus DI savings on this particular mob are probably around 7% (3-4% from DI advantage, 3-4% from better avoidance), give or take a point, leaving 3.6% to the AC difference and the margin of error in the parse.  We can argue about the AC differences AGAIN and Daemon will still say warriors have higher ACs and the rest of us will still say knights are about the same AC.  I say AC should be equal and that leaves us with about a 7% difference in damage taken on this mob.  That difference will be less on mobs with a higher DB relative to DI and more on mobs that are the opposite.  I don't know if this mob is about average for a DB to DI ratio or not.  <br />
<br />
7%... hell of a lot closer to 5 than the fabled 15%.<br />
<br />
See, that's how debate works. I've shown current mob design and abilities as indicative of being done because of and for defensive. That's certainly not the ONLY reason, that's a &quot;well, duh'&quot; kind of situation, but that's certainly the overriding concern. The burden of proof now rests upon you to prove how it is not done for defensive, but only for variety, which is what you appear to be claiming.<br />
<br />
That's what you don't get, Daemon.   I'll say it slowly for you.  You... have.... shown..... nothing.  Any &quot;proof&quot; you tried to show was thoroughly refuted.  Yet you sit there and babble on about how no one else can prove you wrong, everyone else is a blowhard, blah blah blah.  You're a broken record and the music sucked the first time around.<br />
<br />
I hold current encounter design in requiring a defensive warrior to tank as self evident that they design encounters for defensive, and not designed merely for variety.<br />
<br />
They design encounters for a lot of skills and in some cases to make those skills less effective.  This has already been stated repeatedly by people.  Again you just refuse to accept it.  You sit there and spout off more nonsense about &quot;prove it wasn't done because of defensive!&quot;.  One example... OMG... some mobs practically require they be slowed to beat them!  Some mobs mitigate slow or are unslowable to make this skill less effective!  So remove slow!  <br />
<br />
Callon: I briefly skimmed your post. You bring in no evidence or anything solid in that post, as per usual, so as I've stated previously.... it's not going to be responded to. Your inability to even bring ANYTHING that backs up what you're saying to the table shows that for all your blustering, you're nothing but a windbag.<br />
<br />
Why should I repeat the things others already said that shows your beloved parse does NOT prove what you keep claiming it does?  Again, you just refuse to accept it.  You bring nothing more to the debate with every post, but you feel fine in accusing everyone else of being the &quot;windbag&quot; or &quot;blowhard&quot;.  <br />
<br />
After all, with all your blustering, you'd think that you'd be able to come up with SOMETHING... but no. All you can come up with is more hot air, and not a single shred of anything that lends you the least amount of credibility.<br />
<br />
You've been driving this thread for 13 pages and you've still come up with nothing credible.  Myself and from the looks of things most of the others here put your credibility rating at about 0 on a scale of 1 to 10.  But hey, feel free to keep saying we're all blowhards, not credible, etc.  It seems to make you feel better for some reason.  How about you get over yourself?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u187"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p187">200 more AC for a warrior over a paladin is way too much. I could concede an average 50 less AC, taking into account AotC, that's for the couple less AC on elem / qvic armor set, and on 1 or 2 items for focuses purposes. But 205 AC is way too much to be fair comparison. Unfortunately effect of AC is much harder to predict than shielding. I think my calculation is not 'too' far away of the reality though.<br />
<br />
If you want to seriously discuss number some assumption need to be made :<br />
1)How does paladin AC scale with warrior AC (assuming same level of gear)<br />
2)How does AC affect mitigation.<br />
<br />
I'm reposting calculation I made at the begining of the thread :<br />
<br />
Let's do some math again :<br />
The Shadow Knight has 1861 AC, avg hit : 268<br />
The Paladin has 2066 AA, avg hit : 255<br />
The Warrior has 2271 AC, avg hit : 238<br />
<br />
Let's make the assumption that the effect of AC is linear (it's wrong, but if the difference are small enough, it's a fairly good estimation). Shadow Knight and Paladin are on the same mitigation table, and Warrior are not.<br />
By increasing AC of 205, the knight reduce DPS by 4,8%<br />
So a knight with 2271 AC would get hit for an average of 255*0.952 = ... 242 !<br />
Therefore the mitigation difference between warrior and knight is statisticaly insignificant.<br />
<br />
Why is this ? why don't we even find the supposed 5% coming from the neg 1 DI ?<br />
We'd need the distribution of the hit, but we have an idea with an estimation :<br />
The Warrior is hit for 238 in average, DB is 102, DI is 21 , therefore the average x in dmg = DB * xDI is x=6,5 so the average 'gain' of the 5% is less than 7 damage.<br />
So the actual difference between warrior and knight in this set of parses is roughly : <br />
7/238 = 2.9%<br />
<br />
<br />
If you make the assumption of 50 less AC you obtain :<br />
Paladin take 245<br />
Warrior take 238<br />
Paladin is taking 3.2% more damage per hit than a warrior in average.<br />
 <br />
Damage per swing : <br />
Paladin take 245*51.1/100 = 125.6<br />
Warrior take 238 * 48.9 /100= 116.4<br />
<br />
Warrior is getting 10,7% less damage per swing in average, assuming the same shielding and 205 less AC<br />
<br />
Warrior is getting 7.3% less damage per swing in average, assuming the same shielding and 50 less AC<br />
<br />
Warrior is getting 5.7% less damage per swing in average, assuming the same shielding and same AC</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not making that conclusion. Hence the increase in miotigation and avoidance, as well as giving warriors other abilities in other areas, PLUS the content rebalancing, which would be needed to make the change fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">I knew the both of you would start brining in the AC, like that's going to take it from the 12.5% I claim, all the way down to the 5% that you claim, and that paladins really do have AC that's extremely close to warriors, so that the AC advantage should be nullified.<br />
<br />
No way.<br />
<br />
I went to several random servers on EQRankings. I did some fast and dirty math and added up the top warriors and the top paladins for AC. And you know what I found? Not the &quot;AC equality&quot; that you claim and fail to prove. Far from it. In fact, I'm going to go ahead and prove the both of you wrong right here and now.<br />
<br />
I didn't pick these guilds as guilds that supported my contention... I was completely random on what server I took. <br />
<br />
Silent Redemption:<br />
<br />
Warriors: avg 2196AC<br />
Paladins: 1981<br />
<br />
Difference: 215AC<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's look at what looks to be the top guild on say, Karana. Fama Volat.<br />
<br />
Warriors: 2252AC<br />
Paladins:1931<br />
<br />
Difference: 321AC<br />
<br />
<br />
How about Bert's Phantom Raiders?<br />
<br />
Warriors: 2221AC<br />
Paladin: 2095<br />
<br />
Difference: 126AC<br />
<br />
<br />
Explicit on Quellious:<br />
<br />
Warriors: 2319AC<br />
Paladins: 2019.6AC<br />
<br />
Difference: 300AC<br />
<br />
Average advantage of AC the warrior has over a paladin? 240AC. And how big is the advantage in the parse? Exactly.<br />
<br />
Do you REALLY need me to go on and provide further proof?<br />
<br />
EVERY SINGLE server I saw supported the AC gap. It's NOT 50 points at the level of the game that this parse is at, as you like to claim. In fact the difference can be often LARGER than what's in the parse, while only being rarely smaller.<br />
<br />
This is what happens when you make assumptions stemming from arbitrary claims, without a single shred of anything solid to base it on... and you know what? thse SOLID nuimbers that I've shown you for the AC advantage existing, backs up the parse, and the parse and the dev post BOTH back each other up.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I've provided nothing solid at all. /rolls eyes... so if *I* haven't shown anything solid... what have you two provided? Right... the hot air I've mentioned.<br />

I am going to take your advice and give it up. It's like arguing with Taragor.<br />
<br />
I too have done a survey and discovered Paladins CAN, especially with buffs, achieve virually identical AC to Warirors.<br />
<br />
You chose to spot check and see what you believe typical AC values are and found a greater gap.<br />
<br />
I did a spot check during the Knight Defensive debate and discovered Paladins were generaly geared much much worse than warriors at the high end.<br />
<br />
With Warriors focusing entirely on being the Best Tank Possible, there are literally hundreds of 12k HP Warriors.<br />
<br />
With 10.6K HP's equally obtainable by Knights (40HP and 20,20,20 augs in every possible slot, PoTime gear, etc.) there are MANY fewer well equipped Knights.<br />
<br />
I don't know if Knights got sooooo used to riding their spellbook and having superior aggro control that they generally don't make as much effort to gearup or what is happening.<br />
<br />
BUT, they CAN tank very nearly as well as Warriors (when not under Defensive) IF they are geared up AND in addition to tanking very nearly like Warriors, they have SPELLBOOKS.<br />
<br />
You have merely proven many of them don't make that effort. Not, mind you that it really matters. All Tanks can get normal experiance groups and.......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">Thing is, BB. It's not &quot;worse geared&quot;, what it is is simply different itemization choices.<br />
<br />
Warriors, monks, etc can concentrate purely on their tanking side. shielding, avoidance, +atk, HP, AC. Because of focusing on less, they can acheive higher numbers with those fewer considerations.<br />
<br />
Paladins, SK's, make choices to support their casting side as well. This is to some extent true even with the &quot;knightemization&quot; phenomenon. They have to worry about healing focii, mana pres focii, DD focii, shielding, avoidance, atk, HP, AC, mana. Because they have to consider ALL of these things, they won't get as high in numbers in the tanking side as warriors will.<br />
<br />
Are there fewer well equipped knights? Yep. But there are also fewer knights period, too. At least, going by EQRankings, which isn't exactly reliable to judge numbers of a class with.<br />
<br />
I'm not spinning anything, or at least I don't think I am. I'm just merely stating what exists.<br />

Because they have to consider ALL of these things, they won't get as high in numbers in the tanking side as warriors will.<br />
The most important focus effect appears on the Paladin PoTime BP - in this case no huge compromise is necessary. They do not HAVE to concider all these things - they choose to concider them. They result is they are less of a pure tank than possible - a logical result if you are a HYBRID.<br />
<br />
I could choose to maximize my DPS and utility, the result would not necessarily be the best tank possible.<br />
<br />
FT is not necessarily a logical reason for a tank to sacrifice Tanking ability - Mana Preservation may be reasonable for a priest to make but not a Tank.<br />
<br />
From rolling your character on forward the choice is Tank or Caster. CHOOSING to be a hybrid and have spells IS choosing to be less of a Tank. How much more less than the base differences is up to the individual player and their ability to acquire equipment.<br />
<br />
However, electing to be less of a Tank than possible should be a choice. The concequences of choosing a DD focus effect or FT instead of AC/HP/shielding should not be removed by narrowing the gap between Warrriors and Knights. Wanna be a Tank? Dress like one.<br />

<br />
Because it seems nearly all hybirds made the choice to do this, the fact that the choice is open isn't really relevant to the validity of the AC advantage that is nearly always found by warriors over knights. Because it's about what IS happening, not what could possibly happen if they decided to do this or that.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that it's possible for paladins to get close. Far from it. What I AM saying is that while it's possible in theory, the reality is that that rarely happens. And that's what i'm concerned about. What IS happening, not what COULD happen.<br />
<br />
I did not mention FT in my examples, but it is something that hybrids, again, choose to take. As backup, I'll cite how the top paladins for example on many servers are either close to, at, or even exceeding the FT cap.<br />
<br />
Same thing for mana pres. Many top knights have mana pres as well.<br />
<br />
Take it however you will, but the fact that many top knights have both FT and some form of mana pres, even though you say it's not a reasonable choice to make, really speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
And sorry, Gurgeh, much as you'd love me to have been doing, I'm NOT making up the numbers. Instead of jumping the gun and immediately start to scream about how I'm making stuff up, you could actually take a minute and see that this 1931 AC isn't stating the AC of a SPECIFIC paladin, it's an AVERAGE of the top paladins in that guild. That's why I said *AVERAGE*.<br />

Um. No.<br />
<br />
To make an average, you take the top players of one, ADD them all up, and divide by the number of players. <br />
<br />
See, with averages, especially the more people you bring into it, the closer the number approaches reality, and the smaller the margin of error is. In this case, the margin of error would have to be HUGE for your claim to be true. And even with THIS sample size, the chance that the margin of error really is that big is miniscule. Of course, with your debating style, nothing is too small for you to nitpick, you'll exploit even a tiny chance and make a big deal out of it.<br />

I mean, really, do you have to stretch THAT far while you pick apart any post I make? You know what, lots of guilds DO NOT gear up the MT first, they gear up the people who have contributed the most, especially in the DKP system. And to that I also say... who cares? The fact is that that's just the way it is, warriors DO have that advantage, and it's NOT the 50 points you claimed, proving you wrong again.<br />
<br />
To put this all in perspective, you're picking apart my proof that the warrior AC advantage exists, so that you can change the approximately 3% difference that it makes on the 11.8-12.8% advantage that I have proven through parses, math, and two sources that each back the other up, by ONE OR TWO percent. Because that's how you operate. You offer nothing yourself, you just pick apart and attack the validity of any argument you're shown.<br />
<br />
Buddy, even IF the AC advantage didn't exist, you would never get near the 5% that I believe you claim to have &quot;proved&quot; through attempting to pick apart proof that I have offered, without offering a shred of solid evidence of your own. LET ALONE the AC based difference of 3% that you're attempting to pick apart to try and to change THAT by what would probably be a whole one percent. At this point, even if you DID succeed in picking that apart enough, you're STILL not going to get anwhere near where you claim it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u198"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p198">I still don't understand how you made your average. You took ALL paladin and ALL warrior of a guild ? <br />
<br />
But anyway the point is that a paladin can achieve the same AC as a warrior by spending the same dkp as a warrior, there is no AC disadvantage in being a paladin. Some choise to drop AC to get more utility and should not tank as well as paladin who choosed to go full tank gear. <br />
<br />
This is VERY different from 15% innate difference. Innate is independant of the gear, and with the same gear innate difference is 5%. <br />
<br />
Again paladin have lower AC, not because PAL items have lower AC, but because they CHOOSE to go for 'more utility, less tankability' path. It's far from being all paladin. A good deal of them are going for the full warrior like gear, and make no focuses compromise, these are DAMN close of warrior mitigation, are MUCH better tank than warrior without defensive, and situationnaly better than warrior with defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u199"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p199">there is no AC disadvantage in being a paladin<br />
<br />
Just goes to show ya, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.<br />
<br />
There's no AC disadvantage in being a Paladin, yes. And by that I mean, it IS possible to gain the AC of a warrior. That goes without saying. That's theory.<br />
<br />
In practice, your average Paladin IS, however, going to have a disadvantage compared to a warrior in AC. This is because of itemization choices. And this is what I've shown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">Daemonwynd stated:<br />
The thing is, BB, most hybrids appear to have made the choice to not concentrate wholly on their tanking side.<br />
And the consequence is less tanking capaility.<br />
<br />
It's entirely consistant with their descision to accept less tanking ability for a chance to cast spells when they rolled their character.<br />
<br />
Having made that initial choice, confirmed it consistantly with subsequent equipment choices, they are not entitled to either a magic pill to amilorate the negative aspects of that choice while maintaining the benefits, nor to see the Warrior tanking advantages  gained as a result of eschewing a spellbook diminished.<br />
<br />
PoTime has shown that equipment is suffiecient to close the Warrior/Knight tanking gap and allow Knights to MT raid boss mobs previously beyond their capabilities. Knights can overcome Warrior tanking advantages with equipment; except apparently in 1 group content vs. high DI mobs - a situation SoE has fixed where it deemed necessary. In one group tanking where Defensive is not used Knights CAN (with superior equipment) overcome Warrior raning advantages and tank like Warriors while having spellbooks. Thus, the real differences between Knights and Warriors is that they have spellbooks and we have somewhat better tanking ability and Defensive.<br />
<br />
They (and we) made a tradeoff - a choice.<br />
<br />
I am not talking about the thoretical - but about what is, should be, and will continue to be. The title of this thread, Removing Defensive, alone is sufficient to illustrate which little pig built a house of sticks glued together with conjecture.<br />
<br />
Defensive (Evasive and Stonewall) are Warrior class defining abilities that will not be shared. Since they define the Warrior class and provide it's reason to exist, they will not be removed.<br />
<br />
Choosing to be less of a tank at character creation and then chosing equipment that does not maximize your ability to tank leads to diminished tanking abiltity.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">...and again, you concentrate on OMG it's a knight tanking better! This cannot happen! Your obsession and singlemindedness about turning everything into a knight defensive debate is unnerving.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat this, one last time.<br />
<br />
This is not ABOUT improving knights. This is about getting rid of an overpowering ability, while still maintaining the truism that warriors are the best tank in the game, period.<br />
<br />
Warriors CAN &quot;survive the most brutal battles&quot; and remain the premiere tank of the game without requring defensive. It all depends on proper implementation.<br />
<br />
You hold on to the concept of defensive so desperately, you'd think that defensive is the only reason that warriors are the premiere tank in the game... that is not and should never be the case. If it IS the case, than that says in and of itself how defensive is either overpowered, or the rest of warrior abilities are underpowered.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, as long as I'm still the better tank than the Paladin to the point where if I'm fighting named, they nearly always take me over a given Paladin, I don't particularly care about exactly how well the Paladin tanks compared to me... you shouldn't either. As long as our spot as the undisputed best tank in the game isn't threatened, as long as our role remains the same, as long as we have an unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles, who really cares? On the other side of the coin, if hybrids start threatening our role, THAT is a problem which should be fixed.</div></div><hr />

Pal 3 : 40 AC from Augments : 1980 (Going for Polyvalence not AC)<br />
Pal 4 : 70 AC from Augments : 2126 (OldTimer AC whore, Uses a shield)<br />

Ferubi : 2 x 15ac<br />
KoD Taz : 2 x 20 ac<br />
Yxxta  : 20 &amp; 30 ac<br />
<br />
You do realise there is a 50+30+40+50 = 170 , thats 255 AC point difference<br />
between a zero augment and a fully augmented Tank ?<br />
<br />
War 1 , has 120 more AC compared to War 4 just because of the augments....<br />
Pal 4 is an AC whore, While Pal 3 is looking for Polyvalence.<br />
<br />
I'll let you work with avg / mean / variances etc etc.<br />
<br />
Just because you pick the Top 3 of the category doesnt mean you will get a good picture.<br />
<br />
Not to mention you also forget individual Items ...<br />
<br />
I lost 27 AC points On Magelo going for Quarm Cloack instead of Phase3.<br />
(And no fucking way 50/165 is better than  32/210 4% Shielding)<br />
<br />
Etc Etc.<br />
<br />
With EXACTLY EQUAL Time+ GEAR (That depends 99% on HC level).<br />
A paladin will probably be within 50AC of A Warrior (if both use 2H).<br />
If the paladin uses a shield he should go on top.<br />
<br />
Here i'll even do a fake magelo for you :<br />
<br />
Now of course .. Paladins dont need procs do agro do they ?<br />
So lets drop the TZ ring for CT one.<br />
And since they dont need procs, they grab VZ Range.<br />

Take out the 3 4 Raex/Tryan armor pieces.. <br />

Even with AoTC, that's not a 50pt difference... even with over half the pallies using shields.<br />

On the contrary, thats the shows the sheer stupidity of what you are doing. Because :<br />
<br />
1) A 100% Tanking Paladin will GEAR up like a 100% Warrior<br />
2) At Time++ Lvl ,  There is absolutely no need to make itemisation Choices.<br />
3) In the End , we will have ALL/ALL Or Very Very Very Very similar gear.<br />
<br />

He only lacks some FT (and thats easy, drop a 20hp/mana grab a FT3 KT Augment).<br />

Same things happen for warriors as well as paladins, so it all works out. Your points are exactly why it's best to use averages.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The 2 Paladins Tanking Oriented have an AVG ac of 2105<br />
<br />
And your top two AC warriors have an average AC of 2285 or so. Advantage maintained at 170, NOT the 50 you claim. I think YOU are the one that's looking at numbers that best suit you.<br />
<br />
ON AVERAGE... and we're talking ON AVERAGE here because we're looking at how things will be overall, not just for a subset of a given class, that advantage will exist. Why are we looking on average? Because you have to look at the big picture, the average, when talking about balance. You can't just concentrate on the subsets.<br />
<br />
And let me ask you this. If there's &quot;no need&quot; to make itemization choices, why do top paladins typically have less shielding? If they didn't need to make their choice, they could have their cake and eat it too by having just as much shielding as a warrior. Instead, nearly all Time Paladins will have less shielding than the warriors.<br />
<br />

Not Paladins that gear up as Clerics or Hybrids.<br />
<br />
No, you HAVE to look overall. If you don't, you're painting a false picture of reality. We HAVE to look at how the paladin class on average will take compared to the warrior on average, otherwise we come back with biased data.<br />
<br />
We do have more AC, but its Not 100 or 150. Its 50ish.<br />
<br />
Nope, in fact I've proven with your own numbers, and with numbers from other guilds, that it IS in fact somewhere between 150-200 on average.<br />
<br />
Consider:<br />
<br />
TopAC warriors and paladins<br />
<br />
#1 warrior - paladin = advantage and so forth<br />
<br />
2312-2126=186<br />
2260-2084=176<br />
2177-1980=197<br />
2144-1971=206<br />
2137-1927=210<br />
<br />
Average advantage, matching each top paladin with the top knight AC: 197AC warrior advantage. &lt;going this route, which, incidentally, I could have gone with first had I really wanted to bring up numbers that I wanted to see as you claim I do&gt;<br />
<br />
And, as I've said, it's backed up by the other random guilds I chose on other servers.<br />

Proven wrong. See my above math where I prove with YOUR own data that there isn't a SINGLE situation where that isn't the case. ANY way I do the averages, and every time I compare your paladins directly with your warriors, the advantage exists every single time, and there isn't ONE case where it comes up to the 50 you claim, or even ANY double digit number at all.<br />

Back you come with your made up profile. I do not accept made up profiles, nor do I make up any of my own. I will only accept REAL IN GAME profiles, as making stuff up as proof ois no proof at all, it's just made up.<br />
<br />
I could do the very same thing that you folk are doing, and only create profiles for a warrior that's an AC bitz and claim that that's what should be used. I could only use warrior profiles that have the highest AC for those warriors that focus ONLY on tanking to the exclusion of aggro, atk, or DPS. I could say that the only ones that matter are the ones that focus on tanking solely, to the exclusion of HP, ATK, DPS, and things such as combat effects. By doing this, I could arrive at an artifically inflated AC advantage. But I don't. I look at them OVERALL, because overall is what matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u216"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p216">Of course knights will seem lower AC if you lump &quot;all types&quot; of knights together, compared to the &quot;only&quot; type of warrior there is.  Warriors tend to work on AC/HPs only, well, cause that's all they really got to work towards.  Knights on the other hand have a number of choices.  It's not all AC/HPs for them unless they purposely want to try to match a warrior.  They've got caster-oriented gear that they can choose to wear as well.<br />
<br />
Looking at warrior Magelo's it's fairly safe to say that they're all going for max AC/HPs.  You can't say that about SKs and paladins though.  Some might be going for max AC/HPs, while others may be going for max mana and mana regen, while yet others are going for a good mix of the two.  All of those knights that aren't purposely going for AC/HPs like every warrior is, can't be used as a comparison of AC/HPs vs. warrior AC/HPs.  The only way that your &quot;averages&quot; will make any sense is if you cut all knights that didn't go &quot;strictly&quot; for AC/HPs out of your average. The inclusion of knights whom have opted for a few caster items here and there have tainted your averages.  If you're gonna do a study, it needs to be a controlled study.  You're artificially lower the average by including test subjects that shouldn't be in the test.<br />
<br />
What you're doing here is the equivalent of trying to come up with a list of the top AC'd bards, but throwing a bunch of the bards who have their solo gear on into the mix just to lower the average.  Of course the bards who are soloing are going to have much lower AC than the group oriented bards.  Soloing bards are enhanced for CHA gear and the expectation that they're never gonna get hit.  They forgo AC and HPs for gear that will help them kite and charm mobs to death.  Those bards can't be included in an average of the top AC'd bards, because they're not even trying for AC.  Adding them does nothing but taint your results by artificially lowering the average.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2- YOU DONT NEED TO REALLY SACRIFICE HP/AC TO BE A HYBRID<br />
<br />
Thus, if you are a hybrid, and are 300ac points behind a warrior..<br />
Its not because EQ is fucked up or hybrids have less ac.<br />
Its because you are doing something WRONG.<br />
<br />
It's not your fault that Time level Paladins choose to itemizate differently than how you would have them itemize. It's not your fault that because they do, they're not as good in the AC department as you would have them all be.<br />
<br />
They're only Time Paladins, it's not like they know what they're doing, or anything.<br />
<br />
Don't fight with ME about their itemization choices, I'm only reporting what THEY are doing. Go fight with THEM about it.<br />
<br />
If you want to start a crusade to make all Paladins gear up just like a warrior, go fight with them over PoN. Likely as not, they'll tell you what they've told other people... because they're a hybrid class, they don't have to support just their tanking side, they have to support their CASTING side. Hence the bitching about having to get more AA than a warrior to pull their class power up.<br />
<br />
If you choose to ignore RAW NUMBERS that put the lie to your claims, then there's nothing I can do. As it stands, EVERY comparison I've made has supported my position and put the lie to yours. There isn't a SINGLE comparison from a SINGLE Paladin comparing to a SINGLE warrior at the same level that I've seen yet that backs you up. Not ONE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">I could say that the only ones that matter are the ones that focus on tanking solely, to the exclusion of HP, ATK, DPS, and things such as combat effects. By doing this, I could arrive at an artifically inflated AC advantage. But I don't.<br />
<br />
But that's exactly what you did.  You can't include knights that didn't go soley for tanking in a study when compaired to warriors who's only option is tanking.<br />
<br />
It's a trade off.  Flowing Thought, INT, regen, etc, or more AC/HPs.  You're not gonna find equipment that has both the best AC/HPs AND the best flowing thought, insert whatever else caster effects you might want.  That would create the ultimate class.  Verant said when they created this game that there would be no tank mage classes.  Everything is to be balanced.  You want to increase one area, you'll be taking away from another.  SOE I'm sure has adopted this same philosophy.<br />
<br />
You've got to realize that if you up the power of knights because of certain cases where they might lack power, that that power increase is across the board.  Knights who consentrated a lot on their casting abilities will become much more prefered over warriors if their tanking abilities are almost the same.  At the same time, that same power increase is gonna turn those knights that consentrated soley on tanking equipment into tanking gods.  FAR greater than any warrior.<br />
<br />
You can't use an average in this case, because the samples are all over the board for knights, where as warriors are a pretty straight line.  If you up the average knight up to near warrior standards, all of those knights that were above average are WAY overpowered now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">but there IS an option.<br />
<br />
I know some warriors that are HP whores. Their AC is lower.<br />
<br />
I know some warriors that are shielding/avoidance etc whores. THEIR AC is lower.<br />
<br />
I know some warriors that are DPS/combat effects/vengeance etc whores. THEIR AC is lower.<br />
<br />
Yes, knights have more options. Yes, it'll be closer in the tanking department for warriors than for paladins. But I can pull the same thing as you folk are doing and say only the AC whore tanks matter. But I don't, because the fact is, they ALL matter. Because it's only when you look at averages do you find the true picture.]<br />
<br />
I'd love to see the average time geared, balance geared paladin's reaction to a statement that their gear doesn't matter for comparison purposes, only the tanking specialist paladins do.</div></div><hr />

Its not true.<br />
<br />
I have 1700hp 260ac 13% More shielding that our most casual warrior.<br />
Why ? Because i play more, I raid more , and i Min/Max.<br />

A paladin going the same route as me, could still be a perfect hybrid.<br />
And have the SAME AC, SAME SHIELDING, ALL FOCUSES, AND FT9.<br />

These Paladins exist.<br />
We dont have a &quot;hardcore monster tanking paladin&quot; in my guild.<br />
If we did, he would have almost the same equipement as me.<br />

Then the tank paladin will tank better than the warrior, then you'll need to nerf the tank paladin, to put him 10% behind the average warrior, and then what ? the average paladin will be so far behind the warrior in ANY situation that no one will ever want a paladin to tank anything.<br />

Defensive allow warrior to be situationnaly better than knight, but it's just situationnaly it's a very easy way to balance and insure everyone will have something to do.</div></div><hr />

Think about it for a moment,  they are part tank, part cleric, supposedly 75% 25%, whereas its no where near that. <br />
<br />
Right now, the difference between a non defensive war, and a non defensive paladin is near to nill,  and the hitpoint difference of roughly 1000 hp is not enough to make a difference in EP groups, not enough to make a difference in low end GoD (tips, Sewers, ect.)<br />
<br />
Paladins want to shine on named mobs, in single group, and raid situation, thats not the ROLE of the class.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, its not.<br />

Again, you make a BS claim, this time about what *I've* claimed.<br />
Go back and read my original post, there you will find that I've CLEARLY stated additional bonuses in mitigation and avoidance would have to be implemented to justify the removal of defensive, plus a few other more minor changes.<br />
<br />
In other words, I am not attempting to claim that because this advantage exists, IT ALONE justifies the removal of defensive.<br />

Just another example of the BS you like to claim.... and you think people find *MY* posts ridiculous. You're the one who so stridenly claimed to have &quot;proved&quot; that there was only a 5% difference, and was shown to be completely full of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u228"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p228">The problem Daemonwynd is that is a great deal you don't understand.<br />
<br />
SoE does not identify ANY class as a Tank, it's a player convention that has become part of common parlance. When player use the term Tank, they mean the Warrior Class Description:<br />
When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Paladins are described as &quot;primarily melee&quot; in their description. A warrior-based class that fights &quot;toe to toe&quot;.<br />
<br />
But Warriors aren't the only tank, just the 100% embodied defintion of one. Who else is a tank? &quot;Primarily&quot; or 100% melee? Noper, Monks aren't tanks, yet they are melee. Plate wearers? Noper, Clerics wear plate.<br />
<br />
Classes with a taunt button!!! OMG! Rangers are tanks!!<br />
<br />
Why are Knights then so adament that Rangers should not be group MT's or add tanks in raids? Territory sir, territory. The only two justificaions are:<br />
<br />
1. Rangers wear chain.<br />
Chain wearing is just a self-serving position. I've worn chain, Knights have worn chain, Chain doesn't rob you of the abilty to tank. Knights say Plate Tanks to keep Rangers out in the cold.<br />
<br />
Clerics are described in their class description as &quot;primarily a magic-using class&quot;. Doh, that must mean they are secondarily a melee class - a prieset/Plate Melee omg!! But Paladins have consistantly fought like tigers to prevent Clerics from producing reasonable melee damage, despite the fact Clerics are described as having the &quot;ability to wear plate armor and wield blunt weapons.&quot; Territory sir, territory.<br />
<br />
2. Rangers do damage at a distance.<br />
Rut Roh, so do SK's with spells. Even more telling, so do Warriors with bows. We are not talking about insignificant damage either. Vs. Finien Ro with high quality arrows, an elemental bow, a Hawkeye potion, etc. I've done very appreciable damage at range compared to Paladins or Shadow Knights.<br />
<br />
Nope, damage at a distance is just an excuse. Paladins are just as defined by their priestly casting and SK's by necro casting as Rangers are with thier DPS at a distance. None of these thing are Tank-like.<br />
<br />
The truth is having watched Warriors MT virtually every raid boss mob and difficult add from Kunark to the present time, Knights are pretending that's their role too.<br />
<br />
Having secondary skills MUCH more powerful than Rangers, Paladins in particular aren't satisfied with being the #2 tank. They don't want Rangers to be concidered tanks at all. A class that is obviously a greater percentage priest than Rangers doen't want them to tank!<br />
<br />
Failing to obtain Defensive, a Warrior class defining ability, some Knights are now pressing to see it removed.<br />
<br />
It's all about Territory. Not being satisfied with being the #1 Warrior/priest, some Paladins argue that Knights and Warriors should be co-equal (forget Ranger, their taunt button isn't supposed to exist) - they demand &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (and spellbook superiority).<br />
<br />
So, absolutely not. Warriors are defined by Defensive - let Knights play their class and find another way to become more powerful in the game. Holding down Rangers and trying to erode Warrior class defining abilities is not going to be acceptable. Not by the #1 HP buffer in the game, a 90% resser, the #4 healer in the game even including non-melees.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure, SoE will not do that to Warriors. I'm not talking about mitigation and avoidence adjustments or other &quot;compmpensation&quot; here. I'm talking Class Description, the Warrior Class Defining Ability, and the Warrior Role. So long as Defensive is in the game, unshared, and is meaningful, Warriors are the Primary Tank - Knights know this.<br />
<br />
They choose being part caster. We choose being 100% Tanks. They do have equal acceptablilty in normal experiance groups and a raid role. They just like our ability to tank and want to be just as close to it as posible.<br />
<br />
PURE classes are suppose to have dominence in their defining abilities:<br />
....warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.<br />
<br />
While other priest classes have healing spells, no one can match up with the power and efficiency of clerical healing.<br />

Will you QUIT with the obsession of trying to turn this into a paladin hunger for more power issue? How many times hav eI told you it's not ABOUT that... do you have selective hearing or what?<br />
<br />
Your posts have become so predictable, I can just about guarantee you're either going to trot out the warrior class description, and/or the dev comment about defensive not being shared, EVERY SINGLE POST. ENOUGH already.<br />
<br />
It's getting so old, so repetitive, I almost don't even bother to read your posts any more, as I can guess what it's going to say without even reading it, and I'll be right more often than not.... it'll be the exact same thing you posted before, more often than not trotting out the dev statement or the class description for the fifteenth or twentieth time, just in different words. And those can be summed up like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;warriors have the ability to survive the most brutal battles through the use of defensive. Defensive is an ability that will not be shared with knights. Defensive will not be removed from the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard you the second time, and the third time, and the fourth time, and the fifth time, and every other time you've repeated yourself since.<br />

They are not under equipped.<br />
They are choosing SUB-OPTIMAL EQUIPEMENT.<br />
They are not going 100% AC while it is indeed possible.<br />
<br />
A CLONE of myself would have the same AC as me, and NOT LACK any focuses.<br />

Brael : 2390 AC http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=903806<br />
<br />
Let me repeat ,its NOT DIFFERENT LOOT CHOICES. Because Time+ Gear is KNIGHTEMISED.<br />
<br />
This is not the EP,  do you understand it ?<br />
We have reached a lvl of play where  the best war item ac wise = the best pal item ac wise.<br />
If they do not have that item its because 1) they dont raid enough 2) they didnt want it.<br />
<br />
I'm too lazy to link &amp; analyse Time items 1 by 1. And anyway you'll never admit you are wrong.<br />
<br />
Of course the average paladin has less ac than the avg warrior , why ?<br />
Because he's 10000 times more clueless than the average warrior.<br />
He's ignoring the fact he can have the same (or a bit more) ac than a warrior<br />
WITHOUT sacrificing ANY versatily.<br />
<br />
Time+ Paladins can have the SAME AC as warriors and lack zero focus or FT. <br />
<br />
Our best Paladin AC wise &quot;lost&quot; 27 AC because :<br />
Stun Resist Looks cools, i'm gonna grab some.<br />
What does that mean ? He chose to gave up 27 AC for a useless effect.<br />
<br />
He gave up 30 more AC because &quot;I want the 20 DS Cloack its cool&quot;.<br />
What does that mean ? He chose to gave up 30 AC for a Clicky.<br />
<br />
There, 60 more AC by not getting a useless effect, and a rather nice clicky.<br />
<br />
I could go on for ever. <br />
Take the top 10 paladins AC wise.<br />
Take the top 10 warriors AC wise.  (Remove 120ac from every shield using one)<br />
<br />
Compare them you'll see the AC is pretty close.<br />
That shows that once you are Time+ , Pal/SK &amp; Warrior AC is pretty similar.<br />
(Ok we do come way ahead when using a shield).<br />
<br />
Take LDoN  for Example :<br />
5 x 10 AC = 50 ac = 75 AC on Magelo<br />
5 x 20hp/mana = 115hp / 100 mana on Magelo<br />
<br />
For half the price (5x510 vs 5x1150) , you can get 75 more AC than a STUPID (caus thats the only word for it)<br />
Hybrid going Hp/Mana ....<br />
<br />
Whatever way you look at it 75ac  &gt;&gt;&gt; 115hp/100Mana.<br />
<br />
Did some hybrids follow that route ? Surely , just like some really rare warriors did.<br />
Was that Smart ? No <br />
Was that Efficient ? No<br />
<br />
For that reason you cant compare AVG of Classes.<br />
<br />
As a warrior , you would have to be CRAZY to put 20hp/mana when you have 10ac in those slots.<br />
As a Paladin, it would be really really underefficient tanking wise to put 20hp/mana in those slots.<br />
<br />
Working with the top10 AC of each class (remove 110ac from shield using warriors).<br />
You will see that at Time+ Lvl  (lets stick to non Uqua/Qvic please) there is<br />
ZERO PENALTY for a hybrid going FULL AC (he will still perform perfectly).<br />
<br />
So not doing so is a matter of choice, not of possibility.<br />
<br />
They can, but they chose not to for some weird reason. <br />
Because while doing so (going 100% for tanking stats) doesnt give ANY PENALTY hybrid wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u232"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p232">Ah Daemonwynd, I'm glad ya get it.<br />
<br />
It's imaterial how close Knights tank to Warriors - they aren't Warriors. What is material is can they perform their Not a Warrior But Primarily a Melee functions in raids and get normal experiance groups.<br />
<br />
They can - well, at least well equipped Knights in contrast with Sir Graal, who's unbuffed 6500HP's is better suited to BoT than raid Tanking in the EP's much less PoTime, much less cutting edge GoD content.<br />
<br />
Still Graal, I'm not poking fun of yas. With yer 6500HP unbuffed, ya still buff, heal and res a bucketload better than I - your class advantages.<br />
<br />
Just don't ask SoE for stilts so you can stand as tall as I or failing that ask SoE to cut off my legs.<br />
<br />
And Daemonwynd, you are wrong. Removing Defensive IS all about Knights trying to gain power relative to Warriors. Many many Knights publically posted in favor of Knight Defensive. It has sunk in that they are unlikely to get a big bite of Defensive and GoD content has been adjusted so they can't really claim to need it. Now some of those very same posters are saying 'Well if we can't have Defensive, then take it away from Warriors. It's broken.&quot;<br />

There are 4 Tanks in EQ<br />

<br />

<br />
One that can buff the most for HP's in the Game, 4th best healer, and a 90% resser.<br />

<br />
...and while you're busily accusing me of only looking at the numbers I want to see, you're busily using only numbers that only support YOUR point of view. IE that the dfference between the top paladin that you're quoting and the number TWO paladin serverwide is a TWO HUNDRED AC difference. Therefore even on the TOP FIVE  of each class, SEVERWIDE, the average AC difference is going to be the SAME thing that I have already shown over and over again.<br />
<br />
What a hypocrite. <br />
<br />
In fact I'll even show you:<br />
<br />
TOP FIVE paladins serverwide average AC: 2349<br />
Top five warriors serverwide average AC: 2557<br />
<br />
Advantage: warrior 208AC. Funny, even in the TOP FIVE serverwide, when they would certainly have ALL the advantages to make them equal that you claim they'll be. Warriors still have the same advantage you claim that they do not have. Paladins STILL aren't equal in AC as you claim they would have even at THAT level.<br />
<br />
Of course the average paladin has less ac than the avg warrior , why ?<br />
Because he's 10000 times more clueless than the average warrior.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the Paladins in your guild just love how you just called them all clueless. Arrogance showing again.<br />
<br />
Time+ Paladins can have the SAME AC as warriors and lack zero focus or FT. <br />
<br />
Yes. CAN. That's the operative word. But in practice, the vast majority of them at equal gear levels DO NOT.<br />
<br />
Just give it up. You have utterly failed to prove how Paladins only have 50 less AC than warriors. Everything you've brought up has been shown to either be numbers you've made up that don't reflect reality, an abberation that you've brought up which conveniently supports your point of view and don't reflect the majority or even any kind of significant minority of paladins, or simply doesn't even add up to ANY kind of double digit number, let along the mid double digits that you claim. In fact EVERY time the averages come up, or EVEN direct comparisons between knights and warriors of the same gear levels, EVERY SINGLE TIME it's validated my argument instead.</div></div><hr />

Thats 100-130 Less AC per Warrior.<br />
<br />
Result : Its 50-75 AC difference with Time+ Gear.<br />
<br />
Bull they are.<br />
How arrogant are you to think that you know what's better for a Time Paladin than Time Paladins themselves? <br />
<br />
Its not arrogance. Its Reality.<br />
<br />
I chose my equipement based on AC/HP &amp; Shielding. Its the BEST OUT THERE. (Pre Qvic)<br />
<br />
Guess what ? THAT SAME EQUIPEMENT HAS EVERY SINGLE FOCUS A PALADIN NEEDS<br />
<br />
I'm not arrogant , its you that refuses to accept a fact. Stupidity &amp; Blindless.<br />
<br />
Ok let me break this down for you : What does a paladin need  to perform well ?<br />
Healing Haste for Heals: 30% on Mask (best pre Qvic)<br />
Spell Haste for Stuns : 23% on Bracer (best pre Qvic)<br />
Healing Augmentation : 30% on BP (best pre Qvic)<br />
Mana Preservation : 20% Beneficial on Necklace (best pre Qvic)<br />
FT : Non (with 3 Augments its FT8 , Switch Saryn for TZ orb you have FT11)<br />
<br />
I wont bother arguing with you because its sheer stupidity and you are hopeless.<br />
<br />
Face it, I have the best WARRIOR ITEMS UNTIL QVIC.<br />
Guess what ? THESE ARE THE BEST PALADIN ITEMS UNTIL QVIC.<br />
Guess what ? THESE HAVE ALL THE FOCUS A PALADIN NEEDS.<br />
<br />
Understand it ? This is not some Gimp EP gear we are talking about.<br />
I'm done EP farming unlike you. I'm done Time Farming unlike you. <br />
<br />
 And they KNOW that reason, being a Time+ Paladin, far better than you being a Time+ Warrior. You don't play that class, therefore you cannot authoritatively speak on what is good or not for them. Trying to do so is arrogance, pure and simple. <br />
<br />
Absolute bullshit. <br />
<br />
Any Wizard with an IQ over 5 can tell you that you have the best Pre Time Mask.<br />
Any Rogue with an IQ over 5 can tell you that you have the best Pre Time Belt.<br />
<br />
Now please explain to me, why i can not tell a Paladin he doesnt have the best Time+ Items ?<br />
<br />
I can because :<br />
1- I own these items<br />
2- They are the best in regards to pure tanking (no avoidance vs shielding plz) <br />
3- They are paladin usable<br />
4- They have a focus, that while useless to me is perfect for a hybrid<br />
<br />
So lets see .....<br />
<br />
My current gear takes me to 2300AC &amp; Has ALL PALADIN FOCUSES ....<br />
<br />
My current gear on a Paladin with a GBoC gives him 2200AC &amp; Has all Focuses.<br />
My current gear on a Paladin with 1H+Shield give him 2300AC &amp; Has all Focuses.<br />
<br />
Is my gear hard to obtain ? No<br />
Is there any reason for a Time+ Paladin for not having my gear ? No<br />
<br />
A Time+ Paladin can have (until Qvic) exactly the same AC as a warrior.<br />
<br />
Not doing so is a personal choice, detrimental to pure tanking.<br />
Because at Time+ LVL , you do not have to trade Tanking vs Hybridness.<br />
You can have the BEST of BOTH.</div></div><hr />

Btw, PURE classes are suppose to have dominence in their defining abilities. As SoE states in the Class Descriptions:<br />
....warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.<br />

While other priest classes have healing spells, no one can match up with the power and efficiency of clerical healing.<br />

<br />
And THAT, is the only decent point you've made in days.<br />
<br />
Which means that even at the VERY top end, and ONLY in XP group content, is it actually (gasp) near 50.  That, is called situational.<br />
<br />
In named tanking situations, in other than the ultra top end, that advantage still remains. Because there's no reason to use the secondary weapon with DBoTW, AngerII, WA5, and symbol of pthe planesmasters. Hmmm. Better damage taking ability, or more ripostes? Hmmm let me think.... Yeah. Shield every time unless it's trivial to tank.<br />
<br />
In other words, the only time you can actually show the advantage, is with .1% of the population, and even then only part of the time.<br />
<br />
Bravo. Just means I'm right 99% of the time instead of 100%.<br />
<br />

Yet again, you're full of it.<br />
<br />
What focii do you have? let's see:<br />
Spell Haste 30% (beneficial only)<br />
Mana Pres 20% (beneficial only) -where's the stun mana pres? They need that.<br />
NO improved healing - oops, paladins need that one. and you don't have it.<br />
NO Flowing Thought - oops, paladins need that stuff. and you have none.<br />
<br />
Sorry, try again. You have AT BEST half of what a Paladin needs. Just goes to show you how much you REALLY know about Paladins in your arrogance and know-it-all attitude.<br />

<br />

They are actually the common loot along with Regen augments.<br />

My gear has EVERY SINGLE needed Paladin Focus (well exept MP on stuns).<br />

This thread hasn't been going anywhere past the first 2 pages, but I find the compusive quoting (it's required right? lol) entertaining. Hey, I'll bite...<br />
<br />
BB, do it one more time. Everytime I read it, it gives me a hard on. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u241"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p241">The point is, if you don't get it, that in pre-GoD all but the most radical aggree Warrior/Knight balance is just fine.<br />
<br />
In early GoD, it's was possible that EP equipped Knights might have had a tougher time, but it has been rebalanced.<br />
<br />
In more advanced GoD, it's reasonable to assume players have farmed  previous content and completed previous progression. It IS possible for Knights to approach 11k HP's+, have critical combat focus effects, shielding, very close to Warrior AC, and a spellbook.<br />
<br />
So, no Daemondwynd, your assertions that Knights can't acquire the equipment to carry out the functions listed for them in their class descriptions is no more or less true in GoD after adjustment than in any other expansion.<br />
<br />
If anything the sale of Ornate Molds in the bazaar and existance of LDoN augments and armor has made it easier to do early to mid-GoD content while skipping content than perhaps in any other previous realease.<br />
<br />
Balance is not strictly speaking KvW (Knight vs. Warrior) - they aren't Warriors. But rather KvE (Knight vs. Environment). Knights can cast spells, tank normal adds and get experiance groups in GoD.<br />
<br />
99% of the time Warriors are not under Defensive in GoD and Knights are capable of tanking very much like a Warrior not under Defensive PLUS they have a spellbook.<br />
<br />
I use Defensive when I'm MTing in a most brutal battle - exactly when Warriors are supposed to be unmatched.<br />
<br />

<br />
One thing though Emilia - if your talking about the very top, the Paladin will loose some AC/HP from doing FT augments instead of HP/AC vs the warrior, and if your not talking about the very top, then you cant assume the absolute best tanking/focus combo gear, because while it generally does exist with some careful planning, its just not the norm or standard because of competition of drops.<br />
<br />
Qvic Armor will help Knights a lot in FT department, but then again Qvic armor is class based so warriors get more HP/AC, (I dont think this is nessicarily a bad thing i just wish they would stop flip flopping between mold &quot;Class&quot; armor and plate / all or melee / all armor, it makes inconistent balancing between Knights and Warriors HP/AC wise as you progress.<br />
<br />
I dunno what my point is in that because i'm sorta loss at what is being debated in this thread but its something to go on cause from the looks of its been mostly the same debates thrown back and forth maybe i can switch it up a bit!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u244"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p244">Madrone,<br />
<br />
Lemme ask. I briefly used FT items on my (53) Paladin. Frankly, when tanking an add or named mana regen rate is not a big deal and FT15 is roughly equivilant to KEI (correct me if I'm wrong). Mind you, I have an Earring of the Solstice (not a bad &quot;compromise&quot; at my level) and wouldn't hesitate to put an FT2 aug on it instead of a 20HP, 20mana, 20End aug. Some diminishment isn't a compromise, it's just a smart move. Narandi's Crown is another such non-compromise at my level.<br />
<br />
I switch out items used to extend buff duration before combat and don't bother with Extended Range, Reagent Conservation, Free Beer, etc. So for me at least the important Focus effects are Improved Healing and Mana Preservation. Given that both of these are available on PoTime equipment without any real compromise, I believe the Knight's are forced to use third rate equipment argument is largely absolute BS.<br />
<br />
Warriors too have the opprotunity to make bad equipment choices for example, 15AC &gt; 35HP's - there's NO doubt.<br />
<br />
The debate thus far (I think):<br />
Daemonwynd seems to be switching between asserting that Paladins MUST make inferior equipment choices and stating Magelo indicates they do make bad choices.<br />
<br />
Further, he posits that Defensive, a Warrior class defining ability, is &quot;broken&quot; and should be removed (it's not broken and he's wrong btw).<br />
<br />
The discusion about equipment is I suppose an effort by him to find some evidence that Warriors have an overwhelming advantage over Knights when Defensive is not used and that Defensive can't be compared in value to Knight spellbooks so it must be removed (he's wrong btw).<br />
<br />
Of course I might have misinterpreted Daemonwynd's meanderings.<br />

LOL priceless, again. It shows you vast knowledge of high end gaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u246"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p246">I do agree Madrone that a Paladin will loose some HP compared to me to get some FT.<br />
ATM thats 20 &amp; 20 &amp; 35hp .... so 100hp lost to gain  FT8.<br />
<br />
If u change Saryn range to VZ range , you have more AC (10 avoidance &amp; FT3).<br />
<br />
With Totally Equal Gear at Time+ lvl the difference is 50-75.<br />
Using shields Paladin gill get the same AC.<br />
Of course warrior using shields will unbalance but its mostly for magelo virtual cock size.<br />
<br />
Time+ Paladins do not have to sacrifice AC/Shielding/Avoidance to develop their Hybrid side.<br />
Ask Madrone. he as a Time+ Paladin maybe you'll believe him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u247"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p247">Whether its compromise or choosing whats best is largely based on your definition of it, more aptly its sometimes caster focused stuff takes priority over something that is better pure tanking wise, but not better for a paladin. but its fairl slim margin, but one thing is that paladins have a slightly more restrictive gear path, because theirs more things to focus on (no pun intended)<br />
<br />
Of course tis isnt a very fun thing to debate because by and large we agree... pick something different (<br />
<br />
BB, i'm not quite sure what your question is so I cant answer it!<br />
<br />
Re Shields. Shields bring up an interesting thing, because by and large shields are magelo flufflers, but I know that with a DB + Raex, after a minute or two or more (depending on warrior/mob) can hold aggro with the DB + SoS/BB combo, of course whether its done enough to really justify it is definately debatable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">You answered it by agreeing I think. Review - having decided to lose some tanking and DPS as a &quot;cost&quot; of having a spellbook, Knights can further erode their ability to tank by being undergeared for the environment they are fighting in or by having &quot;good&quot; gear that focuses too heavily (and IMO uncessarily) on caster-side support, in otherwords making poor gear selections. PoTime gear does have support for the most critical caster activities and fewer compromises with tanking are necessary.<br />

<br />
No, I'm not making that assertion at all, you're missing my point.<br />
<br />
I'm asserting they make DIFFERENT choices, and that doesn't necessarily meant they're inferior or bad, they just different. YOU are the one saying they are undergeared. Case in point, your above post.<br />
<br />
This is the not the first time you've made a statement that I've clarified, which you keep right on going stating the very same thing, which I clarify again, and you keep repeating like I said nothing at all. At this point, I'm fairly sure that... how is a diplomatic way to say this.... listening is not one of your strong suits.<br />

<br />
No. this non defensive advantage came up by someone to make some point, I don't know what, but, it's getting away from the point. Not making THAT point either.<br />
<br />
Of course I might have misinterpreted Daemonwynd's meanderings.<br />
<br />
Might? DEFEINITELY did. And you've done this before. In fact I already stated my position at least once previously, and here I find you still claiming my position is something different.</div></div><hr />

Even if that was right, which I'm not going to bother arguing the point with you, that still doesn't adress the fact that that's only .1% of the playerbase. So 99.9% of the time, my claim is right.<br />
<br />
And you know what, when it comes to balance... .1%  of the populat ion doesn't matter worth beans. It's the MAJORITY is what balance is for.<br />
<br />
I could just imagine how badly they're screw everything up if they balanced the game for the poorest even 10% geared up of warriors and paladins.</div></div><hr />
