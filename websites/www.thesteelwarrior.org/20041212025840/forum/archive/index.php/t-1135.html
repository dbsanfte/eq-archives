<br />
I would like to know if anyone's actually running this game a its fullest : all models on, social animations, mip mapping, 1024x768 or higher, etc etc .. at a GOOD FRAMERATE (that's 25fps average in PoP / Luclin zones)?<br />
<br />
And if so, what kind of configuration you have to run this ?<br />
<br />
I'm looking into buying a new motherboard, cpu, and possibly 1 gig of memory (512 doesnt seem to be enough).<br />
<br />
Current cpu is a under-clocked athlon 1700xp (due to crappy MB) and 512 mb ram.<br />
<br />
My graphics card don't need any change I believe it's a pretty decent Radeon 9500 Pro with 128mb ram.<br />
<br />
PS: if u wanna see what I mean by good frame rate check out this uber mob raid (http://arete.iambored.com/videoarchive.htm) videos, it's sickening (all models on during raid, decent framerate)</div></div><hr />

I run at 1280x1024 all models on.  Though I turn spells off for Raids only.<br />
<br />
<br />
Decent Framerates....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time I tried activating all models, I was just in PoT, and it wasn't so much that my cpu was a bit slow, simply there was huge 'hickups' in the framerate because the harddrive was constantly loading stuff. I mean it, the harddrive led just wouldnt stop, everytime a PC was going to enter my view, the harddrive was loading graphics. Amd the weirdest part is that the task manager actually says Everquest uses up to 250 mb of memory or so.<br />
<br />
I have 512mb, and I have a separate 1 gig partition for XP's virtual memory.<br />
<br />
So I dunno what's wrong on my pc ??, I hardly believe 512 mb is enough for enabling all graphics.<br />
:(</div></div><hr />

I could run everything in full fine...but I only have 256 mb of ram. EQ takes up a lot of ram, make sure to get at least 512 with your upgrade, or hell even a gig. it takes forever to zone with everything on full, although my FPS is fine. (i play 1024x768)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I run at 1024x768 with no models on, high textures (32 bit) and mip mapping enabled. Believe it or not, mip mapping helped my frame rate.<br />
<br />
My clipping plane is usually at 15% with particles/3d sky off. I have horrible frame rate in Fire when particles are turned, clipping plane past 15% and the 3d sky on. <br />
<br />
If I enable new models it sometimes becomes a slide show, my frame rate drops down so much. In general, everything runs fine with most of the bells and whistles turned off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Snowz, thanks for the honest post. My config is similar. Got a Athlon 1700 XP running at 100mhz instead of 133 due to crappy (Asus btw) DDR/SDR combo motherboard, 512 mb Ram, Win Xp, and currently a Radeon 9500 Pro 128 mb 8 pipelines blabla bla !<br />
<br />
In fact upgrading from GeForce 3 ti200 to the Radeon gave no noticable framerate improvement.. on the other hand due to its much better bandwidth I activate the hardware AA and mipmapping, and could run at 1600 if I wanted.<br />
<br />
Look at some of the technical demos that come with the Radeon 500 or even with a GeForce 3 ti 200 (thats a crippled down Gf3 btw).. it's killer !!<br />
<br />
No, the bottleneck for this game is the CPU. I should have figured long before.. but especially such a bad coded game.. uses tons of memory bandwidth and processor resources.<br />
<br />
I've ordered a Athlon 2600+ (166mhz FSB 2.083 ghz) Asus A7n8X Deluxe motherboard (nForce 2 chipset) and 2 sticks of 512 mb PC3200 400mhz memory.. it will enable the Dual DDR feature of the nForce 2 (which isnt very noticable improvement but what the heck) with my current Radeon 9500 Pro (128mb 8 pipelines blablabla) it better be a serious upgrade to my previous config! I'll post when I try it..</div></div><hr />

I move around okay in general, some lag on raids, very significant lag in bazaar, to the point where it's hard to click on buttons (even with 0 clipping range). I normally run without any spell effects and a fairly small clipping range, depending on zone and lag.<br />
<br />
I wish I had better performance, but my first two years of EQ were on a crappy laptop, 8 megs of shared video memory, and a modem, so it's still okay to me.</div></div><hr />

I run eq at minimal settings clip plane all the way down, with only 1 luclin model on. I get lagged out in outdoor zones and bazaar/pok/pot is really bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Athlon 1gig<br />
1gig DDR 2100 RAM<br />
Geforce 4 ti4200 w/ 128mb<br />
40gb Barracuda 4 HDD<br />
<br />
I used to be of the opinion that EQ performance was all about RAM and video card and hence for its age my PC is stacked in these areas, but when I sat there with EQ running in a window (no other apps running) and then brought up task manager for the first time I was kinda amazed to find that only about 300mb of the available 1gig was being used and that my CPU was at perma 100% usage while EQ is running.<br />
<br />
Upon taking into consideration the performance of my system running other games (Soldier of Fortune 2, UT2K3, C&amp;C Generals most recently) where frame rates are amazing even after turning on every little bit of eye candy I can find, the conclusion I have come to is the same as Lillyann.<br />
<br />
The bottle neck for EQ on my system is definitely the processor.  Perhaps this is understandable given my config, but this isn't the problem I face playing other games with far more amazing graphics.<br />
<br />
I ran with full luclin models on, particle effects on low (not for performance but simple because they can be overwhelming when you run them on high), 3D sky on, mipp mapping / dynamic lighting and social animations all on since the luclin release until about 2 weeks ago and performance for XP grouping was fine, a little choppy in PoK and going to the bazaar was a case of either clip plane to zero or stare at the floor.<br />
<br />
Raiding with 40+ people could cause the frame rate to be a little choppy and effected the speed at which I could react in some situations however so when I started raiding regularly in PoP / Luclin recently I turned models and particle effects off and now enjoy a decent frame rate in all situations and have been pleased to find that the old models grow on you and soon enough you dont miss the new ones at all.</div></div><hr />

I would sometimes start to lag in zones like umbral planes, BW, PoV, etc  If i didnt reboot my computer every 24hours.  With the 1 gig I never have to restart, framerates are the same...even 5 days later without a reboot.</div></div><hr />

Aye, 1 ghz cpu might be enough (1 real ghz not a athlon 1000 or something :) ).. in fact on my current underclocked 1100mhz Athlon the framerate is acceptable with models on.. but it wont stop loading ^_^<br />
<br />
as for the bazaar, with all OLD models, it is crawling to death . When I buy stuff there I look down to the floor as much as possible, get near end of stalls and click the name of seller and check whih side I turn to get an idea where I'm going.. and when I get close to the seller I have to looku p their names and thats when my FPS drops to 5 fps :)<br />

I know I had to change some registry things to get Windows XP to realize I had L2 cache on my processor, and I also told it to use all of my ram before initiating virtual memory (using the Hard Drive as make believe ram). Now Xp runs great, but before it wasn't that impressive.<br />
<br />
As for EQ, I have more ram and more processor speed than the rest of my family, who also plays. My computer I built myself, and it runs the best. Dads is a Sony, and it's so packed with programs and stuff that run in the background that it doesn't run well.<br />
I run Xp with a 2.26 Ghz, 1 gig ram, Geforce 3, and 2 80 gb hard drives raid 0'd. I don't lag anywhere really, except for the bazaar with full clipping. I experience just a little slow down in the library in PoK, but it's nothing like what the rest of the family gets in there lol.<br />
<br />
I can run in all normal zones full clipping, and I do keep spell effects on for the most part. I can run all the luclin models, but I like logging on fast (and I don't use a horse). I usually just keep trolls on since I hunt with a troll shm a lot</div></div><hr />

I run with all models on, full clip plane, all details set high 1280 x 1024 resolution.  Only thing I turn off is particle effects because in close combat range, I get some lag when weapons proc.  Strange thing is caster effects don't lag, it is just my damn frosty.  When I take a day off from the warrior and play my mage, I can run full particles and not worry about a thing.<br />
<br />
Aside from the close combat particles, the only other plcae I get lag is the bazaar, but turn clip plane down and all is well.  Even on raids, with no particle effects, I am still lag free.  But the raids I go on are no bigger than 30 people so It is just like walking through the nexus on a busy night.  The biggest performance boost I saw was going from 512 to a full gig of ram.  It may not seem to big of a deal but once I upgraded I can run most every game full details high res and not lag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Frostbringer proc effect is indeed particle heavy :) Some cards are better at handling those than others.<br />
<br />
You may try changing the particle clipping to medium or far, so that the game doesnt draw the particles closest to you.</div></div><hr />

Imho XP is great for stability .. it's possiblte to alt tab or get the ctrl-alt-del window in 99% of games and kill games or applictions that freeze, and without need to reboot.</div></div><hr />

I had it running at 3.26ghz for a little while until I loaded up EQ.  It would run flawlessly while playing Battlefield 1942, but in EQ @ 3.26ghz, it would just crash back to desktop the moment I had 40+ people around me in raid situations.<br />
<br />
It can run with everything turned up just fine, but I keep all spell effects off and usually /shownames 1 on cause I can't stand sitting there and looking for my mouse cursor.  I tend to lose it with all the flashies enable.  :)<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll try 1.85v!  The CPU, even at 3.0ghz, never goes above 47 degrees Celsius now that I have this gigantic bujezuz Swiftech heatsink over it.</div></div><hr />

nForce2 &gt; All<br />
<br />
Just board alone, nForce2's have like a 10-20% performance advantage on top of their VIA counterparts.  The performance difference is very, very significant.</div></div><hr />

Athlon XP 1800+ with 256mb DDR ram and a GeForce 3 Ti500. It ran VERY smooth, no lag at all, except in the bazaar. 1024x768, all models on, everything at max setting, max clip plane. Currently going to upgrade to P4 3.2GHz with 800mhz bus, 1gig ram, radeon 9800 with 256mb video memory. Gonna play at 1600x1200x32 with everything on :)</div></div><hr />
