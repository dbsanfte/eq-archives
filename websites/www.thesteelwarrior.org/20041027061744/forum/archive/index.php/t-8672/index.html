<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did a search, couldn't find other discussion on this, but I do recall someone saying in passing that our having Tactical Mastery was somehow interfering with us getting the full benefit from any Strikethrough mods we get.<br />
<br />
Not going to lose a lot of sleep over this, but I am curious.  Can anyone support or refute this?  And on what basis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most skills in EQ aren't checked as a cumulative sum.  For example let's say you have stalwart endurance 3 (~70% stun resist), and you've 5% stun resist, you don't resist a stun 75% fo the time.  What happens is 70% of the time SE3 will fire off, and then you resist the remaining 30% stuns that do get through 5% of the time with the stun resist mod.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine TM and Strikethrough interact the same way.  Let's say TM3 = 50% to ignore special defenses and you've 10% chance via Strikethrough, we don't get the full expected benefit (50+10 = 60%), but instead you'd get TM3 50% of the time, and then strikethrough 10% of the 50% TM3 failed to work, for a total of 55% special defenses negated.  Note that the order those are checked doesn't matter whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To illustrate this lets assume 1,000 stunning attacks against you...<br />
<br />
Of the 1,000 attacks Stalwart Endurance has the following effect....<br />
Stuns Resisted       - 700 - 70.00%<br />
Stuns Not Resisted   - 300 - 30.00%<br />
<br />
Of the failures above Stun Resists has the following effect...<br />
Stuns Resisted       -  15 -  5.00%<br />
Stuns Not Resisted   - 285 - 95.00%<br />
<br />
Total Resists        - 715 - 71.50%<br />
Total Failures       - 285 - 28.50%<br />
<br />
And for those not good at math, it works the other way.....<br />
<br />
Assuming 1,000 stunning attacks against you.....<br />
<br />
Of the 1,000 attacks Stun Resist has the following effect...<br />
Stuns Resisted       -  50 -  5.00%<br />
Stuns Not Resisted   - 950 - 95.00%<br />
<br />
Of the failures above Stalwart Endurance has the following effect....<br />
Stuns Resisted       - 665 - 70.00%<br />
Stuns Not Resisted   - 285 - 30.00%<br />
<br />
Total Resists        - 715 - 71.50%<br />
Total Failures       - 285 - 28.50%</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Savidlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I noticed a big diffrence in how much damage I take when I maxed TM just do to avoiding Ripo damage</div></div><hr />

<br />
hrm... I was under the impression that you still took the reposte even though you struck through it?  I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

You do and hes wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You do and hes wrong.<br />
<br />
I was right?  Wow!  One in a row!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ryanosky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, you still take the riposte.  Strikethrough just means you hit through the defensive part of the riposte but you still take the oncoming hit.<br />
<br />
What Phant is the way I have thought it works too.  AA's and ability modifiers on items are 2 different checks.</div></div><hr />
