Keep in mind that no single person is getting sequential pulls from the generator. Inbetween your tradeskill combines or spell casts or flying kick attempts the RNG has already supplied thousands of random numbers for combat to-hit rolls, damage rolls, wander route pathing, skill-up checks, encounter tables, loot tables, and so on. Even if the RNG was more predictable, you're pulling genuinely random samples from an endless sequence of these &quot;random&quot; numbers. <br />
<br />
-Prathun &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
there has been endless talk about needing for example a random number seed so that code crackers dont time their /rand to get the winning roll. that or a rule that says if you fail two tradeskill combines in a row you take a break because the /rand generator isnt working well. this quote alone has put to rest any doubts about the randomness of our individual rolls.</div></div><hr />

This topic is very much more complex than you or apparently the developer believes. Somewhere in the last week or so I stumbled over a rigid mathematical treatment. Maybe someone saw it and wil provide a link.<br />
<br />
I once had a QA bug reported in a pretty important contract. I sat down with the QA Manager, walked through the code with him, and proved that I  absolutely implimented what was called out in the specification to a 'T&quot;. He sat back and smiled (paraphrasizing) - &quot;Interesting, but what was done does not meet the consumer's expectations. So, having brought that fact to your attention, we can fix it now OR<br />
<br />
generate a change in the specification and re-impliment. One approach solves the problem and the other gives you the sanctimonious satisfaction of saying you did it as specified and we still will be fixing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tradeskilling does not seem to feedback near-term failures as would occur in either manufacturing (rejects go up, adjust process) or a skill (focus more intently and be more meticulous following a failure). Mind you, I'm not insisting it should - just pointing out you can have perfect code and still have something that's &quot;not working&quot; on a level other than the implimentation.<br />

not sure what your point is ... that you think some might consider the random number generator to be &quot;too random&quot;? im only addressing this to those who have fretted that people might be attempting to exploit buggy streakiness in RNG and cheating us &quot;honest people&quot; by their their deeper knowledge on how to win /rand rolls and such through knowledge of those shortcomings. i know im not making this up. ive seen people who tried hard to be the fourth roller on a rand for example convinced that whomever rolls fourth has twice the chance of winning of anyone else. and ive seen others who very much hated all rolls on loot because they were convinced that someone else in the group knew something they didnt about guaranteeing a high ratio of winning rolls.<br />
<br />
many of us eq addicts worry about many injustices in the game brought about those who devote their time not to honest leveling but to seeking out exploits that directly cheat out fellow players. i just think this particular exploit has been convincingly argued to be a non-issue.</div></div><hr />

I was never worried about the /random command.  It was the various other things that are totally non random like tradeskills, loot and taunt and such.  I don't think they will fix it tho, so no point in complaining.  I seem to remember a post by someone that it was designed to be non random.</div></div><hr />

So long as SOE doesnt not provide easy access to whatever it is they are using to seed the RNG then this should not be a problem. No number (as the dev indicated) generated by a computer is ever truly random, at least not yet. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When dealing with computer random only means random in the sense that if you roll 1-100 1 million times, roughly all the numbers will show up 10000 times.  <br />
<br />
Though why is this even an issue for players is beyond me, seeing that anything that requires a random number most likely works the same way as EQ gets a random number, and I don't remember hearing people complain their Footman in War3 got a streak of low rolls which cause them to lose the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be because in other games, if you get a low roll, you can't accurately predict that the next 10 rolls will also be low like you can in EQ.  And no, I don't mean /random rolls, I mean things like tradeskill combines and other things like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Human nature is a funny thing.  People often attribute streakiness in randomness to be a lack of randomness, when in reality, you can not have a truely random event without streakiness.<br />
<br />
I had a probabilty class in which the teacher had 1/2 the class roll a 20 sided die 100 times, and the other half made up 100 fake rolls...<br />
<br />
After these were all written down the teacher looked over each of them (not knowing which were fake, and which were not) and labeled them as such.  He correctly labeled all but one of them...how?? He went thru them, and the ones that had the same number appear 2 times in a row, or more, were the real die rolls, and the ones that never repeated a number were made up.<br />
<br />
Humans don't like seeing patterns in randomness, but true randomness will indeed have patterns and streakiness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am not saying they cheated, from what the dev's say above it picks a random number that was produced for a action, it could pick anything from hitting the monster for 8 damage, to hitting an 8 on a resist roll, if it picks from random numbers already made and present in the zone for other actions, someone may be able to figure this out and do some offset hacking.<br />
<br />
again, not saying the above roll was a cheat, just really odd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you consider the scope EQ is played there's bound to be some really lucky or unlucky folks out there.  If you do something long enough even the most unlikeliest of events become quite possible.<br />
<br />
For example you can find just about anyone's birthday (mmddyy) appear somewhere in pi. <br />
<br />
Actually what most people want to see with random is that if I do ran 1 10 10 times, each number will show up exactly once, even though it is actually fairly UNLIKELY for that to happen.  The chance of getting 2 rolls the same number is 1/10, and there are 9 consecutive rolls (roll 1 &amp; 2, 2 &amp; 3, etc), so the chance of not having the same number twice on 10 rolls is (0.9)^9 = 39%.  Or, 3/5 of five times you'd expect if I do ran 1 10 10 times, two consecutive rolls will be the same numbers.  <br />
<br />
As for having 3 rolls of 8, that's not even 1/1000th.  I have seen phase 3 drop 9/15 (not counting guaranteed drop from Deathbringer Skullsmash) loots and 7 of them being legs of some sort (and 5 plate greaves), and I'm sure if you take the expected drop rate and the expect rate which loot are supposed to be legs that number will be significantly less than 1/1000, and yet nevertheless it happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The thing you humans fail to understand is that you should EXPECT to see &quot;patterns&quot; in truly random numbers.<br />
<br />
A total absence of patterns would not be random at all.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of random sequences contain &quot;patterns&quot;, such as Gerick's triple-8's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gerik's triple-8's were actually different numbers every time.<br />
<br />
Random Number Generators, at least the one I'm most familiar with (simple rand() in nearly all programming languages) actually generates a random decimal from 0 to 1 , then multiplies that number by randMax-randMin, adds randMin and truncates.<br />
<br />
Example, I want to roll a 20-sided die.<br />
randMax = 20, randMin = 1.<br />
<br />
The RNG gives me a 0.44658974.  Multiply by 19 gets me 8.48520506.  Add 1, and its 9.48520506.  Truncate, and you get 9.<br />
<br />
Roll from 1 to 10 and get an 8 == 0.77778 to 0.88888<br />
<br />
Roll from 1 to 11 and get an 8 == 0.7 to 0.79999<br />
<br />
Roll from 1 to 8 and get an 8 == 0.875 to 1<br />
<br />
The roll could have been 0.824, 0.706, 0.935...all would give 8, but none are close to being the &quot;same&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">With most programmed languages, if you plot the nth random number vs. the (n+1)th random number and keep doing it enough, you will start seeing a series of diagonal lines that are parallel and equally spaced horizontally and vertically.  This is because &quot;many&quot; (not all) computer generated psuedo random numbers are in fact just one element in a huge string of numbers generated with a mod function.  This string repeats itself eventually and if you see a situation where, for example, 45345 is always followed by 76128 on consecutive numbers picked, this means they fed the last number into the seed for the next number.  This means that if someone could monitor the random number stream for all random numbers returned, they could build up an [n,n+1] map of the random number generator and predict the next number given a very short sequence of observed returns effectively deducing the mod function used to generate the sequence.  This can be done with a program if the programmer has access to the entire random number sequence and can monitor it long enough but I don't know if this is the case in EQ.  I would hope not.<br />
<br />
Of course, this can be easily offset by programmers by mixing things into the seed like the system clock value, the number of people in a zone, etc. which are more likely to be truly random so the random number sting would not be as easily (without using a supercomputer) mapable in that case.<br />
