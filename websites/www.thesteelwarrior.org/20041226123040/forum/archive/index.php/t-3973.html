<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tappy</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When POP came out I was just hitting level 60 with my warrior.   I enjoyed the new zones a lot, but I quickly got disenchanted with the Warrior class and our inability to hold agro when compared to the Knights.  Prior to POP it wasn't really much of an issue to have a little (tiny?) bit of ping-ponging in and experince group:  it wasn't pleasant, mind you, but the mobs didn't hit hard enough to make it lethal to the party.<br />
<br />
My solution?  <br />
I bailed.<br />
I quit EQ for a couple of months, and when I eventually came back I went back to playing a paladin instead of my warrior.<br />
<br />
Fast forwrd to the present:  my paladin is level 65 with 80ish AA.  the paladin is fun to play: he's a decent tank, he's versatile, he's fun to play in experience groups and on raids...did I mention that keeping agro with a paladin is child's play?<br />
;)<br />
<br />
...but I still miss my warrior.<br />
<br />
I've got some friends who are in the 56-60 range who I haven't been able to join for LDoN adventures because of the LDoN 7-level limit....so I have dusted off my warrior.<br />
<br />
I had to re-equip him a bit, but the core of his gear is still fairly solid (almost full SS).  I bought a few fairly cheap pieces to round out his armor, and picked up a GSoT for 400 plat in the bazaar (they were 30K when I quit playing my warrior :) ).<br />
<br />
Its pretty amusing that a 400 plat weapon holds agro better than my old combo of a pair of Fleshgrinders...at the time I thought Fleshgrinders were pretty cool.<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Anyway...I've done a few LDoN adventures and I've been having a lot of fun playing my warrior.  I like the challenge of holding agro...which is something I never thought I would hear myself say.<br />
<br />
I think the current state of the Warrior class in EQ is MUCH better than it was when POP was released: the addition of some very nice 2H weapons for DPS and the LDoN Anger procs ahve been a very welcome addition to the warrior class.  <br />
<br />
Have these changes 'fixed' the warrior class balance problems?  No, but they have helped...and some progress is better than no progress at all.</div></div><hr />
