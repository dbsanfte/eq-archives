the blocked tunnle on the east side if ya were wondering, its open now, but if you try to leave jagged pine now it sends you right the the new zone in a loop, have to be able to gate or have a port to leave<br />
<br />
i think this was a accident because mordorn rasp now lives in 2 zones at once, and that the zone is busted, its a nice place tho, has sea foam(the water looks like PoK water but it MOVES) and there are schools of fish that move in unison, go check it out before they patch it :D<br />
<br />
my thinking is this is where the boat mentioned in the storyline is gona be built and that its gona lead to the new expantion, if you go to skyfire and look at the dragon's globe you can see 1 place on norrath yet to be found, methinks thats where the last expantion comes in</div></div><hr />

SOE is about to roll something out and is supposedly going to be announced soon.   There is also new LORE about it also that is posted on crgaming website.</div></div><hr />

Who the hell writes this garbage? I could have written better structured prose at age 5. Yet another example of how little the EQ team cares about producing quality product and how they rush unfinished shite out the doors every patch.</div></div><hr />

I zoned out actually, through that stone house.  I thought it was very pretty (but I had not been to Jaggedpine before either), and I swam up the waterfall *RaR* ... <br />
<br />
The green furry monsters are very cranky (all of em beat feet for me, lvl. 61) but they all dropped a hide of some sort (seemed a high ratio of HQ as well) - get your tailoring farmers there before that gets quashed!</div></div><hr />

Nice edit Valeris, very nice.<br />
<br />
And I skimmed over the posts and mis-understood Gerick's comment about the trap ... since my g/f's toon is a druid I taxi a lot of places :D.   I had thought you were talking about zoning out of the new zone, not Jaggedpine Gerick ;).</div></div><hr />

Just crazy enough to be a warrior :D.</div></div><hr />

Which will be cool. The ship is suppose to be the size of a small city, probably several zones in itself. My guildmate also suspects that Morden and company are going to be new gods.</div></div><hr />

could it be the next expansion is another World?</div></div><hr />

<br />
5 minutes work.<br />
<br />
Mordon Rasp turned a keen eye on the smaller Dark Elf, eyeing his particularly tiny frame for a moment as the darker one's next words came to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've no doubts in Calliav of course Mordon...he's led us this far afterall but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But?&quot; the gruffy old Barbarian said, already feeling his protective tension for the young human building inside of him.  Tondel looked down, choosing his next words carefully so as not to offend his large friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;But every rationale I concoct tells me that we are going off on some wild goose chase.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mordon found a sigh escaping his lips as he turned back to the sparkling ocean before him.  There could never be a more perfect spot in all of Norrath for Nedaria's Landing, nor could there have been a more perfect start to their scouting than with the acceptance of Lord Antonious Bayle IV himself!  But he had to admit...he had his doubts too.<br />
<br />
Though Calliav had never led them astary.  And if that Grozmok Stone or whatever he'd babbled about laid beyond those seas then by all means...he would get them there.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's led us this far so far...we canna' just abandon him now,&quot; he finally commented with a sense of finality.  Tondel nodded his head, accepting the Barbarians conclusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you're right.&quot;<br />
<br />
No you see, what I just wrote was five minutes of work.<br />
<br />
Please don't insult five minutes of work by labeling that crap with it...that must've taken at least an hour for the million monkies at a million keyboards to think that one up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think his point was that with little effort, he lifted the quality of the prose up a notch.  But I was fooled into thinking that Valeris had not made such an edit by your comment.<br />
<br />
Either due to my pathological fear of monkies, or the pain medication ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I'm rewriting it :D<br />
<br />
I refuse to read and tolerate that crap...I am completely redoing that lore and putting it on my website...then I'm going to email PROPER lore to SoE and say &quot;Don't give me this million monkey crap...I want real lore...I want something interesting and intriguing...not a gay stone I'm not interested in and some barbarian chasing it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went and checked it out with my 53 shammy today (you know, to avoid the trap!! :) )  Seemed kinda like a copy of the Jaggedpine zone, notwithstanding some of the cooler things like the waterfalls, the schools of fish, and the actual sea foam.  And I must say the waterfalls were large and impressive.  Everything was still green at 53 and a 48 ranger that was in the zone told me she saw an occasional LB to her, so yeah, its a 30s zone most likely.  The mobs did seem to drop a large amount of HQ hides.  It was interesting at least to explore a new zone that was mostly empty considering not a lot of people know its there yet.</div></div><hr />

Used often in casual narrative to indicate speech rythms: long pauses as opposed to clipped sentences.</div></div><hr />
