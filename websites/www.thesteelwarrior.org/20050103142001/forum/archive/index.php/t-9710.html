<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dunno if any of you guys have noticed this too, but since OOW came out, ive been getting crit hits, and about 50% of the time im finding that the crit hit number in parenthesis is not the same number right after it saying you hit such and such for X amount of damage.  For example &quot; Suurge scores a critical hit (222).  You slash mob for 202 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Now 2 things, one, has anyone else noticed that and know whats its from, and two, which number should i go by then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No idea, but could it be that the mob is resistant to that certain type of weapon? Maybe the Crit Hit is for 222 but since the mob resists, let's say, 10% from Slashing,  it hits it for 202?.<br />
<br />
It's like when the mob is Runed, you get Crit Hit displays, but not the Slash for X amount messages (at least I think it's that way, too late right now to remember).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suporma</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only reason I can think of that happening is that the mob is runed or vie'd. If a mob has a resistance to a weapon type, I'm pretty sure it still displays correctly. <br />
<br />
Neither of those explain how it happens to you 50% of the time though.. I haven't noticed anything myself, but I don't pay very close attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zendien</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alot of OoW mobs seem to have some resistance to specific weapon types. I've been getting the &quot;crit but lower dmg&quot; thing alot too, especially in MPG. For example I think the Discordlings there have a slight resistance to slashing or something. Cant really remember the mobs and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The line after the (crit) is the actual damage done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ukuns in OoW (dunno about GoD) are more susceptible to blunt weapons.<br />
<br />
I've noticed that my crits on ukuns, with blunt weapons, do 8-10% more damage than the line immediately after it says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barangi~E'ci</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I've noticed it happening too, and like quite a few of the previous posters I'm pretty sure it's tied in with mob melee resistance. Ikaavs take increased damage from bows, for example but seem to take less damage from pretty much anything else. I know a couple of monks who mentioned a certain mob type to take more damage from h2h weapons.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you're figthing in OoW or GoD, you might notice crit messages and actual damage done not to match, but it can work both ways, sometimes you'll do less, some times you'll be doing more damage than the crit says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Az, the ukuns are actually resistant to blunt. Say you get this message:<br />
<br />
You score a critical hit (250)<br />
You slash An Ukun for 225 damage!<br />
<br />
What that means is although the damage should have been 250, you actually only did 225, because the mob resisted 10% of the blunt damage.<br />
<br />
This happens on many mobs in oow; it's painfull obvious on most ikaavs in MPG where youll get a crit message of like 650 and only do 450 damage or so.<br />
<br />
Edit: I just read the above post, and it mentions that the example of the ukun could be that the crit should have done 225, but actually landed for 250. I'm pretty sure that it's not the case; the line following the crit is how much actual damage is done, and based on the crit damage (calculated before the mobs resistance is taken into consdideration) you can tell if the mob is resistant/susceptible. I'm not sure if this is the case though.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen a crit message for say XXX, while the following line shows XXX+20 or so? Meaning the mob is susceptible?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have seen a crit message say <br />
'Darkgecko scores a critical hit! (1256)'<br />
You slash %t for 1694 points of damage.<br />
<br />
This was during an event where mob mitigation/susceptability was the key to victory tho...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The Taskfiends in MPG are this way with blunt weapons.  I don't remember the exact % though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">kyvs = bow resistant, other are normal<br />
nocs = slash resistant, blunt works better, others are normal<br />
mastrugs = blunt resistant, slash works better, others are normal<br />
ukuns = blunt resistant, other are normal<br />
ikaavs = resistant to all but bows (piercing?)<br />
discordlings = resistant to slash I think<br />
dragorns = ?<br />
girplans = ?<br />
stone golems = ?<br />

<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ikaav's mitigation comes from a spell (Chaos Guard).  They don't have any mitigation to the basic 3 weapon types.<br />
<br />
Discordling take 110% damage from blunt.  That's about the only weapon weakness I've noticed.  Pretty sure Ukuns are not weak against blunt in OoW but if so, it'd be 110% like they're in GoD.  It's worth noting that mobs of the same model do not necessarily have the same weaknesses, at least not across zones.<br />
<br />
In trial of weaponry you'd see a lot of things like:<br />
<br />
You score a crit (500)<br />
You slash XXX for 2000.<br />
<br />
The slash XXX for XYZ is the actual damage you done applying resistance/weakness.  The damage from crit is what you should have done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some mobs in OoW take more damage from archery, I've noticed the crits on pulls for it.. (and some take less damage too ) I tried to make a list of mobs one time but beer and lack of sleep made me forget ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ikaav are universally casters: All Ikaav(Or almost all ikaav) self cast a very high HP, 50% Vie effect, and a similar Callaiv effect. Dispell an Ikaav that's been alive for more than 30 seconds since spawn until your caster's dispell keys wear out, and you'll do a lot better against them.<br />
<br />
From one of the Quests in game in GoD:<br />
A Kyv Sample <br />
<br />
Alexsa Whyte says 'Ah yes, the kyv. These stealthy beings are quite elusive. The fact that you were able to recover a sample from one of them is quite an accomplishment. Now, let's see . . . it appears that the kyv have no noticeable weapon weaknesses or resistances, but we do know they have the ability to deflect incoming arrows and thrown objects. It would seem that they are also resistant to poison based incantations, and quite weak to magic based spells. You're doing great, but there are more samples left to be found. Please get them to me as soon as you can.' <br />
<br />
A Mastruq Sample <br />
<br />
Alexsa Whyte says 'Great sample! It looks like this was taken from a being with a thickened hide. This particular being is called a mastruq and seems to be quite resistant to blunt objects, but an arrow or slashing weapon would get through that hide quite easily. Because of their thick hides cold based elemental magic would be quite ineffective while the opposite would hold true for fire magic. You're doing great, but there are more samples left to be found. Please get them to me as soon as you can.' <br />
<br />
A Noc Sample <br />
<br />
Alexsa Whyte says 'Looks like this came from the body of the race of beings called the noc. While their bony frames make them quite weak against crushing damage, their plated chests protect any major organs, reducing the effectiveness of arrows or slashing weapons. It would appear that their flesh is diseased which makes them resistant to disease based spells but their thin skin means that cold might be quite affective against them. You're doing great, but there are more samples left to be found. Please get them to me as soon as you can.' <br />
<br />
A Ratuk Sample <br />
<br />
Alexsa Whyte says 'This looks like a sample from the brutish ra'tuk. These large beasts wield their axes adeptly and seem to have no major weaknesses save magical based spells. Because of their strange body makeup magic tends to affect them more then other spell types. You're doing great, but there are more samples left to be found. Please get them to me as soon as you can.' <br />
<br />
An Aneuk Sample <br />
<br />
Alexsa Whyte says 'These odd-looking floating beings interest me the most. They seem to be quite adept with magic making them strong against magical incantations. You're doing great, but there are more samples left to be found. Please get them to me as soon as you can.' <br />
<br />
An Ikaav Sample <br />
<br />
Alexsa Whyte says 'These snakelike beings are very deadly. The scales on their lower body are all but impervious to slashing weapons, but a well-placed arrow could do some serious damage. They are masters of magical energy making their defenses against such spells very good. However they do seem to be weak against elemental magic like cold. You're doing great, but there are more samples left to be found. Please get them to me as soon as you can.' <br />
<br />
An Ixt Sample <br />
<br />
Alexsa Whyte says 'These centaur-like beings are quite bloodthirsty. They appear to be bred for fighting. Their fur covered lower half makes them very resistant to the element of cold but while that fur can protect them from one element it also makes them very vulnerable to fire. You're doing great, but there are more samples left to be found. Please get them to me as soon as you can.' <br />
<br />
An Ukun Sample <br />
<br />
Alexsa Whyte says 'An excellent find here! It appears that this was retrieved from one of the beings called an ukun. They have frail bodies but their blood is a deadly poison. This would imply that they are probably very resistant to poison. You're doing great, but there are more samples left to be found. Please get them to me as soon as you can.'</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ukuns are resistant to arrows too, at least the Elites in WoS, got a bow Crit on a pull, and the damage done was less than the crit message.<br />
<br />
Great post there Arathena :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most zones don't actually have the mitigation/weakness you'd expect based on the GoD quest.  It'd appear this property was simply turned off for a vast majority of mobs, probably because it'd cause a lot of headaches having to switch weapons around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarran Loreweaver</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From personal experience:<br />
<br />
Ikaav and Mastruq are weak to archery.<br />
<br />
Nothing I have encountered is weak to slashing.<br />
<br />
Noc and Kyv are strong against archery.<br />
<br />
Golems are strong against slashing.<br />
<br />
Everything resists like mad.</div></div><hr />
