<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Still wouldn't be as bad as the time Raaj came to Test and made a freakin dark elf enchanter.  I think it crashed the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">raaj is a good bard..really</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Brutul-hon, you didn't tell him the important part.  No really good twink stuff until level 10... or was it 15...  20?  Hmm, I can't remember now...<br />
<br />
Ya know, it's been along time since I've terrorized little baby wood elves.  I think I'll have to stop by good ol' Faydark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/hugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>tarsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ya, arboreans suck, bigtime. I got boots, gloves, two bracers, and components for legs... if I can get the arboreans to drop what I need..<br />

And, it was a blast of a weekend yet again. My face hurts from smiling and laughing so much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Korak Sarathai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Ahh, mithril twohanded sword, a fine blade.  I fondly remember mine and the TBB I traded for it.  How different the economy was before Kunark :).<br />
<br />
I'm glad you're having fun again Shik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Funny part is I am terrified to hang onto the Mithril 2Her.<br />
<br />
wayyy back yonder when Kunark was first discovered; Shikarii had a Mithril 2Her. He was a killing machine with it. In Cazic I was going through Lizards left and right; and we'd alpha loot FS weapons to sell....bad part is I had a bag full of FS 2Hers..and in there I stuck my Mithril 2Her.....went to go see the merchant in Rathe Mtns..and wondered why I got 9 platinum for a FS 2Her.....than my heart stopped :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The HoH that Five lent me has the same effect on me.  Looks exactly like the half-dozen orc fang and cougar claw earring in my bank.  Haven't sold any of the earrings for fear of accidentally putting that thing on my vendor for 15pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Five</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">/laughs<br />
<br />
Brutul - Took me a sec to figure out why you would think I gave you a Hall of Honor something.  LOL.  Yes, yes, I haven't had coffee yet.  /hugs and kisses  Can't tell you how much we love your company.<br />
<br />
Shik - Don't worry for coin, mkay.  /laughs  We don't really have a huge use for it on Test.  Just kinda point at the mob that drops it and we'll go kill it.  /hugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Five</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Oh!  That reminds me.  Did we do the PoTC quests yet, Brutul?  If not, let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">than go kill vendorgrrl or whatever her name is in the bazaar and loot me some more halas pies and grobb liquid meat :D Elf's gotta eat ya know ..<br />
<br />
Brutul:Looks exactly like the half-dozen orc fang earrings...<br />
<br />
Which reminds me :D Save me 2 of them if you didn't sell them yet if you could be so kind ... stupid elf_boy picks his nose and he's encumbered</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Five</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">ROFL!  OMG, I just noticed Shik's title. Okay, I think I hurt something holding in that laugh.<br />
<br />
No worries, elf boy.  We wouldn't want you to starve or anything...  /giggles  Gonna have to ask around /gu for some decent rings for you.<br />
<br />
So, when are you going to be level 40?  /grins wickedly<br />
