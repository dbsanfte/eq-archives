<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KAELZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently joined a new to elemental guild after my other guild disbanded, I have all the possible upgrades I can get in elementals.   Looking for advice on what to horde for in Time and considering hording until DBoTW or BP or Quarm loot.   Most in guild still need many upgrades and They will contintue looting until we kill cornaiv (about 2 months til fully time enabled im guessing)<br />
we have done rathe once, xegony twice etc.   <br />
ears, signet of might and whispering air bangle<br />
aten neck<br />
mask if piety (my weakest slot prob)<br />
full raex other than bp (have aten bp)<br />
ring of destruction and air haste ring<br />
bow <br />
orb of evasion<br />
ice cloak from VT....125hp 40ac (auged)<br />
belt of mastery<br />
<br />
I dont see spending DKP to upgrade any of the above in the elementals (if the options at hand in elementals are even considered upgrades) and estimate ill be in top 10 in dkp by the time we get to time if not top 5.   looking for help on upgrades that will be not only substatial but also the rare/hard to get items.   im fully ldon auged 8300ish hp and so am in no hurry to upgrade considering most guild tanks will be less than that when we hit time.   Is Quarm loot worth DKP hording for 4 months?  Raex bp worth while over aten vs. hording for more quarm loot?  advice needed plz.   I dont see us doing GoD for some time and am considering picking up glyph prayer ring to replace ring of destruction and not going to upgrade haste ring either.   im sure pauldrons of devastation will fit in somewhere but not sure how the rest of the loot will (i would like to keep all my raex's with exception of quarm bracer)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>quirkyguy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well depending how your system works...  I don't know how yuor stuff is priced, etc.  But i'd go for earring from phase 3 saryrn loots; girdle of intense durability , EoE, symbol, RZ loots; ring, cloak, bp, mask, dbotw, shield* timestone adorned ring 'forgot who drops it' that's about it besides quarm earring, bracer.  Just my personal opinion. for a haste item you just might have to take helm from VZ, or earring from TT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haramdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">faceguard of frenzy, necklace of eternal visions, pauldrons of devastation, platinum cloak/fiery guard, intense girdle - add 10ac from augs on all.<br />
<br />
replace air haste ring with Rallos ring and whispering air with Terris ear, for other ring you *will* get a glyphed ring eventually if you do trials, so keep that in mind like you mentioned.  for quarm focus on silver hoop and bracer, grab an edge when you can, very solid weapon.<br />
<br />
range is easy - serrated dart, mystical globe, symbol, vallon bow all are good ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In your situation i would wait and get a BP, EOE, DBoTW and whore up quarm.  If you are fully elemental geared, then just horde like you said, get the hard to get shit from quarm and rallos, then buy up the more common items while everyone else is saving for the hard to get stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">quarm cloak has less ac than the RZ one or phase 3 one, but shielding mod if your into that.<br />
<br />
bertox boots seem to be a hot favourite too, although a bit of a lateral upgrade from ele.<br />
<br />
the TT earring is pretty common drop for haste item.<br />
<br />
the tier 5 legs are also decent, again a bit of a lateral upgrade but shielding mod and +cha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only thing Bertoxx boots provide for a Warrior is a few HP and minor stats.<br />
<br />
The mod on them are worthless for Warriors. We're capped at taunt already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I never bought into the whole symbol of planemasters thing, I would stick with a bow.<br />
<br />
(am i the only person who doesnt have the buffslots for all this shit?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Err.......... it imbues your weapon with a stun proc. (Hello, agro!)<br />
<br />
It can be used simultaneously with a BoW, you know.. .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im sure its great if you really need the extra aggro, all the wars in my guild have grabbed one.  Ive never really have had much problem with keeping a mobs attention without one though.  Some people seem to like the VZ orb also for the extra avoidance, im not the #1 MT for my guild like you though, so I guess views can be skewed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I guess if you don't intend on tanking, and since WA kinda triviliazes agro, and imbue procs aren't affected by Weapon Affinity, it may not be a priority.<br />
<br />
Still, I like the additional agro for one group scenarios, but to each their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">since WA kinda triviliazes agro <br />
<br />
This has been a pretty dangerous AA for me latly, having to watch myself real hard when not tanking.<br />
<br />
A good one none the less though.</div></div><hr />

I never bought into the whole symbol of planemasters thing, I would stick with a bow.<br />
<br />
(am i the only person who doesnt have the buffslots for all this shit?)  <br />
<br />
I picked up a SoTP last week, the proc is a very noticeable agro addition.  I'd rather have the extra agro over an ATK buff anyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">think he meant bow as in archery, arrow etc, no blade of war</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yeah i gathered that =) was just explaining my choice over a bow.. to be honest i haven't used a bow much since incite came out.</div></div><hr />
