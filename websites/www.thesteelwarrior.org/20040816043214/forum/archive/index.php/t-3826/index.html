<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cerrena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I sometimes play my level 58 warrior. Sometimes I play my level 59 enchanter while a friend plays the warrior. Sometimes I just play the enchanter. With virtue, my warrior has 1280 AC and over 4200 health. When tanking, I usually duel wield with a bloodsworn in one hand and a frostbringer in the off hand. My dex is usually 255. I know it's not the best stuff, but I've seen people wandering around with a lot worse.<br />
<br />
This topic is on my mind because I was playing the enchanter with a  58 paladin last night. When my room-mate plays Cerrena and I play my enchanter I have to be deadly careful with tashes and slows. I usually wait until the monster's health has dropped to a certain point, slow (not tash), hope it isn't resisted, and then tash or cripple, depending.<br />
<br />
Last night, when I played the enchanter with the 58 paladin tanking it took me a while to get use to the fact that I could immediately tash and then immediately slow without a lot of worry. I did sometimes get agro, but the paladin had no trouble stunning to get it off of me.<br />
<br />
From my warrior's prespective, I've done the best I can to get equiptment that has decent taunt procs. I've experimented with a lot of weapons, and my dex is as high as I can get it. I'm still stuck waiting for a random proc before I get enough agro. Maybe I should start doing more LDoN as my warrior, and endure the long periods where I'm looking for group, and endure the groups with poorly equipted people who don't know how to play their class and crawl through a dungeon. On the other hand, I can do LDoN with my enchanter, where I won't spent a lot of time LFG and I have a class that can guarantee a win in even a marginal group. Shelving the character and waiting for Sony to fix something might be a good alternative.<br />
<br />
From the enchanter's perspective, you grab a tank to mitagate the amount of mana your party needs to spend healing. The more damage you keep on the tank the better the party's damage mitagation is. The faster and more reliably I can get a slow off the better the party's damage mitagation is. Heals on tanks are almost always efficient complete heals or heals over time. Heals on the enchanter are usually very costly fast heals.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that warriors can't tank. If the enchanter is dying in a warrior tanked group then the fault is with the enchanter; they should know how to manage agro because that half of what playing their class is about. If that means slows go off a bit later and you lean on the healer a bit more then that's the true cost of having a warrior as your tank. By the way, it is somewhat telling that my enchanter is higher level than my warrior, and my warrior is my main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Is Guts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Being a 2 boxer with a shammie can honestly say I have next to zero problems with aggro .... while 2 boxing. <br />
<br />
3 mobs inc np attack each in turn get em all slowed etc, can even slow on inc if warrior gets singles (casting slow to land as warrior turns and slams).... too many?  off tank with pet then let god and luck sort em out :)<br />
<br />
Then go into a group with warrior only ... inc mob,  the mob is all over the place ?!?<br />
<br />
So gets a comment about knights pfft !<br />
<br />
&quot; War have the hit points and are used to playing with no spells etc .... try casting a little later&quot;<br />
<br />
Seems to work after that ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh shaman and enchanter are two different stories entirely.  I have a 65th lvl enc alt, and I agree that as horrible as it sounds, I preferr a pally to a warrior when not 2 boxing, which is why there are so many voices to fix warriors.<br />
<br />
Don't need snap agro, don't need super agro... just need ENOUGH agro that enc doesn't get raped when tash is followed by slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cerrena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know what, I don't want &quot;just enough.&quot; I want taunt as good as the Paladins and Shadow knights. I want hit points and disciplines that balance against the their stuns, heals, snares, death touches, and fein deaths. If I don't get taunt, I want health to balance out the fact that I'm taking damage from unslowed mobs longer than a paladin will be. It'll be a lot of damage, so I want a lot of health.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, I want it all at level 58, and I don't want it to be an AA point thing or a LDoN thing. You don't fix a class that has a hard time getting a group by making them get a bunch of group xp; that's just mean.</div></div><hr />
