<br />
Cleric/Warrior/Bard would be really trivial with good gear.</div></div><hr />

Took about 35 mins due to the fact we had an alt (me) and a wiz which isn't suited for long fights on M'shas with their resists. Druid stayed at 80m+ the whole fight.<br />
<br />
The thing about the M'sha is that if your gonna do them with low numbers do it with 1 group, and only add another group if you have 2 healers in it or another bard, otherwise the time taken vs the AE dmg is not worth it. Hardest M'sha fight we have ever done was with 3 groups and 1 bard, which was harder than 1 group, but that was our second day in Qvic.</div></div><hr />

Biggest pita for us was not the M'Shas, but keeping all the trash down between the zone-in cubby and M'Nat before respawns.<br />

With a bard, one-grouping is certainly doable.  I don't see the warr/cleric duo happening anytime soon, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A very good bard can pull the Msha's without cleaering all the trash.  Clearing the trash is usually a good idea though, since a lot of times the meldstones andn ot the armor are the limiting factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">could be DUOed, however it will take a very long time(will have repops). I would say war, cleric and bard with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be certain; Warrior, Cleric, Bard, and three DPS classes will own any of the M`Sha. <br />
<br />
Warrior, Cleric, Bard could do it themselves if their gear is excellent. However, I always recommend having a Shaman for their awesome heal over time (spiritual serenity.) A shaman with full healing aa, is just simply incredible.<br />
<br />
If you are new to Qvic, don't try doing M`Sha without a bard per group unless you have a surplus of paladins and other healers (wave heals can be beneficial if you're not resisting the AEs).<br />
<br />
The key for Mnat, don't pull her to zone in. Have a rogue go around SoS and cautiously explore a bit, because without completely &quot;spoiling&quot; (not really sure that's a big deal for Qvic but eh) the M`sha, there's a much better place to pull Mnat. Dvoin and Ptav to zone in though. If you really really can't find a better way, PM me or shoot me a tell on Prexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">best place to pull is where u teleport in (not all mshas)</div></div><hr />

4.  Me, bard, paladin, cleric.  All geared similarly to what I have.</div></div><hr />

If by fast you mean 20minutes. Sure.</div></div><hr />

I guess I am still only mostly elemental geared, with a few pieces I can pick up here and there.  The joys of having the Friday/Saturday time slot when you have to work almost all Friday/Saturday nights :( We killed one, ended up being just me, bard, and 2 clerics for most of the fight.  One cleric only started when the other was oom, the other zoned and came back and medded.  All my resists were in the 400 range, but I guess that isn't enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would put my lowest number at 3  <br />
<br />
pally/sk/war with good ac   as in over 2200 unbuffed  a Chanter/sham/bard/BL and preferably a cleric but can work with a druid in a pinch =p.<br />

and yer healer better not get bored  cuzz you will be =p.</div></div><hr />

1 person playing Rogue+Cleric+Cleric+Enchanter and I was playing warrior+bard.<br />
<br />
It took ~40mins per msha, keeping the mobs in front of it clear long enough to pull was more challenging then the mob itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the key to doing with small person is to make sure that every person has psalm of veeshan.  with that on it just makes it a mob with crap melee dmg, then once slowed, any priest class can keep a tank alive.  i mean most people who are in qvic+ have been in time for awhile to be able to be uquq.</div></div><hr />

Fights last in the 20-25 minute range.  I typically end up doing around half the damage (discounting DS) to the mobs.<br />

I've seen them do it with 6-12 on a regular basis with relative ease, though i'm not sure if Motz has tried to single pull them.<br />
<br />
I'd bet my ass they'll start doing it with 4 soon, so with present gear in game i bet this mob could be duo'd with warrior + shaman/cleric (if by duo you mean the 2 of them + a bot bard to afk psalm and to pull the mob in the first place).</div></div><hr />

Lowest I've ever done is with 7, but everyone was already full Qvic gear, and we didn't mean to pull Ptav =x. Cleric,Shaman,Warrior,Bard,Monk,Enchanter, Necro</div></div><hr />

They're slowable and quad for about 1600s, but they're pretty goddamn resistant and can sometimes be a bit hard to slow with just Malos/Malosinia (but it's doable cause I've done it).  They're not exatly huge dps hitters - 275 to 300dps tops on the average tank with OoW AAs.  This is well within the range of CHable, and I could CH all day long with my cleric without ever losing a hint of mana.<br />

Pets sure have come a long ways since I quit my magician back mid-PoP.  The M`shas are about as cold resistant as they are magic resistant though, so you may want to denote that in your parses.  They might not be doing as much proc damage as you may think.</div></div><hr />

Eriatha, he had /pet cast off :)  The pet was not casting at all, check his parses out silly hfl</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the first m'sha I didn't type /pet no cast so I could see what the pet dps would be (assuming no resists).  The following two fights I did with /pet no cast on to see if it made a difference or not.  Really didn't, just means that pet will do more damage guaranteed unless melee dmg is resisted.<br />
<br />
As for the procs.  The wrath of wind is a magic based proc and in general magic lands fine on m'sha after sinia / tash.  So I assumed they landed for full (like my magic based nukes do).  The Elemental Conjunction Strike is our epic 1.5 proc that has a chromatic-50 check to it-- so it will pretty much land all the time, even on the animal ring event in qvic.<br />
<br />
But in answer to your previous posts, the pets have indeed come a long way.  They are finally capable, in ideal situations, to dish out some serious damage.  And with the longer raid encounters, this seriously benefits mages (while putting other nuking classes-- i.e. wizards, at a disadvantage).</div></div><hr />

Bring me next time :)<br />
<br />
The M`Sha dps is quite low when they are debuffed and you have 500+ in all resists.  Probably about the same as an MPG or RSS trash mob.  I tank them without much trouble and my gear isn't the greatest.</div></div><hr />
