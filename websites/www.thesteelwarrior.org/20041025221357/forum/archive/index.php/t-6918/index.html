<br />
Good question. Either way I cannot in normal play notice any extra agro with Voice on, so usually just click it off to preserve buff slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How about this theory:<br />
<br />
Worn regen stacks with spell hp regen.<br />
Worn FT stacks with spell mana regen.<br />
Worn haste stacks with spell haste.<br />
<br />
Logic says worn hate stacks with spell hate.<br />
<br />
I would very much like to know, I'm using voice on and off, but how to tell if it works or not is very hard to just observe. Anyone done some testing on this?</div></div><hr />

Just like you always have room for Cha &amp; DI  :D <br />
<br />
Should be a worn non triggerable effect (unlike DS enhancers).</div></div><hr />

please just say you don't want it omg<br />

will save a SK a spell gem being wasted on a ~10min refresh spell</div></div><hr />

<br />
Echo of Anger is always on, does not need to be activated by another spell, and works as an aggro increasing modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And now for the real question : Do Echo of Anger Stack ? :)<br />
<br />
/starts dreaming of GoD loot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>RhaamanNoodles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Doubt I'll ever see a Raex BP. Similar focus effects would be nice outside of Time (less effective obviously).<br />
<br />
Seems wierd their is only 1 item w/ a focus effect of an agro modifier in the whole game so far (I'm sure theirs some undiscovered in GoD).<br />
<br />
Ahh well something to aspire too.</div></div><hr />

Holy crap, hadn't thought about that.  It doesnt' seem like they would want them to stack, but every other worn effect stacks.  My bet would be that it the highest effect takes precedent like haste items but who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, if they made them stack, it would sort of defeat the purpose of introducing another slot where you can get echo of anger. <br />
<br />
It seems to me they are probably introducing these gaunts because they want people to be able to upgrade their BP, without worrying about getting any less agro. If they stacked, people would still hold on to their Raex BPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">And from common ness of drops it makes GoD the far better place to farm because guants are usualy easyer to get then BP's from every past expansion.</div></div><hr />
