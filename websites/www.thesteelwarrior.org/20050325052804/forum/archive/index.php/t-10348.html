<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rehogan</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have my kids with me this weekend and am looking for some place new I can take them for fun and experience.  I two box a 49 warrior and 45 cleric.  My daughter plays a 46 bard and my son a 45 druid.  We have gotten tired of Dulak's which is certainly good exp and money but so boring.  We did Karnor's Castle but couldn't make it very far in.  We have been doing LDoNs a lot but they have gotten much harder with just the four of us with all the casters and such.  We have tried picking up others but so often they are BAD and get us wiped.<br />
<br />
We have the expansions up through Ykesha but not GoD or later.  We need MOB's that the bard can mez and/or charm and preferably not too many HP's as our DPS isn't the best.  We certaily are open to dungeons and have done some with pretty good success in SolB and LGuk.  Any out of the way places that are not frequented to much that we might try for the first time?  All suggestions welcome.</div></div><hr />

The zone in is safe since the re-vamp and it would no doubt be a good challenge for the 4 of you.  No idea if a bard of that level can mez any of that stuff though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think solb is your best bet.  That was my favorite dungeon for those levels and I'm currently playing my cleric there.  The xp is also tops.  The worst part about it is the camps do require a fair ammount of attention as you well know by now.  Any how that would be my reccomendation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Emerald Jungle might fit your criteria. It's certainly empty, it's outdoors, which your druid would probably like, with animal mobs (charmable, I assume), it's a bit easier than Karnor's, I think, and there's the City of Mist if you need a change of pace.<br />
It might be a little easy for you; and I doubt that zone would be the best possible experience (there's a reason why it's empty). I think the mobs are 30-45 and as I recall they don't have that many hitpoints. But there are few folks there and it's kinda different and I sense you have other goals than pure min/max activities. Might even be an epic mob around for one of you, not sure. If you set up at the base of the stairs at #2 on this map, you can pull away as you wish:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morf</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lower Guk, and Hole are nice, and empty.<br />
<br />
Lguk is empty, low hp mobs, and lots of them.<br />
<br />
Please note if doing hole, once you drop down into the half pipe near the tower this is the point of no return.  You won't be able to get out unless you gate/port - so make sure the druid is with you.  This zone generally has a lot of mobs that are easy to single pull, the aforementioned group should find it pretty challenging.  Just go in as far as your ability allows, don't push it because it can get pretty rough if you go too far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Howling stones is nice, if you take the time to get the key, Sebilis is usually vacant these days on my server as well.  Both are nice zones, but might want to wait 4 or 5 levels before you try to tackle them.  But both are great for the environment you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rehogan</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the ideas guys.  I've been doing some research and looks like we could handle the quest for the Seb keys in TT and have a shot at a Cerimonial Iksar Chestplate to boot.  Anything else we need to worry about fighting in this zone?  I doubt the experience would be the best here but we really enjoy fighting in new zones.  Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would try out the entrence and first set of undead named in Veskar.. they overall arnt to hard, would be good exp, and there is some decent loot involed, its mostlikly the most overlooked zone for the 45-60 range of players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bustauff</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">City of Mist is good, and mobs don't have to many HP, and are fairly easy to pull/mezz.<br />
Howling Stones would be real nice for you, and the key quest isn't all that hard. <br />
Velks is cool when you first get there, but after awhile it gets boring. <br />
The Orc outpost in EW is a blast, mobs have quite a bit of HP though.<br />
<br />
All 4 of these places can yeild some nice exp and decent PP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clagon</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of my favorite zones is Scarlet Desert.  You have a druid who can port you to Twilight Sea and it's just a short run to SD.  The warrior and bard can run over to Katta and bind just inside, making for a short run back if a wipe occurs.  Zoning into SD from TS, the mobs should be about right for your levels, and you will find that they increase in level as you move on around the walls of the zone towards the Grey zone-out.  I've leveled several of my toons through SD, and pulling at the Grey zone I've leveled a couple of them all the way to 60 there...plus a fair number of AA's.  While I'm not suggesting you grind in this zone for that long (I have an amazing tolerance for boredom) it's still a lot of fun.  One thing I have never found to be fun is a long and dangerous CR, and that is not a major issue in SD.  Only a few of the sun revs see invis, and the aliens and trogs are non-KoS untill you kill a ton of them.  You won't get rich there but it's something different .<br />
<br />
Oh btw, try to pick up a Lucid Shard from the revs....you'll need it for VT key later */shudder shard farming*  :)</div></div><hr />

City of mist rocks for your levels.... The mobs hit a little hard but they have like 1-1.5k hps which makes them easy to kill, and fast... I think most of the mobs are less than level 50 on the way in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Howling Stones would be a great zone for you guys. The key quest is easy, and then having to get the keys for the different wings is fun too.  Also, its kinda a linear thing if you are looking to progress through all the wings so you dont just sit in one spot and have mobs come to you.  Also, becuase it is almost all undead yu dont have to worry about runners. Overall, I think it would be very challenging for your level and very enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanzen Whacksem</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another voice of support for Howling Stones.  Not only is the xp quite nice and the zone mostly empty, but you also have very good opportunities for quality loot.  While the gear may not be all that great in today's EQ economy, those items are still very high value for tribute turn ins.<br />
<br />
And then there is Nurga, which is way up on the list of my favorite zones.  Very good xp modifier here and the mobs are well paid (4-8pp plus occassional gems and named loots).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try Acrylia Caverns.  Fair amount of casters, but they have very low HP and don't hit hard at all.  Also, the weapons they drop semi-rarely sell to vendors for over 150 pp each.  Acrylia still sells well in the bazaar for fletchers, so take a few weight reduction bags if you can.<br />
<br />
To get there, port to Grimling Forest, (make sure you have a map here) then invis, and run out of the fort, upstream for  a bit, and then look for the big grimling camp on your left.  The tunnel entrance is along there.   Run down that tunnel, which has quite a few offturns, and you'll eventually come to AC zone in.  Be warned that a few of the grimling rogue-mobs and the dogs right at the entrance can see through invis.  Just keep runnin at SoW speed and you'll blow past them.  The ZI is in the far left corner behind some rocks, in that final big room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotta vote for City of Mist. It's a great zone to even just sit and relax in; plus anything in there has the chance to drop something of relative worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was CoM one of the zones that got re-vamped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah; sadly they added stupid luclin_mutant mobs to the zone..they're not as wicked looking as the phantoms but, they're still experience. <br />
<br />
It may be just me; but I think CoM was a beautifully created zone. I wish at my level I could hunt more proficiently there. Maybe by my 50's. I think at 45 too it got a ZEM boost as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only would Acrylia be a great choice, but there's a banker nearby as well as merchants.<br />
<br />
City of Mist is a great area but will begin lb/greening out to you soon, even though the exp modifier there still makes for ok experience off those mobs.<br />
<br />
Sebilis and Howling Stones are the runners up for sure, great areas but corpserunning in either zone is a huge pita.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tineren</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Btw, after the Hole revamp a year or so ago the first door is now unlocked.  You can just cross the bridge rather than taking the drop off.  Or you can take the drop off and fight your way back up to the exit.</div></div><hr />
