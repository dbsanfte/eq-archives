I decided to give AH a shot hoping I was wrong.<br />
<br />
If I'm going to just sell it for 1.5X vendor cost it doesn't seem like it's worth the trip (time moving = time could've been spent getting $) and I think you get charged 10% desposit fee too?</div></div><hr />

I'm gonna out level any gear I buy at this point anyway and the real good loots gonna be (hopefully) bind on equip from top end bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does AH take your deposit whether or not the sale was successful?  If it does, it'd seem like if you misjudge and put a reasonably expensive item on AH and it didn't sell, the deposit alone would set you back more than the money you could make via AH from other sales.<br />
<br />
Seems like too much to second-guess the market especially since the market does some pretty strange things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the deposit is generally very low, especially if you don't auction an item for more than 8 hours. really selling for 24 hours hasn't helped or hurt my sales over the other two time options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do what I did, make an alt and mail him the items and have that alt parked at the AH.<br />
<br />
Quick easy way to avoid trips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah has been really hit or miss for me too.  Some things have sold well, but I've had a whole string of things returned to me which I then just vendored and so made less money on.  I did notice that the Heavy Mithril Breastplate which I skill up smithing with, sells decently.  I put two up, got two sales.  But I also put a buyout on them, and priced them very competitively vs. the market, so that could also be why.  I also agree about asking yourself if you'd use the item.  Some items, such as chain that's tailored to Pallys/Warriors but is like level requirement 39+, and I know there's better plate out there, I won't even bother auctioning.  Same with weapons.  If I get a drop but I know that other better weapons are easily attainable, I'll just vendor it.  18 gold away from a horse now at level 45!  Lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haas, always set a buyout and lowball the price.  Some stuff won't sell, for example post 40 mail just won't sell on alliance (only hunters can use as war/pallys have gone plate)...high agi leather gear will always sell to rogues, etc, etc.  If the item's uber I may double the default price, if its good I set it at 50% over default price and otherwise I just vendor it.  The key is use buyouts though, selling through auction is a waste of time and money.<br />
<br />
And yes the AH was designed by a retarded gerbil, someone needs to be fired over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it's common sense to use buyouts, that's why I haven't mentioned it, and have gotten the advice to use them.  Trust me, all my shit has a buyout because I see clearly how annoying it is without one, and it still hasn't improved anything.  I don't place them at ridiculous levels either, so I dunno...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno then, i've had good success with the AH.  I broke 100g at level 33 or 34 and had almost 50g left when I bought my mount at level 40.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure Paladins alone outnumber the Horde on some servers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a side note... does anyone know of a way, using macros, to switch from a 2H weapon to 1H + shield?  I had read on a WoW board somewhere, where some guy had mentioned he could do this without the screwing around of equipping and un-equipping while fighting.<br />
<br />
exemple : we keep the first two slot of the 4th bag free for switching weapons<br />
<br />
going from 2Her to 1Her + Shield<br />
/script PickupInventoryItem(16); <br />
/script PickupContainerItem(4,1); <br />
/script UseContainerItem(4,2); <br />
<br />
going from 1Her + Shield to 2Her<br />
/script PickupInventoryItem(17); <br />
/script PickupContainerItem(4,2); <br />
/script UseContainerItem(4,1); <br />
<br />
note : cosmos adds newmacro such as /stance [#] (#=1/2/3 for Battle/Deff/Berzerk) that can be added at the end of the weapon switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the Cosmos UI gives you the /equip and /unequip commands.  It doesnt depend on an item's position in a bag, just its name (which can be shift+clicked into the macro window for spelling ease =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Granted I don't weapon switch a lot, that's quite handy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check the census:  WoW census (http://www.wowcensus.com/realm_stats.php?realm=hellscream)<br />
<br />
Horde outnumber Alliance 10 to 8 (or 5/4) on your server</div></div><hr />
