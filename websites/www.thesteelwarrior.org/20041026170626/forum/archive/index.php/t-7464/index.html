<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today my guild was giving a shot at the bomber event in Inktu'ta, and since I've heard this event is DT-happy, I decided to see how much my spellshield helps.  I have 31% spellshield and I got a Bulwark of Alendar (absorbs up to 20% for 1600 spell damage).  So we screwed up and died and I got DTed, and I took 12200 damage from DT.  My total HP is about 12600 raid buffed.  Didn't have spellshield (the spell) or a Rune.<br />
<br />
I think I'll try to get a screenshot with some old world DT mobs that don't hit much.  I figure if I go in with rune/spellshield/alendar and DI my chances of surviving one is pretty good.  Any suggestions on one to use?  <br />
<br />
For anyone who cares, this also shows that spellshield is applied before runes, since 20000 X 0.69 - 1600 = 12200, and if rune is applied first the damage would be (20000 - 1600) X 0.69 = 12696.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">fear mobs are easy, or exploit RZ on the Z axis and get ported to spiroc island in PoA lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And the result is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haven't had time to try yet, been kind of busy recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd go up to sky, actually. It'll take you a little while to clear through to the first DTing isle, but putting an arrow in a mob with DT will basically guarantee you've got full health to start with. Getting a fear golem down and alone without dying will be a slightly different difficulty, thanks to happy aggro near him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Now I just need to convince some people to do it... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Headboss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What about those 7th hammer guys in POJ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Next time a guild is doing RZ just shoot him above the arean it ports you to DT isle in sky  on top of the guys head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Tribunal has a false Death Touch - They'll melee you before they blast you, I've survived one the the past by being -really- fast on the FD. They hit for a fuckton too. <br />
<br />
Ahah! There's something else you may need to watch out for. Cazic Touch, the oldworld DT, acts very, very differently from Touch of Vinitrias, the Luclin+ DT. Cazic can and will ignore things like DA, there's a non-zero chance it'll ignore Bulwark, Spellshield, etc. Dunno which touch Inktu'ta mobs use, but, it's more than likely Touch of Vinitrias, or some recycle-altered variant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Headboss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What about Shei, farm it in AR, sell loot rights?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I remember a very long time ago I saw a screenshot of Furor getting DTed for 19300 by Emperor Ssraeshza (700 for spellshield) and I'm pretty sure he just had DT like anyone else.<br />
<br />
I think fortitude and hitting a Tribunal might be the safest.  I'll try to get someone to do this then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">oldworld Deathtouch is flagged unresistable, thats why DA doesnt block it, i'm 90% sure the luclin DT's have some high resist mod, but arnt unresitable, and thats why DA blocks, but i'd have to check lucy and i forgot name of those death touchs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Original emperor Ssraeszha was more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not a big difference imo.<br />
we tried paladin disc sanctification on dread once, way back, and it didn't work. pally ate it :D<br />
and i seem to remember too what someone earlier said, oldworld DT hits straight through DA/HS/QVoX. been a while though.<br />
<br />
anyway, impressive amount of +spellshield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Looted a few more spellshield thingies yesterday, did the math, and I should have enough survive DT now too. Got Inktu'ta tonight, guess I'll be the only one yelling 'CHOOSE ME!!!!'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Problem is the bombers can also melee for about 5k, which screws up anti-DT plans quite a bit.  The lowest I've seen them hit for is about 2K and that seems to be as low as it gets, so you have to survive a minimum of 2K + DT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've got a 1200hp or so buffer, but for the first one I'm prolly just gonna pussy out and autoripo hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think they proc DT instead of casting it so if you riposte you won't actually get DTed?  Last time I got killed by one it was like miss, hit 1900, DT, dead.  If they just cast DT I should be dead before the hit 1900 part (didn't bother getting Alendar that time so 13800 would've killed me fine).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's a funky type of DT. It ignores FD and DA for a start I think, so it definitely doesn't need to come from a successful weapon hit. Maybe with VIE and another warrior shileding me....<br />
<br />
It'll probably get changed to DT=30,000 damage soon if the devs read this thread, but I think that would be a shame. A small chance of surviving a DT is kinda fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">yah but next expansion will probably have even more insane loot so high end players will have even more hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">funny post.  It's too bad that spells can't trigger DI (or couldn't when I tested it in POP).  Here is a SS of cleric innate AA di working.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Damnit, you were right. They seemed to melee through furious, either that or it ninja'ed me from behind. Had plenty for the DT, but got meleed for 2500ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">They changed Cazic Touch.  You now take 32000 from a DT.  I havent checked other spells because I wasn't sure the name of some of the other DTs, but I'm assuming they are the same way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">They changed Cazic Touch.  You now take 32000 from a DT.  I havent checked other spells because I wasn't sure the name of some of the other DTs, but I'm assuming they are the same way<br />
<br />
Heh, proof that the devs are reading our boards... I guess DT is meant to be deadly. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">death touch is death touch not really big and hurting touch!<br />
<br />
they'll prob make it so SS wont work on DT's, 32k with good spellshield seems overcomable if oow gives HP increase's like every other x pack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If your using alendar in your calculations, would gain more by using calrena, 25% instead of alendars 20% if i recall correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Alendar absorbs a max of 1600, Calrenda absorbs around 1280.  Since DT is 20K, even 20% is 4000 which is more than the max Alendar absorbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Alendar absorbs a max of 1600, Calrenda absorbs around 1280.  Since DT is 20K, even 20% is 4000 which is more than the max Alendar absorbs.<br />
<br />
ahh good point.</div></div><hr />
