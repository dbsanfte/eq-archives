<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranna Swiftpaw</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for a decent XP spot for a 53 warrior / 56 cleric.<br />
<br />
Both fairly well equipped (3700hp/1200ac on the warrior, unbuffed, 3500 manapool for cleric with mp3 and id4 focus)<br />
<br />
I've tried various places and just can't seem to find a decent XP spot.<br />
<br />
I have a ToD for slow if needbe.  I usually don't need to use it.  Depending on mana, I'll use pet hammer, MoR and maybe nuke a bit for added dps with the cleric.<br />
<br />
Velks - slow as heck<br />
<br />
OOT - Very very slow but very easy<br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye - Gorangas aren't much better than seafuries and 5 times more difficult<br />
<br />
KC - XP actually seemed decent and the mobs weren't overly difficult, even on pulls of 2 or 3.  The problem was noobs interferring and getting in the way.  Or unloading their mobs onto me.  When there was no one else in the zone though, it was great.<br />
<br />
Dulak - The boats scale up a bit too much I think.  Oceacrasher especially was a hassle (duoed with my 65 rogue and the cleric.  XP was pitiful for the difficulty. )<br />
<br />
PoJ - Best to stay AWAY from the ZO.  Rooms are alright, but I have to load stuns with the cleric otherwise I get buffs dispelled.  XP is good, but it's a lot of micromanaging.  Haven't tried deeper in with just PoJ guards.  Velks Kobolds were similarly a pain.<br />
<br />
SolB - Fairly easy aside from that spider, but pitiful XP and very slow respawn.<br />
<br />
The Hole - I did the ZI mobs without too much trouble.  I'd clear to the drop off point then rebuff and med for the next round.  I haven't been back in since the changes.  Even so, since the XP change awhile back, the Hole just doesn't seem to compare with how it USED to be.  <br />
<br />
I have seb keys on both, but haven't tried it for 2 reasons.  Lots of casters.  Shammies can be a pain.  And wizzies hurt.  Add in that they run, and things can go from alright to disastrous.<br />
<br />
I'd thought of Akheva, but I'm not sure if it'd be all that much better than Maiden's Eye.  Umbral is definitely out of the picture.  Too much ac, too many hps.<br />
<br />
Highkeep is out.  Both the barb and the dorf like having those factions.  Besides, on my server there are tons of beastlords, druids, monks and rangers messing with the guards.  Even a few 65s farming them for cash.  Not worth dealing with people interferring or deliberately training you.  Same reason I've avoided Chardok.<br />
<br />
I've thought about PoD flies, but there's usually kiters there.  I never really XPed there much with PoP (got to tier 2 right away and never looked back) so I'm not sure what they hit for really.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not so worried about loot.  Maybe enough coin to cover C3 here and there but otherwise it's no biggy.  I'm also not looking for camp spots like the Droga King (already have both weapons anyway).  I'm mainly worried about melee mobs and just good old fashioned great XP so I can hit 65 and start working on AA :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm more than happy to group for LDoN or PoP provided it's a decent group.  But doing a PoJ group with a pally as the group's only healer is a bit counterproductive.<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note, how is the new Plane of Hate for a mid 50s group?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kills take a bit of time, a tad bit longer than Tepid Deeds lasts (ToD as well), but you're pretty much guarenteed singles.  Resists can sometimes be annoying, probably a bit more so at 53.  The mobs in the forest area near the zone in are around 53 or so, I think.  Hit for about 350 or so.  They do run, but you can root or nuke them down as they do, can pull a bit away from mobs, so not that big of an issue.  The mobs move at about run 1 speed, so you might want SoW potions or a bow for pulling, if you don't have run 2+.  My cleric does use Vie to offset the damage.  Not sure if you have that, but might be worth getting.<br />
<br />
I've been duo'ing there a bit with my warrior (57-58) and cleric (64).  Works good.  Although now that I'm 59, the forest area isn't good xp anymore and I've moved on to the ramparts, killing halflings (who are 57).  For those, I use my ToD to slow, then break out the silken whip of ensnaring.  They hit a bit harder and have more hp.<br />
<br />
There's some nameds as well in the forest.  Seen a named bixie, the funky skunk, the irritating mushroom.  These summon, are a bit tougher, more hp, so be careful of them, though you should be able to kill them.  Nameds in PoM are great xp.  Really great xp.<br />
<br />
Only other issue of note is leaving the zone.  The zone exit is one of the trees and it drops you off in CS.  Not exactly a place you want to be dropped off.  So have a gate hammer, potion, some porter friends, or else do the VP thing (bind at same location, kill warrior in zone, then again at bind, rez warrior back into PoM, loot, gate cleric, rez warrior with gear out of PoM).<br />
<br />
But really, how can you go wrong with any zone that lets you kill halflings?</div></div><hr />

Zone in is a safe spot to pull to and in the entry area everything is undead. Might be a bit tough for you at the moment, without a slower, but should be able to do well in a couple levels or so. I leveled my warrior and shaman there from about 54 to 56 with another healer in group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno how overcamped your server is, but I 2 boxed my war/shm combo at PoI ZI from low through high 50s. You will want to employ ToD to get 'em slowed, and you might wanna avoid archaics since they're unslowable. Only issue is that on my server, that area tends to fill up with idiots who pull 2 mobs, panic and zone 'em. <br />
<br />
I rooted adds, but with a cleric you should be able to WoT or paci and single pull.<br />
<br />
Not only was the 2 box xp decent, but the tinkering drops sell well in bazaar and you'll pick up lots of tinkering drops, as well as plenty of class 6 batteries for the anizok shrinker. ;-)</div></div><hr />
