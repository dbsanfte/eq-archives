<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">whoa... that might be a bad thing.. this might be a good thing...I see the guide system all over again.... but question.. why do they need to know what EQ related boards you post on regularly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probably beause they want people that have a good grasp on their class and would beable to get along with their class as well.</div></div><hr />

SOE and EQ are blessed with a comeplete set of deep and well established class boards run by thried parties. <br />
<br />
I think the best way to handle what you are looking for is to go though (and work with) the administration of those boards.<br />
<br />
Just ask the mods to put out a post as to what the most pressing issues are. <br />
<br />
No insult to SOE, but there is not a class board I don't find better than what is provided here, what is provided here can be removed at any moment, and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from when these were the whineplay boards.<br />
<br />
Use the community that has sprung up around the game. And you won't have to deal with the issuses of being offical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">some class's (bers, bards, beastlords) are much more fractured board wise then other class's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I vote raaj or frod to be our rep, frod is a data monkey and knows his shit but he doesnt hate paladins :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you notice it says &quot;Correspondent&quot; and &quot;Collect Information&quot;.  So it's not going to be one person going &quot;I think i speak for all warriors when I say...we want epic 2.0 that procs pet falcons&quot; or some such shit.<br />
<br />
It seems like it will be a person who goes to community boards (like this) and posts polls or something on issues of class balance, etc..  Then returns to the devs and says &quot;Hey 99.9% of warriors said they would prefer slow death to an epic 2.0 that proc'd pet falcons&quot;<br />
<br />
So it looks like the potential for things to go horribly wrong is slight...at least with our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Remember... the person has to be fairly unbiased. The reason why I personally am worried is that I just don't know what criteria they're going to base it off of. There are posters on the EQlive boards who have 700+ posts whom I disagree with almost every time, even on fundamental things. There are people that would filter the information too much, only passing on things they thought was worthwhile. There are people who would pass on every idiotic idea that was mentioned. If SOE is to rely on this person at all, it'd have to be a very good choice. Personally, I think we should find our own class correspondent on our boards.</div></div><hr />
