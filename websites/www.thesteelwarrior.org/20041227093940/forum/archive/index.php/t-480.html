<br />
Was this a mistake?  <br />
<br />
Are there instances when I would want to use 1hed taunt weapons instead of BoW? <br />
<br />
 When I am trying not to agro, I switch to Primal 2her.  What is your perspective?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although from other peoples impressions of the BoW I doubt you would ever use a BoC again or the SoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same hulanta :)    BoW or Primal 2HS.<br />
<br />
I cannot think of any situation where Dual wield will be better than BoW.<br />
<br />
I have zero problems getting &amp; holding agro. I love the stats.<br />
Sure i looce ac/hp , but who cares ) i<br />
I'm still paranoid about ripostes.<br />
<br />
I'd probably be tempted by BF +   Earth Aegis/Mallet.<br />
But since i dont have BF case closed.  <br />
(BoC sux for ac/hp &amp; proc rate, HG maybe instead)<br />
<br />
Imo the best combo for us is :  <br />
BoW (tanking) Primal+Air/Fire 30/20 2handers.<br />
<br />
All things said, i have a BoW, if i get a shot at a BF (or HG)<br />
Or another 1H EB weapon, i will take if for &quot;turtle mode&quot;<br />
Hoping i can get a decent shield later in the game (better than fire)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have both 1h and 2h options and I'm normally wielding the bow.  Their are times when Bloodfreenzy/boc are nice but not often. (when large numbers of mobs are mez'd and you have to get instant aggro and can't wait that second for taunt to recycle)<br />
<br />
BOW is beter than the boc and bloodfreenzy is right in the middle between the two.  <br />
<br />
Wrack up some aa's in the first fort in fire and you will be a killin machine.  Venture on Hulanta.<br />

<br />
Also you probably already know this but I'd try to grab a commonish pure DPS 2h soon, like a Crow Footed Lance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danathor</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You did the right thing if people in your guild need BoC/SoD.  Since I got my Blade of War the only time I've used 1handers is when I want avatar (I only have a primal 1hs, no 2hander =/) or when I'm not tanking occasionally (I sometimes still use BoW when not tanking, I just click off call of fire and turn attack off if I start proccing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tossed my Blade of Carnage back to the guild as soon as my Blade of War hit my primary slot. I really cant think of any situation that 1handers would be significantly better than the BoW (well, maybe if youre tanking Seru or something, but he doesnt count!). Even in non-tanking situations, I usually dont have a problem taking aggro from the ma. I will cycle in my 2h Prismatic Axe every now and then for procs, but those are the only weapons i carry around now a days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Granthor</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of my 1 handers now reside in my bank.  I carry a couple of different 2 handers around but really I can only think of 2 fights where I bag my Blade of War.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last night doing Warmaster G, I did AHBS/Pet weapon dual wield to try not to get aggro on the memblurring mob.  I think that while under disc on blurring mobs I'd use BF/BOC but switch back to BoW when memblurr goes.  About the only simplification that getting the BoW did is I banked the primal warsword and just use prismatic axe on xp groups :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and BF/Pet weapon owns for bragging about hp on magelo :)  250 hp vs BoWs 175.  Really need to make BoW be 250 hps as well, if casters get it in fire we should get it from RZ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bagged all my 1 handers minus 2 the moment i got my BoW.  My willsapper which still comes in handy and my Blade of Carnage just to have something to go with the willsapper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you did the right the the BoW is ungodly and you should have no problem keeping aggro in a Tier 3 group and lower just makes it easier.   BoC is kinda lame at your level but I would take it.  Overall I don't think you'll need dual wield until you get some insane 1h weps or are the MA or SA of guild even then I'm not that high so don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah -- I am MA and SA sometimes!  And we are dancing all over the planes!  I think the BoW works okay for most of the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have a BoW, thing never drops when I am around but I do have a stone etched war sword (45/30 procs rune3). I also have  a bloodfrenzy and hategiver, personally I prefer using the bf and hg over the stoned etched war sword, even though rune3 is fairly good agro. I'd have to say if I got a BoW, I'd probably start off with the bf/hg combo, then switch during the fight, once I felt I had established clean agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our tanks that weild BoW do so almost exclusively. Other than the occassional BoC+shield, its BoW all the time. And speaking from a caster stand point, BoW PWNZ in exp groups. I PoF I can basically chain nuke with little fear of agro when a BoW warrior is tanking. I did a test back when SoE had nuke agro all screwed up and in an hour of fighting at fort1 in PoF, I got agro exactly 4 times while clipping along at over 200DPS. The few times I did get agro where when I cast very early in the fight and landed a big crit (nuking at 99%, critting 3k+).<br />
<br />
BoC is kinda lame at your level but I would take it.<br />
<br />
Just a little side note - BoC is never lame, at any level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutalliss</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda like to dual wield. Currently wielding BF/render, and have a BoC for backup equip if I need more EB procs. Dont normally needs this though.<br />
<br />
With 1407 atk (305 str avatar AoB and clicky) I do from 80 to 110 dps in PoV. 95 being average.<br />
<br />
AAs are CF3, Raging Flurry 3, Ferocity 3, tact mast 1, stalwart 2.<br />
<br />
With ranger buffs, dps seems to increase quite abit doing over 100 dps most times. In VT with 1600+ atk I do from 100 to 145 dps.<br />
<br />
Im thinking to test one last 1 hander out, the doubled edged stormblade, that 17/20 cold plus 1. Going from BoC to BF in main hand gave about 5 to 10 dps increase to suspect agnarrs blade to add an additional 10 to 15 dps. That would bring my dps to about 90 to 130 in PoV. finishing off AAs im thinking that the most ill ever get out of duwl wielding with 1407 atk is average of 120 dps in PoV.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now from what I can read, BoW will outdam this /shrug, so not even sure I wanna bother setting up a super dualwield setup. Thinks kinda shame that there will be such big difference in dps. I hope some day I get to wield BoW, then I can run dps test myself in PoV.<br />
<br />
So to answer the original question, will you need 1 hander when you get BoW?<br />
<br />
My answar is:<br />
<br />
In most cases no, but have a 1 hand setup, if not for efficiency, then for fun ! also, wielding BoW when not MTing i think will be a hazard as you can snag aggro if you get a streak of procs and flurries off.</div></div><hr />
