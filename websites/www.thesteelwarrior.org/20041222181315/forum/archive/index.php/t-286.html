<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gardack</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, long time lurker at the old boards and decided to finally post on the new boards. Wanted to get your guys feedback on future goals for weapons.<br />
<br />
I'm MT in a decent size guild on Vallons Zek that farms stuff like AoW, burrower, and working our way through ssra and PoP mobs. Here's my current set up, http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=31117 .<br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure out what weapon to go for next. I'm sure we could kill Cursed if we ever find him up, so Bloodfrenzy is one option. Also plan to start working on a Arx key for getting to Lord Inquisitor Seru, so BBB is another option. None of the PoP weapons except the Blade of War and maybe stuff from Elementals would be that much of an agro upgrade, but doubt we'll be at that level for another 6 months or so.<br />
<br />
I'm curious to know if BBB is good enough agro to tank the big mobs like Bertox, MM, etc as we go through PoP or if I should go for the second EB weapon? I prefer using 2h weapons both for pvp and pve purposes. I tanked using a primal 2h and TSBS till I saved up for a SoD, then later was awarded the BoC.<br />
<br />
I realize BF / BoC would be better agro, but wouldn't the ripostes kill me on the big encounters? We're finishing up with Aerin Dar, Behemoth, Grummus and Terris Thule and starting to work on Agnarr, Carpin Ring, HoH trials and the Zeks next. I don't think ripostes are as big a factor until we hit MM and Bertox level mobs where they hit for 2k+, but i could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post any feedback, especially if you have experience with these weapons. I checked the stickied thread at the top about agro weapons and BBB was lower on the list than I expected from all the good things I've heard about it.</div></div><hr />

I dont care how many ppl argue with me till their blue in the face, its not good for getting aggro, in fact its a chore. Holding aggro is another story, but still, Id go with a BoC and a BF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You dont really &quot;need&quot; a 2 hander in PoP. Its a plus however.<br />
<br />
-If you want a good 2hander wait until HP of SSRA.<br />
That 2H kicks ass both for dps &amp; agro. (its like a huge SoD)<br />
I dont see any other alternative before RZTW. <br />
(no emp aint for wars, maybe seru when def drops)<br />
<br />
-Dual Wield... That will of course give you the best agro.<br />
Just remember to change whend defensive drops.<br />
Get BF/HG/BoC and a shield from BoT or any other ac40+ hp100 shield.<br />
<br />
Tanking 2K5 hitters with defensive is max 1200 per riposte.<br />
We can live with that.  However when def drops its a killer<br />
<br />
After farming elemental planes for 5 months this is what i'd say :<br />
Most PoP fight have a duration from 4 to 8 mins ....<br />
<br />
<br />
1) BF/BoC/HG dualwield with defensive<br />
2) BF/BoC/HG with shield when defensive down<br />
3) BF/BoC/HG with 2H when defensive down<br />
4) Fulltime 2H tanking (hard to before RZTW, <br />
    (exept maybe with Norge'Tal, HP SSRA 2HS) <br />
<br />
I was lucky to get a Blade of War, before that my combo was :<br />
BBoE (exiled) + BoC (Avatar) +  Ac55 hp100 (shield)<br />
<br />
It worked for me, it will work for you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you just really cant count on getting a BF, they dont drop like rain from the sky and cursed is usally a slightly contested mob if not rotated.<br />
<br />
BoC does drop like rain from the sky, one pester here said they didnt get one in 9 kills, but they must not be living right = P, normally 1 if not 2 drops every kill.<br />
<br />
duel wielding prob work ok like you said till bertoxx and MM, after defensive is gone, there is simply no way you will tank them duel wielding without some supah healing. its best to try and single tank them as switching on a mob hitting as hard as they do really sucks. both our bertoxx kills have been messy due to MT dieing after defensive is out and getting to the next tank is a bear. some ppl duel wield till defensive is out and then switch up, since at that point there is really no way your gonna lose agro and the stupid ppl who couldnt control their agro are dead anyways.<br />
<br />
no matter what anyone says, no weapon builds agro fast enough, if ppl attack a second or two after you while in defensive, they can kiss it goodbye. you're doing 40 percent less dmg hitting like some sissy. if they dont wait at least 7 or so secs, no weapon is going to keep agro.<br />
<br />
norg'tal works great for me like above poster stated, decent proc rate with a double taunt of stun+knockback. HP can be stingy though = ( . im sure BBB would work fine if you get the necessary lead time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimwit</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BBB works great.<br />
<br />
Great for getting aggro, great for holding aggro.<br />
<br />
I built my character around using 2h weapons, and bought offensive aa's specifically for the purpose of greater aggro control and they paid off. Many of the people who whine and cry their 2h's have no aggro on this board haven't so much as bought flurry from 3 expansions ago in luclin much less the multiple PoP offensive aa's availible to them, and still wonder why any other warrior will out perform them.<br />
<br />
I have used my BBB to tank everything up to and including the Elemental Mini Bosses in PoP (excluding the actual gods themselves as I had since upgraded to a BoWar as of the time of my personal engagement with them)<br />
<br />
If you are lucky enough to get a BBB I would reccomend you make an effort to get the most out of your 2h and Train Punishing Blade 3 and Ferocity 3. Personally I also finished Tactical Mastery and am in the process of finishing Fury/Flurry, which will add even more aggro.<br />
<br />
When using a 2 hander as your primary aggro control weapon there are a couple things to be aware of in order to make the most of it.<br />
<br />
2h Weapons can generate so much aggro not only because of their proc, but because of the potential for massive DPS bursts. Mobs notice when a ferocity/pb/flurry warrior is frequently swinging at them them 3/4/5/6 times a round. If you aren't main tank and you are going full throttle into a mob with a BBB without turning attack off, you're either gonna be target #1 when he dies or you are going to start pulling aggro off him whether you want to or not. It's just the nature of this weapon, it is an aggro magnet, and I've had to learn my lesson the hard way hehe.<br />
<br />
The flipside to relying on it's frequent bursts of potential damage as well as a proc for flat out aggro control is that if you are fighting a mob that frequently has you stunned for long durations or has you slowed by 90% for long durations between cures, you lose that edge you had with DPS aggro, and a dual EB warrior is going to come out ahead due to the fact he will proc more, even if his DPS is in the toilet too for the same duration. This goes for BoWar, BBB, SEWS, N'T, GSoTS or any other aggro 2h out there. <br />
<br />
Part of knowing how to use a 2h right is knowing how to manage your aggro, both when you want it and when you don't. So obviously if you are going to fight a mob that procs a 5 second stun frequently you will want to structure your tanking around the stun and learn to adapt from the standard strategies used on most boss fights. An obvious example of a mob that procs stun relentlessly and really screws with 2h users are the Generals in PoFire. You're better off using evasive on these guys (not only to avoid the 3kdd portion of the proc) but also to avoid the constant stuns associated with having them proc on you every other round they land their hits. You will notice a huge difference on these guys in particular being defensive or being evasive as far as aggro on concerned.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up, if you want to use a 2h, prepare yourself for them and make an effort to train your any aa that will add extra swings to your attacks, the difference in aggro is remarkable, and well worth putting an effort into. If you haven't even put a single point of aa into a 2h skill like Punishing Blade and you want to stand around talking trash about 2h weapons, you're just uninformed and unaware of your real potential. BF/BoC users can put less effort into their weapon skills and still maintain aggro due to more frequent proc rates by default, but that in no way means 2h users are anything less than godly when they have a good weapon/aa and mange their aggro correctly. We will do more DPS, Hold the Same aggro, and take less damage with a 2h weapon at the current stage of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lies!<br />
<br />
We still need to have our aggro war, Im thinking maybe guarding of Tunare in PoG.  Both of us attack with no taunts until hes around 50% then I shut off attack and see how long it takes you to get aggro back :p<br />
<br />
Hes got 200k hp and hits for shit btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I xp often with a war BF/BoC and i use BoW.<br />
<br />
We do have an AA difference, that we balance with buffs.<br />
(Swift like the wind + Brell    vs  Vallon + Full ranger)<br />
<br />
And guess what :)<br />
<br />
I completely OWN him agro wise (no taunt usage allowed).<br />
<br />
2H beat 1H in both Agro &amp; DPS, the difference is soooo huge.<br />
But they give out less hp, and less ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HamkChai</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i am going to agree with the above posters about 2h tanking...<br />
<br />
especially with something like High Priest 2hs, which has a nice ratio and a proc, it gets and holds aggro pretty well.<br />
<br />
we are not uber enough to meet those big hitters in PoP yet (best we have tried is bertoxx, but we wiped by messing with position). so i can't tell the difference in &quot;2x 1h vs 2h tanking on riposte&quot;, but what i can tell is, 2h weapon with good ratio gets aggro pretty fast, probably faster than 2x 1h. well unless ur 1h setup is a great ratio ones.<br />
<br />
the reason behind i think is that, we warriors ONLY have 3 means to get aggro; Taunt (which we always do), DPS and Procs. i am not a developer of EQ, so i cant tell how well a weapon is going to proc. but for DPS, i am sure a good ratio 2h weapon will out do any 2x good ratio 1h weapons. that extra DPS from 2h grab aggro faster than when i am using 2x 1h.<br />
<br />
of course, if u have uber 1h weapons like BF or HG, that maybe another case. the HP add up also makes quite a difference.<br />
<br />
personally i don't have good enough experience on rune-line spell aggro weapon, so i cant tell if a BBB will worths more than BF+BoC. but if u have chance on a high priest 2hs, and u have not too bad 1h weapons set up, i strongly suggest u to get one of them to maximize ur varieties on different weapons tanking, because u never know what VI is going to do on next patch about aggro management and riposte :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Robok</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a bloodfrenzy in the main and a CHSD in the off hand, and yes a warrior with PB3 and ferocity3 etc weilding a BoW will out aggro me any day of the week, but any 2 hander outside of the elemental planes wont out aggro me.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that the bloodfrenzy is ever so slightly easier to get then a BoW being it drops from a cursed (doable with 1-2 groups) as aposed to Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
BBB is without a doubt a great weapon and the best advice anyone here can give you is to do your best to get both a nice DW taunt combo and a good taunting 2hs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but I'm going to call you on the cursed being 1 groupable.<br />
<br />
It's not possible. I do know he's killable with a small raid force though.<br />
<br />
But yes, you're right in that a Bloodfrenzy is much easier to obtain than a Blade of War. Blade of War is just what every warrior has in their EQ dreams (unless you have one :p).</div></div><hr />

Its already a 10+ min boring nightmare with 40 people full elemental.<br />

I dont even wanna imagine how long it will take with 12 or 18.</div></div><hr />

1 group is probably a bit low, 10 people tho.</div></div><hr />

But I also want to hold the best agro for tanking so I'm using duel wield right now. Was just trying to plan ahead and see if I could switch back to a good 2h yet or if i'm stuck using duel wield till we can kill RZ.<br />
<br />
If I get off my ass and get some more AA points I may try for the Seru when we eventually kill him. Sounds like it's good enough agro to get the job done. If I don't get the AA I'll go for a BF though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
definately need some spare tanks for exile on long fight, i see a tendency to lowball the figures many encounters. maybe you could squeak it out with less, but everything needs to be perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cydrenlin</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what rogok wanted to say is that 1 group of the proper classes (looking like 1 war 1 bard 1 shaman 1 enchanter 2 clerics) could hold cursed for an infinite amount of time (hours...) provided they got sufficient gear/AA and know the fight well.<br />
But that's not enough to kill him.<br />
You got 0 dps beside the tanking war, 0 backup in case something goes wrong (if slow is resisted you got no spam heals etc..) and you forget completly that you need enough to kill the mobs before cursed (exhiled is not slowable -3 clerics rot i think- and DT means you need to have enough tanks).<br />
Yes, 25 should be enough. Our first cursed was with 29 so it's perfectly doable. But 2 groups isn't possible on exhiled so no point arguing over cursed heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone who claims that BoW is more aggro than BF + BoC is talking out of their ass, or not comparing like AA/atk gear/haste warriors.<br />
<br />
Last night. Warrior with PB3 Ferocity 3, Crits 2-3, and a BoW was main tanking Xegony.  I died about 15 minutes in, Gnimwit had been going full out with BoW on Xegony for 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
I (full offensive aa) got rezzed, rebuffed, and started attacking with BF + BoC. Within 5-10 minutes, without taunting, I pulled aggro off him.<br />
<br />
Ive tested it before. BoW is more consistent early aggro, because your not relying on procs, you got DPS or potential DPS (misses) which cause good solid aggro.  If you want the highest aggro over the long run, BF + BoC will significantly outaggro a BoW.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, Im not knocking BoW, its a fantastic weapon.  It lets us do probably more DPS than we should be doing and its great aggro.  Its not, however, the best aggro weapon combo in game atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in xp groups i totally own the two BF/BoC wars in my guild.<br />
(see PoF 1st castle 2 tank chain pull groups)<br />
<br />
Every xp mob in fire beats the crap out of me most of the time.<br />
While the other war, with similar aa  pulls agro, but<br />
out of 10 CH , 7 will go on me, 3 on him, and we arent taunting.<br />
<br />
On the long run, your probably right, 2 EB &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 EB<br />
Agro is more or less based on procs.<br />
(Specially BF/HG since BoC procs once a month)<br />
<br />
I have pulled agro off BF/BoC, and lost agro to it :)<br />
So deciding which combo is better for agro is a risky bet.<br />
<br />
I do tend to believe that while you are under defensive/evasive<br />
BF/BoC win, without BoW's monster DPS take over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimwit</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnimwit had been going full out with BoW on Xegony for 15 minutes.Full out with 2 slows on me :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
We lost 2 warriors and a cleric from our group durring this time. As also had to deal with crappy positioning and I was getting nailed with 2 different ae's and 2 different slows. One of which I couldnt get cured no matter how often I was asking :mad: and the other of which was only being cured once every 2-3 ae's for a while durring the time the people doing our cures were juggling their heals and positions at the same time to stay alive.<br />
<br />
TBH it was a mess and I'm surprised that we won, but I don't think it was valid platform to accurately test aggro, since A) I wasn't getting cured in a timly manner for both th slows I ended up getting and B) our deck tanks WERE and C) I still want to max out my Flurry skill too :D because I am not sure how my PB3 stacks up to a warr with DW-Hate and flurry 6.<br />
<br />
Do I think BoW is BETTER aggro than Boc/BF? Like Hana mentioned, only to start, there have been plenty of times I've engaged a mob at the same time as him or one of our other dual wield hate warr's and ended up with aggro right form the start unintentionally, even after giving them a 5-10 second lead-in. But over the long run with the same approx aa's and haste I think both are just as effective at holding aggro.<br />
<br />
Soon Hanadan and myself will probably run through some very specific tests to figure out exactly where each weapon set stands in relation to another, we'll probably do SEWS at the same time since we've got a ton of those floating around too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no concrete way to say without a doubt x is more aggro than y.  The best really is to speak from experience.  For me, Bow blows away any dual wield setup I ever had.<br />
<br />
Using one example where you pull aggro off a warrior with a bow and claiming bow is inferior isn't exactly science and the fact is, anyone who has ever used any eb weapon in a big fight, when not tanking knows it's a risk to pull aggro off the mt, regardless of what they are using.<br />
<br />
Hate list is less about what have you done to me in the last 15 minutes and more about what have you done in the last minute.  Any setup can have bad times and good times and can out aggro the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone who has ever used any eb weapon in a big fight, when not tanking knows it's a risk to pull aggro off the mt, regardless of what they are using.<br />
<br />
I had to assure I was next in hate after MT in case he went down, and I had just been freshly rezzed. No other way to do it than to pull aggro 1 round, then back out, pause, and maintain my aggro.<br />
<br />
Any setup can have bad times and good times and can out aggro the other.<br />
<br />
This is very true, but its also negated by amount of time tanking.  You give me a mob that has 1 million HP, and let 2 warriors beat on it without taunting for 30 minutes, the one with better aggro set-up will have the aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonehammer</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Coray, it's really difficult to lay down the law on what is and isn't absolutely better for agro.  <br />
<br />
By now I imagine folks are figuring out that each mob is different, and one setup may suit that named better than another.<br />
<br />
Also a warrior will play to his/her weapon's strengths, I highly doubt you will find success by turning on autoattack and praying agro will stick.  I still believe the warrior does most of the work, and that the weapon is just a tool of the trade.<br />
<br />
I find the BoW to be a perfect tanking weapon for most situations.  If I want agro, I can have it without much issue vs. other melee.  If I don't want agro, I put it away or just use intermittently to make sure I am ahead of the DPS classes if the current MT dies- theres no sense in jacking agro up and risking a wipe because I am too lazy to swap weapons.<br />
<br />
If the BoW has a weakness, I see it in the first 10 seconds.  I realize folks here are saying it's strong initial agro, but if I manage two rounds of misses early on I will be chasing the mob all the way to the clerics.  I find myself working every trick early on, because that is where I have lost control.  <br />
<br />
After the first 10 to 15 seconds the BoW has immense agro capability, and I have no issues whatsoever.<br />
<br />
But those first 10-15 seconds I generally wish I had a dual weild combo for peace of mind, because theres no way I can spend 4-6 seconds with straight misses dual weilding, and I would have plenty of chances to proc early on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That test proves nothing, because again a mob cares less about what you did 30 minutes ago than what you have done in the last minute.<br />
<br />
Run this test, have a warrior with a blade of war attack a mob for 30 minutes.  In that period of time the warrior would probably do a quarter million points of damage (at 130 DPS which is conservative estimate), and probably get 100+ EB procs.<br />
<br />
Have that warrior stop attacking, and have another warrior attack the same mob whos obviously aggro on the first warrior, with pretty much any weapon setup, even probably hand to hand, and tell me how long it takes before he gets aggro.  It will not be 30 minutes I can tell you that much and he won't have to come anywhere near a quarter million damage.<br />
<br />
Does that mean that if he was using Ykeshas, that they are superior aggro weapons compared to a blade of war?<br />
<br />
My point is simply that, the tests and things you talk about don't really prove one weapon is better or worse than any other.<br />
<br />
I have a blade of war and I went from a dual wield setup to a bow, and there is a distinct difference between the two, generally I would say because of the huge increase in melee damage you do with a blade of war.  I have no test that would prove that really, but if you compare DPS and proc percentage, you'd find without a doubt bow blows away other things dps wise, and it's atleast as good in the proc department.</div></div><hr />

Actually, your correct, but the numbers are off.  Back when conquest guild was banned, there was a little blurb posted by abashi I think about mob hate.  It was confirmed at the time that mob hate memory is 5 minutes. hate decays after 5 minutes, so yes the mob does only see the hate you did to it in the last 300 seconds.<br />
<br />
Still 5 minutes is a long time, long enough to smooth out the ups and downs in aggro of either weapon.<br />
<br />
My point is simply that, the tests and things you talk about don't really prove one weapon is better or worse than any other.<br />
<br />
But you can prove via testing that one set of weapons is more aggro than another. Mabe not by 1 test, but by repeated testing.  Hypothetically, if we take 2 equally AA/geared warriors to guardian of tunare, both turn on autoattack for 10 minutes and 20 out of 20 times, the same warrior has aggro every time, I would say thats a pretty conclusive test, regardless of how the weapons &quot;feel&quot;.<br />
<br />
We will do the test and see how it goes and report back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimwit</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also wanted to address the issue about hit/miss/dps aggro.<br />
<br />
It's my personal opinion that all melee based hate is based on the ratio and POTENTIAL damage done from your weapon (excluding procs, we're just talking dps hate) moreso than ACTUAL damage done. <br />
<br />
I also feel Discs are completely ignored when calculating hate and that hate is based off of the potential you would have to do damage based on the number of swings you have for a round, rather than the damage done for that round. a warrior with a BoWar swinging 4-6 times a round with full offensive aa, but using evasive stance and missing a huge % of the time won't be any worse off than a warrior with the same aa's who isn't using the disc, because they are still generally swinging the same number of times with the same ratio weapon.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned they can't get aggro with their BoWar if they miss the first 10 seconds, well if you are SWINGING thats all thats needed to generate the same aggro as if your hits were landing. More swings = more POTENTIAL dps and so it creates more aggro. I actually LIKE it when I am trying to break  mez and I miss for a round or two before I actually land a hit and break the mez, because all those misses are adding on alot of extra hate before the mez is actually broken.<br />
<br />
AA abilities like Tactical Mastery and Combat Fury and Fury of the ages will add a lot of DPS, but they probably won't add any extra melee HATE. Unlike aa abilities like Ferocity, Punishing Blade, Ambidex, FLURRY which require extra SWINGS in order to contribute to your dps. It's the potential damage of the SWINGS that is causing the hate, not the damage itself. SO even a full SwingDPS-AA warrior using evasive who is swinging and missing a whole lot more than a NonSwingDPS-AA warrior NOT using evasive the SwingDPS warrior will most likely have all the hate, even though disc'd to miss more, causing their actual DPS done to be significantly lower.<br />
<br />
I never get extra hate going full aggressive on a mob (using a non-hate/non-rune proccing weapon) even thoguh I am doing 50% more damage as opposed to those times with the same weapon where I am attacking in normal mode. The same aggro management rules still apply though if you are in a fight that requires you to cycle attacks, but in some fights you can go full agressive, and you will notice that you aren't pulling aggro any differently than if you were attacking without a disc on. The only difference is that ussually once you are aggressive you are less likely to want to turn attack off because you are on a timer for how long you can keep up the DPS, in these cases you may start pulling aggro just because you've left your attack on for so long, the same would happen even if you weren't disc'd<br />
<br />
All in all the majority of our aggro is caused by procs, but heavily manipulated by the potential for huge melee DPS. Weapon ratio plays a big part in this, as does your current haste/slow level and the number of swings you attempt in a round. Warriors who swing more with higher ratio setups will be hated more than warriors who do more crit/tm damage with the same weapon but less swings but both doing similar dps.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who reads this msg board on a regular basis knows full well that Gnimwit and Hanadan do more testing and reasearch then just about anyone else in the game.. If your going to make a statement like that at least have something to back it up.<br />

Personaly I've always found misses to hurt my aggro, something more to pay attention to while im tanking now.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the old steel warrior boards, you will see a thread where many high end warriors talk about taking aggro off someone else with a miss.<br />
<br />
The only way it is possible to pull aggro off someone else with a miss, is if there is some aggro associated with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimwit</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. potential agro - you talking out of assI never talked about potential aggro, I talked about potential DPS. I have done alot of informal testing on this, informal being something I will do mainly through practice and observation of my daily routine moreso than going out of my way to go somewhere and put a specific theory to test.<br />
<br />
I have found that being disc'd has absolutly nothing to do with my aggro generation. Whether I am aggressive, evasive or defensive. Durring standard exp gorups I've gone so far as to get myself to the borderline of being #1 on hate list (those times when mobs will flip and back forth between two warriors everytime each warrior gets their round of swings in) and have backed off a bit so the mob stops flipping even when I keep my attacks on fulltime (have done this with non-proccing weapons, specifically testing DPS aggro). At these times I've used discs like charge / mightystrike / fellstrike / precise so I could explicitly see if the mob will then flip to me, even though I have the same number of swings as the 60 seconds of previous rounds after establishing getting myself 'borderline'. When I used these discs I got no extra aggro, you'd think if aggro was relying on damage DONE and not a flat ratio/hasted/slowed damage potential that the mob would flip to me for the sudden burst of DPS, but it just wasn't so. Although one taunt later and the mob was back on me and into flip-mode showing me I was still right on the border.<br />
<br />
I don't believe actual higher DPS will inrcease my hate more than increased number of swings leading to higher Potential DPS.<br />
<br />
EB procs are there to makeup there difference in hate between a Warrior and another melee, or nuker. Crit nukes and heals certainly do not create more aggro than their basline counterparts. It's my belief each nuke/crit/heal is programmed with a very specific amount of hate it will cause, whether it is resisted, whether it lands for full, or partial or even crit. And I honestly beleive melee damage is treated the exact same way, it doesnt matter if we miss, there is hate involved. It doesn't matter if we crit, the amount of hate we create does not increase with the actual damage DONE.<br />
<br />
I also beleive that there is a line of code that is missing from the game that would exclude INVULNERABLE attacks from generating as much hate as they do. I've tanked undead mobs with a Reaver (before they were flagged as magic) and have held aggro against players equipped with double feshgrinders which in themselves were great dps for the time. Both weapons were crap for aggro, but even then I suspected aggro was based off potenial damage, not damage done, and I was able to hold aggro more succesfully than the DW FG warrior, both of us 60. <br />
<br />
I'm now trying to think of a mob that requires a bane weapon I can go crazy on with a high dps/no proc weapon and pit myself against another warrior with an equivalent ratioed bane weap, just to lay this issue down to rest, and see if I can succesfully pull aggro off him. Maybe I can play around with Valdanov Zefeer or find some other mob that isnt quite seru/emp level and would require a raid to screw around with. If aggro were based specifically on damage done, non-magic arrows shouldn't be able to aggro invulnerable mobs, but they do.<br />
<br />
2. if you miss with 2h early on while raid give you time to solo mob you wont have shit for agro - thats a factNo it isn't a fact. I miss 40% of my swings, by default. That means that there have been PLENTY of times when I have missed and missed and missed for severeal rounds before the rest of the guild engages a mob. I've never had crappy aggro because I kept missing. This is ESPECIALLY apparent when evasive, which is a disc I am a HUGE proponent of and use daily on mini bosses, gods and trash mobs alike. Many warriors skip using evasive all together, it doesn'tmean they hold aggro better than I do just because I am missing more, not even close.<br />
<br />
3. AAs do not add that much dps, but its nice to have them anywaysI went from 95dps with a 1450atk when I first hit 65 in PoP with my BBB, my last test with full spec offensive aa (minus Flurry and CF3/FotA, and DRipo) and 1450ish atk (didnt need quite so any atk buffs to hit this number at the time i was 65)I was doing 130ish dps on the same mobs. Each aa adds crap for DPS pretty much but can REALLY add up for all the points spent. Solinar/Hanadan can add to this more than myself, he has tested DPS more recently than I have personally, as I have been less concerned about my actual DPS done than most warriors, plus he has FLurry DR and Fury afaik all just about finished and recorded his dps progress along the way, which I ignored other than 2 short tests.<br />
<br />
DPS done has never been a concern of mine so I have slacked on recording my actual dps output for quite a while (since like last december when I first invested in some new PoP aa's)<br />

4. I prefer tanking with 2h more dmg dealt less dmg taken and easier to deal with enrage.<br />

I can miss for 10 seconds and still hold aggro, and not just hold, get a better grasp on the mob.  Misses DO make the mob stick to you.  That's what makes 2handers keep aggro better.

Specially if u have killed emp/seru (where you do ZERO effective damage).<br />

I havent tested the reaver theory but you got me curious on that one.<br />

Their potential dps is crappy (when they dont hit the BS key)<br />

<br />
Rogues that dont BS have gimp agro (see 2boxed )<br />
You do remember rogues flipping mobs with a dual BS 5 seconds after inc.<br />
How do you explain that ? <br />
Their potential dps is less than yours (no flurry, tripple atk etc etc)<br />
<br />
With 16/20 16/20, their potential agro is less BF/BoC.<br />
They have very few &quot;bonus AA&quot; and cant land 6-10 hits in 1 round.<br />
Rogue potential damage is thus a Quad with 16dmg weapons.<br />
Your potential damage is Quad to Octuple with 16 dmg weapons<br />

I've pulled often mobs off the MT with BoW + Agressive and zero procs.The BoWar in and of itself is a high ratio weapon. TBH I've never gained or lost aggro specifically because of a disc I was using. Given my current role in alot of the raids going full aggressive for the duration of a fight might prove tough on a regular basis for me personqally, but it's something I can start looking into in certain situations and come up with a comparrison with my attack-on times and pulling aggro off a dw-hate warrior vs times when I am fighting non-disc.<br />

Well a rogue scoring a double backstab 5 seconds after a mob is incoming probably has more attacks in durring that period (with a high dps potential) than the warrior trying to attain aggro. If the warrior were to score a flurry at the same time the difference in hate would probably be mitigated some.<br />
<br />
I am not a rogue pro by any means, but unless things have changed in the last 2 years or so; their backstabs cause more hate than a standard weapon swing by default, miss or not. A double backstab even more so, grats them on having the evade skill in order to counter it :rolleyes:. I don't know if the extra hate is a derivative of their equipped mainhand weapon damage OR if it is just programmed to toss in some small amount of hate when used, but either way it is indeed very aggrivating for the mob when they're getting nailed with double backstabs so early in  fight if the warrior hasn't even had a chance to get a good round or two of swings out.<br />
<br />

Making the ratio much much more important than before.Well the great thing about PoP hate weapons (Sews, BoWar) is that they are also two of the highest ratio weapons in the game for a warrior. So at the moment you're no longer trying to decide if you want more aggro or more dps, you're gonna get the DPS no matter what type of high end pop 2h you use, you just have to decide if you want one that procs an aggrivating spell on the mob too. If you want pure dps you can use an Ornate Greatblade or a Crow Footed Lance(sp?). If you want the same DPS output but more hate you can use a BoWar or a SEWS you just have to decide if you want the hate AND dps or just the dps.</div></div><hr />
