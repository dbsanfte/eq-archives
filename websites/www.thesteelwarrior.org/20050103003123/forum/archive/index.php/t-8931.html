sorry if this has been kicked around too much already --quit looking at this board a couple months ago.<br />
<br />
My post<br />
<br />
Why do we have a new expansion and still no Warrior only defensive aa's? This is our class specialization, is it unreasonable to expect to get some skills to help us be the best at it? (Thinking about exp groups mainly here --where defensive is not used) the only difference between warrior and knight tanking is in the gear. Why can't we go on an adventure and rise above every other class in our ability to protect the group? <br />
<br />
Tanking just seems trivialized aside from raid encounters. With the same defensive aa's available to all classes I regularly see non plate wearing classes who can tank EP exp groups. <br />
<br />
Trying to speak to the warriors community by coming here -- not trying to start another knight/warrior thread, but I guess that's where it inevitably goes when warriors speak up for their specialization.<br />

I saw the Abilities and I said &quot;meh&quot;.  I saw the same abilities with PoP, GoD and Luclin.  What do I really have to look forward to?  More mitigation and avoidance?  Ya, did that before.  Granted, it will make me a better tank, but its not really new.  Nothing got my eye like the way that ambidexterity first did, or LR, or most recently, WA.<br />
<br />
On this same note, I saw some abilities and I said &quot;WTF am I gonna do with that?&quot;<br />

It is sad that OOW didn't give warriors any help and gave huge boosts to knights.  I guess all that talk about &quot;we will not be giving knights a version of defensive&quot; was just talk with no meaning.  SoE didn't give them defensive, but they certainly gave them a lot of boosts.</div></div><hr />

If tanking in the elemental planes is gimp, challenge yourself further.  There are zones out there where the tanking isn't trivial.<br />
<br />
As to warrior only abilities, check out the Warlord's Tenacity line, and specifically the upgrades in OOW.  I just bought the first level of the OOW upgrade, and a 3k Instant heal is pretty damn handy when those heals are late, especially when fighting some of the GoD and OOW one grouped named.<br />
<br />
As to defensive AA's - shield block is looking great.<br />
<br />
As to the difference between Knights and Warriors outside of defensive use in one-group exp content - There's still a difference even with equal gear:  the -1 DI bonus.  Any more of a difference than that would render the knight classes unusable in too much content.<br />
<br />
As to the &quot;boringness&quot; of more Mitigation/Avoidance - heh.  I'll take those aa upgrades over DPS ones any day...boring or not, it enhances our main job as a class.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree with that --I'd just like some warrior &quot;only&quot; mitigation/avoidance aa's. Or maybe some more challenging one group defensive content, but I haven't seen much of GoD yet so , maybe it's all there. Seeing non plate classes tank EP's just kinda sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EPs aren't really cutting edge anymore, I want to see them tank in Kod'Taz, think they'll have issues even at lvl 70.</div></div><hr />
