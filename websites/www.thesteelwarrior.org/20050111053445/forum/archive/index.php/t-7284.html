<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thromn</div><div class="date">05-23-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can not post on the EQlive boards for some odd reason... it says I need to log in. Well I have 3 station accounts, and I can log into all of them, but for some reason when I try to post it says I am not logged in... Since I can't vent my frustration there I'm venting here.<br />
<br />
I bought a 90 day Game card a couple months ago (March 18th according to my billing information) Since yesterday (May 22nd) Every time I try to log on it says I need a Valid account. When I look at my billing info it says my account has been CLOSED! Now I'm no math expert, but can someone tell me how March 18th to May 22nd equals 90 days, or even 3 months....<br />
<br />
And no I did NOT cancel my account, I did NOT give my acct info to anyone, I checked my comp, and I do NOT have a Virus/Worm/Trojan that could allow anyone to get my info...<br />
<br />
So basically the only conclusion I can come to is that SoE F'd up my account (and my station accounts)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

And check your Account information there? Maybe you can get to log on from there if the main site doesnt work.<br />
<br />
And its really weird, I had played with Game cards before and never had a problem with the expiration dates...<br />
<br />
I would try to email or use the Web customer service.</div></div><hr />
