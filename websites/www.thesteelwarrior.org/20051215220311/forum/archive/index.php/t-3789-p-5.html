First, I wanted to set a baseline and make sure each stun was adding hate linearly.<br />
Tests using 8/20 in offhand to get agro<br />
<br />
Initial Agro<br />
1 7<br />
2 6<br />
3 6<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + one force of Akera (4sec/61)<br />
1 69<br />
2 68<br />
3 68<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + two force of Akera<br />
1 132<br />
2 132<br />
3 132<br />
4 132<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + three force of Akera<br />
1 194<br />
2 193<br />
<br />
Let X be the aggro from a 8/20 per swing.<br />
Let I be the initial aggro, A be the aggro from the first force of Akera, B from the second and C from the third.<br />
<br />
Then what you have proved is:<br />
5 X &lt;= I &lt;= 6 X<br />
67 X &lt;= I + A &lt;= 68 X<br />
131 X &lt;= I + A + B &lt;= 132 X<br />
192 X &lt;= I + A + B + C &lt;= 193 X<br />
<br />
First question: is this consistend with A = B = C = Force of Ak aggro<br />
Let us assume F is all of A B and C.  Then<br />
<br />
1) 5 X &lt;= I &lt;= 6 X<br />
2) 67 X &lt;= I + F &lt;= 68 X<br />
3) 131 X &lt;= I + 2 F &lt;= 132 X<br />
4) 192 X &lt;= I + 3 F &lt;= 193 X<br />
<br />
1 &amp; 2 give:<br />
61 X &lt;= F &lt;= 63 X<br />
1 &amp; 3 give:<br />
62.5 X &lt;= F &lt;= 63.5 X<br />
1 &amp; 4 give:<br />
62 X &lt;= F &lt;= 62.667<br />
<br />
Together we get<br />
5) 62.5 X &lt;= F &lt;= 62.667 X<br />
<br />
now, 2 and 5 give us:<br />
4.333 X &lt;= I &lt;= 5.5 X<br />
with 1 this becomes<br />
5 X &lt;= I &lt;= 5.5 X<br />
<br />
Plug this into (3) and we get<br />
62.75 X &lt;= F &lt;= 63.5 X<br />
which together with (5) provides us with a contradiction.<br />
<br />
Thus proving our aggro model is flawed or incomplete.  There is an additional source of aggro wandering around that isn't accounted for.<br />
<br />
Dispite this additional unknown aggro source, it was really damn close to linear.<br />
<br />
I'll take as a rule of thumb that<br />
raw stun aggro =~ 62.5 offhand swings of an 8 damage weapon.<br />
Initial aggro =~ 5.5 offhand swings of an 8 damage weapon.<br />
<br />
which gives us<br />
108 DD component of QWoS =~ 17 offhand swings of an 8 damage weapon. (+/-)<br />
<br />
from your second set of tests.<br />
<br />
Changed to 9/36 in offhand<br />
Initial Agro + force of Akera<br />
1 62<br />
2 63<br />
3 62<br />
<br />
Let Y be the aggro from a 9 damage weapon in offhand.<br />
<br />
Lets assume that the offhand swing has some &quot;base&quot; aggro and some aggro that is purportional to the weapon damage.  The base aggro might be zero.<br />
<br />
So,<br />
Y = B + 9 * D<br />
X = B + 8 * D<br />
<br />
The above test says:<br />
61 Y &lt;= I + F &lt;= 62 Y<br />
The test with the 8 damage in offhand weapon says:<br />
67 X &lt;= I + F &lt;= 68 X<br />
<br />
Rearranging we get<br />
61 Y &lt;= 68 X<br />
67 X &lt;= 62 Y<br />
<br />
Using the B + # * D equations, we get<br />
61 B + 549 D &lt;= 68 B + 544 D<br />
67 B + 536 D &lt;= 62 B + 558 D<br />
or<br />
5 D &lt;= 7 B<br />
5 B &lt;= 22 D<br />
0.71 D &lt;= B &lt;= 4.4 D<br />
<br />
Ie, aggro from offhand swings is not quite just purportional to weapon damage.  There is a small additional component, between .71 raw-damage-aggro worth and 4.4 raw-damage-aggro worth.<br />
<br />
From:<br />
Changed to 9/36 in primary<br />
1 49<br />
2 49<br />
<br />
Changed to 8/20 in primary<br />
1 54<br />
2 55<br />
<br />
These numbers are scary.<br />
<br />
The extra 1 point of damage-aggro from 49 swings out aggroed 4 full rounds of an 8 damage weapon (round 50 51 52 and 53).<br />
<br />
So:<br />
49 * &quot;Aggro Per Point Of Weapon Damage&quot; &gt;= 4 * &quot;Mainhand Base Aggro&quot; + 32 * &quot;Aggro Per Point Of Weapon Damage&quot;<br />
17 &quot;Aggro Per Point Of Weapon Damage&quot; &gt;= 4 * &quot;Mainhand Base Aggro&quot;<br />
4.25 &quot;Aggro Per Point Of Weapon Damage &gt;= &quot;Mainhand Base Aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
which means the &quot;damage bonus aggro&quot; isn't nearly as large as we thought, if aggro is linear in weapon damage and in damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Man, reverse engeneering is hard.</div></div><hr />

Just using those <br />
weapon_damage + damage_bonus <br />
seemed to be a good *relative* indicator for hate generated per a swing.  even in offhand.  I tried combinations using min damage per a hit and it only exaggerated the error.<br />
<br />
for example the 9/36 generates 2.04% of the hate needed per a swing. now we want to predict how much hate the 8 weapon will generate per a swing.<br />
<br />
according to the theory the 9 damages hate per a swing is 22 and the 8 damages hate per a swing is 21.  so we expect the 8 damage to generate 2.04% X 21/22 = 1.947 % of the total hate per a swing.<br />
which means it would need 51 swings in actuality it needed 54 so boo me but its close =)<br />
<br />
moving on.  the 15/32 is expected to generate 2.04% * 28/21 =2.72% per a swing which predicts 36.8 swings to generate 100% agro.  in actuality its  39 swings.  again error.<br />
<br />
Now your thinking why did i post if theres error.<br />
well because it keeps up with offhand =)<br />
offhand has no damage bonus.<br />
so its expected to generate 2.04* 15/21 = 1.45% of the total agro needed per a swing.  predicting 68.6 swings to get agro.  in actuality its 71.  2.5 swings off.<br />
<br />
Not bad really for a theory that unifys offhand and mainhand into an approximation.<br />
<br />
im sure theres some combination of those numbers that is the real equation but for now base_damage + damage_bonus/delay seems to unify main/offhand into one agro detirmined package.  I mean all the predicted relative delays were less then 3 swings off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">btw if anyone is wondering what that prediction means to them it means for mainhand<br />
<br />
(weapondamage + damage_bonus)/delay can be used to predict what weapons generate the most agro without procs.  the higher the number the better.<br />
<br />
some test numbers (damage/delay) show..<br />
12/17(1.47agro) &gt;14/19 (1.42agro) &gt;15/20 (1.4agro) &gt; 13/19 (1.37 agro)<br />
<br />
The most interesting prediction there is the 14/19 out agroing the 15/20.  that would be an interesting test but note how small the differential is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also one last shocking note.  and your not going to like it.<br />
according to the data the only thing that matters for agro offhand is ratio.  meaning things like defenders lightblade are big agro offhand.<br />
<br />
some one needs to get some more offhand data.  ill try to find somemore.  thats an interesting result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok yep theres more supporting data.<br />
<br />
take the 8 damage weapon versus the 9 damage weapon versus intial agro + 1 force.<br />
<br />
the 8 damage weapon took 68 swings offhand.  according to the theory i advanced the only thing that matters offhand is weapon damage for agro.  so its 1.47% of the agro total needed per a swing x 9/8 for agro per a swing of the 9 damage weapon. <br />
So the 9 damage weapon offhand does 1.654% agro needed per a swing offhand (predicted).  predicting  60.45 swings with the 9 damage weapon to generate the same agro.<br />
in actuality it was 62.3.<br />
<br />
Pretty tight correlation.<br />
<br />
So the only thing that matters per a swing offhand is base weapon damage.  So the only thing that matters offhand for agro generation per a minute (minus proc) is ratio.  <br />
<br />
So those warriors offhand defenders lightblade that you laughed at....  are laughing now....<br />
<br />
I wouldnt have believed it either but thats what the data is saying about offhand agro.  Offhand agro over time is ratio and nothing else.<br />
<br />
<br />
PREDICTION!<br />
<br />
If the person that did the Initial Agro + one force of Akera agro wants to get a defenders lightblade.  I hereby predict that it will take the defenders lightblade  27 swings  to get agro offhand against an initial agro + force of akera.<br />
<br />
(the actual numbers said 25.5 but i bumped it 1.5 swings cause the equation seems shifted down a swing or two but still predicting)<br />
<br />
Cant beat that for not cooking the data~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brodda, I think I figured out where that difference between aggro ranges for me and you may have been coming from.  From the data I've gathered so far it appears Spell Casting Subtlety AA lowers melee aggro generation as well (confirmed on my tests that it was SCS and not Terror causing lower aggro generation).  I posted some more data on my thread but I don't think it will do a whole lot of good right now considering its got a modifier on it lowering aggro generation, probally 20% but who knows...</div></div><hr />

Using your number then ...<br />
<br />
Dual weilding a 14/18 main hand, and 13/20 off hand would generate less agro then a 31/30 2 hander? (with no procs)<br />
<br />
14/18 primary = 1.5<br />
13/20 secondary = 0.65<br />
Total = 2.15<br />

The off hand, without its DB, has always wanted the weapon with the best ratio--where as the main had has had to balance speed and ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that statement has a good chance to be accurate cily given the extremely reduced agro generation from offhands already shown regardless of the equation.  Data so far basically suggest the mainhand dominates. <br />
Still though there might be a second behavior for twohanders. A nerf of there agro is a possibility.  No reason to think that though till (weapon_damage + damage bonus) fails to predict their swings. The only reason i didnt check previous twohanders already provided is cause im not fimiliar with the damage bonuses for twohand weapons off the top of my head(im a rogue)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there actual is some two hander data but given that my equation has always been a couple swings short this could be to tight. I looked up a damage bonus on a 50 delay weapon... well i looked up the equation... its 27 or 28 right?  Im  guessing 27 and proceeding like it was.  anyone know the damage bonus for a 50 delay weapon at 65?<br />
<br />
the 12/50 took 34.5 swings to generate 100% of the agro to get the mob to turn.  thats 2.898% of the agro per a swing.  Now according to the theory 2.898% X 49/39 = 3.64% of the agro per a swing.  predicting 27.4 swings when in actuality its 30.5.  3 swings off.  but thats a 10% error so not good.  <br />
<br />
Note:<br />
error would go down if the Damage Bonus was 28 instead of 27 on a 50 delay weapon but not by alot.  <br />
I must figure out this almost constant shift down im getting in my predictions.  Its like it works if you add 2 swings in every case~<br />

grrr.  just found the lucy charts for damage bonus.  my damage bonus for a 50 delay weapon is all wrong.<br />
<br />
but i punched in 51 which lucy says is the damage bonus for a 50 delay weapon and something wierd happen cause i had all the equations set up to cascade the change.  and there was a dead on correlation at a wierd but interesting spot.<br />
<br />
my tightest correlation was at <br />
<br />
twohand weapon agro is<br />
weapon_damage + twohander_damage_bonus + single_weapon_damage_bonus<br />
<br />
thats per a swing<br />
<br />
Which seems like it makes NO SENSE but its actually symetrical with the single hand weapons tighest correlation which was best at<br />
singlehand weapon agro is<br />
weapon_damage + damage_bonus + 1<br />
<br />
thats per a swing.<br />

That was the data i used. its only two weapons so definatly need more.  Ill walk you through the prediction.<br />
The 12 delay weapon generates 2.898% of the agro it needs per a swing.  Then 2.898% X 86/76 =  3.279 % agro generated per a swing predicted from damage + twohandbonus + singlebonus predicting 30.49 swings for the 22/50 to get agro.<br />
<br />
which it is =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
note that was with old equations.  lets see what the new tighter ones predict.<br />

14/18 = (14+13+1)/18 = 1.556<br />
13/20 secondary = (13+1)/20 = .7<br />

<br />
<br />
NOW Digression.  I been debating over something critical here for hours.  Not heavy debate just a nagging thing.  Did we unify the single weapon and twohand equations so that we know they are in the same units of agro per a time?<br />
I been debating on that for sometime.  Ive always leaned towards yes but for some reason the proof doesnt stand out to me.  Ill think on the proof but my nagging suspicion is that its there and those are in the same units.<br />
<br />
grr its still nagging at me whether these two numbers are directly comparable.  i cant find a twohander test being compared to the same amount of agro from a single weapon test.  this is a big question!</div></div><hr />

This has to be wrong.  If it was true then 20 delay two handers would be on of the best agro generators out there.  But they aren't.  I know that is anecdotal evidence, but it is just that easy to tell.<br />
<br />
Also, I made a mistake and it was a 13/50 in my original tests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm thats not what the equation says.<br />
<br />
if anything is going to be best agro it would be the 28 delay weapon<br />
<br />
for example lets compare theoretical even ratio weapons with http://lucy.fnord.net/dmgbonus.html<br />
<br />
then the 20/20 twohander would be<br />
(20+14+13)/20 = 2.35<br />
28/28 is (28+35+13)/28 = 2.714<br />
31/31 is (31+36+13)/31 = 2.58<br />
40/40 is (40+42+13)/40 = 2.375<br />
<br />
