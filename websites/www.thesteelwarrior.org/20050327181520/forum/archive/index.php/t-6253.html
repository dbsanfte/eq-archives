Upcoming for March and April 2004<br />
<br />
Graveyard Zone<br />
<br />
Tired of losing your corpse?  The current EQ system removes corpses from the game after a week to reduce clutter and potential video lag.  But we know there are times when your character dies and you just can't get it right away.  Next thing you know a day turns into a week and BAM!  Your corpse is gone.  Since we can't leave the corpses sitting in game indefinitely, some inventive folks here have come up with another option.<br />
<br />
We plan to create a &quot;graveyard&quot; zone that will only work if your corpse has decayed and disappeared.  If you have lost your corpse due to decay in other parts of Norrath, you will be allowed to enter this zone and reclaim it.<br />
<br />
This is just one of the things slated to come out of the EQ Live laboratory.  Watch for other exciting announcements in the weeks ahead.</div></div><hr />

Your corpse goes to the graveyard zone after 7 REAL LIFE DAYS, when it would have permanently rotted with the current system.  This won't help you with CRs unless you are extremely patient.<br />
<br />
Basically, this is to save GMs the work of checking logs for people who want restores because their corpse rotted.</div></div><hr />

After 7 days, it saves everyone some time and trouble. You don't have to wait around for a petition to be answered, and SOE doesn't have to bother answering those &quot;my corpse rotted, I need a restore from my character's last backup&quot; petitions.</div></div><hr />

Folks leave corpses with half used mod rods and such to rot all the time, it wont be long before it overflows with nekkid slabs of meat.<br />
<br />
Also would the corpses just pile up in the center of the zone? or would they perhaps be seperated somehow? I think id'd be cool if they marked em with tombstones or something cheesy like that.  :D</div></div><hr />

I've met 3 people who've done this lol. <br />
<br />
<br />
    Though, they could be doing some better things with their time. For example; This recent duck when you go near a wall shit is annoying, espically in ssra where the walls aren't all straight. You cant climb in/out of things easily, or go up ladders/hills very well. Guktan and Vah Shir graphics are all messed up, dyes no longer exsist and everyones robe looks like an SMR, or Oracle robe, etc..</div></div><hr />

We have planned our next update for early April.<br />
<br />
This update is scheduled to include the new Graveyard zone.<br />

...dyes no longer exsist and everyones robe looks like an SMR, or Oracle robe, etc..  <br />
LOL, I noticed that myself. My wife's enchanter is wearing a Steelslave Surgeon's Robe, which is usually this nice warm gray with orange trim. Now, only the &quot;chest&quot; section is that color; the arms and the legs section of the robe looks like an Oracle robe.<br />
<br />
I also noticed that some dyed slots will show up as a slightly transparent gray overlay over the slot rather than the color you chose to dye the slot. This is really more noticeable on native DX9 hardware (GeForce FX 5000 series, ATI 9000 series) than on the older cards, so I'm sure it has something to do with DX9 calls not being implemented correctly. <br />
<br />
These are all things that they'll eventually get to fixing...I hope. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's easy.  Just require the corpses to have at least 1 non-no rent item on it to get into the graveyard zone.  And also, the corpses in the Graveyard zone should rot after a while, too.  Say 3 months or so.  I've had guildies go LD, find out that thier account has expired and not be able to get back online for weeks.  This would be a good thing, for sure.</div></div><hr />
