<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kainoa Krushur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm looking for some advice on gear upgrades, but first, a little background...<br />
<br />
I am in a family/friends-oriented guild.  We try to &quot;raid&quot; once a week, but that's been pretty sparse the last several months.  When we do raid, I am currently the MT.  Otherwise, I have spent most of my time duoing with my wife's druid (also lvl 64).  We've gotten into other groups as well, but by far, the majority of our time is spent with just the two of us or with a friend or two (we've had too many bad experiences with pickup groups).<br />
<br />
Now, there's a chance that I'll move on to a raiding guild soon (or at least doing more pickup stuff), as I'm growing tired of just grinding, so please keep that in mind.  Also, I have about 9-10k to my name.  Oh, and a guildie just took back a Face Mask of Frozen Mana that she had loaned me, so I haven't replaced that Antlered Mask, yet.<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=734397<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Kainoa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey man, IMO you're really  not doing too bad.  The first thing I'd do however is pick up a Helm of the Raldukan roughly 3k on Prexus I think and a new mask, Crystal Spider Eyes bout 700 last I remember comes to mind.  Between those you shouldn't gain much more than like 5 ac and 70-80 hps.  But hey thats a start.  Then I'd say you need a new BP, if you join a raiding guild like you say then just try to pick up like a Vindi Bp or something... would be a pretty decent upgrade to what you have right now.  Other than that there's realy nothing I can come up w/off the top of my  head thats under the 9-10k range.. sorry I'm fried its been a long day.  Sorry I know I didn't tell you alot but I hope it helped ya.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In a case like this, Adventures can be your friend.  With your wife and a couple of friends, you coud run though Everfrost about fourteen times, pick up a few AA's, and once you amass ~750 points you could afford some pretty significant upgrages, especially in the BP department.  Or you could do Tak and slap around the Named to pick up a Decent Breastplate (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23154) .<br />
<br />
Grinding this out might be a pain, but when you consider the risk vs reward it's not too bad of an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">760 actually but thats what ~ is for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bluenet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would hit the Nro Adventures and get that plate armor.  Its verynice.  The Ef armor isnt a bad idea either, as its about half? The price of the good nro stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kainoa Krushur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks to all!<br />
<br />
I looked in the bazaar this weekend for the Helm of the Raldukan (around 7K) and the Crystal Spider Eyes (around 1.5K).  I didn't think either were great deals, so I looked at what was available.  I chose a Mask of Flourishing Fungus for 3K and haven't yet upgraded the helm.  Seem like a reasonable choice?<br />
<br />
I think I will make an effort to hit EF for LDoN points, to upgrade my armor.  I actually have some points there, since I wanted to buy Anger II augs, but never quite finished that.  I think I'll work on upgrading my armor (most notably the BP) first (as in before any anger augs).  The 760 armor seems like quite a deal compared to the 1492 armor.<br />
<br />
BTW akamek, I was a little confused by your &quot;IMO you're really not doing too bad&quot; comment.  I figured that AC in the mid-1100s was kinda low, as was 3800ish HPs for a level 64.  Are my concerns not justified and I'm just seeing profiles of raiding warriors?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the help,<br />
Kainoa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kainoa, what I meant was that for someone who doesn't worship RZ or The Tribunal and has pure bazaar equip you're not looking too bad to me.  And good call on not getting either of my suggestions at those prices lol... I paid 600 for my Crystal Spider Eyes over a year ago and don't remember seeing a Helm of Raldukan for more than 5k for quite some time.  Also you are right, there are alot of raid warriors around here, but when you find the ones that aren't raiders and have mainly bazaar equip you're not too far off.  Just hit LDoN and get points for armor and you should be fine.  Sorry for the confusion earlier.<br />
Aka</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kainoa Krushur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the clarification Aka!  That makes much sense.<br />
<br />
Kainoa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can't see your magelo from work, but LDoN and Veksar are your friend.   LDoN is better gear, but Veksar has several peices of plate gear that are decent kit until you can get cultural/ornate/ldon quality stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kainoa Krushur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK, I'm working on EF LDoN points now.  Once I get to 760, should I upgrade my BP like I was expecting, or my helm, since that seems to be my weekest piece atm?  (For those w/o Magelo access, I'm wearing Indicolite Breastplate and Cobalt Helm.)<br />
<br />
Also, will I need to worry about a light source, if I'm Human and I upgrade my (Serpent Sight) Cobalt Helm?<br />
<br />
Oh, and any suggestions to replace my Imbued Granite Spauldors?  They have nice AC and resists, but no other stats.  HPs and STA seem to be more important.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
Kainoa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nightvision isnt nearly as big a deal as it used to be. Another upgrade to your helm that would be relatively inexpensive would be a champions helm.  Not great, but serviceable until you can get better.  Your helm, bp, boots, and waist are your weakest slots.  The boots have way too low AC, I'd say replace them with champs, raldukan, ornate, or LDoN.  Champions gear is an upgrade to several of those slots until you can afford or camp better.  Waist, soulscream belt from Veksar is nice and easy to get if you can actually get the camp.  A good, easily attainable BP is the darkguard chestplate from the theatre camp in Veksar, dropped by trooper muruk I think.<br />
<br />
Edit:  For shoulders, draconic pauldrons or strength of the elements. Both quested, draconic is a much easier quest, but the str of the elements had more ac and has sta and raw hps, where the draconic just has 12 sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would recommend getting the helmet from everfrost.  No stat pieces are the first ones to go.  After you unlock 760 points from everfrost, I would hit up NRO to get the 54ac 60hp Breastplate- normal adventure drop.  I would hold onto that till you can manage a vindy bp.<br />
<br />
Everything else is preference on replacing.</div></div><hr />
