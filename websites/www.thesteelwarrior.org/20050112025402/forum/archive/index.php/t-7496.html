Like what are the PH's for the named do certain named only spawn in certain areas.  <br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if you tryin to get the Hynid Howler to spawn kill the hynids. From what I have seen the named can spawn anywhere but I try to do most of my hunting around the ikkinz raid areas to the right as you enter the zone. Usually get a few named to spawn after several hours of clearing. Or you can get there after a patch and I have seen as many as 5 named up at once.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe there are actually specific spots, it's just that there are a lot of them. I've camped the front temple area a bunch. From what I've seen, the front left Mastruq can pop as a random named mastruq. There are two Aneuk roamers that roam in and out of the temple. Those can both spawn named. They may be random, but it appears that one spawns Pixxt Nervehammer and the other spawns Pixxt Tyrannist. THe back center Ixt inside the temple can spawn as a named, as well as the middle ghost in the far right room inside. If you clear the crags and hynids that come up in that pass you will see the Rager and Howler. I have no idea if it is a specific PH for those or not, but you don't have to clear back very far from zone in to get either of them to spawn.<br />
<br />
Beyond that I haven't done a whole lot of farming, but a few others are the center Aneuk outside the zone in to the first Ikkinz trial. As well as the snake on the top right stage in the same temple. Also, if you go past the all the crags and go into the south temple. The Ikaav in the center room can be named and 2 more named spawn in the rooms down the left hall.</div></div><hr />

The majority of the spawns / ph in the zone are static.  Once you learn where they are from having them up after patches and just killing, you'll know where to pull and get the most possible name spawns before mobs re-spawn.</div></div><hr />
