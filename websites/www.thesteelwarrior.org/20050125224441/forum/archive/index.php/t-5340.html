It says increases my attack speed by 30% but I have CoF for haste and it stacks with enchanter and shaman haste. I was under the impression that you could not have more than 1 Spell haste and 1 Item haste but I have them both up when grouped with a 56 chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sisthar</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also got awarded 2 pieces of ornate from a friend as a congratz to getting to 55. I have the helmet and gauntlets now. I am thinking about looking into getting more as my current guild does CoD every day and I can easily get to go with them and maybe get more. Is there any signifigant one pice that I should look for given my current profile?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have nice gear for your level I wouldn't worry about upgrading that FH stuff with ornate for a while.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Because VQ doesn't have haste in the same slot as MV, vallon doesn't overwrite the MV icon, but the higher hate % takes precedence, and if you have VQ your Miraculous Visions buff won't do anything.<br />
<br />
VQ will also stack with shaman haste, but you still just have 68% haste.<br />

The long duration is such a blessing (from a former eyepatch user)</div></div><hr />
