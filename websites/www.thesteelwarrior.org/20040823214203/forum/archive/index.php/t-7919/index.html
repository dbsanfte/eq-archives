<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jerlaxle Noamuth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what other info would some1 need to help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">something like :<br />
your os, with its lattest patch you have<br />
your PC configuation/power/structure<br />
a detail of what you did to EQ since last time you successfully connected<br />
...<br />
<br />
but they will certainly ask you what they want to know at sony's support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">uninstall and reinstall eq<br />
yes i know its a pita but with the genericness of the error thats probably yer best bet, unless you can give a lot more detailed info about the problem, like when it started (i dont mean June 14th, i mean like did it happen after you installed something else recently, power failure, hardware change etc). what other software is running on your box, have you scanned for viruses at trendmicro.com(other antivirus proigrams dont count since they suck and miss a LOT of trojans)? have you removed all spyware from yer machine etc</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2 questions.<br />
<br />
What Video Card do you use?<br />
<br />
How long has it been since you were able to log in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Montoliot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you have directX 9 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarhl_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">an over abundance of running processes can cause the client to crash.  use msconfig (from START &gt; RUN) to turn off unneccesary processes in the startup menu. <br />
<br />
You can also check out OS guides by Black Viper (http://www.blackviper.com)to &quot;tweak&quot; your system and get rid of unneccesary background services etc.  <br />
<br />
RPG experts have some ideas also<br />
 http://rpgexpert.com/734.html<br />
<br />
Once in game you can use the new petition interface to get help on &quot;client crash&quot; they have a number of suggestions you can try.<br />
<br />
***edit below***<br />
If all else fails wipe the C: drive and reinstall windows =P<br />
(you DID partition your drive so you can wipe the OS without loosing all your programs and files didn't you?!?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jerlaxle Noamuth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">could it have anyhting to do with having the game installed on 2 computers could it?                i dont ussually play on this computer but for right now its the only one i can play on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Could it have to do with answer the questions so we can try to help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you haven't areadly try shutting down and letting the PC sit for a minute and then restarting. <br />
<br />
Very hard to say what may be wrong without knowing the details. For example i have never had a problem with running too many apps to launch EQ but I rarely have more than 6 things going (Email, IM, music, IE (a couple of times) EQ itself) but I run a system with 1 GIG of ram. If you tried the same on somethign say, with 256 meg of ram I could see windows gacking all overyou.</div></div><hr />

i have nothing else running and ive had this problem for over a week...<br />
  why does it matter what kind of video card i have the game ussually works but since i got comcast it sorta stopped but most people ive talked to say it has nothing to do with the cable connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Okay so I am gathering you don't know what vid card you have. My assumption is that your card does not support dx9. I just went through and had to toss some memory and a new vid card into my nephews machine for the same reason and the symptom was identical. <br />
<br />
Instead of arguing why not to tell someone something if you don't want to know the answer to your questions don't ask. I can stop paying attention to your posts really easy. I was trying to help and you were being stubborn. Good luck hope the whole it just dont work fix it thing works out for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mistersparkle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hi guys. i have an eq problem. i will be very vague in what is wrong. i will dodge any questions that you ask of me regarding my problem. i will be stubborn and arrogant to the questions i do somewhat reply to. so ya please help me because you all owe me<br />
<br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
FIRST ERROR !!!!!<br />
even win XP, which is meant to not be restarted, need to be restarted sometimes when things are going really bad, or when you update a software which isn't 200%  winXP compatible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You could always try deleting eqgame.exe and downloading it off the patcher...also somtimes if you log into the test server and download that patch, then go back and patch live, you will get rid of a corrupted file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jerlaxle Noamuth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Okay so I am gathering you don't know what vid card you have. My assumption is that your card does not support dx9.  .<br />
ive been able to play since the dx9 patch and have dx9 on my computer already so..., also ive tried uninstalling the game and deleting all the files then reinstalling it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, if I were you I'd go to the official EQ tech boards, post what they ask you to post and see what their response is. They deal with issues like yours ALOT, so they can likely point you in the right direction. Failing that, try the live chat for support. They're not always helpful, but it's another option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jerlaxle Noamuth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ill try (again lol) and hopefully theyll help this time, thanks very much for everyones help on this problem. =)      <br />
