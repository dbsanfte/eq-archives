I mean, she had put in a whole 6 hours and deserved sumtin for her time right? lol what a joke and the lame attempt at justifying it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the laugh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its just hard to believe people still do this kinda shit and expect to not get caught.  Then claim a righteous attitude when they do ... its funny really, which is one of the reasons i posted it.  That, and i wanted to get the word out to Xegony about her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No server drama here plz.  I'm sure the Xegony people can get this crucial information from the server board.</div></div><hr />

You rock on that thread!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd have to rate that like a 2 on the 1-10 scale for xeg drama, doesn't even come close to some of the shit from 2-3 years ago. Sad thing is if the person really wanted to they could easily use some of the loopholes through legends to get recordless name change, geared server change too if they really wanted heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">duppolfg</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the best part was the GM sided with him/her and let him/her keep the damn weapon. Haha...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GMs havent really sided with her, if they did, Callick would have never gotten the blade.<br />
<br />
Shes just been neglecting to log on, so the GMs cant take it from her, they cant take items from an account that isnt logged on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I give it a 3 as well. Boring shit. It got reposted to our guilds public boards too, and the response was mostly along the lines of 'Remind us why we care?'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I take that back after reading past page one. I rate it an 8 of 10, for anyone to get Sienea that mad makes me chuckle. Plus some of the other antics of this Fyreborne on that board in the past.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">happens on TM everyday. we don't bring it to serverboard thats just gay. but i guess xegony has some problems. well i guess it was wrong of the person to loot but i wanna see callicks old magelo before he got the weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xegony is the ghetto, so much so that I am surprized so many people reacted to this one person Ninja'ing. Apparently the GM's sided with the thief and both the ninja and the ninja'ee got shiney new Keen Edged Cleavers out of the whole ordeal. <br />
<br />
Reps I guess are a bigger deal on Xegony then maybe some other servers where more casual and laid back players grind and nobody gives a fook about the asshats in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are like 3 servers where rep doesn't mean anything. It's just that taking this (which is a fairly common occurence sadly) to a serverwide level is a little much, even if Xegony's board is teh suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Links to Drama = GUUUUD<br />
<br />
You got stuff to read while CRing after a bad pull :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xegony boards being teh suck would be an improvement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then again the board only is only an extension of the server~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skullreaper Zek</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing wrong with letting people know serverwide in the day and age of server transfers for $. Of course he could change his name too, but the point is lets make it hard on em.<br />
<br />
Ninjas are the scum of Everquest. I remember the last two times a CoF dropped off of Naggy they were ninjaed. Once by a level 60 (Pre-PoP) Warrior who would have been banished had he actually got close to him.<br />
<br />
There is nothing like the excitement of downing your first dragon, only to be slapped in the face by a greedy ninja. Fook em. Tell everyone. If you are not interested, dont read it. Just make sure the facts are straight first before posting (logs, pics etc.)</div></div><hr />
