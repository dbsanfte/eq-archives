<br />
I leveled my warrior to 38 up to around the time that Kunark was released.  I then quit playing EQ because I noticed some disturbing trends having to do with my RL responsibilities / EQ play time ratio.  Well, I’m back into EQ now and have been playing my warrior again for about 2 months.<br />
<br />
It’s been interesting coming back to the game after a 2 year hiatus.  Back then, warriors were THE tank, and paladins were an amusing class that you rolled if you wanted to solo or something.  Now paladins are the uber tanks (funny how things change).  I’ve had my own depressing experiences with several pallys getting groups while I sit around with my /lfg flag up, and it’s not fun.  I’d consider rolling a paladin and starting over but I have no interest in going through the newbie grind again.  Besides, I rolled a warrior because I wanted to be the beastly animal that picks his teeth with the bones of his victims, not the holier than thou pristine wuss that is a paladin (no offense to the pristine wusses out there).<br />
<br />
Anyways, for what it’s worth, this is my perspective coming from someone who hasn’t gone through the progressive slide into mediocrity and ultimately coffee maker status that is the warrior, but rather had an abrupt, overnight wake up call.<br />
<br />
Knights need to be nerfed, or at least their ability to generate aggro through stuns needs to be nerfed<br />
<br />
There, I said it.  I’ve lurked these boards for more hours than I care to think about, and don’t claim to be the expert that many of the old-timers here are, but this is the conclusion I’ve come to.  All the many other well thought out ideas posted here are interesting, and would certainly make warriors more viable for groups, but I think they result in more mudflation of skills and abilities without addressing the real issue.<br />
<br />
I believe the real issue is aggro-lock.  This is the game breaking, boredom instilling, tactics eliminating monster that SoE created with the stun line of spells that paladins have.  I don’t believe that those stuns are “working as intended” for pallys, I think they are just an unintended consequence, and SoE is terrified of pulling out the nerf bat, particularly with viable EQ alternatives on the horizon.  Another issue is the fact that most other classes have come to take this ability of paladins for granted, and would raise bloody hell if they were forced to go back to real aggro management.  All the aggro-proccing weapons out there are SoE’s attempt to nudge warriors back into balance with paladins, but given the nature of procs, they will never equal the instant-aggro abilities that paladins have that is most sought after by xp groups looking for the best xp / time ratio they can come up with.<br />
<br />
I don’t see any other simple, viable, practical solution, and apparently neither does SoE, or they would have dealt with it by now.  The aggro generating procs on weapons are an admitted band-aid fix by SoE while they try to TRULY resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
Aggro produced by paladin stuns should be reduced (maybe by extended re-use times, I don’t really know) to put paladins on  a level playing field with warriors.  I’d be satisfied with that – putting pallys lower on the aggro generating list would go a long ways towards putting them back into irrelevant amusement status which I don’t believe anyone wants.<br />
<br />
The balance would be maintained by the (admittedly not huge) utility advantage that paladins have with their spell book (post stun nerf), balanced by the slightly better mitigation / meatshield abilites of warriors and their albatross /defensive ability.<br />
<br />
Itemization and the shrinking melee stat gap between warriors and paladins is puzzling to me, but I don’t think that’s nearly as big an issue as the aggro-generating stun issue, and to be honest with you I really don’t care that much, just so long as warriors can go back to at least equally viable status with paladins for tanking.<br />
<br />
I know that this solution would not be liked by all (particularly paladins, of course), but I think it’s what needs to be done to not only fix warriors, but fix the larger issue of instant aggro-lock.<br />
<br />
That’s my 2 cp worth.  Feel free to call me an idiot if I’m borked here, but I don’t see any other solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>magnes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">id like to see my SLAM cause the agro that a stun spell causes, same thing right? stun is a stun in my book. and pallys get the agro even if the spell didnt stick, so WTF?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Once again: Why should agro generation by any class be reduced?  Why not give Warriors ways to generate agro for themselves?  An action should generate the sufficient level of reaction.<br />
<br />
Too many ignore the thing that keeps the entire Stun Line in check in raids.  Nerf the agro on stuns and I gaurentee you give Paladins on raids more fun stuff to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're most certainly correct that the difference in snap aggro between the knight classes and the warrior is the major balance issue between the tank classes. However, I would suggest that the heart of the issue is not the existance of this aggro disparity, but rather, the vast inflation of its importance to the exp group. <br />
<br />
When I fight in PoP, I fight mobs that at a minimum, double for 750. Triples on a faster delay for 700 are common, and quads for 850+1k proc are not unheard of. I cannot tank these kinds of mobs unslowed. You can do it under /disc, but disciplines are shitty tools for reasons all over the board here, I won't go into them. As far as the cleric is concernced, you and me are functionally equivalent to cardboard in front of these mobs. Except that we have a chanter to slow them. Great! We're still functionally identical, the cleric can keep us up.. Yay! Oops. Slow generates tons of aggro. Here's where the difference that matters starts to happen. I will most likely keep the mob off the enchanter. 99.9% certain.  If you didn't pregenerate enough aggro, and you probably won't, you've got a 60% chance of getting his attention at the press of a button. Well, that's nice, but... That's still almost 1 in two mobs where the enchanter's getting meleed. If he's got Arcane Rune up and slow landed, our enchanter probably won't get one rounded. He's probably got about 4khp buffed, after all + 1kish on rune.  It'll cost the cleric a sup remedy, the same mana as cheal, but he'll live. But if slow didn't land, that mob will probably get 2-3 rounds off before your second 60% chance of getting the mob off him comes around. If he's got low AA, that's a bloodstain in a dress-shaped outline in the floor. But if he doesn't slow off the bat.. Are you gonna take 7 miunte breaks while that /disc recycles? Piss away 800-2000 mana from the cleric every fight on sup rems for you? Tunare forbid you've got a druid healer. No one really gives a shit about the rogues and monks and wizards. Yeah, it cuts their DPS a bit, maybe 5%, but they've got evade and FD and concussion and so on and so forth. That poor enchanter never even got the chance to use boggle, and waiting on the slow was just as costly as not waiting. It's the same issue that was always there, just no one gave a shit before if the chanter took a round or two from a gimp frog who doubled for 140. In addition, that chanter had ways to deal with the mob beating on him. Those methods are either too slow or ineffective against 55+ level mobs. Remember when a chanter could -turn mob's attacks off- with coordinated cycling of Color spells? Those days are what's gone. <br />
<br />
The problem with LDON is only slightly different: When you're potentially limited to 45 seconds per mob counting pull, can you let a warrior have 10 of them to gather aggro?<br />
<br />
Simply put, The game no longer allows for the pace at which warriors gain initial aggro in the optimal scenario. Either mobs need to be tuned down, which with the gear and spells of the current bazaar twink will render the game trivial in nearly every aspect, or warriors need to be given some form of snap aggro.  We can debate the ramifications of the limits on it for thousands of pages, as well as other fixes to make warriors fun as well as functional, but the choice is to eat your wheaties, or to piss in everyone's. Here's your spoon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I certainly don't like urine in my flakes, so for that reason I will gladly pass on the opportunity to do so for everyone else. You can have the spoon back thank you.<br />

This issue will not be resolved by nerfing Paladin stun. This issue is best resolved by SOE going ahead and giving pure melee the upgrades that should have been forthcoming for the past four expansions. I'm not talking about item upgrades. We got those, and so did everyone else (hint: all/all, plate/all itemization). I'm talking about core stat and ability upgrades. Casters got increased mana regen post 60. I honestly don't know if melee got the same amount of hit regen. Hell, pure melee should get hitpoint regen equal to mana regen AND hitpoint regen, seeing as the do now have a mana pool to speak of.<br />
<br />
Casters got massive core ability upgrades (spells). Pure melee got...to use a quote...Jack and shite, and Jack left town. Give pure melee the upgrades that should have been there. Give pure melee increased hitpoints, AC and abilities. The content progressed, but we sure didn't. Hell, situationally, a Paladin has more hitpoints than a warrior in certain grouping situations in which the warrior does not have the proper amount of buffage.<br />
<br />
Here is a hint:<br />
<br />
Give warriors an innate stamina bonus for each level above 60 and allow warrior stamina to go above the max stat cap (currently 305 I do believe, with AA). I don't think it at all unreasonable to give warriors a max stamina of 315.<br />
<br />
Also give warriors an innate magic resistance increase for each level over 60. you would think that after dealing with casters for over 60 levels (and having been casted on time and time again) Warriors would have built up a certain amount of immunity to it.<br />
<br />
Start moving warrior berserk range up once they get past level 50, and give warrior berserk some real teeth. Maybe by the time a warrior reaches level 65, they go berserk whenever they get under 50 percent health, and the Berserk rage gives +50 Strength, +50 Speed (stacks like bard song) and additional mitigation, but have it also lower Agi, Dex, Wis, Int, and Cha by 50 points as well. If they really want to add an element of fun into the game, give a small percentage chance (less than 1%) that the warrior will lose control of himself and attack whichever target is closest)<br />
<br />
I suggested earlier about giving warriors a new skill that allows them an increased chance of triggering a proc on the weapon in their primary weapon slot. This fits in well to the hate proc bandaid fix that SOE gave us, but it also mitigates warrior reliance on the fickle RNG. For hate at a distance, give warriors +hate arrows (again in my suggestion). not procs, mind you, but arrows that work along the line of the +hate spells that SKs have.<br />
<br />
I like Woody's idea on the GU Comics forum of giving warriors intimidation. Hell, if I were to meet my toon in a dark alley, him decked out in all his armor and weapons, you can be damn sure I'm headed the other way. Warriors should be intimidating. We should scare the piss out of those little greenies who step on our toes and make them leave a trail of yellow for us to slide on when they run away.<br />
<br />
Oh well) I should wrap this up by saying; leave Paladin stun aggro where it is, give warriors more core abilities to handle the content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Slow has such a HUGE ability to insure that the mob in question is going to die that I really don’t have a problem with him getting pissed and wanting to separate the chanters head from his body.  That seems like a perfectly rational response to me.  I would say that the balance that should occur here is not in raising the aggro generating abilities of warriors to compensate, but rather giving the enchanters the appropriate upgrade to their spells which allow them to help diffuse the situation.  They already have them; they’re just not as effective as they should be on high level mobs.  I’m not saying that SoE should trivialize this either.  The hate generated by slow is and should be dangerous for the enchanter and should continue to be one of the tense moments of the fight, and the difficulty for the chanter to survive this situation should of course be scaled appropriately to the difficulty of dispatching the mob.  It just makes sense to me that, let’s say from an evolutionary perspective, the enchanter should be able to at least HELP himself not get killed.  As you pointed out, many classes have these abilities that are useable at the high end.  <br />
<br />
As far as LDoN is concerned – my post was mainly intended to explain my thoughts out the easiest way for SoE to solve the problem of warriors not being able to do their jobs without breaking other aspects of the game.  I guess my simple answer to tweaking LDoN to remain balanced with the new aggro equation would perhaps involve extending the time limit to complete the mission (/shrug).<br />
<br />
I’m not really knocking giving warriors more utility and “fun factor” while also fixing the balance issue, that’d be great.  I’d just like to see if there is a way to boil the issue down to its essence, and give SoE a solution that helps to solve the major issue of warrior vs. knight balance, while minimizing the consequences on the other side of the equation that then need to be fixed as well.  It’d be great if all the suggestions made by Gyrfalcon and others could be implemented as well, and perhaps they will be someday (to some extent), but I’d like to have a solution that is as simple as possible to implement so that it can be done quickly, and put warriors back on the map in xp groups.  Then we can continue to /lobby for additional perks to add utility to the warrior so that we can pwn pallys (just kidding about that last part).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also give warriors an innate magic resistance increase for each level over 60. <br />
<br />
Warriors have always had this. We gain 1pt innate MR for every 2 levels we gain - +30mr innate at 60, +32 at 65. Take off your gear and see.<br />
<br />
If they really want to add an element of fun into the game, give a small percentage chance (less than 1%) that the warrior will lose control of himself and attack whichever target is closest) <br />
<br />
If a warrior gets a chance of breaking mez and there's nothing he can do about it, he won't be tank anywhere other than raids; people won't wanna chance it when a knight's safer around mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
I think the emerging picture that people are agreeing on is, increase warrior snap agro ability. You can't say it'll trivialize exp grouping since knights have this already, for better or worse. So it's nothing new. Also, the argument that it'll trivialize raids is increasingly going out the window as knights tank more and more boss mobs. <br />
<br />
Heck a friend of mine's playing a paladin on Zeb (server I have alts on) and he's been telling me his guild's been using knights to tank on raids more and more, and his guild isn't endgame - they're around vindi/ntov level, not yet elemental. Knights tanking on raids are doing it throughout the spectrum, not just on the very high end, so SOE can't say snap agro will trivialize raiding. It slready IS trivializing raiding. All warriors want is to be brought up to par.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Once again: Why should agro generation by any class be reduced? Why not give Warriors ways to generate agro for themselves? An action should generate the sufficient level of reaction. <br />
<br />
 There are more ways to deal with the problem rather than changing the amount of aggro they do. One could hard cap Cease and Desist so that they CANNOT be cast on mobs higher than.....mmmm, 40. That would solve a great deal right there.<br />
<br />
 However, rather than have them change all the content once Warriors would be given snap aggro, (And they would, because snap aggro breaks content,) adjusting Knights back down to realistic aggro generation is easily done by comparison. Add resist components so it's not a tool for locking. It also promotes aggro management......something everyone did just fine with all the way up through PoP.</div></div><hr />
