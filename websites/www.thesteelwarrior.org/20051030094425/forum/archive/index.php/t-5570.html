<br />
In this thread (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=19192)<br />
<br />
 Basically, go here (http://eqemulator.net/search.php). Find the weapon you're curious about. In the right hand column is a field for &quot;unknown070&quot;. The number after that is the proc rate modifier. 0 is default, 2 procs per minute.<br />
<br />
 For example.<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy (http://eqemulator.net/item.php?id=OTI3ODguNDAzOTgzMTU=). We all know it procs around 3 times per minute. It's unknown70 value is 55. It procs roughly 55% more than default.<br />
<br />
Furious Hammer of Zek (http://eqemulator.net/item.php?id=NzM2NjEuNTQ4MDg2NzE=). Cleric hammer from VZ(tactics). Is 530.<br />
<br />
 Anyhoo, there's a full list of all 38 items in game with modified rates in the SK thread. Looks 100% accurate.<br />
<br />
 Warrior-centric ones are...<br />

<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord - 30<br />
Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled - 65</div></div><hr />

<br />
do augments take the procrate of the weapon, or their own value?<br />
<br />
I'm sure this is answered elsewhere, but the definitive  answer would be a welcome addition to this information.<br />

Cleric hammers proc 10 times a min or so?  I knew it was more than the standard 2 procs per min, but I've never noticed it being by that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And, following up that line of thought, perhaps the actual name for that field is... Combat Effects :D</div></div><hr />

A couple notes...somewhere in the middle, I lost some dex somehow (not quite sure...I don't think I had any dex buffs when I started) and dropped to 271.  That'll skew the rate a little lower, but it should be within acceptable limits still.  41% haste, 12something atk, but that's not important.  The listed proc rate for the scim seems to be spot on.<br />
<br />
Also, notice the a3 proc rate.  Looks like augs aren't dependant on the rate of the weapon they're put on, but on their own independant rate.  Kinda what I thought from the beginning, but good to know for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Edit: Also, I'll (hopefully) lay to rest the question of whether or not augs proc at their own rate or based on the weapon.

<br />
Augs definitely proc at their own rate. My Furious Hammer gets about 12.5PPM (which supports the data in that SK thread), and my augmented Guard I proc doesn't get anywhere near that. 2PPM is likely - I've never parsed my Guard I proc - but the difference between 12.5PPM and 2 is large enough to be eyeballed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Admittedly not a big enough sample or ideal conditions. But over 1 hour non-stop fight, blue con mob. 270dex. 71% haste. Flurry6, PB3, Fero3.<br />
<br />
Got4W<br />
60min from behind<br />
153 procs<br />
<br />
PPM = 2.55<br />
<br />
 So within 5 hundredths of the predicted rate. Easily attributed to the relatively short length of the log, and to not having 305dex.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
 I'm curious about the cleric Time hammer now. It was last updated in the Emu server on 9-13. Any chance it's rate has been upped/fixed since then?<br />
<br />
 From Oct 9th patch message<br />
<br />
&quot;- Made changes to various stats and effects on Plane of Time items.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Found nothing concrete on cleric boards about it. Making a post to ask.</div></div><hr />
