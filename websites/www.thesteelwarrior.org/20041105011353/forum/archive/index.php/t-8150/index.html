Need advice of all kinds: what gear to go after next, and where.  Also, was thinking of putting 20% into AA's, and would like recommendations of which skills to choose first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My standard advice is to go to the bazaar, carefully search each slot by AC, race, religion, class and start with a reasonable price range: say 2K. In your case, I'd just search by AC. Take notes on the cheapest AC for the buck (not only the price, but the other characteristics of the gear--resists and hitpoints).<br />
You need more AC. I haven't played a small warrior so I'm not entirely sure what's out there for an agnostic dwarf.<br />
A lot of warriors aim for around 20 AC/ level. That's not hard-and-fast, but it will give you something to shoot for.<br />
I think you might find some upgrades in your armor slots for 2K or less in price.<br />
You probably also ought to buy a Greatstaff of Thunder, which you'll be able to use in a level or two and which is cheap aggro.<br />
Partly what to do next depends on how many friends you have and how much you play. You could start pounding LDoNs out, saving points for augments (aggro augments) and maybe some armor.<br />
You might also dedicate some time to farming (I'm assuming this is your main and you don't have lots and lots of cash). Other posts here can give you some ideas about farming spots.<br />
Concerning AAs: the first most folks get is Run3. After that, perhaps Regen 3. You need 6 general AAs, and most of them aren't worth that much. Run3 is still handy at lvl 65; most of the others are not worth very much at that point.<br />
If you are as broke as you look, though, at some point I think you might consider putting experience grinding on the back burner until you can get some plat for upgrades (or put 90% into AAs until you get Run3 at least).<br />
If you are in a guild, I'd talk to the other warriors in it, assuming there are higher-level warriors in the guild. They might be pretty happy to help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">General Gear Advice:<br />
Go immediately to the bazaar and search for &quot;heraldic&quot; with your race as one of the criteria. Once the results come back, be sure you're looking at the pieces that won't conflict with your diety. Now, buy as many of those as you can afford. Start with your waist, if the girdle is available. The heraldic will carry you well into your 60's. Other posters will have more specific suggestions for particular slots; my advice is for a general way for you to upgrade &quot;everything&quot;.<br />
<br />
AA Advice:<br />
If I had it to do over, I wouldn't turn on AA experience until I got to 65. You get such a major boost in your effectiveness just from dinging up that's it's amazing. Furthermore, the general AA's (with the exception of Run Speed) are not worth the time you pour into them while you're in your 50's. That hard won exp pays better dividends if it's invested in levelling. <br />
<br />
My 2cp -- your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dwavlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did the search on Heraldic.  Apparently Heraldic is not available for Dwarfs.<br />
<br />
I have done quite a few LDoNs, and have a bunch of Augs which are not in my Magelo, but I'll put them in.  Actually, I was expecting someone to yell at me about Haste items, or getting some Keys to get specific pieces.<br />
<br />
I plan on Leveling till I get my Defensive Dicipline.  I was wondering if putting AA's on and spending some time just working on gear was the right thing to do, and if so, what gear upgrades to go for.<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder is a 2H blunt, and required lvl of 55 (currently am 54).  I'd like to keep 2 one hand weaps in my slots in order to skill up, and to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
As for play: I average 2-3 hours on weekday evenings, and 4-5 hours on w/e play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">brellium is for derfs<br />
<br />
mainly look for ac and hp. gear even if you lose a cupple ac in one spot the 20-40 hp will make up for it.<br />
<br />
also +sta stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just some ideas for free upgrades and earning exp: Would consider taking a group out and doing zone in and Elysian camp in UP for new Helm of Raldukan and Death Mask of the Elysians. Also a chance of nice BP dropping off Raldukans too. Also, while in UP you may be able to get some drops from Rumble, Doomshade, Zelnithak that often go to twinks or rot when higher levels kill them. Killing Radiir there also yields some pretty good one handers (no procs, but still decent).<br />
<br />
Get some guest invites for raids maybe? Could try to get in on some kael raids and see if you can work out looting some velious quest stuff. Also, seen bow rot quite a few times, and Vindi Bp/Bp of Eradication, Axe from Tormax too. <br />
<br />
Maybe even look for a guild or group of friends that is doing Velious/Luclin content and join up. <br />
<br />
Definately search the bazaar too as cash flow allows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Greatstaff of Thunder is a 2H blunt, and required lvl of 55 (currently am 54).  I'd like to keep 2 one hand weaps in my slots in order to skill up, and to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
GSoT is like 10x the aggro your current weapons are. more dmg too. so just get a lvl and buy one for 100pp and you're set. and unless you're lvling in PoV or PoS as soon as you hit 55, you will have plenty of time to keep your 1h skills up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only skimmed over most posts but it would be easier if you updated your magelo skills. Unless you really have 400 which would not be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dwavlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only skimmed over most posts but it would be easier if you updated your magelo skills. Unless you really have 400 which would not be good.<br />
<br />
I had not before, but now my skills in Magelo are up to date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ah, yes, I suggested the Greatstaff of Thunder because you have a lot of expenses coming up, it will be a jump in aggro for you. You could also go to the bazaar and get the Copper hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn, but again, I don't know how much plat you have and if resources are tight the GSoT is a great weapon for dirt cheap. If I had 10,200 plat and I were you I would not spend all of the plat on a Droga weapon: I'd spend 200 on a GSoT and dump the rest into either haste or AC. (You'd have to save more for the haste, though).<br />
If your weapon skill in 2hb is low, it will only influence the damage you do, not the aggro the weapon produces. So you won't be endangering your aggro by skilling up in a group situation, though your dps might fall a bit. You'll get skill ups pretty fast, though.<br />
If you don't get an aggro weapon then pretty soon your group mates are going to be yanking the mobs off you right and left. Or they will have to throttle back their damage output, causing the mob to stay up longer, causing you to take more damage, causing your cleric to be grumpy.<br />
You can level to 56 for defensive, but again, if this is your main character you will find that you can level faster as a warrior than you can make plat for gear upgrades. I don't think you want to get much higher than lvl 56 while you still have less than 1000 AC. <br />
I think Frostpaw's idea about Kael raids might be worth a look. There's a quest that starts in Thurgadin for Champion's armor that you might pick up some random drops for on a Kael raid; nowadays most of the folks on such a raid will have better gear than that and there might not be many folks rolling on the drop you need.<br />
And yes, you do need some haste; there's a post in the library about warrior usable haste items. Check the bazaar prices on the stuff. I'd look for 31% haste, which obviously isn't as good as 36% haste, but is close considering it will cost half as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Take a look at my magelo to maybe get some Ideas.  The Fabled haste belt you can't get now but otherwise the rest should be available.  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=781201&amp;resize=true<br />
<br />
I'm not much better off than you, but maybe you'll see something there you can go for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dwavlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have easily enough TaK LDoN points (300 or so) to get the 21% haste aug, and I can put it in a type-3 back slot.  I didn't know if I should save on the LDoN points, tho, but since I can re-sell the aug and back item later, I think I will make that purchase.   At least that gets me to 21% haste.<br />
<br />
I don't seem to have a lot of trouble holding aggro - in fact in last LDoN the cleric complained that she would rather have our pally tank, as she was having to heal me to much (the pally died on the next pull, tho so we tried to split it after that - he would take hits for awhile, but even w/o taunt/provoke I would get aggro).  <br />
<br />
I only have about 3000 plat in the bank, so your assessment is correct: I can level much faster than I can get gear upgrades- that's exactly what has happened, so now I find myself in pitiful gear in my mid-50's... thus this thread.  Unless someone else has an idea, I will follow Frostpaws advice and head over to UP tonight and see if I can find that Raldukan Helm- definately could upgrade the head gear.  Would also like to find some better wrist and Leg slot items somewhere.  If I can get some good No-drop items somewhere, maybe I can tank without annoying my cleric, at least.<br />
<br />
Other ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, the 21% haste might be a short-term boost. Better than nothing, for sure.<br />
Before you slap the haste on your current cloak, certainly look in the bazaar to see if you can get one with more AC. Seems like I got an Ancient Seahorse hide cloak (AC 20, Hp 25) once a while ago for &lt;200 plat. Anyway, look before you aug.<br />
Another thing you can do in the bazaar is check for halas 10-pound meat pies and Grobb liquidised meat. Both are cheap stat boosts (hitpoints). Be sure you know how to use stat food first (but I assume you do).<br />
Since you know about LDoN stuff, bazaar searches, and Frostpaw's suggestions...I'm not thinking of anything substantial. If you actually know a dwarf gm smith, you might be able to work out a per-combine fee on the cultural stuff...if you gather the subcomponents a smith might cut you a big break, and even the agnostic stuff would be good (bleh, assuming dwarves have agnostic cultural...not up on the small guys' stuff, I'm afraid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dwavlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok,  first I'll check with Guild to see about advice on farming plat somewhere- maybe someone else needs to farm too.  I'll also ask guild about any uber Dwarven smiths. After that, I'll head over to Bazaar and see about stat food, invis and SoW potions (for the potential Corpse run in ME or UP if I end up solo-ing).  <br />
<br />
Any other places where some good no-drop items might be rotting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">there is no way you're gonna be soloing ME or UP. and nobody is going to just hand you a helm, if anyone is even there. <br />
<br />
maybe try going for some of the lower point cost ldon armors, like the 442 Vicious Ooze stuff from Guk. that'll get you to 55 along the way so you can use a gsot. and if you find yourself lvling too fast again, switch on aa till your gear catches up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dwavlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You are correct: Can't could not find any NoDrop items rotting, and LDoN appears to be the quickest route to upgrading most Armor pieces.  I'd like GuK, but for some reason it has a bad rep on my server: have trouble finding people willing to even try a Normal there.   Have no trouble getting folks for MM or Tak, and the occasional Mir, but Guk, no.  Give me some reasons other classes might want to go to GuK, so I can convince them, please.<br />
<br />
I sold off some old weaps to make more plat: up to about 6K now.  I've upgraded some armor too- will update Magelo later on.  Looks like I'm gonna be farming a bit, but first I'll hit 55, get a few XPs, and turn AA's on to 90%, so I can collect plat to upgrade gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dwavlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ya, there's no rotting No Drops that I have seen, and I'm to impatient to wait- would rather play.  Even Farming greenies is more interesting, which looks like my next step, in between LDoNs.<br />
<br />
How do I convince other classes to do Guk, or S Ro?  I can get groups easy for BB, N Ro, or EF, but Guk, and S Ro are tough sells.</div></div><hr />
