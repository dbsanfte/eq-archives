<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dags</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok all I have left for defensive aa's is LR5.  Like a retard I didnt do this early so I have to get it done.  I do LDON hards from time to time, I want to do more but I only hit about 8400 hps with group buffs.  So this doesnt make LDON hards very easy for the healer until it's slowed.  Once they are slowed they are trivial for me to tank.<br />
<br />
But I was wondering, I am close to having my anger 3 augment so I want to do WA to some point.  I am also 245hps from breaking 9k raid buffed so I want to do Sturdiness to another point.<br />
<br />
I was wondering will LR5 be the way I should go and just suffer?<br />
<br />
Does LR5 make much of a difference?<br />
<br />
Would LR5 make a difference on making LDON hard mobs easier to tank?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think it owns and +HP stuff blows compare to LR/ID usefullness for raids and xp.</div></div><hr />

Care to share a link to those posts since search/advanced search netted me links to my post and one other that had nothing to do with LR5.<br />
<br />
I always use search before I post.  But thanks for the reply.</div></div><hr />

Once you get the anger 3 aug, you can put points into the first 2 or 3 levels of WA since the proc rate increase remains consistent regardless of the level.  First few levels of WA offer good return for the points spent.  Once you get WA2 or 3, work on LR.  At least that's how I'd go about using the AA points.  Just make a guild exp group in PoFire and you can grind out a good chunk of those AAs in 1-2 afternoons.</div></div><hr />

WA5 is nice to have, but LR5 is a must to have.</div></div><hr />

LR5 before WA/Sturdy, you won't regret it =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">while a lot of hitpoints is certainly a good thing and am important thing do not forget that defensive aa's is equivalent in every respect to having more hitpoints except with regards to caster mobs. and even caster mobs usually do a lot of melee too.<br />
<br />
ldon hard will never be &quot;trivial&quot; with unslowed mobs. and it certainly wont be &quot;trivial&quot; just because you break 9000hp. but it is impossible without defensive aas. i think you are on the right path completing them and then moving on to hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are delusional if you think LR5 is going to suddenly make you a great tank.  <br />
<br />
It is merely a tool that will increase your tanking effectiveness.  Nothing more.<br />
<br />
If you need to avoid a proc to live, you have no business tanking that mob in the first place.<br />
<br />
I guess people never realized that mob still misses you without LR5 and thinks any misses after you get LR5 must be attributed to LR5.  Given GoD's seemingly abundant use of mobs with high to-hit I'd even consider doing ID5 before LR5, even in light of Chaos Claws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LR5 alone won't suddenly make you a great tank.  But there is a pretty decent difference.  When used with the rest of the defensive aa, it's a large difference.  Personally I'd do the aa in this order if I did it again- LR5, WA1/2, Sturdiness1/2, WA3/4/5, Sturdiness 3/4/5.<br />
<br />
None of those will really make a big difference in LDoN hard against unslowed mobs.  Even all of them combined wouldn't do much if unslowed.  Main thing that would help there is a good bit more ac imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a bit of a tangent; you might want to experiment with swapping in a ToD for the first 20 secs of the fight.  Getting a quick proc right off the bat is really helpful in Hard LDon. Getting WA aa really helps this alot too (with WA3 I almost always get a pre-slow in on mobs).<br />
<br />
As far as LR/ID etc.  With 8400 net buffed HPs you really want to have both, they do help quite a bit tanking these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You either can tank the mobs unslowed or you don't.  ToD won't really help much at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it will. I know this works AS I HAVE ACTUALLY DONE IT on a frequent basis.  With WA &amp; TOD you can get a fast slow and it *can* make a ton of difference in hard ldon for a 8-9k buffed tank.<br />
<br />
Its OBVIOUS that he cant tank the mob unslowed.  That isnt the point. The point is what can he do to be more successful; thats the CONTEXT I gave him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So are you doing Hard LDoN without a slower, hoping you don't run into a mob that's hasted that happens to resist your ToD slow because that equates to instant death (let's not even talk about what happens if there's more than 1 mob), or does your slower suck so much that they fail to slow a mob in the 20 seconds (on average, assuming maxed WA5) that it takes for ToD to proc?<br />
<br />
If you need to proc to slow a mob you might as well not have slow at all, at least that way your healer will heal more consistently.<br />
<br />
I have done LDoN Hard when it was considered necessary to root a mob before slowing.  So don't tell me I don't know how it works at the lower end.  Even for the nonuber there are far more reliable ways to get something slowed than hoping you'll get a lucky proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I will continue to tell you because clearly you don't know what you are talking about.  Hopefully you can put down your ego long enough to listen.<br />
<br />
 So are you doing Hard LDoN without a slower, <br />
<br />
No you have failed reading comprehension once.  read slowly and carefully this was never mentioned...<br />
<br />
 hoping you don't run into a mob that's hasted that happens to resist your ToD slow because that equates to instant death (let's not even talk about what happens if there's more than 1 mob), <br />
<br />
No mention of hasted mobs (where do you get this stuff?).  What insta death?  Did you bother to read the SWAPPING IN THE TOD part?  No of course not.  OMG did I even talk about doing this multiple mobs?  Are you just rambling on at random?<br />
<br />
 or does your slower suck so much that they fail to slow a mob in the 20 seconds (on average, assuming maxed WA5) that it takes for ToD to proc? <br />
<br />
Yes Phant in today's hard ldon for the non l33t that really does happen....more often than not slowers often DO suck  And if you swap in AFTER you have a couple stun procs/anger guess what...you often get a slow early on (well within the 20 secs you are quoting). And hell guess what if you don't get a proc THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.<br />
<br />
 If you need to proc to slow a mob you might as well not have slow at all, at least that way your healer will heal more consistently. <br />
<br />
Again you are wrong.  And you obviously aren't going to listen...and wtf does healer being consistent have to do with anything?  I swear you just make this stuff up as you go....you don't LOSE agro doing this (if you swap correctly).  There is NO downside (again think about it before responding...better yet TRY it)...and for the 8-9k crowd that may have questionable slowers its VERY helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Root tash slow or Root malo slow works quite well if you just absolutely can't afford to have your slower taking hits.  <br />
<br />
Damage mitigation and aggro control is not the warrior's sole responsibility.  Just about any casting class has far better tools to deal with aggro than a Warrior ever have.  It's up to the other classes to figure out how to use it, not a Warrior's responsiblity to babysit people who don't know how to play their classes with gimmicks.  I remember when I first did yellow mobs in Fire we have to mez a mob outside the camp, slow it, root, and then blur before meleeing it.  If you want to jump through loops to make sure people don't die, make the useless casters jump through the hoops not yourself because they sure have a lot more tricks than we do.</div></div><hr />
