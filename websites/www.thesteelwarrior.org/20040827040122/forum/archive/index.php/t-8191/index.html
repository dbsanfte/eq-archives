<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikemac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a weird experience last night, and I hope someone can help.  I am a lvl 10 (almost 11) Barb who was duoing with a guy in Everfrost.  Doing fine killing yellows and occasional red.  He has to leave and asks if I can out of the zone OK, I say yes (I am in the NE corner).   On my way back, I am jumped by an Orc Shaman who kicked my can with some rather pretty spells.  I hit /loc as this was happening and made sure I died in a &quot;findable&quot; place; in this case on top of one of the white rocks in the middle of the western &quot;Y&quot; of the frozen river.<br />
<br />
Start back in Halas for my CR, no problem.  I head into EF and head directly to where I died.  Only problem is that my corpse wasn't there.  At this point, I was eyeballing where I died, and proceeded to run up and down the river, going on top of each white rock.  Nothing.  I then use the coordiantes I received --  it is not there.  I then start running around hitting my /corpse command in case I can't see it.  Nothing.  I even walked the entire river (both sides of the Y).<br />
<br />
At this point I /ooc &quot;Has anyone seen Mikemac's corpse?&quot;  I receive a couple replies that it is just south of the entrance to PF.  One my way there, I get killed (another orc, joined by a Snow Leopard).  Do the run, go to where they say - Nothing there.  NOTE:  This is nowhere near where I died !<br />
<br />
I keep running around, /ooc and /cor again and somebody says they are standing on my corpse.  I track it down, but it is my &quot;naked&quot; corpse from when I died  on my first CR.  All my stuff is gone.<br />
<br />
I then use the help function that informs me (as I knew) that after 9, you must CR.  What was news to me is that BEFORE 11, your corpse only lasts 30 minutes.  Once you hit 11 (that I was 3 bubbles away from) it lasts 24 hours.  Therefore,  only while you are level 10, you can lose all of your stuff if you don't retrieve your corpse in 30 minutes.  Doesn't seem fair to have that penalty apply to people that are just figuring out how to CR.<br />
<br />
OK, So.  I wouldn't be so upset if my corpse had been where it died.  I was to that spot in about 10 minutes.  How did it get to PF entrance??  I didn't give anyone permission to drag.  Could it have something to do with where I died - on a rock in the river?  Did I float away??   Why was I moved directly east?<br />
<br />
Finally, (sorry for the rant) could my corpse be in the Graveyard?  I know that it goes there after a week - does that apply to mine?  Can I tell if it will be there?  I don't want to redo all of the warrior armor quests again if I can just wait a week and maybe start a new character.  If, however, it won't be coming back, I will build this character back up.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, and any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check the GY zone, shadowrest, but since this happened recently, i dont know.  I thought that when you died at level 10 or below, you kept all your stuff, the reason for a 30 min corpse time for rezes.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that doesnt work, petition.<br />
<br />
<br />
hmm, /consent someone you trust, it will list all the places you have a corpse.  you might have to consent them a couple of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First go back to EF and do /corpse. If it tells you its too far away to summon, then the corpse is somewhere in the zone, if you get a &quot;You do not have any corpses in this zone&quot; message, check Shadowrest. Corpses dont usually go there unless they've been laying around for a few days, but bugs do happen, so Id check that. <br />
<br />
If the corpse is still showing as being in EF somewhere, it may have fallen under the world or be stuck in the rock you died on. Ive had corpses bugged to where you cant drag or rez them because of them being on a slope. Your best bet would be petition and wait it out, or find a necro to summon it if you know one willing to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Buy and use a chipped bone rod.  Go to the area you died, equip this in your onhand, target yourself, and right click it.  It will point you in the direction of your corpse.  Run straight clicking your corpse button.  You should find it.<br />
<br />
I am assuming by this that when you /corpse that it tells you your corpse is too far away and not that you dont have any corpses in this zone.<br />
<br />
Fried</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mikemac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are all correct, it says that it is too far away, not that it isn't there.  My problem is that I already did find the one corpse, it's just that it had no equipment or loot on it.  (I had silks etc . . . worth about 100pp and some pretty good weapons).  <br />
<br />
I also thought that you didn't lose your stuff, but looking at the /help file informs you that you d/n lose your stuff at levels 1-9, once you hit 10, you do.<br />
<br />
I thought that if you died a few times trying to get an toon with equipment, your stuff stayed on it.  Maybe I am wrong.  If I die 20 times trying to get my corpse, do I have 21 (dead and embarrased) corpses laying around for 24 hours?<br />
<br />
I think that I missed the 30 minutes, and that all my stuff will show up in the Graveyard.  <br />
<br />
Many, many thanks for the expert advice doled out to a new player.<br />
<br />

P.S.  How much does the chipped bone thing (can't remember the name) cost.  I have about 100pp in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The SK dark elf in befallen drops them for free but i don't remember his level.  The barbarian that sells potions in the building across from the PoK soulbinder also has them for sale but I'm not aware of the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">not much, they have 3 charges on it, and you can buy plenty.  might need to use 3 charges for it, to learn how it works, and in case something stops you in the terrain.  if all zones where flat, you would only need 1 charge. hehe<br />
<br />
NPC vendors in various starting citys sell em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I recall correctly, the bone rod is less than 2 pp a shot. <br />
<br />
Alternatively, if you can find a friendly necro(any level), SK(9+), or Bard(4+?), they have a spell that does the same thing the chipped bone rod does. Just be polite about it, and don't get testy with them if they tell you they can't help out. Also, try to contain those requests to people actually in EF, you'll get better responses if they don't have to cross half the world.</div></div><hr />

Your equipment will be on the first corpse.  Additional corpses (if you get killed trying to get back or whatever) won't have anything on them unless you pick something up on the way ;) .  Starting at level 11 you lose some xp every time you die.  Empty corpses will have a 3 hour timer on them so you can be resurrected and gain back some of the lost xp.  Corpses that have equipment on them should have week long timers (though only a 3 hour rez timer).<br />
<br />
For future reference,  rez timers count down any time you have your account loaded (even at the character select screen).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mikemac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just wanted to give all a hearty &quot;Thank you.&quot;  Logged on, went to EF, typed /cor, which showed me that the corpse was still in the zone.   No necros or other helpful magic types to be found, so went to Bazaar for chipped bone rod.  I am not even going to tell you what I paid for it, but it wasn't 2pp.  <br />
<br />
Back to EF, used the rod.  Went in a straight line, hitting /cor the entire time.  As I come over a hill, what do I see?  My corpse peacefully laying EXACTLY WHERE I INITIALLY DIED !  On the white rock in the middle of the river.  I had stood on that very rock the night before making up new swear words.  The /loc coordinates were the same.  But it wasn't there the night before.  Was it April Fools day yesterday.  What the ...?<br />
<br />
Oh well, it is a game after all.<br />
<br />
But I just wanted to thank the helpful people for their input.<br />

<br />
hopefully you didnt pay more than 7pp for it, seems like its for sale at 5pp in pok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>corillis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm sorry you had to go through that. GLad you got your corpse back..<br />
<br />
but welcome to EQ.. you'll get used to this kind of bullocks soon. <br />
<br />
After a while you'll learn how to deal with these kind of problems fast..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A couple of things.<br />
<br />
Make sure you keep the chipped bone rod in the bank, lol. Obviously, if you carry it with you, it will be on your corpse when you die.<br />
<br />
If you have trouble finding your corpse (or getting to it) in Everfrost again, try asking politely in /ooc for help reaching your corpse. There's an LDoN camp in the zone and at least a third of the characters there not only can solo everything in the zone but know darn well they aren't doing anything at all for the next 20 minutes. They might help you out, especially if you say you have a loc but are having problems running naked to the corspe without getting killed.<br />
<br />
Start fletching. You can make arrows right away and a bow shortly after that (or you can buy a bow in the bazaar, but make your own arrows). Those orc shaman in Everfrost are nasty but stupid. Even if they root you and run off, they'll turn around to cast on you before they get out of bow range. If you've picked a good spot to fight them, you'll still be able to see them, and you can shoot them to death, heh.<br />
<br />
Also, if you haven't noticed this already, you'll get a message when you are fighting the shaman that they have begun to cast a spell. As soon as you see that, use your bash hotkey. It will interrupt their spells. Your bash won't refresh as fast as the shaman can cast, but you can interrupt 1/2 to 1/3rd of the spells they try to cast.<br />
<br />
Man I hated orc shamans. Kill 'em alll &amp; good luck to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and what server are you on, if you don't mind me asking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mikemac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for the advice.  Yes, those Shaman are tough.  I have been lucky enough to group with some great people, and it takes all of us to nail them, especially with some of the Shaman's other &quot;friends&quot; joining the party.  In fact, one night, we had 5 warriors, all wearing the same newbie Quest armor.  It looked hilarious.  We looked like murderous quintruplets.<br />
<br />
BTW, I am on Morden Rasp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you think you are at the spot where you died but don't see your corpse, it could be just a graphics bug.  Type /corpse and if you are near it you will get the &quot;summoning Mikemac's corpse&quot; message.  If you still can't see it, type /tar mikemac's (with the 's at the end so you don't just target yourself) and see if it comes up on target.  If it does, you can type /loot and get your gear.  Corpses are funny in that they can sometimes sink into geometry, like if you die next to a wall, your corpse may be (on your screen at least) hidden almost completely inside the wall where you can't see it, or just a toe will be sticking out, but /corpse will get it to your feet if you're in range.  <br />
<br />
And yea, don't buy chipped bone rods in the bazaar, anyone selling them there is just a rip-off artist.  You can buy them from NPC vendor in any city for 5pp or so (for a 3-charge rod).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lol, long ago I spent a good long time looking for my corpse in (if I remember) South K. Finally I noticed this boot sticking out of a tree...</div></div><hr />

its been years since ive seen this bug but old bugs dont die they just go into hybernation. i would be willing to bet that 1) the corpse was there all along and 2) you were the ONLY one who couldnt see it. if it happens again just camp out (right at that spot if you judge it safe) and come back and see if its right there staring at you.<br />
<br />
chipped bone rods are bought at various herb shops. a couple that come to mind are one in firiona and one in west freeport. the freeport one is convenient at your level to get and they are about 5pp for a 3 charge rod. i suggest everyone keeping a couple in the bank and ideally one with you at all times. if you group regularly with a friend make him keep one too because if you die yours will be on your corpse not on you and you will be glad you dont have to run to the bank for it. i cannot tell you how many times ive used these things for myself for friends and for strangers. many people dont know they exist and after i find their corpse they say &quot;how in the world did you do that so fast?&quot;</div></div><hr />
