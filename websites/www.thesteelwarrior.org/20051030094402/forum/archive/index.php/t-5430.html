<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many have asked how to create fake (and real!) Links in the past few months. Today, all will be revealed.<br />
<br />
First, the story of how the links were born.<br />
It was over a year, and some months back, when the first linking was found out, shortly after links were put in. It was nerfed shortly later - But a tiny percentage of those people knew how to get around the nerf and make links again.  It went something like this, if i recall correctly:<br />
<br />
4934883ITEMNAME<br />
<br />
But alas, this was again nerfed, and only a percentage of people knew how to get around it. How? The code was made longer, and most of the links were blank, because of lack of code. One of my links looked like this:<br />
<br />
3943774Raex's Chest of Destruction<br />
<br />
When part of the item name was cut off, I knew they had changed the code somehow; and the journey to find how to make big links began. It took me a while, but autojoining a link and looking it up in your EQClient file worked for a while (Doesn't work anymore to get the boxes, iirc) <br />
<br />
When I opened up the EQClient, to my suprise, the codes were changed again.<br />
This time, the links were given a long ass ID code, such as this:<br />
<br />
0002671-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001F647CE29NAME<br />
<br />
Later, I figured out how to get an item ID easily. You just ;t a link, or ; a link, same thing. You get the code, but without the autojoin hassle.<br />
<br />
To the part you all wanted now. How to make a fake (or real!) link!<br />
<br />
To make a link that doesn't link anything,you just make a bogus link, like so:<br />
45 random numbers/letters hereNAME<br />
<br />
For a real link!<br />
Using the correct ID Code (First 7 letters, and the last 8) + a different name, would yield and link to whatever item you wanted, with whatever name you wanted to, like so:<br />
<br />
Let's say for example, I wanted to make an Obsidian Necklace from VT into the name &quot;OMG UBER HP I KNOW YOU LOVE IT GINK&quot; (inside joke online tsw =p)<br />
<br />
You ;t the Obsidian necklace, and you recieve <br />
&quot;Could not find player 0028911-00001-00001-00001-00001-000015E090E26Obsidian&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, you take that number, put the boxes around it (here it is again if you missed it before!)<br />
<br />
And you change the link of Obsidian necklace to OMG UBER HP I KNOW YOU LOVE IT GINK - Save it, and neck time you zone, the necklace will be linked as OMG UBER HP I KNOW YOU LOVE IT GINK<br />
<br />
<br />
But Dima!! My Augmented thing wont work! I'm crying irl!<br />
Do not worry, Augmented links CAN be made, but you have to do something.<br />
<br />
Let's say you want to link an Aegis of the Earth with a 12mana aug.<br />
<br />
The Aegis, Unauged is:<br />
0027290-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001CBA915CF<br />
The 12 Mana Augment is:<br />
0041107-00001-00001-00001-00001-000013D93B90C<br />
The Aegis with the 12 mana aug is:<br />
0027290041107-00001-00001-00001-00001FA6FA7DD<br />
See what you have to do?<br />
..If not, you take the first 7 letters of the mana aug (0041107) and paste it on the last letter of the Aegis's ID (in this scenerio, it is a 0) to the second dash. Be sure to get the augmented last 8 Digit code, too.<br />
<br />
Note, you cannot generate items that have not been found yet. the 8 digit code before the name seems completely random, if you can find a pattern to it, YOU ARE GOD.<br />
<br />
BUT DIMA, THIS IS ILLEGAL, IM GONNA GET BANNED!<br />
You can't. I've done it in front of Absor on the Discord server (Absor's Condolances) and he just laughed, also in front of many guides and GMs on my server as well, same responses. They cannot do anything to you if you decide to edit a file they tell you to edit.<br />
<br />
For some people, the link won't work. If i had a WinXP (The people it's not working for) I would try to figure out a way to fix this, but I don't. 98 here!<br />
<br />
In short, to make a real link with a fake name:<br />
1: Copy the box. it's the most important part.<br />
2. ;t a link you want. Get the code, paste it past the first box, and add a box onto that. Change the name of the item to whatever you want the link to say.<br />
3. Save. If you're alt+tabbing and doing this from ingame, you'll have to zone or relog to pump in the effects.<br />
4. Most importantly, enjoy!<br />
<br />
It's been fun while it lasted. Hope you guys have fun with it!<br />
Shoutout goes to topsekrit industries (In no specific order, Erollisi.Metzen, Erollisi.Elementous, Marr.Ikkan, Torvon.Kokonut, Torvon.Muun, Marr.Binnamarr, Tholuxe.Surlok, Tholuxe.Aclyosprada EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER JOINS THE CHANNEL!, Brell.Fallakin, Torvon.Polopaul) Sorry if i missed any of you.<br />

(Thanks for Bigrr7th for posting it)<br />
<br />
Edit Edit:<br />
Further XP Fix....<br />

If it still doesn't work with the fix above, put something around the link, anything, just something. This helped a few people I was chatting to.</div></div><hr />
