If you went and tried it and then posted specific things that are giving you troubles then perhaps people will be more willing to give you advice.<br />

For now, don't let people die, deaths are bad, make sure your tanks are on the ball, you need to handle large pulls of mobs that hit quite hard.</div></div><hr />

Farm Time a few more times and get everyone who sets foot in that zone level 70. Seeing as you killed Quarm on the 10th I would strongly suggest you beat Ikkinz 1-4 before you try Uqua, the gear you'll pick up otw and some of the dmg the mobs put out will prepare you.</div></div><hr />

I speak the truth lol, i remember my 1st time in that zone. Pallies and SKs would laugh at me when i tried to Tank mezz in that place, It was more like get agro and die to be honest, then to top it off Rangers would send me tells saying &quot;SPLAT&quot; o those were the days and my ass is still sore ~ .</div></div><hr />

On our first runs we had tanks use defensive on the first pull and still died a fair bit until we got our act together, and our first zone in = Trigger trap, 1 inc..easy..2 and 3.... 4 and 5..bam 35 people dead in under 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
We have to go back there to reflag soon, when I call this raid I cry at my desk sometimes :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Main question cause this is how far we got is this:  Anyway to set the trap without having the 3 mobs come at once or is there no way around it.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

When my guild was learning Uqua, I worked as a servicable tank.  I was about #4 on the list, which meant I only tanked during the traps.  My advice to you is use your discs whenever you can.  Traps are spaced far enough apart so you can basically use defensive every time you have to tank something (if you are late in the tank rotation).<br />
<br />
Other than that, your raid force needs to be efficient and work to fix any small mistake very quickly so it doesn't turn into a big mistake.  Have fun :)</div></div><hr />

Man, we had to go back and re-flag this zone about 2 weeks ago  :( <br />

Now I remmber why I hated the zone, Even being 5th on the list, with 10.5 I was taking a beating whenever someone dropped. Hate that zone, and we had to do it twice in 1 week =x</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with a full spoiler though, the zone takes a month or two to finally get down if everyone in your guild is going in there completely raw.  What I mean is, any kind of spoilers you get for Uqua only get so far.  It's going in there and actually executing it that really matters.  <br />
<br />
You want some tips for Uqua though?  You're gonna need about four or more 9k+ tanks with hopefully well over 2100ac once buffed.  Trash mobs start off doing ~300dps and slowly work their way up to doing about 600dps.  Yeah, they get mean as hell, and you just have to deal with it.  There is no room for error in Uqua.  If your tanks and healers aren't on the ball and someone dies, it could mean a fullscale wipe.  If one person dies, a 1300 hitting spirit spawns and usually goes straight for the casters, killing them, and spawning another 1300 hitting spirit.  Basically, it can set off a chain reaction and there's nothing you can do to stop it once it starts going.  There is no room for error in Uqua.  You either play Uqua accordingly, or Uqua will play you.<br />
<br />
You have to figure out where the traps out.  Advancing into the zone like you're the Red-Fuckin-Army is a bad, bad idea.  Traps spawn anywhere from 3-5 mobs, so it's a good idea for your pullers to learn how to stagger them so you're not dealing with the entire trap at once.  Oh yeah, don't be afraid to succor back to zoneline after you move up to give yourself some more room. . .<br />
<br />
MAX YOUR ALCOHOL TOLERANCE.  I cannot stress this enough.  There is an AE that goes off mid-twin fight (Rage and Furious) that makes you drunk.  If you're like 150+ AT, you won't get affected by it.  If you're caught mid-fight drunk, your dps goes to shit, your manapool goes to shit, and your evasion goes to shit.  If you're drunk, you're a liability.  Do something about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Basthird</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best advise i can give you, have a Caster body guard or more then 1 . Keep a warrior behind the meleeing line and he watch if any break htrough /shield and save the caster works wonder and if you tank twin AT over 150 and give the twin a bazu on the pull and be the WS  ( best is to pull using bard with DA) when hes up the hole give it a bazu right away just in case he would AE stun he will come for you anyway and not rush your raid . <br />
<br />
Total awareness makes you win Uqua ... those who dont wanna be concentrated for 3-4 hours shouldnt head to Uqua its a hard raid it tore guild apart and get people mad at each other sometime ... Uqua = test of skill pass it and youll get to candyland</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hear now most people don't even get adds ont he Barxxt event, has OOW made ti that easy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avelariel</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe when they're going back for backflagging after months past it they don't get adds :p  <br />
our 50 man raid with only 1 boxed rogue only had Barxt at about 80% when add wave spawned on Sunday - was our second win in the end.  Granted lack of rogues and a not-quite-full raid hurt our dps but I think to have done Barxt another 80% before the adds spawn would have taken some serious juice.<br />
<br />
Like everyone says, Uqua is all about concentration and taking care - we beat the traps the hard way a couple of times before we managed to split the mobs some, so it is doable, but really... ouch.  If any 2-3 people die during a trap pull, your chances of a wipe are dangerously high.   Very, very unforgiving.  One of not too many raids where having lots of tanks really rocks.  Beating it is a real rush, the challenge level is so high that when you get everything right it's a great feeling.  <br />
<br />
This all from the perspective of only having just beaten it of course - obviously its a bunch easier for people going back to backflag after months progressing beyond it, but I can't believe it ever gets easy, mistakes are just punished too hard.<br />
<br />
(statwise, our think our top tank is at around 10.8k unbuffed, and the lowest warrior we used is at 9.7k.  The first time we won in December, knock a good couple hundred off each of those - Qvic armour agogo).</div></div><hr />

Where did you hear that?  That wasn't the case the last three times we've done  Barxxt this month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also what is this full raid you speak of? you mean expeditions go above 45 people!?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least now some people might live when the AEs in the trap room goes off.  It used to be 6 or 6.5K, which makes an instant wipe when it does go off.<br />
<br />
The ghost adds stop coming at around the time the channelers come live.  Therefore if you can knock Barxt to 40% before the first set of adds are ready they will never come.  Though really adds make the fight easier, not harder, unless you just absolutely cannot mez anything.  Barxt never had that much HP, and most of his HP is his regen anyway but with level 70 + new spells + new weapons you can knock out his regen really quickly.<br />
<br />
Then again, one time we had channelers and the ghost at the same time, so some weird things can happen.  Thankfully, Barxt wasn't live during that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you kill fast enough, you won't get adds on Barxt.  We got adds our very first shot at Barxt, but the second time we did it, the adds never came.  If I had my guess, if you spawned the channelers before five minutes, the adds don't come.  If you wipe, however, and come back to summon your corpses for another go at Barxt, the adds will come for sure with the channelers, definitely.  Also, if the adds do come and you're able to survive them, I think Barxt gains both Rampage and Flurry abilities afterwards.  Otherwise, he's just a straight melee can of whoopass (~1800dps).<br />
<br />
Barxt actually has a lot of hitpoints (~1.5 million) and no regen.  If you've ever wiped to Barxt, you'll know this his regen is probably the slowest in the game.  I'm not entirely sure about this, but I think his mitigation jumps up a bit around 30% of his life, that and the fact that your dps casters are probably near OOM at this point from burning the golem and spending the rest on Barxt himself.</div></div><hr />

Last time we did Barxt we got adds, but was the first time in a long time. Think they may be a % spawn now.. We burned Golem before he could FD, and Barxt was dieing really fast, and they spawned at 35-40% each time we've done it since they gimped it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hitpoints in the 1.4-1.6 million are enough for the level of content Barxt is supposed to be challenged at.  Realistically, the best weaponry you're &quot;supposed&quot; to have is something like Darkblades, Jagged Onyx Staves, and various Time/Ikkinz weaponry.  Riftseeker twins (Chailak and Feratha) combined with Epic 1.5's just give an extra advantage.  Now, if you've got Royalty/MPG weaponry, then of course 1.6 million hitpoints is gonna look like Freeport yard trash. :P What it boils down to though is this; unless you're sporting some elite firepower being rogue/wizard heavy or whatever, Barxt is gonna be a 4-6 minute fight, which is 1-3 minutes longer than Defensive lasts!  &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

no one is allowed to die.  seriously  if you have arggo freaks that are not the people tanking.  boot them from the raid.<br />
<br />
Pullers be it SK necros or Omg monks, need to be on the ball, properly done they can make a large diff on traps.  <br />
<br />
if yah see a super ugly pull inc  yer warriors be not afraid to blow aoet and furi on 3 or 4 at once.  this gives the other ots time to lock down he adds.<br />

<br />
I don't think they gimped Uqua as much as people think they did, but I do know the Barxt encounter is a lot different than it used to be.  From what I've asked some old schoolers who beat Uqua before it was toned down, the Barxt encounter is similar to what the Kelekdrix encounter is now - Barxt would frequently disengage himself and summon a whole slew of mezzable adds on your ass just like he can now if you take too long to beat him.<br />
<br />
But hell, we just beat Uqua on a backflagging run (to hell with doing the bullshit backflagging quest when it's easier to go through Uqua) for the third time, and, uhh, it seemed pretty easy to us too. ;)  It just depends on how you look at it.  If you know what to expect from the Barxt encounter, then yeah it's fairly simple.  The real question is, how long did it take Blades of Law to complete Uqua from the very first time you started working on the zone back however many weeks ago until the day you beat it?  <br />
<br />
Toned down or not, I think the zone is far from &quot;gimp&quot;.  It's still challenging and fun imho.</div></div><hr />

Mobs walk slower, and are more spaced out now.  Dont really think anything was changed with Barxxt himself.  Timer was always 6 min to my knowledge.  At the time pre oow, 9 mths ago or whichever when we were backflagging we had beat it with the ae on and had no adds .  We've done it 3 times now since oow, haven't had adds yet to date and obliterated that zone.  5 lvls / aa / spells and a little down tuning that zone is cake.</div></div><hr />

Traps were more dangerous, etc. Although, people being level 70 helps alot compared to when we were doing it as level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it last night for reflags. 70 and AA/Gear made it alot easier, but some of that was negated by having alot of people who had never been. Barxxt fight we spawned the 2 channelers before the 12 adds pop, so if yo go fast enough it makes that pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Still tricky but not nearly as hard as at 65.<br />
<br />
Also we got hit in the second fire trap and had 1 death lol, funniest thing to happen this week to me.</div></div><hr />

Oven tosses out the blast....and everyone lives. Guess it's gonna be one those cliches now, &quot;Remember when Uqua was hard?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
When does the timer start?  When starting the event upon opening the door to Barxxt's room?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meyni</div><div class="date">03-09-2005, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know for a fact that when Barxt started giving me a whoopen, we had 3 mins..cause if my disc wore off , he would stand and stare at me...  (which was convenient since I could get my disc back while we relaxed and killed adds)<br />
<br />
No idea if they changed him  though..hasn't taken our raid force (even with 50% recruits) longer than 3 mins to kill him in a long time.<br />
<br />
I loved uqua though, was my first chance to be busy tanking an entire raid).  Too many boring TIME raids of 1 boss tanking, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzme</div><div class="date">03-09-2005, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, kk.. 3 mins from Barxxt being active.  People have stated 5 mins, 6 mins.  The question I have is when does the timer start?  When you open the door?  When you pull the golem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">think it was when barxt goes active.  yeah it's like 5-6 mins now, it was 3 initially (one priest of destruction would fall over every minute, and one minute after the third one fell over, the adds would engage).<br />
<br />
old uqua was interesting.  i liked how all the traps in the latter part of the zone would warp to the zone in and come from the rear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">03-16-2005, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got past uqua last week.  We figured it out without spoilers, took us 9 trips over 3 weeks.  I have to say, I like this zone.  This zone made us a better guild.<br />
<br />
Heh, we actually managed to mow down barxt in 3 min and 40 seconds, and lose.  Guess we shoulda ________ ;).<br />
<br />
Seriously, you need your tank lineup to have their shit together, and you need healers who can keep a tank up on mobs hitting for 1200s without disc.  Make sure to map a key to cycle NPC, and assign your tanks to an order, so each person knows ahead of time which mob to grab.  The rest I leave to you to discover.<br />

I applied to my guild right before they beat Twins for the first time. atleast 2months of that damn zone =((.<br />

But, on a sidenot, king and queen in RSS made it seem like healing on barxt was easy lol!</div></div><hr />

Once my guild got passed the &quot;let's use Succor during this encounter as a viable strategy&quot; anyway =/<br />

Tank assignments for incoming mobs helps a lot. I find it helps even more to use a Warrior as the MA / first incoming, and well-geared knights for the rest, because the ranged aggro in this situation cannot be overlooked.</div></div><hr />

We used warriors(and occasionally our best geared knight when short a warrior) to tank trash.  The non tanking knights agroed the slower mobs incoming to camp(the caster mobs that want to beline for healers once they do make it to you), and we would taunt off the knights.  These knights also were ready to handle it when one of our warriors went down, and when we had oh shit moments.  Worked pretty well.</div></div><hr />
