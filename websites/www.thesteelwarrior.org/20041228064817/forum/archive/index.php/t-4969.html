Note - as you level, the refresh time on disciplines decreases. For instance, by the time you reach level 60, the refresh time for Evasive will be lower than the refresh time for Defensive.<br />
<br />
All disciplines share the same refresh timer. If you use Mighty Strike at level 54, you can't use another discipline at all for 60 minutes.<br />
<br />
A word on Evasive vs. Defensive - Evasive is best when the lower refresh time is advantageous and when a mob has a low DI and a high DB. Also Evasive is more effective when your AC is high in relation to a mob's ATK and is handy in avoiding mob procs. Defensive cuts a mob's DI by half. For more on DB and DI, check this thread.<br />
<br />
Evasive<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">although I do not have the information requested I will state that the above post is good but not so much anymore. Since the melee updates the timers have been split and now you can use Mighty strike every half hour and still run other /discs on the in between...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously with the new system some of these have changed but when you buy the Tombs it tells you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thats not true now, most of those disciplines have been changed.<br />
<br />
Also, they have been divided on 4 timers as shown on this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4786) <br />
<br />
Defensive and Stonewall have a reuse of 10.5min and Evasive of 7~8 min at 65 I think.<br />
<br />
Charge has a 25 reuse time and lasts for 30 secs now.<br />
<br />
Mightystrike, lasts for 30 and has a 25min reuse.<br />
<br />
Furious has a reuse of 40min and lasts 12 secs now I think.<br />
<br />
Precise, (not sure) lasts 1min and has a 25min reuse time.<br />
<br />
Aggressive, like Precise.<br />
<br />
For more info about disciplines times, while in-game, press S on the Combat Abilities window.<br />
<br />
For more exact info about disciplies effects, visit Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com) and search for &quot;Disciplines&quot;<br />
<br />
As far as the new disciplines (61+). Spirit of Rage gives a boost to your agro generation (10 or 20% I believe) for like 12 secs.<br />
Healing Will will heal you for ~100hp per tick for 1 min, with a reuse of 5min. And Stonewall, is Defensive but without cutting your DPS by half, but snaring yourself (cant move much, so no running :p), lasts 3min, 10.5min reuse time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">glodin</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what I have,  if you see anything wrong please let me know.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aggresive and Precision have a 1 min duration, not 3.<br />
And the reuse of the disciplines no longer decrease as you lvl, at 65, Defensive is still 10min reuse time, same as at 55.<br />
Also, the negative effects of Precision (getting hit more) and Aggresive (getting hit for more) have been removed, so you can use em while tanking.</div></div><hr />
