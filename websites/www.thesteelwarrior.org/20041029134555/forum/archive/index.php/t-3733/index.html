Cobalt bracer 20ac   <br />
Kizrak's bracer 28ac<br />
<br />
So over the course of 3 years , the *standard* warrior bracer has improved by 8ac and 45 hps....  wtf??<br />

Compare caster spells from kunark with the spells they have now....<br />

One has had a lifespan of 3+ years ( Cobalt )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Like I've said before:<br />
<br />
(Let's just assume that after 4 hours with your /lfg on you finally get a group.)<br />
<br />
A) You're in a multiple melee group and one of the other melee types keeps stepping in front of you so you can't see your target. After grumbling about the &quot;You're too far away...&quot; message, you whip out your little clicky bracer and shrink the bugger. That makes it all the easier to just walk right over them.<br />
<br />
B) You're on a raid or surrounded by unshrunk melee types. After grumbling some more about the &quot;too far away&quot; message, you whip out your clicky bracer and shrink yourself. Now you can run right underneath most of them and skirt by the ones you can't.<br />
<br />
Clicky shrink is awesome. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ah...utility in shrinking OTHERS...../runs to the bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I sometimes use it as a motivating force. There's as many people that don't like to be shrunk as there are those that don't like to levitate. Being shrunk can sometimes disorient and distort your perspective, especially if you don't see it coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;There's as many people that don't like to be shrunk as there are those that don't like to levitate.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't like to be shurnk OR levitated.<br />
<br />
Halls of testing ... main puller ... steps ... can't jump ... SAVE ME JEBUS!<br />
<br />
Far too much time spent running away from mobs that could spank me dead in a few hits for me to like being too small to get up a step or being floating in the air so I can't leap up a ledge properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">See? Shrink as a motivational tool. <br />
<br />
If I'm MT on a raid that requires a high level of communication and skill (Such as HoT) and the puller can't figure out how to stay out of my face while I'm tanking, I'll tell them a couple of times where to stand and where they can put their little sticks, but if he doesn't listen I'm gonna shrink his ass.<br />
<br />
It may be a death sentence, but I guarantee he'll never step between me and a creature again. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lev rocks, shrink sucks .....course would love power to shrink others...very annoying to get blocked out on raids by a bunch of overeager noobs ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I HATE being shrunk.  Especially now with all those HUGE pets.  Nothing worse than being the MT and not being able to get to the mob because of those damn pets.  But yeah it is sad, I had a hooded black cloak for a really long time too, until I got my cloak of greater pernicity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">With the bracer, you can go around shrinking the pets, and they won't grow back.  Only shamans get the grow spell, so other classes can't do anything about shrunken pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've had trouble for the last 2 weeks shrinking people in wolf form and shaman pets. A while back I could make them puppies but now it just isn't happening. I'm hoping its a bug that will be fixed and not a bug that *was* fixed instead...<br />
<br />
Personally I use my Cobalt Bracer to piss off the shaman. Its fun waving cobalt bracer, ToD, and cobalt legs at them and calling them useless. I somehow think thats why been stuck without shaman lately though :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mwahahaha, I love pissing off pullers by shrinking them!!  I mainly keep my bracer to shrink my cleric, tho... (horse ears SUCK, and I'm too cheap to buy a drogmor, which looks stupid, imo.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I use the chase cam constantly on my cleric, especially while on horse...it just seems easier, and less problems.<br />
<br />
I just wish I had some way on my Bst to cast an AE shrink...too many people on the raids I go on stay unshrunk, and trying to fit 10 people inside a hallway an ogre would fill just doesn't work very well...especially if one of them IS an ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i tell people if your trying to get around me to hit the mob your on the wrong side of the mob. unless i'm not the mt or second add whatever if im just dps i take my shrink.</div></div><hr />

The best way to get a Soriz pouch is to go in and check the mines after a server reset/crash with IVU potions or a tracker. I used to see the named iksar up all the time. That's how I got a pouch for my monk. They'd be more likely to be up for a long time on an older server that doesn't have guild's doing Empbane/keys much.</div></div><hr />

The wolf models are bugged in somes zone right now so they can't be shrunk that much.  SoE responded on the bst board it would be fixed in the next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Btw did anyone notice that now you have to click the cobalt bracer 2-3 times to shrink someone when before it only took 1 click. ggrrr I hate items with long cast times</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hrmmm....I'd add the Veng2 from the Ornate bracer in that straight analysis.<br />
<br />
Also, if by standard warr you mean ordinary Joe who just does exp groups (and not Ellie flagged or VT equipped) I'd use 1492 or 760 LDon Armor as a compare pt as oppossed to Kizrak.  In this case you would see a 60-100+ hp delta depending on which set and which mods...not unsubstantial.<br />
<br />
I agree with above posters that Cobalt bracer has held up incredibly well over the years in terms of usefulness.<br />
<br />
As for shrinking others as punishment: I don't like others doing it to me w/o asking...hence I don't do it to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/hugs his cobalt bracer.<br />
<br />
This thing is great. Just yesterday we were in the middle of the AoW cycle and the MT (human) wasn't shrunk and couldn't get Idol cornered. He was in my group so mid fight I pulled out the cobi and shrunk him down to fun size. Once fun size Idol turned to the corner and everything was much easier. <br />
<br />
I was so happy to have one at that point.</div></div><hr />
