MS is nice but doesn't rule the roost as it once did. I am going Fury/Arms myself, but of course that is open for revision too. Respecis are reletively cheap--particularly at 60th. <br />

Frankly I think warriors should build for one v one PVP but  mass PVP. We are  fighting an uphill battle with 1v1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rodocite</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, i agree. 1v1 pvp is very hard for a warrior to shine in. however, in group battles, we can cause some chaos. besides, 1v1 is sorta irrelevant when most major battles are going to be group based.<br />
<br />
im beginning to think that we need a mix of warriors in both offense and defense.  the skills in each tree are very valuable in pvp. i notice that protection is more immobilization and cancellation based though.<br />
<br />
also, remember, intimidating shout is a very useful tool in pvp too. jump in a group and IS them all while youre hitting the priest and you pretty much have them. unlike the priest's fear, we can fear an unlimited amount of people that aggro on us-- unlike the priest itself, we actually have the hp to jump into a group of enemies and cause chaos. even IS'ing a couple people off you while your group picks off others is a big help.<br />
<br />
that also brings up engineering. goblin engineering would only help us cause even more chaos.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rodocite</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, tactical mastery really changes a warrior around</div></div><hr />

altho piercing howl is very handy to have</div></div><hr />
