<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy,<br />
<br />
I have a very retarded idea to fix warriors.  It's so retarded, in fact, that it's something the Sony Dev team might actually implement.   But first, lets come up with some Universal truths here.  Even if you completely hate my idea, I'd like everyone to accept my universal truths or atleast give your opinions on their &quot;truism&quot; so that it can help us come up with a better solution.<br />
<br />
1.  With itemization how it exists today, War, Pal, and SK are all well within 10% hp/ac.   This is Good enough for any of the 3 tanks to take hits in groups/raids.  Sony will not go back through from LDON augs to Velious loot and make adjustments, it's a pipe dream.  Additionally, the length of time it would require to add new War only items from Velious to augs in order to artificially recreate the standard of War's being far ahead of other plate classes is just too much to be cost effective from a developers standpoint.  Itemization will remain how it is.  As much as you hate paladins/SKs complaining about the 'dark ages of kunark', it might be time for warriors to realize that the Greatly Superior HP/ac advantage myth is also a relic from kunark as well.<br />
<br />
2.  The Solution to the problem should leave Warriors, Shadowknights, and Paladins on equal footing for grouping.  The decision to take 1 over the other should be simple, such as a need for a FD puller/extra dps in a certain camp, grab the SK, the extra healing provided by group/targetted heals, take the Pal, the extra durability and yes utility (Disciplines, shield), grab the warrior, etc.  These extra advantages should be equally attractive for most areas.  ie. Paladins should not be forced to only group in Undead zones due to SU3, however, even in Undead zones, they should not be so preferred over either SK or War that those 2 classes are LFG while groups wait for a paladin to log in.<br />
<br />
3.  The solution should not change the way warriors work at raids.  As it exists now, boss mobs are at first tanked by warriors (with pals/SKs have other essential non MT roles in raids), at the point where the encounter becomes trivial/easier due to either smarter tactics, proliferation of that encounters loot to the raid (farming better gear), etc, Other tanks can MT the encounter.  The solution should keep this standard.  Therefore, the solution should not greatly increase the hps or mitigation of Warriors, which would either allow not-as-skilled/geared players to higher content faster, or would require significant retuning of boss mobs from HoT through LDON time lvl raids.  not going to happen.<br />
<br />
4.  The Solution is not more HPs.  It does not matter how many hps you have if the monster never hits you.  It sucks, it really does, that hybrids get more benefit from a 200hp/mana item than melee's do, it really really does suck.  But converting mana to hp for melees is not addressing the problem at hand.  You could give that lvl 57 warrior tanking in PoI 30k hps and it still would not help them tank.  Regardless of how many hps you have, it still requires 400 Mana for a cleric to heal 7,500 hps, yet to heal other members of the group (say the enc who got slow resisted) costs more than 400 mana.  Even if warriors today are placed on a superior mitigation table than other plate classes, to such a degree that they take 50% less damage than either Pal or SK(better than perm defensive without the DPS reduction), it would be more mana efficient to Cheal the paladin twice instead of a Chealing the War once and Supernal Lighting the Enc once.  Sony will not go back and retune the mana costs of all spells to make it any better, especially not with the Mana regeneration at the levels they are today.<br />
<br />
5.  players in general are going to continue forming the most efficient groups for exp/hour.  It's just a fact.  nerfing Paladin/SK Aggro lock will simply drive players to other ways to maximize their exp/hour.   Making all plate classes as inefficient as warriors as they exist today will lead to AE groups, pet groups, etc, as the norm, which leaves all tanks LFG.  When exp groups need a tank, Beastlords, who completely avoid the slow-on-inc aggro issue by providing the slow, will become the new best tank.  You may already be seeing this now.  The solution is not to nerf knights just like its not to nerf BLs.  Lets face it.  The game is dumbed down.  It has been for a while.  LDON didn't change that, it only reinforced it with lull pulling being the standard for your average retarded player to mow through normal slaughters like they were going out of style.  The true differential between casual gamers, joe everyguy players, and ubers is still high level raids.   Always have been.  This is another reason why the warrior fix should not change how raiding works today.   The art of aggro management still needs to exist, if only for raiding purposes.<br />
<br />
<br />
With these 5 somewhat long winded truths, I propose my solution to plate tank balance:<br />
<br />
raise the taunt cap of Paladins and Shadowknights to that of warriors.  this places all plate tanks on the equal grounds as far as &quot;riding aggro&quot; when its necessary to do so.<br />
<br />
Add a warrior skill hotkey, call it improved taunt, spit in the eye, or whatever.  give it a range of 100 or so, and have it be a pass/fail skill check with a 95% chance of success when maxxed.  Give it a refresh time of 6 seconds.  The skill should be interruptable by being stunned.  On success, this skill adds 400 or so hate to the warriors aggro.<br />
<br />
Flag all raid level boss mobs as immune to this new warrior skill.<br />
<br />
With this new snap aggro for warriors, groups should be able to slow on inc, heal, burn, etc, as well as they can with either a Pal or SK tanking.  Its chance of failure/interrupt is about equal to the chance of a pal/sk spell being interrupted, which keeps them on equal grounds since this skill is &quot;mana free&quot; aggro.  The difference between Snap aggro with Pal/SK and Warriors now is that Warriors can do it mana free every 6 seconds, while pal/SK can chain cast at the beginning of a fight for improved initial aggro.  <br />
<br />
By a careful combination of Taunt and improved Taunt/AE taunt, or Taunt and Stuns/heals, or Taunt and taps/dots/dds/direct aggro spells, Warriors, paladins, and Shadow Knights should all be capable tanks in Exp groups as far as both Aggro generation as well as damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
Knights have always complained that if Warriors had snap aggro then they would be inferior, but would they really?<br />
<br />
DPS tests show clearly that SK&gt; War &gt; Pal for damage<br />
Itemization places all plates as capable of tanking exp groups, with Warriors 10% or so ahead.<br />
Group utility functions place Pal/SKs &gt; War for secondary jobs in addition to tanking (heals/taps/FD/paci pulling/loh/ht/etc).<br />
<br />
In all honesty, if warriors had Snap aggro that was as reliable as knights today, I'd still prefer a paladin as MT if for nothing more than for group heals and LOH.  But that's just me.  I know plenty of people who will still swear by SKs as I do ppl who still swear by warriors.  Giving warriors snap aggro will not make knights obsolete.<br />
<br />
<br />
Retarded Idea I know.  Opinions/rants/flames are welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">points 1 - 4 are i think absolutely on the money.<br />
<br />
Not sure i agree with 5. <br />
<br />
As to the idea itself, yeah i could see that. Prior to my coming to the conclusion that aggro lock should go, i championed a similar idea as seeming like a simple way to redress the balance a little. :p <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aggro lock SHOULD go...but it's never gonna happen.  I see this idea as a viable alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">(while atm I do feel warriors are relatively balanced themselves, I do realize that other classes are mostly not, add that in addition to people becoming lazy and my opinion here becomes what has to be done to &quot;fix&quot; warriors)<br />
<br />
The only thing that VI has to do to fix warriors imo, is up our DPS past that of SK's, and remove chance of taunt to fail.<br />
<br />
If a pal/sk is doing 90 DPS, a war should be doing at least 110.  Not a pal doing 80 war doing 90 and SK doing 100.<br />
<br />
Removing failure on taunt would make warriors able to hold aggro if they know what they are doing.... since, I assume anyone playing a war atm has at least a slight idea of what they are doing, since everyone who didn't ran at pallies/sk quick, this would fix the problem as effectively as adding these &quot;EB&quot; clicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Even if warriors today are placed on a superior mitigation table than other plate classes, to such a degree that they take 50% less damage than either Pal or SK(better than perm defensive without the DPS reduction), it would be more mana efficient to Cheal the paladin twice instead of a Chealing the War once and Supernal Lighting the Enc once.&quot;<br />
<br />
I disagree.  The slower would never get hit if this happened.  The slower wouldn't be in the group because the slower would be obsolete.  If warrior had a full time defensive mitigation, with no drop in dps, who cares if mob is slowed.  This would also remove paladins and shadow knights completely from many experience groups because it would be a choice of having a 16k tank vs an 8k tank (assuming both had 8k buffed) and this would destroy the game as we know it.<br />
<br />
As far as snap agro that adds 400 hate or a non-fail taunt, this is a good idea but I doubt Sony will do this.  They seem far more concerned with making sure newbies get 200 sense heading, fixing a targeting system that isn't broken, or adding new fatures to the UI every 2 weeks than they worry about warrior agro.  Basically the reason is that they want to attract new people to the game and they know that once these people play for a certain period of time, they will become addicted and continue to play.  As long as people pay them, they will continue to do what gets money.  Part of the reason this game is so addictive, is that it is incredibly frustrating.  If people could actually get the things from this game that they want, they would become bored and quit.  As it is, very few people actually quit because they have invested so much time and frustration that they would not want to think they have wasted all that time.  I know very few people that I play with that actually think EQ is still fun, its more like a job to some of them where they feel compelled to play because they are so addicted, they don't play because the game is actually fun.  They just keep chasing the carrot on the end of the infinitely long stick they can never get.  The &quot;carrot&quot; is why Sony added links to this game--people see all this uber stuff that makes them think &quot;I can get that if only I work hard enough..&quot; but in reality only a small fraction of players ever see that stuff but those stupid links make them all think they have a chance.  I think 50 percent of EQ is sitting around bored LFG, medding, doing boring repetitive tasks, etc. and waiting for something to happen, 45 percent of EQ is hanging out with friends, and 5 percent is actually fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Man, bonequest, i'd play a new game if i was you :) To be fair though I've virtually stopped playing since (due to various factors) my play experience was beginning to mirror yours :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I hear that Valeris, I have been thinking of doing that.  Sorry I sound so negative but that is pretty much the situation with EQ as I see it.   If WoW turns out as good as it seems on their web site, I will probably switch.  I know a lot of people who are tired of how Sony runs this game.  For example, a lot of people on this board are fed up with the warrior taunt issue and they have tried and tried to get Sony to do something but the basic fact is, the warrior taunt issue just fuels the addiction by increasing the frustration level.  Most people are not quiters by nature and Sony uses this against them and its just one more thing to addict them with.<br />
<br />
Basically, this game could be so much funner than it is but once you get to level 60+ then they pretty much have you hooked and they really don't have any real competition at this point to make them change their evil ways so people keep playing.  <br />
<br />
I just hope that the Blizzard people read these boards and listen very carefully to what is said because if they do, they are going to destroy EQ with WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blizzard has always been more interested in making a good game than their bottom line's instant gratification. They hold themselves to higher standards than Sony does, and for that they'll probably have a superior game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>OlavSkulcrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In some ways, I liken EQ to golf. Golf can piss me off like nothing else, but I still love playing it. Same with EQ. Those moments of frustration are outweighed by the good. (I never really liked looking for pick up groups anyway, so balance issues never directly affected my play time fun, it has always been something that gets me when I'm offline cruising message boards and news sites)<br />
<br />
The HUGE difference between these two hobbies is simple: Golf is 100% in my control. Balance issues are 0% in my control.<br />
<br />
When golf is pissing me off, it is really myself I am frustrated with. But waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting some more for SoE to actually do something about a problem they said they've wanted to look into for nearly a year. . .<br />
<br />
Anyway, to actually respond to the topic . . . ;)<br />
<br />
I agree with #5 as far as pick up groups go. When you are out looking for whatever group you can get, you are doing so because you want xp. If I want to just do anything I consider fun, I can play twinks I can solo with, work the tradeskills, or whatever when there aren't any guild/friend groups I could join. But when I get it into my mind that the next AA or level is right around the corner, it's pick up groups or nothing in those cases. We've all been in pick up groups short 1 or 2 people, but have the basics covered (tank/heals/CC and/or slow). It's always, 'nah, don't need another &lt;tank/chanter/cleric&gt;.' They (we) want the class that brings the most to the group so xp rolls in faster.<br />
<br />
I also agree with #2, but with some further comments. The hardest part about balancing knights vs. warriors is the fact that<br />
knights = tank +<br />
warriors = tank<br />
<br />
With this situation, warriors need to be enough better tanks than knights to justify their existence, yet not so much better that knights can't do their job. Right now, PvE balance is such that a much wider range of classes can do the job of tank than is usual. Even non-plate melees can tank in a pinch if they have good enough gear. The difference between warriors and knights in xp tanking is negligible compared to that '+' knights have. But the situation long ago, basically pre-luclin was that knights tanking value was insufficient to the task, so their utility didn't mean anything.<br />
<br />
The real solution to the warrior problem isn't just a matter of getting our aggro where it needs to be. The balance between knights and warriors will end up shifting again sooner or later if this is all they do. <br />
<br />
Warriors need their own '+'. When was the last time you heard SK and Pallies going at it? They are both unique with basically the same tanking ability. Thus each is content with where they are relative to each other. Warriors have AETaunt and /defensive and beserk. Everything else particularly useful or interesting about our class is shared with other classes. Maybe they need to get crits through AAs, and don't get the same crit frequency we do, but AAs are just a matter of time investment. Each class needs to maintain a unique identity. This needs to happen no matter how many AAs other classes get. Or what gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am old player and I remember reading the rules in the beggining and going hey why play a warrior? SK and pallys get spells. And in the beggining of the game it was silly to play a warrior. I played a cleric back then and always preferred a SK for pulling (pre nerf) and save me button (harm touch). Or the pally for the downtime heals. <br />
<br />
Then they added crits and some armor for warriors but still wasnt enough. Then they added the disc and at that point I was like ohh evasive and defensive. Very good. At that point I started a warrior.<br />
<br />
But now that my warrior is 65 and a ton of aa I go back to the why do you play a warrior again? You dont have that many more HP than them nor the utility nor can you solo. All of which things you can do with the hybrids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think the problem from the start  has been Laziness on the part of the Devs/Designers.   During the Kunark Era Knights needed Help....badly.   The PROPER solution to maintain balance(and help the knights) was to introduce content and abilites for knights that made their utility a valuable and needed resource.  But this required alot of change and alot of work.....more than they wanted to do.  <br />
<br />
However through itemization(really easy to create items), and through giving Knights nearly every aa ability Warriors would get in the upcoming alternate advancement system they were designing....they could expand upon knights TANKING abilites and make them more desired in groups that way.   <br />
<br />
The part that they DIDN'T see was that this added tanking ability that Knigts were getting when paired with the expanded casting ability they benefited from when they improved casters and thier inhereit aggro generation that allready existed created 2 over powered classes when compared  to the other tanking option people have......warriors.<br />
<br />
If they woudl have just sucked it up and done what they should have to begin with, we wouldn' t be posting on this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So most posters agree with points 1-4, but disagree with point 5 on general principle.  However, most replies indicate that the &quot;most likely solution&quot; to be taken from SOE would probably include something along the lines of giving warriors snap aggro, cus either they are too lazy to really balance classes, do not want to nerf classes due to backlash, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
In regards to snap aggro generation of Paladins/SKs and the balance between warriors and knights, I'll admit I don't know much about SK's but just looking over their spell lists/mana costs, and from general discussion here, I assume that:<br />
<br />
1.  Shadow Knights Tank slightly worse than paladins, who tank slightly worse than Warriors, primarily because SKs lack the pally/cleric style buffs that bridge the gap between knights &amp; warriors (aura of the crusader, brells, stuns to lower mob DPS, etc)<br />
<br />
2.  Shadow Knight DPS is in line with warrior DPS, and usually even greater than Warrior DPS.<br />
<br />
3.  Shadow Knight aggro lock costs Shadow Knights significantly more mana than Paladin aggro lock.  It also comes at a loss of DPS due to SKs having to cast their aggro spells more often.<br />
<br />
The above statements may be way off.  If a SK could confirm or deny those statements for me it would help, but I'll just go ahead and assume those 3 statements to be true.  I'm not aware of any low lvl high aggro spell, other than possibly a darkness spell, that a SK could chain cast to give them significant aggro lock without requiring the use of the higher lvl, mana intensive aggro spells.<br />
<br />
If all of the above is true, then, in a vacuum, are Warriors and Shadowknights balanced as tank classes?  SK do more damage and have better Utility (taps, ht, snare, FD, etc) than warriors, but warriors take damage better and greater survivability than SKs.  Also,  While SK are better at aggro generation than a Warrior, it is at a significant enough mana cost that the exp/hour of grouping should be just about equal.<br />
<br />
Perhaps to make the above statement true, changes could be made to the lower lvl darkness spells so that they are not as effective for generating aggro against higher level monsters (similiar to the changes to disease cloud, a low lvl dot that used to generate huge aggro).  Again I don't really know the SK class well enough to get into specific details, but if minor changes can made to the mana cost/effectiveness of SK spells in order for them to be balance with warriors, then I'm all for it.<br />
<br />
Now comes Paladins.  Looking over the mana cost/recast times of their higher level stuns, and assuming the following:<br />
<br />
1.  Paladins tank slightly less than warriors, but slightly greater than SKs due to their unique hp/ac/stun line of spells.<br />
<br />
2.  Paladins do less damage than Warriors, who do less damage than SKs, due to the lack of offensive spells.  (paladins and SK's have same skill caps and same general choice of weapons, SK spells ie pet/dd/dots/HT etc put them ahead of Paladins and warriors)<br />
<br />
3.  Paladin aggro lock is not mana intensive.  The primary reason are Cease and Desist, as well as stun and holy might.  If paladins were forced to use combinations of their higher level stun spells(due to recast times), then Paladin aggro lock would be about as mana intensive as SKs (actually would be slightly less, some small adjustments would need to be made to paladin stun mana costs, nothing too big).<br />
<br />
Now again, in a vacuum, if spells stopped generating aggro if they did not affect the target (immune), then would paladins be balanced against Warriors, as well as SK's?  They do less damage, and their greater aggro control comes with a mana cost that requires downtime for medding, so exp per hour is on par with a warrior tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
I say in a vacuum because I'm trying to figure out how Absor believes the classes are not that far out of balance.  If the only thing that needed to be changed is limiting the effectiveness of clinging darkness and cease/desist on higher lvl mobs in order to achieve balance, then he would be correct.  On paper, I believe absor is correct, classes aren't that far out of balance, not the balance of Kunark/velious that some warriors are looking for, but the balance of how Sony feels the classes should exist now.  <br />
<br />
The problem is, is that in todays EQ, Aggro generation is far far more important than the ability to tank well.  The two primary concerns are Slow/debuff aggro and general caster aggro (heals/nukes)  The latter is an issue with players being lazy, not knowing how to control their aggro, or just looking to kill faster so they can gain more xp/hour (full burn).  In general this sort of aggro can stay how it is I think, with warriors using their existing tools (taunt/aggro procs) it generally isn't much of a problem for even low 50's warriors, and in addition, this is part of the balancing of the plate classes.  groups should be able to burn mobs down faster with a pal/sk tanking, in exchange that the pal/SK is required to med every so often so that the exp/hour is the same as with a warrior.<br />
<br />
With the Higher end game designed how it is (hard/fast hitting low hp mobs) slow is basically a necessity in the game.  I think we can agree that it would be much more work to redesign all of pop + than to just make adjustments to classes.  So the problem with Warriors tanking vs a knight, even if the above changes are made and classes are truly 'balanced' on paper, is tash/slow/malo aggro at the beginning of combat.  It is primarily due to this initial aggro being generated by non tank classes, and the knights ability to circumvent it, that makes warriors undesirable.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, if all of the above is true, and in the spirit of coming up with the most idiotic yet simple and easy to implement ideas, I present the following:<br />
<br />
Either A: remove a large portion of the aggro generated from slows.  This would hypothetically place the tank classes on equal grounds, assuming the other changes i noted above are also implemented.  groups could still burn faster with a Knight, in exchange for the med time a knight would require in order to hold aggro, or could just go easy with a warrior tank on burning, and earn the same xp/hour either way.<br />
<br />
B: give warriors a way to circumvent initial slow aggro other than a million of the other ideas already presented that would give warriors &quot;snap&quot; aggro, but that will not invalidate the knight classes for tanking.<br />
<br />
Yes A is retarded.  you'd want to Flag boss/raid mobs so that they still hate being slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Now again, in a vacuum, if spells stopped generating aggro if they did not affect the target (immune), then would paladins be balanced against Warriors, as well as SK's?

<br />
This would be a disaster for many warriors.  It would effectively eliminate all stun procing weapons for tanking.  All force shock and ykesha weapons would be useless for agro in most cases.  If Sony were to do this, they would need to raise the maximum level on these weapon's stun components to 75.<br />
<br />
I think Sylas's two solutions are very good though.  <br />
<br />
Lowering agro on slows is probably very easy to implement.  I would also lower agro on tash too.  Tash has rediculous agro for what it does and there is no reason for it to be so bad.  If slow agro was turned into a dot like effect so that it just took effect slowly for the duration of the spell, it would be much better.  This way it would still be necessary to taunt before breaking mez on a slowed mob but the initial slow agro would not be so bad and the mob would not instantly try to kill the enchanter even though the warrior has hit it 35 times already.  <br />
<br />
If snap agro was implemented, it should be some kind of spell like effect that has about 500 hate, a 100 to 150 range, and a reuse time of not more than about 45 seconds (I am guessing 45 seconds is about how long it takes to kill a regular difficulty LDoN mob on average).  Even this wouldn't be as good as what knights currently have but would be far better than what warriors have to work with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think the initial poster is missing an important factor. In an experiance group, a Paladin can not only often exceed a simularly equipped Warrior's HP's (Paladin's always have their buffs, Warriors don't), but a single stun can provide as much time for a CH to arrive as another 1k in HPs (mob DPS x time mob is stunned).<br />
<br />
*** Paladins often have more survivability than Warriors in experiance groups ***<br />
<br />
In the 6 to 12 seconds a Warrior may take to gain initial aggro, the Cleric may die causing a delay which may make your group lose it's LDoN adventure. Not only can a Paladin establish earlier aggro control allowing your group to kill faster, in the event the Cleric dies the Paladin can Res perhaps preserving the chance for a win. In a timed event waiting for a Warrior to establish aggro is unexceptable.<br />
<br />
*** The amount of time it may take a Warrior to establish aggro slows down groups and creates unnecessary risk - both are unexceptable in LDoN ***<br />
<br />
This is unbalanced. A very simple solution exists, Since weapons only proc once a minute or so, we can disreguard them - to normal Taunt functionality add the same amount of Hate as a stun unless the player is under Defensive. There - Paladins still retain the advantages of their stun effects, the playing field is leveled, and raids are unaffected.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bunnie is right though.  Paladins do bring more to the group than Warriors.  If Warriors actively participated instead of passively then not only agro would be less of an issue we can all move onto bigger more systemic problems of dealing damage by melee.<br />
<br />
All melee can do basic melee.  All Hybrids however have moved onto employ &quot;advanced melee&quot; techniques.  We inject additional and worthwhile effects with mana.<br />
<br />
So where are the Warrior advance melee skill?<br />
<br />
So yes the situation is out of balance.  Add some skills that a Warrior can do to the monster and can do for the group would solve a lot of problems.  Agro follows detrimental actions.  Detrimental actions give worth in group.<br />
<br />
Another button to just taunt again is a fix but a lacking one.  Something better would be to additional effects creates aditional tactics and approaches.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A simple button &quot;add 500 hate&quot; will not do. I think aggro generation for warriors is ok at the moment. there is a lot of the stuff in the game as it is to help warriors to aggro :<br />
- EB weapons<br />
- High aggro weapons<br />
- Aggro Augments<br />
- DPS increase<br />
- Aggro spells <br />
- Furious bash<br />
Ok some of those don't work very well (like Furious bash that need to be completly revamped), but there are good aggro tools here and here. NOT snap aggro, but fine aggro, even if I would more weapons in the line of the GSoT and a balancing of dual wield.<br />
<br />
What I really would like to see, more than an &quot;ability to add XXX hate pressing a button&quot;. Something more, to add diversity in tanking, to do, without mana, more than &quot;/attack on, mash buttons&quot;. Look at THIS (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2577) post. ok, self haste or a simple proc on command may be too powerful, but there are great ideas there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Couple of Points:<br />
<br />
Oh yes,<br />
another button to press every 6 seconds while staring bluntly at a screen!<br />
Awseome...<br />
<br />
if that goes in as a warrior fix, I'll just play another game...<br />
<br />
ideas that would make melees actually fun are welcomed as well btw....<br />
because aggro isn't the only problem with warriors....<br />
<br />
when all you do to play your class is hit 2 buttons non stop, <br />
no choices, no thinking, no nothing...<br />
just click .. uhhh... click .. uhhh... click .. uhhhhh....<br />
the fix is NOT a 3rd button to click mindlessly....<br />
<br />
You've had how many levels to realize that pressing those 2 buttons was the entirety of your class since the beginning of the game?  If that isn't fun to you, then you probably should have realized it around level 5 and started a caster.<br />

<br />
/shield Cleric_01, /taunt<br />
probably the best aggro generating combos a warrior has, and accomplishes both purposes you were striving for.<br />
<br />
and for survivability:<br />
/disc evasive/defensive/furious/etc etc etc<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, my personal belief is that many, many, many small to large changes need to be made to balance melee classes.  unlocking all disciplines, higher skill caps, more innate mitigation value for armor types, etc etc, anything but giving warriors spell books.  I'm just a realist and understand that the SoE will take the path of least resistance in order to &quot;claim balance&quot; and go back to making lvl 4 gnome shadowknight newbie quests.  I'm trying to understand how, on some hooters napkin somewhere at SoE, some developer has wrote out a thesis and is pitching the concept that 'classes are not that out of balance' and managers are accepting it as a valid view point, because, if you haven't noticed, SoE is accepting it as valid since nothing has been done in the what, 8 months since its 'come to their attention.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aggro generation is NOT by any means fine for warriors right now.  The very fact that Chanters and Clerics and Shammies PREFER a knight to tank for them than warriors because they can do their job quicker is proof of this.<br />
<br />
Also, changing the taunt button to add 500 hate is fine for xp groups .... but on a big raid mob where multiple tanks are needed(you got pass aggro from tank to tank as defensive wears off) your idea breaks the ability to do it.  As it is now, Taunt can take you to the top of the hate list and will do so after a few mashes even if the first few fails.  What this enables raids to do is change tanks relatively quickly as a couple taunts and the mob is now switched to tank #2.<br />
<br />
Where warriors need help(if we are to maintian the tanking position) is:<br />
<br />
 1) Ranged aggro.  Shammy's and chanters should be able to slow on INC with Warriors like they can with knights.  <br />
<br />
2) Aggro generation.  We need to be able to HOLD aggro better than we can now.  Whether this mean some Modifier so that everything we do generates more hate than normal, or some other modification........not sure.  But our ability to get solid aggro in a relatively short ammount of time is a HUGE problem right now.<br />
<br />
THe taunt button is fine for the most part.  It COULD use some tweaking in that I would like to see a better success rate, but other than that, the taunt button ISN'T where our problem lies. The taunt button will turn the mob to us most of the time ..... but keeping the mob turned.....THAT is our problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>MaxiVisVires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bonequest, you hit the nail dead on. I couldn't agree with you more.<br />
<br />
SOE isn't likely to fix any of the warriors main problems right now because they are interested more in getting new money, than in keeping the people that they are currently getting their money from happy. As long as we are content and don't threaten to cancel our accounts, they'll keep pushing their luck as far as it goes. Any of you that played SWG knows what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
I just came back to EQ from about a year and a half break last week. And yes, lots has changed. EQ has put in so much gear and items, and with the introduction of LDoN, it gives casual players a chance to reach a higher tier status. They addressed problems that one of their target markets (the casual player) had, due to it be 40% of their client base.<br />
<br />
But will SOE go after their warrior customers and address their issues? Yea, but not anytime soon. They are too busy worrying about their legend server (the whole idea of spending extra money to have real customer service is ludicrous), or their pile of a game, SWG. It's just business. Remember when Verant ran the show? Things were alot worse, it was hard to get any customer support at that. Sony realized what Verant was doing wrong and fixed it. Verant swore up and down that they wouldn't do certain things. Sony found out that if certain things happened we'd pay extra (Legends, server transfers). What ended up happening? Sony put Verant employees on the street and gave us what we want... at a price. This caused the biggest resurgence of old players coming back into eq ever. But once they got us back paying our 12 bucks a month, you think they care? Please. Yes, it may be poor business relations as a whole, but SOE knows they got us by the short hairs.<br />
<br />
As for fixing warriors, I think snap aggro would be a step in the right direction. But just as bunny said, playing a warrior is how we said in the old days &quot;Hit a, and pray&quot;. Yea granted, in a raid I worry about how I am positioned, but that's about it. On those 30 minute fights all you have to worry about is pressing 2 buttons, hell, you can macro it so you can flirt with one of the druids while tanking. It's sad. Hybrids get the total bone when it comes to AA's, I mean come on. They get as much hp bonuses as us, plus more to their spell casting and so forth. Once warriors finish up their actual tank aa's, what do we have to look forward to? Increased bind wound? YAY! Giving snap aggro is nice, but SOE is gonna need to do alot more than that to fix em. Maybe if us warriors paid an extra 5 bucks a month, they'll give us some crazy new ability like LoH or HT. Or hell, maybe both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Yehan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">New to posting ont this board, but I thought I would add my 2 cents worth.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of aggresive  response build up.  I do not want to see us losing a discipline unless we gain another, equally benefitious.  I would like to see more damage dealt  by warriors, although I have no idea as to how to implement it.  <br />
<br />
There ya go. my 2 cents worth.</div></div><hr />
