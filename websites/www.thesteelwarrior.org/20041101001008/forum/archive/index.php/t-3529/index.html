Well, as of right now, GRAPHICS on their armors.<br />

<br />
More than Type 1/ Type 4 Augments on all our Older gear.<br />
Recommended Level 1-50 1 slot, level 51-60 2 slots, level 60+ gear 3 slots<br />
<br />
<br />
More than ONE augment slot on older gear.<br />
<br />
On Assassinate missions, the boss mob should drop something.<br />
<br />
On collection missions, usually the item you collect, these are most annoying as any given group can fail, through no fault of their own.<br />
<br />
An option to just choose the type of mission. Waiting 20 minutes while they get a slaughter mission gets old.<br />
<br />
Also, give different points for different mission, we all know rescue is a lot harder than slaughter.<br />
<br />
More than Normal/Hard options. I want missions like wings at Hooter's ... normal, spicy, hot, suicide, nuclear, etc.</div></div><hr />

I agree. If they can give us an AA popup menu, they can give us a mission popup as well. Let us choose our own adventures (wow, remember those books?), we choose our own quests, why not this?<br />
<br />
I've also failed a collection mission after slaughtering the entire zone, so I refuse to do them anymore. Of course, they're the single most common mission I get when I go looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Decent augmentations for pre-LDON rings, earrings and bracers, I am not paying 1150 points for 20hps/mana.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Definitely missing a middle difficulty, something between normal and hard.  Currently my choices are so easy it is boring or omfg the mobs hit harder than krigers and if taunt fails once a robe is going splat.<br />
<br />
Other than that -<br />
Class specific armor<br />
Purchasable non-visible slot items of quality (and yes, class specific versions would be good here too)<br />
<br />
Having to spend adventure points on mana and brain stats on visible armor sucks.  Spending it on non-visible gear sucks too.  Class specific non-visible gear shouldn't be that hard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone else bored with the 4 types of missions already? <br />
<br />
Maybe add more twists to traps.<br />
<br />
Last night I was in a dungeon where we were pacifying through some mobs.  A barrel was next to a mob and I was using the cleric AE pacification (because single target pac was too low lvl for the dungeon we were in) and triggered the trap in the barrel by mistake.<br />
<br />
We were all turned fully drunk in an instant and had that tunnel vision!  It made most of the dungeon very tough but it was fun and made a good twist to the dungeon.  I wish they would put more of something like that instead of your usual poison dots.  Drunkeness or making a PC charmed for a bit or something to make it more interesting.  Right now the 4 types of adventures are getting too repetitive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">scaleable settings on adventures using a slider bar for difficulty.<br />
Sign up group and then use the slider bar to set the difficulty setting. The more left you go the easier, the more right the harder. This way the game system isnt telling YOU what they think you should be able to do.<br />
You finally get a group together, it isnt ideal and join an adventure that you lose. Would be nice to try again with the same group and scale it back a bit. Instead I find most groups that lose tend to break up and go look for alternate groups leaving many players LFG again. <br />
Or you win an adventure with 30 minutes to spare, would be great to try again and scale it up a notch. Far too easy in many cases and it is all based on party level make up. If you are winning by 30 minutes it isnt any fun.<br />
It should be on a scaling difficulty slide bar not just a generic setting.<br />
The way they do it now based on total level averages is silly.<br />
There are some nights you want to try something more difficult, and some nights where you just want some easy &quot;no-brainer&quot; fun. A player useable sliding difficulty bar is ideal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1. Better top of the line (1492 lvl) face/neck/shoulders/waist for PURE melee (wtf mana?!).  For example: there is nothing worth buying for shoulders that exceeds an augmented (+10ac) barbed rubi pauldrons...thats kinda ridiculous.<br />
<br />
2. A medium mission setting.  <br />
<br />
3. Unique rewards for each mission type (otherwise why NOT do a slaughter each time?)<br />
<br />
4. A &quot;Big Gun&quot; 2 hander (read that a +50 dam)<br />
<br />
5. A purchasable (1492 lvl) weap with two type 4s<br />
<br />
6. Hell just make the type 6s accept type 4s (but no the reverse)<br />
<br />
7. Give old equip some legit upgrade paths other than type 1<br />
<br />
8. Differentiate &quot;old equip&quot; for upgrade types.  And not just between &quot;time level and everything else&quot; ;-) <br />
<br />
9. Get rid of the lore of some mods (see Veng 3).  If you want to spend the rest of your Eq life trying to get the points to buy by a bunch of them so be it.<br />
<br />
Hrmmm late breaking news may change 8 &amp; 9<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Racorex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wish they had set it up with a system that would work with a slider bar, I may not be high level (currently 51), but that has afforded me with a different perspective on the setup of difficulty settings in Ldon.  I've leveled so far up from ~44 in Ldon exclusively and from what I've seen every jump in difficulty is LARGE.<br />
<br />
When my normal group hit ~48avg we started teetering on the edge between easy as cake and suicide for missions.  My normal group consists of war, cleric, rog, mag, +2.  The levels of the +2 would basically determine if we would have a hard or easy mission.  No, we never played with the &quot;hard&quot; setting.  I'm sure that we are getting close to that edge again as pretty much every dungeon we've done lately (except a collection in Mir) has been a walk in the park.  I'm sure the next step will be a challenge, but we've been learning the ropes quite well and I'm generally the puller which suits me quite well (usually either have the cleric, who sits next to me, or a pally pacify just enough so that I get 2 or 3 on most pulls.)  In fact, we've done probably the last 3 or 4 missions without a slower...  I know that will change because on our next difficulty step I'm sure I'm going to start getting hammered HARD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hard that is more then just hard hitting mobs, leave the mobs the same or just a litle harder but toss in secret walls more traps mob spawn traps maze like dungeons with twits and turns so you get lost. every dungoen different so you cant map them ect... make hard hard not just tougher mobs.</div></div><hr />
