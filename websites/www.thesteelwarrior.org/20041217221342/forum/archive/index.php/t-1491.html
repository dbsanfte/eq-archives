Is it really worth the aa points?  I know I love AE taunt, and think I would want this aa sometime, but before LR/ID, or after?  How far after if after those?  Thanks in advance for your input.</div></div><hr />

All defense was done before as I don't find myself using AET every time it fresh's but it's always nice having it back sooner after a forced use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it usually go for a couple hours or more between uses, but if I do use it, seems like I will wish I had it again within 5 minutes.  My luck is like that tho.</div></div><hr />

It's a nice tool, but we lived before AE taunt, and you can live without it if it's down...it just makes things easier.  <br />
<br />
I'd rank it really low on the list of things I wanna spend AA's on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it after defensive related AAs, but before most pop offensive ones.<br />
<br />
In my experience, the vast majority of warriors sit on AE taunt holding it until they have to taunt some boss NPC, when I'm far more apt to use it all the time to save people and control mobs and still have it up if needed in a bigger situation.<br />
<br />
I'd say if you don't use AE taunt much to begin with then to not bother with it right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faster AE taunt + Shield  = Saves 5-6 people per xp session<br />
Faster AE taunt + Shield = Saves 10-15  people per raid (on multipulls)<br />
<br />
AE taunt is great for a raiding guild, you can commit suicide<br />
winning 10 seconds for the add tanks/chanters on a bad pull.<br />
Faster AE taunt means you can do this more often and/or have<br />
more flexibility.<br />
<br />
And of course it will help save that ench/shaman after a couple<br />
of badly timed resists during an XP session.<br />
Or the cleric on a multipull while ench is trying to slow.<br />
<br />
Also AE taunt will almost be on the same timer as defensive (thats priceless)<br />
<br />
Its not really &quot;usefull&quot; but i'm happy i took it. <br />
Reducing  the &quot;Crap AE down&quot; isnt a huge boost, but sometimes<br />
its makes the difference between a CR (in xp) or 12 15 extra deaths (in raid).<br />
<br />
Sometimes i use AE taunt twice per day. Sometimes i need to use it twice in 5 mins.<br />
Its a bit more flexibility (which we lack)<br />
<br />
Shield on the other hand is very very very situational because<br />
of its really pathetic range. If it was increased to 30 40<br />
like u run/jump in front of danger it would be awesome.<br />
<br />
My advice ?<br />
Defensive AA   -) Offensive AA -) Utility AA -) Resists -) Fun AA<br />
<br />
We lived before them, and we lived before the faster timer refresh.<br />
Its utility AA, but as you go deeper in PoP (and mobs hit harder &amp; harder)<br />
This small utility AA, makes a difference in xp groups, and in raids.<br />
<br />
304 AA and still going :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd dump points in living shield in a heartbeat if it increased the functional range. Anyway, yeah faster AET is just a utility aa but that's one of the perks you get to have when your defense / offense are done ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds about what I figured.  I just had a day where needless to day, just after using AE taunt on a multipull, 5 to 10 minutes later, another multipull and AE taunt was down still.  Put the idea in my head so thought I would ask.  Thanks much for all the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt think it would be all that usefull but at full aa your ae taunt refresh is down to 10:30.  This comes in very handy during fennin ring and earth A rings.  Imo its definately worth the 9 aa.<br />
