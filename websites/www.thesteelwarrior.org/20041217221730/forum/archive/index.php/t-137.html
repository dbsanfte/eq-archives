<br />
The max HP (8014 hp, 1896 ac unbuffed) war :<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=221262<br />
<br />
or the<br />
<br />
The max AC (7484 hp, 2218 ac) war:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=591007<br />
<br />
for comparision an ALL VT (7059 hp, 1711 ac) war:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=573375<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not sure if 322 ac &gt; 530 hp.</div></div><hr />

So far, parses have shown that the &quot;soft cap&quot; on AC is around 1800ac. Since the 8khp war has over 1800ac he should see little mitigation differences than the 2k+ ac warrior.<br />
<br />
In this case, 530hp &gt; 322ac. In most cases 3ac &gt; 5hp, but this is a pretty extreme example. If the options where 7600hp/1100ac or 7100hp/1400ac I would pick the latter since the mitigation difference would be huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boub</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">doh there is a softcap of 1800 on AC ? <br />
<br />
even the vt only warrior could reach that with a few different choices of pre pop gear</div></div><hr />

Read THIS (http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=145)  post for some good raw data. It will be nice to see some more thorough parsing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in total agreement.<br />
<br />
Even back in the day, there wasn't ever a soft cap, you could still see noticable differences in AC, however it was impractical to reach a high enough AC value and still keep enough HP to be effective.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, that may not be the case.  With Solinar's work on AC testing, I don't buy an AC cap anymore either.  Considering the HP difference between the magelos above, I'd want as much ac as I could get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">melee damage only mob Mr. AC<br />
AE damage mob Mr. HP<br />
combo type Mr. HP or MR. VT<br />
<br />
i am curious why the guys not interested in AC are weilding shields?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boub</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm for the hp guy the shield has the highest hp available,  ok just 5 hp more than hammer of crushing waves but still, I was goin for the max ;)<br />
<br />
and the vt guy hmm yeah could probably put a trident of slaughter in offhand</div></div><hr />

I dont know why people still believe this heh.  I recently tanked aow with like 2100 AC.  He does about the same damage now that he did when I had 1200 AC.  I can just feel the &quot;maybe if you could just get 3000 or 4000 AC&quot; replys coming, heh.<br />
<br />
I think your all sticking your head in the sand when it comes to the AC cap.  Just my opinion, but all the data points towards it.  Outside of PoP (and possibly new CT), AC over 1200 does diddly to mitigating damage.</div></div><hr />

I don't think most people are disputing the AC softcap pre-PoP.  Most people accept a cap somewhere in the 1200-1400 range for those zones.  There seems to be a lot less of a consensus on what cap if any exists for PoP.  Is it 1800?  Is it 2000?  Is it 10000?  I've seen several posts suggesting diminishing returns past 1800 and others stating further gains past 2000.  I'm nowhere near either so I can't test it, but it would be nice to know for planning reasons.<br />
<br />
Just as a further note, overall I'd consider more HPs to be more beneficial than more AC simply due to the fact that HPs absorb all types of damage rather than just melee.</div></div><hr />

Alright fine.  I'll let you interpret your data and tell me what the hell to wear then.<br />
<br />
Ain't like my gear is gonna change anyway.  1300ac cap or 2100, I ain't getting there, so the point is moot.</div></div><hr />
