Thanks to Lazereth from Stormhammer for posting this on www.eqgui.com<br />

The only criticism I can find about this UI is it has no timers... anyone know how to add a timer or two to it? maybe inside the target bars, I dunno. Other than that it's perfect.<br />
<br />
It has your entire inventory laid out on the screen for you to click and your bags...plus it's seemless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty nice... would like to see something else added.<br />
<br />
Bag modification where you can switch out weapons/earrings/misc real quick without having to track across the screen further than I need to.  I find this really effective for primals and insta clicks, and is one of the reasons I use it over an open inventory system like you have in the main bar.</div></div><hr />

I guess I'm not understanding what you are referring to. Quick access to bags is located on the right hand side of your hotkey menu if that's what you mean.</div></div><hr />

Info on what it does is seen here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=363)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok I see what you mean and I do like that a lot. I wonder if I am talented enough to incorpoate that into this UI. I suppose I will find out tonight when I get home from work.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on the bags, I can see them being very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that's a nice UI!<br />
<br />
<br />
But here's a better UI! It's got everything you need!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">what about a tap button?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">nice chat there, i must be doin pretty good have had some of those</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For real, what I want in a perfect UI, in decreasing order of importance, is to be able to see my cyber/tells/chat channels, to be able to see raid chat, to be able to see the world around me for adds/etc and quickly target what I have to off tank, and to be able to quickly swap out weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sars!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't care for Sars, I like a seamless look that Sars doesn't have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I use a slightly modified delta..It's worked far better than any of the others I've used. The only downside really is that if you need chatfonts to be huge, you won't like it.<br />

That looks kinda like Kreugen's UI. Also I noticed you have a blood orchid katana. I hate you =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just don't dig Sars because I much prefer seemless UIs. That Delta is nice, could add a few windows up top and make them always invis for hits and spells and such just to move them out of the way. I still prefer to have my entire inventory available to switch out gear and use for clickies. =)<br />
<br />
And yes...H8 you for having that damn Katana. /rude Druushk.<br />
<br />
I changed my bags to the more useful clicky bags...very nice mod.</div></div><hr />
