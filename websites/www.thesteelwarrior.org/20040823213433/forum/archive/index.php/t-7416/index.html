<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VanceAlKabor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok this is a old school question i hope some of the old school warriors can remember. On Mac EQ and friend of my just got his epics, and if some of you dont know mac EQ only has up to when PoP was released. So they dont have LDoN to split the epics into the 3 augmented blades.<br />
<br />
Now back in the day there was a trick to get all three epic swords at once with a mage summoned rune of swords. I dont remember the trick very well anymore, but i helped about 4 guild members of mine with summoning swords to do it.<br />
<br />
Now do any of you old school epic warriors remember how that trick worked? Was it you combine 2 sword of runes and it gave you the 2hs epic wep? or was there some other way of doing it?<br />
<br />
Also that leads me to ask, was that trick nerfed at all? if so when was it nerfed?<br />
<br />
I cant remember how it worked, but i know it was done a lot when warriors got their epics. Cause they hated carrying around that box to combine the swords in.<br />
<br />
So just remember on Mac EQ has up to when PoP was released, so try and think back how it was done. And if it was nerfed at any point until then. (So damn hard trying to remember old stuff for EQ mac, since most info is updated for PC EQ on allmost ever site).<br />
<br />
Thanks for you time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Still worked for me up until LDoN was released.  I think you just put 2 summoned swords in the scabbard and combine them to get the 2Her.  Been a while, I don't really remember now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If i remember proper; first you had to uncombine the 2Her epic ( needed a red and blue blade in your bag or in-use<br />
grab your red scabbard<br />
place in the scabbard one sword of runes<br />
click and make the jagged blade of war.<br />
put scabbard in bank.<br />
<br />
<br />
it's either that way or the polar opposite ( JBoW in bag, place one sword of runes in scabbard and it makes 'stacked' one handers..place one in inventory and the other appears on cursor ) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it worked independant of weather or not you had jsut uncombined the 2hander.  This was specifically put in as a fix of some odd sword poofing issue i *think* So it should still work substituting the missing blade for a summoned sword but i don't think you can do both at once.<br />
<br />
Since theres no possible way to do this without having done the quest in full i doubt it would be nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">THe only thing you have to do is make sure you don't have two lore items.<br />
<br />
-Create the epics with sword of runes(makes either 2h or 1h cant recall)<br />
-Combine what you just created to make the opposite and put that in a bag<br />
-Create the epics w/ sword of runes again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I did it, I had the 2 1her's, then combined 2 swords of runes in the scabbard, and got the 2her. Not sure if you can have the 2her, put 1 sword of runes in, and combine for the 1hers, didn't try, but I know the first way works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reamer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I belive It makes teh 2 one handers when you combine the summoned sword of runes in teh scabard, its been along time since I did that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Correct method is: Make the 2h weapon. Place a sword of runes in the scabbard, hit combine, and you will have the 2 1h weapons. Place scabbard in bank. All done ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yup that is the way I did it. And of course Kailyn is camped out with 5 (I think its 5--don't think I have 2 Jagged Blades of War) epics. 2 red, 2 blue and one 2h. I would have to reactivate my account to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats what I have Kailyn.  I turned in my 2Her for the LDoN versions and ended up with 4 1Hers and a 2Her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">[1] Place your Jagged Blade of War (2hs) into the scabbard.<br />
<br />
[2] Place a Summoned: Sword of Runes into the scabbard.<br />
<br />
[3] Hit combine.<br />
<br />
At this point you will have the unaugmentable 2hs *and* both 1hs on your cursor. Place them all in your bags before zoning or you risk losing 2/3 of them.<br />
<br />
[4] Go find your buddy Gartrog Smitehammer in East Freeport.<br />
<br />
[5] Hand him the unaugmentable 2hs *and* the scabbard, but *not* the 1hs. Make sure you are not invis.<br />
<br />
At this point you get back the augmentable versions of all three epics. This means you have a single 2hs and four 1hs.<br />
<br />
If you play EQ on a mac, skip steps 4 and 5 but save that scabbard for future use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnatzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thank you for your help I now have all 3 weapons and can bank the red scabbard. <br />
<br />
The method that worked was having the 2hs in inventory putting the Sword of Runes in the Red Scabbard and combining to get the two 1 handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Never auged my epic.  Does it just add a type 4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yup</div></div><hr />
