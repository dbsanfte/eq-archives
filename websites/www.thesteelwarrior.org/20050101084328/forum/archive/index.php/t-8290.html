/gmarknpc # sucks for the most part. What would make this ability useful, however, is the ability to target marked npc's by number. Wouldn't it be grand if we could /target 1 or something to pick out the one that was called? It seems like the logical &quot;other side&quot; of this currently overlooked leadership ability.<br />
<br />
Any ideas why we don't have this? Or maybe it's there and I've missed it.<br />

<br />
Other than using it to indicate which mezzed mob to tank next, it does seem fairly useless.  Especially as most cc'ers I've been with lately just have me take whatever one I want (of course if mez wears off, I go for that one first).  Especially as the prime situation (excluding raids) is in LDoNs or Sewers...mobs either don't last that long to bother using this or if you're in a hard/sewer, having more than 2 mobs in camp is generally going to cause a wipe without a very strong group.<br />
<br />
I'd agree there should've been a follow up aa to that on the assist to make it more desirable.</div></div><hr />

Especially in crowded places or underwater raids it's much easier to see where my target is and to make sure I'm not trying to offtank what the MA has targetted.<br />
Not saying that what you suggest is a bad idea, just saying that, for me atleast, the ability is far from useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hell it'd be nice if they just made the main assist la work just by making a hotbutton to &quot;/assist main&quot; or some such crazyness. As it is, all it does is make a pretty ring around the MAs target. you still have to type out those insanely stupd name people give themselves. I swear it seems like some of those names were made to hard to type on purpose. I hate having to stare at a name, especially ones with a lot of I's and l's, or r's, n's and m's, making it nearly impossible to tell how its spelled without trial and error, jeez, some people...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Delegate Main Assist does work that way, typing/hotkeying /assist group or /assist raid does that. Click the ? on the LAA window, list of commands at the bottom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">REALLY? Now that is good news. Now they need to make it work off mark npc for the puller, and those leader aa's are really worth something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops, I spoke too soon, it doesn't work that way or doesn't work properly, apparenty only work on players that the MA has targetted and only if that player is close. No idea what the purpose of that is. Anyway, this it the text in the help window:<br />
<br />
/assist group -- Targets the player the Group Main Assist has targetted.<br />
<br />
/assist raid -- Targets the nearest player that any Raid Main Assist has targetted.<br />
<br />
/assist main --  Targets the nearest player that any Group or Raid Main Assist has targetted.</div></div><hr />

Somebody should go test if it actually only works on players or if they just write lame help texts. Will do tonight.</div></div><hr />
