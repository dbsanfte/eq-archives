<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some are too wrapped up in what once was to want to think of a non-specialist alternative.  Most are just pissed off by month after month of neglect and looking for the &quot;easy&quot; solution - i.e. nerf the hell out of knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking for me personally, I love playing my warrior because I like that very specialized role we fit into, tanking.  If I wanted a 'broad' class, I would play a knight.  The solution to warrior problems is not to make wariors something they are not.  I liken it to solving warrior problems by making pallies more healer than tank, and Sk's more a necro than a tank.  Both classes would be rather upset I suspect by this change.I find the idea of giving up all utility to be the best tank a worthwhile tradeoff(to me)...I just would like to actually be the best tank again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I want massive utility, I play my Bards.<br />
<br />
 When I want raw tanking, well, it used to be that way with my Warrior. I guess it still is if you call sitting on your ass in the EC tunnel with the LFG tag up 'raw tanking'.</div></div><hr />

Raw tanking, no.<br />

<br />
Yeah, we fight and get hit and, well, that's it. <br />
We should be leaders. We should be able to garner the courage of the people we group with and our presence alone should do that.<br />
<br />
The whole shallow/narrow thing was VI's fault. Warriors in all senses of Roleplaying and Historical accounts were deeper than what we; as warriors; appear to the community we play in.</div></div><hr />
