Previously we cornered RD and had no trouble at all doing so.  Now that doesn't work.  He warps.  So soon after I called the assist on RD, bam, dragon warps to the middle of the room.  The raid wiped a little while later.  Thanks Sony for breaking an encounter that was fine.<br />
<br />
So what do you do with RD anyway?  It seems like it's just a matter of desperately trying to keep your tank up (we're non elem), max your MR buffs and hope you always resist the DoT and that not many people, especially your MT, get feared.  I was MT and had MR buffs plus bard in group and I still got feared for 1 tick on 2 occasions.  I saw others getting feared some as well.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, we killed RD with another similarly progressed guild with about the same size total raid force as we had tonight (60 characters).  The warping hurt us, but it seemed like if we did things right we could still win.  Nope.  We weren't even close.  The fears kicked our butts.  I died with RD still at 70%.  The raid was dead with RD at 51%.  I just don't know any other strategy for this mob other than all out dps, spam heal your tank, and pray key people don't get feared.   Sounds like zerging to me.  Oh, but we have to fight it in the middle of the room instead of cornering.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We took two runs at this slut before we got down a good strat for him.  He actually prompted me to stop my Sturdines AA progression and work Fear Resistance 3 because his fear pissed me off so much (I don't regret it for AD/RD and I know it'll come in use later for Time Inny)<br />
<br />
But anyways.  We take the MA and the Ramp Tank and slap them in a group with a bard.  The bard twists Psalm of Veeshan with the raid-wide MR as well.  PoV puts both me and the ramp tank at 500 MR (max).  When the custodian (trigger mob) is at 25% we back the raid off and range kill it while only the BRD, MA, and Ramp Tank stay on him.  At 2-3% hp, bard goes Fearless Disc, ramp tank goes Defensive, I go Furious.  I spam F8 and Incite asap when rydda spawns.  Ramp tank does the same, swings once and attack off til 90% to ensure no pulled agro.<br />
<br />
The thing to remember is RD's AE Fear is a 60 second interval.  This means having 500MR at the beginning is key to resist that first fear.  If you get unlucky and get feared off the bat, shits gonna go awry.<br />
<br />
From there its a matter of having two priests chain cure just in case that 3200hp/tick dot lands on you or the ramp tank.  Disease slow Rydda`Dar since the MR one will more than likely not land.  I just kinda walk him back and forth near a wall (Where the raid is positioned) and we kill him that way.  It works well.   500 MR, get that, and things will got a lot better.  Find a Fear Resistance 3 WAR tank, and you only increase your odds.<br />

If you wall RD your asking for trouble.  We had this issue as long as a year ago but he used to warp to the Grave yard.<br />
<br />
Fight him in the middle of the room and don't back him into the wall is the only way to fight him</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all.  Like I said, we cornered him on our first kill when we worked with another guild on an off night for both guilds.  They'd killed him before by cornering and it worked great when we helped them, too.  But obviously this time it didn't.<br />
<br />
We had a couple bards, but I'm sure we could have used more to help keep the dps coming.  The dragon was dropping too slowly so I assume some people must have been feared.  I need to ask the bard in my group what they were doing too because my MR was only around 435 and I've topped 500 before.  hmm... I did forget to get Ferocity though.  Maybe that was it.  Anyway, biggest problem was the warping and then the slow dps rate once we were fighting in the center.  If I remember I can also add the tribute MR for 25-30 more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of things, RD has always seemed to get pushed up a post by a wall and warp to the roof or wherever he summoned me to.<br />
<br />
Next, you have a bard for your tanks, but what about the healers?  You wont last long if your healers get feared.  Are you using Evasive or Defensive?  Avoiding his proc may be more beneficial than lowering each melee hit depending on your gear, etc.<br />
<br />
His rampage is very bad for many guilds, are you keeping the rampage tank up or setting one?  RD can very quickly one or two round many peeps fighting him as current content.  Having melee on rampage is crucial so healers dont start dieing.<br />
<br />
If you have 60+ peeps, I am assuming you have some 65 druids and chanters.  Are you taking advantage of charmed Wrulons for druids and enchanters?  Personally I would keep a chanter in reserve in case a chanter or druid is killed and they need to take over a charmed pet. Charmed pets loose in healers = bad.<br />
<br />
Also, I would have a debuff crew hit him with malo/tash/slow etc. as fast as possible.  You may lose some of them right off the bat but slowing him ASAP is very important to winning that fight in my opinion.  He still is a royal PITA for guilds to do as backflagging unless you are so much past that level of progression.  While botting some friends for this flag, I have watched pickup raids whipe to this mob with an 11k tank with 85ish peeps, so he is by no means easy.<br />
<br />
Keep trying, you will get him :)<br />

I'm pretty sure the AE doesn't have a dot either, cause we had no one die and the only people that needed heals were MT, RT and idiots that attacked from the front and took riposte dmg. Looking at spell details it's:<br />
<br />
2: Fear(1)<br />
3: Decrease Movement by 36% (L1) to 105% (L70)<br />
4: Decrease Attack Speed by 35%<br />
5: Decrease AC by 180<br />
<br />
So maybe everyone in the raid got slowed and that hurt your dps? It has a -200 MR check.<br />
<br />
Oh and we fought in the middle of the room.</div></div><hr />

Oh and we fought in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
I've attended two pickup RD raids now, and both wiped due to the MA (was not me either time) having insufficient agro shortly after RD pops.  In at least the second situation, I know the MA wanted to move RD into the corner (I assume one or more people jumped the gun on debuffing, which may have happened the first time too).<br />
<br />
I have a quick question regarding RD, since this is an outdoor zone, I assume the walls will not protect casters against AoE (fear)?</div></div><hr />

Have your ramp tank and MA finish the trigger off in the center of the room then both attack right away and pop fortitude.  Burn him in the middle.  Charm guards from the other 2 rooms if you need more dps.  Stick a bard near the wall with casters singing ae resists and one near RD's body singing ae resists or if you lack 2+ bards have one near RD and have people gather near RD during the kill after assist is called.</div></div><hr />

1:  	Decrease Hitpoints by 2500 per tick<br />
2: 	Stun(3.00 sec)<br />
3: 	Decrease Hitpoints by 700 per tick<br />
4: 	Increase Disease Counter by 36<br />
<br />
The reason for the two seperate DoT slots is the 3rd slot one prevents DRU/SHM &quot;regeneration&quot; buffs.  Honestly I think it's retarded becaues no regen buff is going to counter a 3200hp/tick DoT.  But that's the only explination I can come up with.  It just causes a stacking issue.  That or some limitation with max hp that can be done by a spell per tick per slot.<br />
<br />
But eitherway, 3200hp/tick is gonna rock you hard combined with his melee especially if you're unslowed. 500 MR really helps.  We usually stick two people, one for MA one for ramp tank, and chain cure to make sure we remove the DoT ASAP if it lands.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iyacc@work</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried several different things and finally settled on the following and have had minimal trouble for all the flagging/backflagging along the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
We make a tank group with bard and two healer groups with bards for resist song. Everyone else relies on AE song but so long as tanks and healers don't get feared, it's no biggie if others do occasionally.<br />
<br />
We put the tank group, healer group and debuffers in one corner. Everyone else in opposite corner. Healers deep in corner, MT out almost at max range for heals. We pull trigger there and tank group kills it. Rangers and/or wizards shoot it from range and back off with trigger at 5% or so. MT and ramp tank finish off trigger and RD pops on top of them. Both tanks pop def/evasive/furious (whichever) and heal chains are already going when RD spawns (started them when trigger was at 2 or 3%.)<br />
<br />
As soon as RD pops, MT calls attack. Melee spread out around target to minimize push, since pushing it up a wall or pillar is an easy way to wipe. Range attacks stay at max range. If you have a lot of melee and/or pet casters, you can park pets with the healers to push opposite melee. Enchanters will sometimes charm guards to send in also.<br />
<br />
I think that's everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it just me or does this have absolutely no logic behind it?<br />
<br />
Why would you range fight him?<br />
<br />
1.) His AE Fear range is considerable to the point that everyone in the raid will get hit regardless.<br />
<br />
2.) It is an Outdoor zone, walls mean nothing when it comes to AE's.  You can't &quot;hide&quot; from it.<br />
<br />
3.) His AE does no harm to your health or otherwise so detrimental that it warrants trying to &quot;joust&quot; by running people back an entire room.<br />
<br />
4.) His rampage list is single, not AE.<br />
<br />
Again, I see absolutely no feasable logical reason to attempt to range this guy.  In fact i'm discovering that RZ Script's Tallon Zek you don't even have to range either.  We no longer range fight him and grats us flawless kills on him with no deaths.<br />
<br />
Ease off the ranged fight thing, play the game.  Only ranged fight when its pretty much necessary.<br />

You got very lucky. :)  I was at 435 the other night (forgot to get ferocity buff) and I got briefly feared twice.  Fortunately his brutal point blank DoT didn't stick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same rules apply to Screeching Bellow as with Enraging Blow.  Has a chance to proc every swing.  Get as much MR as you can to resist it and have someone ready to cure it, as it usually will get you killed if left to fester for more than a few ticks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tip1 , innate fear resistance! even first rank, any bit helps.<br />
<br />
tip2! 500mr. So key. Put clerics with bards for psalm of veeshan, no fear = ez. with 500 you resist every time or insta-break.<br />
<br />
tip3 - do not corner! cornering rd is dumb... the fear will flop him everywhere and you wont be able to adapt and move :(<br />
<br />
tip4 - Divine aura song! &lt;3 hit DA song right before the custodian dies, that way, your tank doesn't get insta-feared on RD pop! <br />
<br />
tip5 - keep .. this! (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3174&amp;source=Live) Off your tank/rt.<br />
<br />
RD's ae does no damage , he only single target ramps and beats the shit out of the MT. have yer tanks ready to catch RD when they pop... if you've killed him before you wont need to catch with DA, you can use fortitude to catch him.\<br />
<br />
We once had a 6 1/2 min RD fight falling short at 5% , it was pretty intense, think we had like 24.. that was pre-gates too, was alot of fun. Just takes good useage of bards, ferocity, and intelligence among raiders (if you're getting ramps... back the hell out of ramp range)<br />
<br />
and oh yeah! Where the hell were you guys in kunark!! /disc fearless after dps discs  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like to park 3+ charmed pets in the middle of the room.  The entire raid backs off except MT, Custodian, and pets.  When custodian is at 3% you fire off warcry and move out of range to get summoned.  At 1% or 0% you start furious.  Make sure you are backpedaling to get custodian to chase you.  If you're too close when Rydda pops he actually pops behind you and more often than not you're dead before you can turn around.<br />
<br />
Purpose of pets in the middle of room is they all get on the rampage list.   Just have your enchanters stay out of rampage range and Rydda will ramp the pets down 1 by 1.  This frees up ALL your healing power to be spam healing the MT.  Rydda should be dead before he finishes all the pets.<br />
<br />
I disagree with people saying &quot;Rydda is all about DPS&quot;.  As long as you can kill him in the 3 minutes defensive is up, you're home free.  The rest is about having the healers mana hold out while they chain cast on the MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As fun as it would be if that were true, you can't defy core game mechanics.  Indoor zones, walls will always &quot;block&quot; AE's.  In outdoor zones, nothing can block AE's.  That is fact, it is game law, you cannot defy it.<br />
<br />
Please note that &quot;Detail&quot; structures may not be classified as walls, rather are Models (like the characters you play).  <br />
<br />
Like the infamous &quot;omg hide behind the firepot&quot; obviously doesn't work.  Usually standard pillars and structures alike do not block things.  Again, that is why people use the term &quot;Wall&quot;.  Because only walls block them.  If you're ever done some basic level editing for say like a first person shooter.  Think of it as any &quot;block&quot; you use, can block AE's, any &quot;entity&quot; will not stop it.  (Not the best example, but you get the idea)<br />
<br />
Grummus, Behemoth, Terris, Aerin`Dar, Agnarr, Rydda`Dar, etc. are all in outdoor zones.  Regardless what you do, as long as you are in the radius of their AE, it doesn't matter what is between you and the boss, it'll hit you.<br />
<br />
But I would like to entertain your accusations of AE's still going through walls in Indoor zones ;P<br />

Hehe I considered going all the way for Warcry.  Aerin`Dar and Rydda`Dar's fear were pissing me off.  But I only got up to Fear Resistance 3 and found that to be a significant enough help that it didn't justify going towards Warcry.<br />

Um, let's see PoWater, I remember we used to place the Wise differently where casters could be in a tunnel which if walls blocked the ae wouldn't hit but it did.  To restate then, &quot;most&quot; of PoP enviroments aren't considered &quot;real&quot; walls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With 500MR and max fear resist AAs you're still going to get feared 1 in 3 times or so.  If that 1 time happens when Rydda fires his first AE it pretty much blows the raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've yet to see an AE go through a Lxanvom wall.  Bertoxxulous' AE included, or any AE for that matter.  Examples and locations used?<br />
<br />
Drunder, I routinely use walls to avoid AE's in this zone and it works well.  In fact I pull sometimes in RZTW plows and I routinely use walls to &quot;tank&quot; Hendin Shadow Masters for a brief second around the corner so they use their flux + 1 slot dispell so that only myself gets hit, when if walls didn't block, the raid woulda been hit anyways.  Again, examples?<br />
<br />
Solusek Ro, i've never fought SolRo himself but keep in mind that his AE is a Target Based AE.  Meaning the AE radiates from the target he's attacking, not himself.  So again, make sure he's positioned properly.<br />
<br />
Reef of Coirnav is indeed an outdoor zone, you just can't summon mounts under water.  Zone in and stand on the sand, grats mount.  So again that would make sense, since powater is indeed an outdoor zone.<br />
<br />
I don't see any flaws, just inaccurate information presented ;P<br />
<br />
Show me examples, it's hard to defy game mechanics.<br />

You can't summon mounts on the sand either.  PoWater is an indoor zone, I'm not trying to fool you!!  Yes I know how targeted ae's work heh, wouldn't matter much though anyway cause I doubt solro would be behind a wall but somehow the tank wouldn't be, basically originate from the same area give 20 range for melee distance from solro to the tank.  <br />
<br />
Haven't done solro in a while but I'm trying to think what the zone geometry is like.  Honestly with the minis I've never even bothered placing them in a way that you could hide from the ae because I was pretty sure they went through the wall.  I suppose next time on rizlona I could do it for the hell of it if we ever do solro minis again.  Solro I know we'd change our strat if the ae didn't go through walls.  I know for sure it goes through the big pillars but I guess you're saying these aren't considered walls so I'm trying to think if the side walls even bend enough that you could have a tank be even within a 150 raidius of a caster but that caster be behind a wall.  Still think it goes through however. <br />
<br />
The Wise thing I'm sure about and yes it's an indoor zone.  About you being around the corner with the Hendin's that's most likely because you being around the corner put the hendin at a fairly decent range from anyone else since the ae is only a 30 or 60 ft raidius.  Probably just has to do with what they flag as &quot;true&quot; walls like I said since Quarm's room is flagged as &quot;true&quot; walls.   I'll play with a hendin sometime maybe and see.</div></div><hr />

        Wall certainly not block AE in drunder. Per exemple you can't avoid Vallon and Tallon AE . Hendin shadow masters ae have a very small range  ;)</div></div><hr />

I may end up leading an open raid on this dragon, so...what spell(s) can cure this?<br />
<br />
A) Abloish Disease<br />
B) Abolish Poison<br />
C) Greater Remove Curse<br />
D) Pure Blood<br />
E) ??<br />
<br />
<br />
The other basics that all agree on for success seem to be (trying to verify):<br />
* Keep RD on the rug<br />
* 2+ Bards (at least one for MA area and one for healer/caster area)<br />
* Charmed Wrulon Guard Pets help tremendously if enchanters are capable<br />
* Have FA buff on MA for extra MR<br />
* Have MA position the first agro'd mob and be moving backwards at kill shot<br />
* Rampage Tank (SA or real Rampage Tank?) get heals from druids and/or shaman<br />
* Ensure that casters are out of PBAE range (is this frontal only?)<br />
* 1 suicidal enchanter for quick tash (should be near ma in case of agro)<br />
* 2 suicidal shammy for quick slow (should be near ma in case of agro)<br />
* 1 suicidal mage for mala or 1 shammy for malo (should be near ma in case of agro)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry, late response... but I have major issues with paying 12 AA for fear resistance and however many for Warcry just to kill Rydda Dar.  I'm at 312 AA now and that's still not worth it. heh... <br />
<br />
Oh well, guild got our 2nd solo kill of Rydda Dar last night.  I tanked it from start to finish.  We only had one bard on the raid, who did her best to stay between the healers and me.  Fear never once stuck on me this time.  Screeching Bellow never stuck.  There were a couple brief moments where I was rather dangerously low on hit points though DI never fired.   No charmed pets.  Defensive wore off very shortly before the dragon died.  We did have a large raid (about 65 people).</div></div><hr />

Huummmm, either I don't understand .... either  ... I don't understand.<br />
How 65 people form a solo fight ?<br />
does one guy chalange the mob in duel, and the other 64 cheer him ??? or Iam I missing somthing ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh... solo kill as in just our usual raiders.  The first time we ever killed RD it was on an off night with us filling about half the raid spots and another guild filling the other half.</div></div><hr />
