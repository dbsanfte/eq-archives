<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all:<br />
<br />
I am one of the MT's in a smaller guild and we just recently broke into the Elemental planes.  We cannot consistently field the numbers to kill elemental mobs to farm them so we have all been asked to list the one item we would like more than the others from the E-planes. So far we have killed a big gator in Earth, Hydrotha in Water and two birds and General someone in Fire (not Reparm) but wiped on an large fire type muddite model'd mob who drops molds.<br />
<br />
Therefore, if you are bored, take a look at my Magelo and post your opinion on what I should shoot for.  I am guessing on a good night we will be able to field 45 people for a mob soon as some backflagging is taken care of if that helps.  I would assume the tougher mobs will be out of our reach for a while for us.  Normal I think will be 35-40 peeps for our raid force.<br />
<br />
At the moment, I am leaning towards a Bracer of Earthen Energy because I don't like the stats on my haste neck and this would give me a new haste item.  I think I could get a new neck from a hard LDON or from TZ/VZ/Rizlona at some point to upgrade with.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks in advance for the advice :)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Forgot to say that molds will be handled differently.  Our guild's leader decides loot ultimately and IMO does a good job at it.  This is for non elemental armor only.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally, if I had to pick one or two items, I would look at molds only.  Since you're killing Hydrotha you obviously will be seeing molds.  For other classes the molds and non-molds can be a tossup, but for warriors the molds really stand out.  Looking at your magelo, your two worst slots are your neck and gloves.  I'd ask for a plate gauntlet mold and plan to add a hp augment to it.<br />
<br />
You should be able to replace that necklace pretty easily incidentally, whether through raids, SolRo mini-raids, LDON hards, or GoD loot.  In this age of tribute haste, there is no need to compromise on gear to get 41% haste anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitely a piece of Raex.  Pyronis should be an easy kill for you and he drops gloves.  Replace whatever your worst visible armor slot is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They might be running into the problem my guild is of early competition.  Fire gets cleared earlier than most of our raid force is on.<br />
<br />
A good, easy target would be avatar of wind in PoA.  Its a little longish to get there, but the loot is pretty decnet, easy easy mob, and for some reason on my server up a lot.  Also, the mini's in air have fast repops to help fill out other classes with good stuff too.<br />
<br />
Brutul is head on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">41% haste ring from one of the one of the elementals in air i suppose<br />
Ring from hydrotha is good too<br />
Fang of Flame from birds<br />
<br />
I say jewelry cause IMHO it's kinda hard to find realy good jewelry specially earrings<br />
<br />
Vis slots should all go Reax or Earth bracer if u are set on it for haste<br />
<br />
there are no weapons of any note in elemental that is better than a BoW so keep farming RZ when u can (SeW is pretty good as well soo if bow are gonna be A3'd i say get whichever one drops 1st but keep hoping for a BoW)<br />
<br />
Ohh and Puresteel Mantel (one that has clicky DS) in air...its War only soo ya shouldn't have much probs there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Raex is the most important stuff in the elementals for Warriors, but if you are looking for a non-Raex piece the only non-visible slot really worth it for warriors in the elementals is the Puresteel Mantle.  Pretty much everything else you can get something with better AC from VT / Ssra.<br />
<br />
Haste bracer is a good call too, but only if VT haste isnt available to you (gorget of superiority / BP of speed etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Puresteel Mantle is a Myth on my server we have killed the mob a dozen times and always the gay hybrid shoulders  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">we had 8 or 9 gay hybrid shoulders then 2 puresteel in a row, considering I was wearing draconic pauldrons at the time they were a huge upgrade for me.  Don't think we have bothered to raid air again since then.  RZ in time on the other hand has been very generous on Pauldrons of devastation giving us 3/8 or so kills which isnt so cool as they are kinda a dud loot from him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd say Raex arms and put a 40 HP aug on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Raex helm,<br />
<br />
since its the hardest to get due to rarity, <br />
<br />
only drops of reparm in fire, one of the avatars in poa, and very rarely in poeb.<br />
<br />
Other pieces are much more common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">His best piece of armor currently is his helmet - so I'd personally suggest any piece of Raex OTHER than the helmet. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kenyi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Arm Mold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Arms or gaunts. They will last you until Qvic. The Time plate arms/gloves are hardly upgrades to Raex so go with one of those those first. Really any Raex is worth having, but those 2 seem like the best deals considering the upgrade path in Time. I would hold off on jewelry slots until you get in to KT or Time. The elem jewelry items generally suck for warriors, you end up giving up a lot of AC to VT or Time+ drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gaunts are very very common. Only problem with plate arms are they are very good for clerics. If you don't do DKP, I am sure clerics would be prioritized on them before you.  Can pick up a nice neck off charm birds in fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Puresteel Mantle<br />
Earthen Bracer<br />
<br />
(with the Tipt bracer that leaves your out on Raex Bracers - so others can get it)<br />
<br />
I agree on arms or gaunts (especially as gaunts are easy to get)<br />
<br />
I dont know how contested elementals are on your server, but the way to Fennin can yield some majorly nice loot (Band of Elder Understanding etc) - and for you it might be the Fire Marked Rune as neck piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Elementals are fairly contested on Tunare, except air rings of course :P<br />
<br />
Go for the arms or gaunts, but pick up a Puresteel Mantle if you get lucky and have 1 drop (we've had a total of 2 in many clearings)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Normal I think will be 35-40 peeps for our raid force. <br />
<br />
That's plenty for every miniboss in the elementals except for General Reparm and Warlord Gintolaken.  Here's a tip though....<br />
<br />
VEX THAL<br />
<br />
You're doing yourself a disfavor by skipping it.  It really makes the elementals that much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18"></div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Skipping VT to go to the elementals generally leaves a guild severely handicapped. VT fills the mana pool, ft, hp and ac gaps that are needed to reliably raid the elementals with lower numbers. If you are in the elementals it means you were able to beat RZtWL, means you can put a full raid force on if needed, that will be what is required until your guild gets more gear. Skipping VT very much hurt your ability but can still be overcome by farming tier1 and 2 of PoP, Ornate from Sol Ro and LDoN equipment. Still it will actually take you longer then if you did VT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">a guild of 30-45 can pharm air like no tomorrow and pull every piece of elemental armor from it but boots.  Easy to pharm for a small tight guild.<br />
<br />
And yeah puresteel mantle defintely or any piece of Raex i'd go with would be boots/gaunts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I appreciate how highly valued VT is to some guilds.  The loot there is quite nice, but as a whole our guild feels that it would set us back too far in POP to take the 1 year we estimate it would entail to key and farm it for the rewards.  We do not have manditory raiding or anything.  We are small enough and casual enough that &quot;racing&quot; another guild to a target is pretty much out of the question.  On Tunare it seems that many mobs are killed within 1 hour of spawn since it is an older server with a lot of competition.<br />
<br />
Our guild is pretty much full Ornate/LDON gear with a mix of POP loots filling in and some GoD stuff as well.  Most of our casters have decent FT (10 or higher) and focus effects.  From what I understand most VT focus effects are useless post 60 save for the FT although I could be wrong on that as I have no spells to cast :)<br />
<br />
Again, I apreciate the VT suggestion, but at this time it is not an option.  Elemental armor is being handled seperately from the other drops, and yes as a guild arms will be going to clerics first.  I have no problem with that as it helps keep us all alive longer.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for the suggestions and if anyone has anything besides plate molds as a suggestion I would appreciate the input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Vex Thal focuses work on spells up to level 65.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes, but when OOW comes out in 6 weeks, the POP foci are much more likely to be extended to level 70 than the VT foci.<br />
<br />
(VT foci were already extended once.)<br />
<br />
Personally, if I was a caster, I'd be very reluctant to rely on any VT foci at this point.</div></div><hr />
