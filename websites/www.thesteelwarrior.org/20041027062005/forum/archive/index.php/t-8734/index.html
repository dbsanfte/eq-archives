<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not really keeping track on repop time of kunark dragons, but it seems that it has been lowered, it has been a couple of time where sev has repoped apparently after 3days ish~.<br />
<br />
One time I met talen in SF also about 3days after a server reset ( was a total surprise ) and same for Gore ( was about 1month ago ).<br />
It would make sense as 1week repop for them was really long considering that these dragons can drop epic parts and it would be really slow for people unepicced  as OOW comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They used to spawn 1-3 days after server reset, followed by 7 days +/- 1 day after that.  So your Talendor sighting would match that.<br />
<br />
There have been a fair number of server resets lately, on Bertox anyway.  I think four in the past 10 days.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, I didn't know that they could pop up to 3days after a server reset, if it the case it would be that ( well 3full days + 10h in sev case so a bit odds ).<br />
I was wondering if they lowered the repop time as for exemple phiny epics drop has been up for sure ( wizard wands used to be rare, now it's as much common as other epics drop from him ), and these 3 would be the only pop on 7days for an epic mob dropper  I think.</div></div><hr />
