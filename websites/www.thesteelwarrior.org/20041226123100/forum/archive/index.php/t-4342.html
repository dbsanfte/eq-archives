<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leonof</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey everyone, I was just wondering what a reasonable, or maybe a better word would be respectable goal is for a non uber warrior to set for unbuffed hp at 65.  Let me first tell you about my guild, we are a casual raiding guild, mainly raid twice a week on the weekends, with about 30-50 58+ on average.  Some of the things we raid are Vindi, NToV, Xanamech, Tunare, Grieg, and some of the lower end targets in Ssra.  So I was wondering what your opinions were, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well according to your Magelo he broke 5k now.  Just keep trying to upgrade your HP.  You can never have enough HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He never said if he have LDoN, so don't know if he can stuff in HP augments, but if he could put one +40HP augment in each non-weapon piece, that would be +680 HP from augments alone. True, it's a lot of points for those.<br />
<br />
Then add a decent Range item of some sort and get a few flags and an adventurers stone to stuff into the POP charm and things should look good.<br />
<br />
Also, try and buy some Ornate molds might be interesting, some of the smaller ones are fairly easy to get and have good +HP on them.<br />
<br />
I'd say that 7k is entirely within your range.<br />
<br />
Besides, LDoN adventures would be useful as exp for some more AA's .. like ... offensive AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">7k is too high and you'd be insane to get that many points and put it in armor that you're likely to upgrade just with some simple guild progression heh.  I'd say shoot for 6100-6200 unbuffed not including ldon augs.  Techinically droppable gear can get you to around 6300ish(AoW helm, acid bracers, earthern rings, amygdalan mask and such) so many factors though really are involved but yeah I'd say a good number is just over 6k the 6k-6.2khp range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is killing the exact same stuff you are and I'm in just under 6300 so I'd say somewhere between 6300-6500 is doable, maybe more with LDoN augments.</div></div><hr />
