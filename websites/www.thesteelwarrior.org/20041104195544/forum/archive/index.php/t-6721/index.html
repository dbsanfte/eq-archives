<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vicaire Delestacia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I was shopping one of the LDoN merchants in NRo today I noticed that they are now selling a &quot;Worn scout shield&quot; for six points. The sheidl has some minor stats but more importantly it has the message, &quot;This item has a faction modifier&quot; printed on it. The faction that it modifies is not listed though. <br />
<br />
I naturally assumed that the faction was for Wayfarer's Brotherhood members and immediately bought the item thinking it would improve my faction with the magus which I usually unload LDoN vendor loot on. After equipping the shield though my faction remained at indifferent. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea what faction this item modifies?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't heard of it, however if you identify the item then it will list the factions.  Can use Silvery Mask (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25077) or Star of Eyes (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14361) to do so.  Or have a caster cast the spell on you.  You need the item on your cursor when the spell is cast.  It will give the item lore and the faction adjustments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After you do that, Vicaire, let us know what it modified. I'm all curious now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">anyone wanna guess talosian? so everyone can get a mod not just people who bought the box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since no one had a clue, and it was only 6 points, I went and bought it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This item gives positive faction to DaBashers.&quot;<br />
<br />
feh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That seems pretty pointless to put Da Bashers faction on a shield from Nro.  Isnt that the Troll guards which are now no longer there because the frogs took over the city.  So they put a non existant faction on an item so it seems to me they must have messed up on something there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is in fact Troll Warrior guild faction. Which is/was most of the guard faction as well.<br />
<br />
But i still dont see the point of it myself.</div></div><hr />
