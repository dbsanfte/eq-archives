<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard about 1 hour after someone kills  him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tanok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anybody have any info on this encounter?  The only thing in the guide is that he hits for 2k + single target stun.  Are there any adds?  How long is the stun?

<br />
He has like MASSIVE hp.. hits for 2k, rampage I think or flurry, does a AoE 1200 Knockback stun, NOT single target.  Add's repop if your dps is low in his area unless you pull him out someplace safer.  Its pretty much a straight up fight otherwise. 3 groups can do it just will take like 10 minutes to kill.  I think with like 25 or 26 it took my guild around 6 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just did this fight, and we had to wait for the beastlord guy to spawn (be glad you don't have this, sorta 2hrs up then despawns for 2hrs)<br />
<br />
we killed krekk, moved to room, and he was up again by time there, I think 30minutes or a hr.<br />
<br />
Either way, quick enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's in the far NE corner of the open area once you zone in.<br />
<br />
In terms of tactics, I would recommend clearing the entire large room he is in, doing your turn-in and engaging immediately.  Fail to clear his room and undoubtedly one of you will get thrown into another mob and chaos can ensue.  His stun I found to be negligable, it was the AE knockback and losing aggro from being OOR that was the most problematic for us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maarv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What happen if you wipe ? Can you get back the 3 items ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>axxeman01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What happen if you wipe ? Can you get back the 3 items ?<br />
<br />
We wiped a few times before we got it right.  The 'aggro' version of Krekk doesn't seem to despawn until he's dead (he was up at least 2-3 hours for us).  As for getting the items back, no.  Once you give them to him, they are gone.  So its kinda vital that you have the force to win the encounter, or you are going to be SOL.<br />

Thanks for any info i'm close to that final part just need Dragorn Champion and i'll be set for Krekk. Don't want to loose everything and have to redone all.<br />

<br />
With 525 svmagic, I resisted him plenty of times..but also got to play yoyo alot. I haven't parsed my log but I'd say somewhat over half of the yoyo bounce was resisted throughout the fight. He's got lots of hp, unless you have a ranger/nuker army.. I do not suggest range fights, it'll just be painful.<br />
Go in, fight toe to toe, loot your sword!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Does he dispell?  If not then DMF or SoE could help against the knockback.  Would it be wise to treat this fight as a range fight?   Keeping all that can be out of the range of the AE might be a good thing.<br />
<br />
From what I'm hearing so far sorta sound's like Tallon Zek minus the dispell's and the Shadow stepping.  Also, his room have any corners?  If he has corners, getting him cornered could help agaisnt the knock back.<br />
<br />
I am now ready to try this guy, but hate to go into it blind.<br />
<br />
Any information would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Small stupid Question :<br />
<br />
I was goofing around in Dranik today and went to check Krekk.<br />
I am not done yet for the epic (still missing Bloodfields Part)...<br />
<br />
And he Saw inviz &amp; Cons was KOS .....<br />
<br />
Anyone know if this is normal ? <br />
I didnt remember any faction hits during the quest.<br />
And i havent heard of anyone failing it yet on my server (One done, I should be 2nd)<br />
<br />
Anyone actually cons him before getting to the last step ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>HeradWO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">He always cons KOS, but you can still turn in your pieces to trigger the killable Krekk.<br />
<br />
No decent corners around him to corner either.<br />

<br />
Yes it's normal. Don't worry about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dropped him last night with 30 quite easily.  Had more problems getting everyone THERE than actually killing him as someone with Bard speed and invis aggro'd a named and never noticed it...named and about 6 or 7 mob's came into camp before we were all gathered.<br />
<br />
He is VERY doable with 3 to 4 groups.....depending on gear.  I would say we could take him with 20 or slightly less depending on What classes made up the raid.  <br />
<br />
The mob is ALL about resists, and clearing everything from the area, so if you have a bard, and can clear the area very quickly, your Golden.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">He's not overly hard.  Clearing is a must.  He doesn't dispell, and DMF/SOE helps.  It's best to fight him away from that little tower or whatever it is nearby.  He had this tendancy to warp inside it.  I was waiting for the tank to get summoned inside and ported to the zone in.  Range fighting him is totally uneccesary.<br />
<br />
<br />
This fight reminds me of tanking Vyemm...like a yo-yo. Knockback...summon...knockback...summon. It's pretty fun overall. <br />
<br />
Lanys for the rogue epic is like that too.  She dispels though.   :( <br />
<br />

I'm quite glad this guy is nothing like the Sun Revenant.  Ugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Supposedly he has AE FD as well now. I know they ninja buffed the BST final, wouldn't suprise me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I can confirm the AE FD, did him twice tonight (45 minute repop) first time the FD hit at 25%, 2nd time it hit at 40%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Venkmen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I can confirm this also.  Done the fight twice.  Once for me, and once for a guildy. Went off both times about 45% or so.</div></div><hr />

He made an emote that he was charging up and cast something on me, I think it was a slow/ac debuff, had a cleric get rid of it before I really noticed tho.

Cue many more failing FD. Good laughs.<br />
<br />
Make sure your casters know to sit/stand out of the FD - Your warrior will probably lose aggro too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">what is the range on the FD? Also did they up the AE damage from 1250 to 2000?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll double check the log when I get home, but Krekk's main AE seemed weak as hell, I believe it remained at 1250. Whirling Smash is a once off, scripted attack. Krekk has a metric ton of HP, though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>ffcnemesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">He is located in The ruined City of Dranik, pos 930 neg 1130, north west corner, with several trash adds. Kill them before the battle, buff all resis for the AoE FD, and any form of levitate. Buf with alendar and SS, even, set AoE heals if the AoE FD does too much damage.<br />
<br />
Yellow con at 70 both versions, the kos non-agro triger, and the triggered one. You can see him kos, but he is holded until you give him the 3 items. Then, he starts to attack you.<br />
<br />
Hits max about 1900, normally about 800, rares max hit (15% shielding, 2500 ac)<br />
Rampages, normal rate, but dificult to fix them cause the first in rampage list will be the warrior who triger the event, and probably the next will be a healer, so keep the tank healers away from him. 2 clerics on tank, and a cleric or a druid can heal the rampage, depending who takes them.<br />
<br />
Hps: about 800k estimated based of fights in PoTime. My battle was about 8-9 mins with 22 ppl, time+ geared. Easy kill, no deads if u are advised (no parses of hps, just my estimation)<br />
<br />
AEs used:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6119&amp;source=Live - This one is really easy to resist.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5556&amp;source=Live - Hard to resist, but interrumptable, so dont try to corner him, just keep him turning around you. Only 2 landed im my combat in 8 mins.<br />
<br />
Dead at first try, so no idea about if the encounter ends with a wipe.<br />
<br />
Good luck for u all with this mob )<br />
<br />
Edited: if u stand up quickly after a FD, dont loose agro. But just have about &gt;1 sec to do it. After a sec, the mob starts to hit anyone but you hehe</div></div><hr />
