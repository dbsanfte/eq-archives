<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any info on this please? I got level 1 and its pretty weak. It didn't show any new messages for the skill so i turned on 'attacker missing me' filter. Then after 4 or 5 mobs I saw the message &quot;tries to hit you but you block&quot;. So does it get better at level 3? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parses have shown it between 4 and 20 percent more avoidance.<br />
<br />
I think it is somewhere between those values (I doubt 20 is close to real.)<br />
<br />
The number a lot of people have been quoting lately has been 4 percent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it wasnt weak we would be forced to use shields permanently eventually which would suck. I would have rather not had it at all, but since we did get it I'm glad its weak enough that my class doesnt turn in to a knight with less dps and no spells. <br />
<br />
You cant balance around a skill like that, if it was even 10% you would have to balance every boss mobs dps to that of a warrior using a shield instead of just a defensive warrior, otherwise it would be to easy for the ones using shields, therefore using a shield would be required.<br />
<br />
The age old saying 'be careful what you ask for' fits perfectly with the whole shield block argument.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shields work great on bosses.  Just don't start the fight with them.  I use dual wield for about 60 seconds to generate aggro, then swap in the shield and never have any problems with aggro.  I would never use one to XP because our DPS is pathetic with a shield but on a raid my DPS doesn't matter.  What matters on a raid is that I hold aggro and survive as long as possible on bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice idea IMO, could be a bit more than such small %'s though :)</div></div><hr />
