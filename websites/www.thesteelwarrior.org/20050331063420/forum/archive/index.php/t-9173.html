<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Bloodfields go through the wall in middle of zone and bear left, up on the plateau.  There is a crater like area in center and Devourer spawns on the back side. From what I read killing the Girplans that spawn around the crater will cause the devourer to spawn, and if its like a lot of the epic mobs it can probably be respawned immediately.<br />
<br />
   I really like this aspect of some of the new epic fights as you can get a few people that need a mob together, gather friends and when everyone there do the fight as many times as you need to get everyone there drops.<br />
<br />
   Also the devourer has a real slow regen. We tried him with 9 Sunday, 3 war, 3 druids, shaman, bard and beast and got him to 25% before wiping. Took a good half hour to get a cleric there to rez, and a few more people to help, and he was still only up to like 80% when we rengaged so if you can get a cleric camped chances are even if you wipe you can rez and regroup and finish him off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He spawns after 4 slashers are killed.  Slashers have a respawn of like 30 mins so he can be repopped and done every 30 mins or so.  Me and another warrior did ours back to back this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the minimum amount of people you really need for this?  Im at this point and wondering how many people i need to get to do this part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slassh</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did it with 2 groups. I didnt disc because I wanted to see how his damage was.<br />
<br />
Our guild has set up optional Raid EPIC nights on offdays, and the other 11 people were wondering why I dragged them there.<br />
<br />
Of course the fight will be longer with only 6, but a good balanced crew of 6 should have no dramas. Just be smart.<br />
<br />
In hindsight, I would still take 12 because I had 12 willing peeps. If you wipe he doesnt despawn and like some of the other epic mobs, his trigger is on a whole seperate timer (like the Rhags in Ssrae)</div></div><hr />

Turned the hilt into korbuk got exp and no message..so he bugged me horray.

We did him with 6 tonight and you beter be buffed and ready to rock and roll cause with 6 it's no cakewalk like some would like to have you think.  Single group mobs that rampage for a decent amount, aoe and have a boat load of hitpoints are going to be a bitch.<br />
<br />
Btw fun as hell with 6, would recomend trying it as you lose nothing on failing.</div></div><hr />

Im a EP geared warrior almost full omens defensive 12k tank. He got a lucky round the first time we tried him.. Flurry after my defensive droped.. over 14k dmg.<br />
<br />
Druid can easly keep rampage tank up.<br />
<br />
Put 2 healers on main tank incase of lucky rounds.. <br />
<br />
Hits for 2250 with 9% shielding, flurrys and rampages.  VERY MR resistence.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razzo</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just tried him with 6 EP geared people and a boxed druid and shaman. 57% with literally only a Rogue, myself, and the SK RT on DPS. Had 2 clerics and we were doing fine until a lucky Flurry when I was at 30% health (his flurries had been missing me for the most part earlier). With another Rogue or two we woulda had him, he's not that bad. The knockback really isn't that big of an issue, you can just run right back up to him and start slashing away again as long as you have lev up. His DoT was semi-annoying, but as long as you had the first buff slot open he'd just DoT there then dispell it again.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I could kill him with 7 or 8 people, just need 2 clerics, 2 high-DPS rogues, a rampage tank, a shaman, another priest for RT heals, and myself. He's just got a helluva lotta hp.</div></div><hr />

I was at 10.5k HP, 430aa, 1800AC and level 70 when we tried this last night.  We had 22 pre-elemental toons who have not been thru VT.  We wiped cuz we tarded it up and got agro from the Enc Epic mob who is located really quite close by.  We somehow got him to 50% before the Enc Epic mob had killed all the healers.<br />
A buncha folks had to leave and we were left with 16 of same pre-elemental players.  We found a nice safe spot off to the west of his spawn and had a go but ran out of heals before he ran out of HP.<br />
So, YMMV, but he is not quite as easy as I first thought from reading this thread.  I went through and looked at the Magelos of folks who are doing with 1-2 grps and I can see why they find it easy.<br />
I'm guessing CHrot doesn't work due to his knockback so we were using faster heals, which burned hella mana on our ~10 FT team of healers.  Maybe I need to school the healers to crack a CH after each knockback, which is &gt;10 sec interval.<br />
What is the relative difficulty of the mobs in the epic for us pre-elemental folks?<br />
For my crew, i rate this Girp Devourer as 3.5+ grps.<br />
How many will we need for Krekk?<br />
How many for the champion in WoS?<br />
<br />
Any tips I can give our heal team on how to preserve mana is appreciated.  <br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">10-20-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you start, figure out where you want to fight him. Then have your healers do a range check on MT, and have everyone but MT and rampage tank at the healers. Have your RT pull to ensure they get rampage. Make sure at the very least, MT and RT have levi/dmf, and beat the tar out of it. Do a ranged fight and it may last awhile, but you have a better chance of success as your healers arent wasting mana healing and curing people.<br />
<br />
Also of note. he doesn't summon until he is at 98% health, so if he does the knockback at 99-100% you need to reposition him and yourself or it can get ugly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Location is on the SW corner of the map<br />
- We killed 2 slashers and he spawned, not sure if its a bug or not<br />
- Used 18 people (elemental), max hit was about 600<br />
- Setup due North of his spawn along the wall, there is a nice ledge there to work with<br />
- His dot/KB really isnt worth worrying about.  Lev and you will be just fine</div></div><hr />

<br />
Means someone before you killed a couple slashers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthud</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've been trying to bash this critter for a few tries, and finally got him last night.. but we had a wrinkle in it.  When we pulled him, 2 critters were stacked on top of each other.<br />
<br />
I think, great, that bug is back where multiple of him can be there, but no... the 2nd critter was a Girplan Lacerator.  Not listed or mentioned anywhere.  He's about as tough as the mini Slashers, but, when you are not expecting to deal with 2 it can be quite a surprise.  I will also add, that the Devourer was up when we arrived, and we did not have to kill the 4 Slashers.<br />
<br />
Dunno the why, but wanted to pass on the info...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BattleaxTP</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just want to Add i have done this with 6 as well.  I'm a 10500hp / 2150 ac unbuffed tank.  <br />
<br />
Group was bard / cleric / shaman / wizard / mage / warrior (me).  He's pretty doable with 6 imo.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it was said or not but he regens REALLLLY slow.  It took me two tries to get girplan down, first try got him down to 11% and due to shaman getting gflux into a mob wiped us.  By the time everyone got back, rezed up rebuff, girplan was only at 35%.  After that he went down NP.<br />
<br />
So i just recommend, get resist up, lev up, plan where you want to pin him ( i did it in a small crevice going down to the sleeping named guy)  and after that you just need CH with occasional spot heal.<br />
<br />
If you wipe no biggie because he regens super slow.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
