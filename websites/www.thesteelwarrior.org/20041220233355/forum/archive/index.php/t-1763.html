I assume you have aetaunt of course.  Flurry is another good one.  Ferocity is nice, and helps with flurry.  Stalwart Endurance helps.  Tactical mastery is a minor dps upgrade when attacking from the front.  Ingenuity is fairly worthless, but fun if you have a dd proc weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went:<br />
Fero3<br />
PB3<br />
CF3<br />
Flurry3<br />
and have saved up points to get PoP flurry 1-2-3 at once<br />
after that i will get Fury of the ages 3<br />
after that i will finish tactical mastery <br />
I heard double riposte (old and PoP) sucked ass, so not getting it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mentioned them both =p<br />
<br />
SE is actually very useful.  I have level 1, and it helps quite a bit.  TM I don't have, but have read about some.  All it does is increase your dps (attack through parry, block, dodge, riposte), but doesn't cut down on how often you are hit (when you are riposted, and TM fires, your attack goes through, but the mobs attack from the riposte also goes through, so you both get hit assuming no misses and your defensive skills not firing).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I purchased Tactical Mastery well before getting my defensive AAs. It is situational DPS (only from the front) but I think it's the most cost effective offensive AA. OTOH I tend to get more use out of it, because I duo with my shaman, or trio with a druid friend, or do other unusual groups quite a bit (so I'm a very considerable percent of the group's DPS). <br />
<br />
<br />
Stalwart Endurance is very nice too (I also have it maxed) I think that level 1 is the most cost effective though. If I had to do my AAs over again I would have gotten SE1 much earlier on and left it that way until I got done or nearly done with my defensive AAs (right now I'm working on my last defensive AAs, planar power 4-5, and I just purchased Stalwart Endurance 1-3 right before starting planar power).</div></div><hr />

I love SE3, some of the best 12 ponts I've spent. Believe I read over on the FoH boards that they had parsed about 75-80% of melee stuns being avoided with SE3.<br />
<br />
Going for Ferocity, Punishing Blade, then the crits / flurry route next. After those are maxed I'm really not sure what to do.</div></div><hr />

As an aside, I recall reading that CF1 was bugged for warriors, back in the day when Luclin was new.  It actually lowered our crit rates.  Anyone recall this?</div></div><hr />

I've never had any problems with DI at 75 CHA and no buff a lot of times.  It's much easier to get a buff than spend 15 AAs on it unless you have 250+, in which case the point is pretty much moot anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyndrusher</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what my aa setup was:<br />
<br />
did run3/regens3 (of course)<br />
ND3<br />
then PP5/PD3<br />
then on to PE<br />
then TM1 and SE1/2<br />
then CA/CS2, then finished CA3<br />
just got LR2 last night<br />
<br />
here's the plan:<br />
finish LR3-5<br />
finish CS3, then do IR 1-5<br />
finish SE3<br />
<br />
once that's done, I'll be done with defensive aa .. I consider SE to be a defensive aa since it's mainly effective when I'm tanking as a defensive measure.  Afterwards my plan, and my advice to you, is to go all out on your crit aa until you're done CF1-3, FotA1-3, Flurry, and Rampage.  I'll be doing a 1hs setup primarily, so I'll be doing ambidex after that, but if you're using a 2hs setup, then next step should be Punishing Blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rampage (good for farming greens and ae groups but how often is that?) and Fury of the Ages dont excite me too much.. Combat Fury didnt seem worth the aa's except it unlocked Flurry.  I&quot;d certainly get Raging Flurry 3 before I'd get Fury of the Ages.  <br />
<br />
Maybe its just me, but I find my agro holding ability has soared with Flurry as well as my dps.</div></div><hr />

Flurry is ok when you got nothing else important to put aa in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Max out Charisma because there is STRONG evidence that a warrior's charisma will make the difference between living and dying if you get to a point where DI is to fire.   Protecting your butt on raids is your responsibility if you can take any action to do so.   Offense is NOT your responsibility, nor is tactical mastery or anything else if you neglect that which will ensure that you remain tanking longer, and Charisma has been shown to do just that, extend your life on a DI.</div></div><hr />

Uhhhh<br />

Double Riposte adds next to nothing for DPS, and I really doubt punishing blade 1 added 20 DPS.  Gotta parse more than one fight man, because no way did those 2 skills add 20, especially not at level 1.</div></div><hr />

parse every fight thank you very much and yes it raised it a little over 20 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">parse every fight thank you very much and yes it raised it a little over 20 dps. <br />
<br />
6 AA points did not grant you a 20dps increase, especially if 3 of those points were placed in double riposte.  Your buffs were different or you were fighting different mobs.  Double riposte gives an almost insignificant DPS increase due to the nature of the skill.  Punishing blade would have to fire every round to come even CLOSE to generating 20 more DPS, and it doesn't.  Trust me, you didn't gain 20 DPS off DR1 and PB1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dostoevsky</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DUDE!!!<br />
I have been playing this stupid ass game for a long time, I think I know what buffs were used. <br />
Welcome to a 53 damage weap with a 47 damage bonus, double riposte ends up being on average 500 damage everytime it happens, instead of single riposte of 250. Punishing blade adds on average 250 dmg per time it happens, so dont tell me that there is no way that happened when it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Max hit with the windblade (50 damage) at level 63 is 332.  The AVERAGE hit, is MUCH lower than 250, it's more like 150.  You also have to hit the mob to even get that damage, another drop in your numbers (40% miss rate...sounds good).<br />
<br />
So 15% of your ripostes are doubles, which are already less than 5% of the hits on you, AND you miss 40% of those anyway, and even when you do hit, your average hit is in the 100's.  You're telling me you get an extra attack every 15 seconds with Double riposte to get 10dps?  You're full of shit.  Double riposte adds SQUAT for DPS.<br />
<br />
Punishing blade is a little different.  They don't give % increases for the levels of punishing blade in the descriptions of the skill, but based upon the other AA's, the first level is likely to be jack and shit for chance of adding another attack.  It's probably in the 10-20% range.  So 10-20% of your attack rounds you get an extra hit, with a 60% chance of that attack to land, to do an average of 150.  Once again, you land another hit every 15 seconds with punishing blade?  I think not.  While punishing blade could eventually add up to quite a bit of DPS, level 1, is no way, no how 20dps.  Think about the math.  There's no way it can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back to the subject, IMO the most important AA that aren't purely defensive, if you tank a lot, are SE and TM. I'm personally at 100 DPS now tanking, 110 when not, with about 10-15 extra DPS from TM3. SE is pretty nice too, basically turns you into an ogre if you aren't. If you are, it's probably not quite as big a win, but still nice.<br />
<br />
At this point personally, I'm going Ferocity first, Punishing Blade (the two seem to work together relatively well), then CF, Flurry, and finally Ambi. Somewhere in there I might throw in some resists and Tanaan just because I want to raise more tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say this is one of the few times that I agree with Haass lol.<br />
<br />
Anyway since you already have PE, I would train up CS1-3 before doing the rest of LR.  Not that it really matters but you will get a little bit more bang for your buck from CS/CA than LR/ID IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...to recap, in terms of best DPS bang for the buck, it sounds like folks would go with: (EDITED per below comments)<br />
<br />
Ferocity<br />
Punishing Blade (2hs) or Amb (1hs)<br />
CF3<br />
Flurry3<br />
RF/FoTa3<br />
SE1<br />
TM3<br />
Double Riposte<br />
Rampage<br />
<br />
If one uses 2hs, then PB would probably be stuck somewhere between Flurry and SE.  That about it?  I'm going from defensive to offensive AA myself and am very appreciative of this discussion thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome to a 53 damage weap with a 47 damage bonus<br />
Not sure what weapon you happen to be swinging, but MY 53 damage weapon (TSBS) sure as heck didn't get a 20 DPS upgrade when I got PB1.  I don't remember how much it was (I parsed it before and after I trained PB1... same buffs/mobs) but I can damn sure tell you that if it were a 20 DPS increase I would remember the numbers.<br />
<br />
PB1 is nice.  It adds a little DPS.  (I want to say that it parsed out around 6-8 but I can't remember for sure.  I'm positive that it was single digit.)<br />
<br />
Like others have said.  I gotta agree with Haas on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure I'd put CF3 and Flurry on top of the list as far as &quot;Bang for buck,&quot; because that's an awful fuckin lot of buck for not so much DPS.<br />
<br />
CF3 was pretty miniscule in and of itself, but Flurry was okay when I was using my 2h.  I wouldn't say flurry 1 is really worth 15 points (with the pre-req), but it's worth 3 for sure.  I guess I'd probably put Ferocity/Punishing blade first as far as bang for buck goes...because it's an awful long road down to Flurry, and everyone speaks highly of Ferocity3/PB3 (no personal experience...I could explain why I got Fury/Flurry first, but no one would care anyway :P)<br />
<br />
Edit -- oh, and Ambidex is a good chunk of DPS...~4% or so depending on your offhand.  The caveat being that you have to dual wield, and most people don't have as good a DW combo as they do a 2h.  With the new Copper Hammer/Sword of the Bloodsworn tho, Ambidex is gonna end up coming back as a necessity I think...more aggro from the offhand.</div></div><hr />
