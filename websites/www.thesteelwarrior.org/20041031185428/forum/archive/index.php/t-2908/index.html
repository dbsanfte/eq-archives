I looted one of these the other day helping a rogue friend with his epic.  This came from a spawned mob in Steamfront...Renux Isanastybithchifyournotready....don't think I spelled her last name right but hey.  Haven't used it too extensively yet.  Got it to proc a few times whens I was in Chardok, was pretty good agro against a dozen other melees...cept when the mob(s) got completely zerged and died in a few secs. Anyone else put this to use in combat and want to share their opinion on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I played around with this weapon right after the epics came out back during the kunark days.  Even then I thought that the agro it generated was pretty low.  I guess its because you can only use the weapon in the offhand, but it never seems to proc much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Banked it after about 2 hours.. DPS sux.. proc didnt generate nearly as much aggro as I thought it would.. and it was resisted alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had one of these once.  Ratio is terrible, proc is usually resisted.  Just a toy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fun to use in PvP. Nothing worse than dueling someone and be spinning arund and to have no idea where the other guy is. Doesnt proc a whole bunch but fun to use.</div></div><hr />
