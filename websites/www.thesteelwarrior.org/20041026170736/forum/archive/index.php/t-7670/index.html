<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've killed him a few times, and have always used conventional methods of killing the spawns , pulling MM to the corner .. tanking him then killing/mezzing/otanking the adds when they respawn.<br />
<br />
I've heard tale of a &quot;gimp easy&quot; way to deal with the encounter which makes LMM rather trivial.  <br />
<br />
Soooo .... if anyone is feeling generous i'm always curious of new ways to kill things in an easier fashion.  Case in point: in the Agnarr event we dont kill the named giants as they spawn, just have a bard + a few ranger team downstairs to kite them all while we burn down my lightning rod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">like ... can you pull him out of his main changers and into the hall where the repops arent nearly as intensive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think he's leashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mith Marr is leashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">alot of people kite the adds, but i dont think that makes it &quot;gimp easy&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can kite them, offtank them, use charmed pets from outside the room, stagger them so they won't spawn during the fight and really do all kinds of alternate strategies.  I think I've seen some variation for every time I've done the fight.<br />
<br />
I'm not certain I know of anything that &quot;gimps&quot; the fight really but after a few goes you'll likley wonder how you could have ever failed on the fight anyhow.<br />
<br />
Then again, we kill Agnarr last ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">People tend to glorify their posts to make themselves sound better. There's not one strat that makes it completely gimp, just makes things easier.  Timing the respawns if you kill them is the key thing.  Having your tanks with a bard is another (svM).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yup, I always have a bard in my group for him, and RD/Carpin/Bert events :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, you used to be able to charm them iirc, and the charmed cats would gimpify the fight right quick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can charm them, but the ones in his room are so MR it will break alot. If using pets charm the blue cons just outside his room. Also, the zone uses the antikite code. So no more than 10 NPCS can be on aggro list at once or charmed mobs will gate. So, if using charmed pets make sure nobody uses swarm pets and id probably kill off all the mag pets and necro pets and beast pets to! You do NOT want a charmed pet to gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How far is MM leashed? Has it changed in the last few months?<br />
We used to use the monks to kite all the cats + MM around in the bigger hall...then carefully get the rest of the raid to his little antechamber whilst not aggroing anything in the kite....then use a rogue or a bard or something to get MM to pop back in his littleroom...ranger would WS him to a corner, tank takes over, we kill MM, no worries about repops cos they're all alive still chasing monks....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not sure on the leashed distance, as I dont pull him, we have a FDer pull him.</div></div><hr />
