<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mandragor</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a die-hard soloer; I do well with groups, have been praised on my aggro and pulling skills, but I just prefer to do it on my own, most times.<br />
<br />
Any advice where I can fight without TOO much trouble, decent XP, and not have to worry about training or being trained much?  Or is my way-of-life dead after 50? :( <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bractos</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really helps to have a weapon that slows,  like a trunchean of doom that you can swap out after it procs.   Probably too low to solo spiders in velks though,  try cinderella , the chick that spawns in front of the portal into POF.   6 min spawn, low hps, and will give you xp for another level or 2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over the weekend I was doin the frenzy camp with my wife (cleric).  We both 52.  She died once when I couldn't pull a few frogs off her quick enough (I told her not to use her stupid AoEs!)<br />
<br />
While I was waiting, I found I could solo singles outside of the Frenzy pretty well.  Low drk blues.  The tougher dark blues would lead to a pretty close battle, but the weaker dark blues were easy.  Some of the dar ghoul knights got me down to single digits in health before the fight was over, but the drkblue zol knights were wimps.  Don't try soloing the ones which spawn in the frenzy camp though!  With an IVU potion should should be able to make it to the camp no prob after you kill the few live frogz after zoning into dead side.<br />
<br />
Gluck!</div></div><hr />
