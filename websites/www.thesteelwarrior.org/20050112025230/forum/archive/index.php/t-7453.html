Prolly weapons like Lammy, fast, or with a better ratio might do the trick.<br />

Loong really long ago, I used to use a Lammy with a Jagged Blade of Mourning hehe.</div></div><hr />

You're fine, stop worrying about it</div></div><hr />

Before then, if you are taunting and using the agro disc then you hsouldn't have any problems unless someone is trying to take agro or being careless. IMO, I'll taunt mobs off of the DPS or support classes, but if they keep being stupid and taking agro, they can have it. I always tell the healer in my goups not to heal anyone but the CC, Slower, and the tank. After the idiots taking agro realized that the cleric isn't going to keep healing them because they are being stupid, they usually back off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you must have a agro proc look for some kind of stun debuff.<br />
<br />
but 30-50 you can reasonably rely on &quot;dps&quot; agro<br />
<br />
also this is when the other classses need to learn to control their agro. don't be upset when a pl'ed twink goes blasting casting away at something and takes a few hits. they need to learn it now not post 50.</div></div><hr />

Depending on what server you're on, you should be able to get two of them for under 15k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're using a Lammy and a wurmy now, I wouldn't spend more than 1K total on any more weapons before you get to the point you can use CHoS &amp; Bloodsworn.<br />
Not only do you not need better weapons than what you have to hold aggro, but getting such weapons might distract you from learning how to do all the other things you can do to get, keep, and re-aquire aggro.<br />
I wouldn't advise spending any money at all on weapons until your early/mid 50s, in fact, except that you need weapons in other categories to work on your skills.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wurmy and anything, or a BABS is pretty fun for 2hs. Just use whatever for now, look for the damage/delay ratio being as high as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wurmy's are great from 20 to 40ish, at which point you can go about looking for aggro proc weapons. Up to 50+ just keep a good ratio weapon in offhand, ie Jagged Blade of Mourning, Centi LS, etc, or something with a aggro/debuff/stun proc (barny axe is decent)<br />
I would steer clear of a lammy period; I've never really had great results from one. True, they're fast, but from 20-40+ a wurmy kills them in damage, and a better ratio weapon that's slightly slower, like a 12/23 or 13/25 is better than a lammy as well.<br />
<br />
Also, if all you care about is keeping aggro, you might want to carry around a gnoll hide lariat or two. 3/20 is sucks damage, but they are aggro gods pre-50. Cheap too.<br />
<br />
And PS: If you do use a lammy, DO NOT put it in offhand. 9/19 is terrible for offhand, anything with a better ratio is preferable. Either go for slower, higher damage in primary, like a wurmy, or a faster 1hander in primary, like a lammy. Trying for the best of both worlds doesn't work, since the wurmy is primary only</div></div><hr />
