Currently i own a Windblade, Greatstaff of Thunder, Shortblade of Lightning, Wind-worn handblade, Frostbringer and severel other cheaper weapons and have been wondering if I should sell some of them to upgrade my armor, which currently is:<br />

<br />
Problem is I cant think of much to upgrade that isnt insanely exspensive so any suggestions are welcome - also, which weapon(s) would you sell out of those mentioned ?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sell all except for GSoT. Keep Windblade if you need it for DPS when you are not MT. <br />
<br />
Buy another Mosquito Leg Earring. I'm not sure what but I'm sure there is something that could upgrade your Neck and maybe Shoulders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd keep the Windblade and the GSoT.  Sell everything else, except maybe the windworn handblade, so you have something to dual wield when you get an EB weap.  Really, until you get an EB weap, you shouldn't be dual wielding at all.<br />
<br />
Upgrades?  Unfortunately, you're at the point where most of the stuff that would be an upgrade for you is no drop.  Or, as you say, insanely expensive.  There are some crafted rings, I think .. but for serious upgrades you're going to have to do a lot of raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depending on your server, you may be able to get one with some extra pp and selling those weapons of yours. You have not Maxed the Stamina cap (Assuming you get to level 65 etc...and that means 60 extra hps for your warrior :)<br />
<br />
P.S. Draconic Pauldrons (30 mins) would get you 12 more hps :)<br />
<br />
Not sure how anal you are about stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Jak<br />
<br />
Oh yah, two more:<br />
<br />
Feartouched Rubicite Arms I *believe* have more overall hps than that set up (not sure)<br />
<br />
oh and definitely check out: <br />
<br />
Chokidai Hide Pauldrons from Chardok.<br />
<br />
155 hps in that slot = 95 more than what you have currently. <br />
<br />
With that an Othmir Totem, you are pretty much done on Stamina stuff heh.<br />
<br />
P.S. You have the Plane of Time Charm slot on. Is that a Typo or what??? :) :)</div></div><hr />

P.S. Jak - The charm is what everyone with just one pop flag can attain, magelo just shows it with max stats</div></div><hr />
