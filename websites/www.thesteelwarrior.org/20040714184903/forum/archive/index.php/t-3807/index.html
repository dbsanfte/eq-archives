<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive got a good start, but I need some more info from all the parsers out there.<br />
<br />
Im trying to make a damage calculator that will account for player and mob level and attack for different weapons.<br />
<br />
Right now I think I have it pretty much nailed down for atk and weapons on the katta banker. I have been able to accurately predict DPS for any weapons combo and atk level (up to 1600ish, hard to get a 6+ hour parse with greater atk than that).<br />
<br />
What I need is a significant length parse (4+ hours I'd say) including the following info for red and blue con mobs:<br />
Mob level or con<br />
ATK<br />
Weapon(s) [note cant use same type weapon in both hands. Either use a 2h, or 2 different type 1h, or 1h + shield]<br />
Total Damage<br />
Total Damage from crits<br />
Total # of crits<br />
Total # of swings for each weapon type<br />
Total # of hits for each weapon type<br />
Total time of parse<br />
<br />
EQcompanion will provide all of this.<br />
<br />
I have been going through, and will continue to go through the other parses in this section to grab what info I can from them.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Edit: Looking for warrior parses only at the moment. I dont have definitive data on which classes are on different damage tables at this time, so just starting with warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was just thinking about that in fact.<br />
<br />
Just today I got my old excel dmg calculator up and recheck some values.  Problem I have is that 2-handers seem to give too high dmg atm compare to what we saw recently.<br />
<br />
Can you give more infos on your formula please? Can also help validate them.<br />
<br />
Let me put the numbers I use, they are estimate, and I think some are wrong (really unsure about the DW percentage for example).<br />
<br />
Dual Wield % : 0.516666667<br />
Double Attack %	: 0.62<br />
Hit percentage%	: 0.6<br />
haste %	: 0.41<br />
low hit dmg average : 0.4<br />
medium hit dmg average : 0.67<br />
high hit dmg average : 0.8<br />
Max dmg multiplier : 5.95<br />
tripple attack % : 0.05		<br />
crit %	0.05 : War crit % : 0.03<br />
Punish Blade :0.08		<br />
Ambidextery : 0.08		<br />
<br />
The low/med/high hit are to simulate different atk lvl and can be eventually replaced by direct atk.<br />
<br />
I didn't include flury yet and I don't think I have ferocity %.  Any more infos on that? WHen you flurry do you always get to try for 2 more hits?<br />
<br />
I also attached the excelt sheet if you want to look at it (rename to xls because the board can't blah blah).  Really easy to play with the numbers, still pretty basic.<br />
<br />
The main thing would be to explain why 2-handers are too low, then it should be pretty straighforward from there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Right now Im basing it on warriors with maxxed offensive skills only.  After I get that nailed down I can start changing the rest.<br />
<br />
For a warrior with maxxed offensive skills.<br />
<br />
1.80 attacks per round from main hand.<br />
1.53 attacks preround from offhand<br />
1.85 attacks per round from a 2h (due to PB)<br />
<br />
Hit percentage is based on mob/player level.<br />
<br />
Multiplier for average damage, for a level 1 katta banker, is very close to atk/450.  For example<br />
<br />
1400 atk, 16/20 weapon<br />
1400/450=3.11<br />
average hit = 3.11*16+13 = 62.8<br />
<br />
increasing to 1600 atk<br />
1600/450=3.56<br />
average hit = 3.56*16+13 = 69.9<br />
<br />
Id like to figure out the relationship between mob/player levels and hit rate, and mob/player levels and hit multiplier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are other variables that make the hit rate and hit multiplier fuzzier. Different mobs of the same level have different avoidance/mitigation values.<br />
<br />
thorbadin, DW rate is 85%, not 52%<br />
1.80 attacks per round from main hand.<br />
1.53 attacks preround from offhand<br />
<br />
1.53 total attacks from offhand per round/1.80 double attack rate = 0.85=85%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are other variables that make the hit rate and hit multiplier fuzzier. Different mobs of the same level have different avoidance/mitigation values.<br />
<br />
Mitigation? yes. Avoidance? maybe not.  I cant recall a specific mob I have ever fought that avoided noticably more hits than any other mob if its level.  Im inclined to believe that mob evasion of your attacks is based purely on level ratio and nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rajsy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can take a look at my formula/parses that I made. It takes into account single,double,triple, crits, atk(somewhat), haste, damage bonus and so on.<br />

You might remember my last thread on weapon comparison formulas. If you dont then check this thread out<br />
<br />

<br />
Well I have improved it by using data from parses now. The values I wanted to parse were dual wield chance, double attack chance, triple attack chance and some average hit values. I used EQ Companion to show double and triple attack percentages.<br />
<br />
I have all offensive AAs for reference.<br />
<br />
To measure dual wield chance I used two weapons with the same delay but different types(crush,slash). I compared the number of slashes with the number of crushes and could decide the dual wield chance. The double attack chance is shown in the parser.<br />
<br />
15 20 1hb primary, 13 20 1hs offhand in Sol Ro, 2300-2500ish swings per weapon:<br />
Dual Wield chance: 90%<br />
Single attacks: 33%<br />
Double attacks: 67%<br />
Triple attacks: 0%<br />
<br />
Warders Ornate Broadsword in Sol Ro, 2200ish swings:<br />
Single attacks: 33%<br />
Double attacks: 61%<br />
Triple attacks: 6%<br />
<br />
An interesting result to note is that PB3 does not make single hits into double hits but only double hits into triple hits. <br />
<br />
I checked some average hit percent values without avatar and with avatar and got:<br />
1770ATK: AH=0.615 (with avatar)<br />
1620ATK: AH=0.583 (without avatar)<br />
<br />
The hit/(hit+miss) ratio was 0.6 for all parses.<br />
<br />
Now that I had all these values I got to work and made a new weapon comparison formula that shows approximate DPS for a planar ranger when fully hasted.<br />
<br />
AH=Average hit percent<br />
DW=Dual wield percent. 100% for a primary weapon.<br />
SA=Single attack percent<br />
DA=Double attack percent<br />
TA=Triple attack percent<br />
Dmg=Damage for the weapon<br />
Dly=Delay for the weapon<br />
DB=Damage bonus<br />
LR=Level ratio for damage calculation. 5.7 at lvl 60 and 5.92 at lvl 65, approximately.<br />
Crit=The chance to make a critical hit. Forgot to check my logs on this one, but I guess it varies with dex so I will have to check with max dex sometime.<br />
<br />
All percent values are in the range 0 to 1 with 1 being 100% and 0 being 0% and 0.5 being 50%. I hope you get my meaning. Haste works the same in this formula with 1 being 100%.<br />
<br />
Anyway here is the formula for one weapon. When dual wielding just add your weapons together and be sure to apply the correct DW value to your offhand.<br />
<br />
Damage per second = (1+Haste) * (1+0.7*Crit) * (0.6*DW*(SA+DA*2+TA*3)*(LR*AH*Dmg+DB)) / (0.1*Dly)<br />
<br />
To simplify this a bit for comparison purposes only we set Crit=0 and haste=0 and put together the SA DA TA values for 1h and 2h weapons. This makes the formula correct only for persons with all offensive AAs. Also merge with the hit percent(0.6) to simplify as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Comparison Value 1hander = (1.002*DW*(LR*AH*Dmg+DB)) / (0.1*Dly)<br />
<br />
Comparison value for 2hander = (1.038*(LR*AH*Dmg+DB)) / (0.1*Dly)<br />
<br />
Well anyway an example for me is Warders ornate broadsword 45 35 with 38 damage bonus. Plug this into the damage per second formula with say 5% crits(0.05), 100% haste(1), AH=0.6(same as SolRo parse) and we get:<br />
<br />
WoB DPS = 121.45<br />
<br />
Assuming crit chance is 10% instead of 5%(forgot to parse) then we get:<br />
<br />
Wob DPS = 125.56<br />
<br />
This is consistent with parses as I always get about 125 DPS from my WoB when im fully hasted.<br />
<br />
Using AHB 16 19 offhand and agnarr sword 17 20 main we get if using 10% crits:<br />
<br />
AHB off DPS= 57.725<br />
Agnarr main DPS = 78.678<br />
Summed DPS = 136. 4<br />
<br />
This is also consistent with my parses as I outdamage WoB with agnarr AHB combo.<br />
<br />
Now a sword I dont own SEWS. 45 30 with DB=36<br />
SEWS DPS = 140<br />
<br />
Make of this what you will but I will use it to compare weapons all the time. If you have higher ATK than me then you need to increase the AH value some to match the DPS you will get from your weapons. The AH value can also change depending on the mobs AC.</div></div><hr />
