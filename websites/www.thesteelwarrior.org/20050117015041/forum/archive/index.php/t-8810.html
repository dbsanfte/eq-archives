<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the group I normally play with just hit 62-63 and we're starting to spend some time in BoT.  I see all the info in the library on all the BoT minis and mini-boss info and which wings they are in.  I have been in BoT before, and I know, for example, where the sand mini-boss is (forget his name, the guy that drops ornate plate greave mold), but I don't know where the others are.  My maps don't have the info, I can't find a map on eqmaps or alla's.  Any idea where I can find locs on these guys or a maps showing where the ph's are?  I think we have been camping Oreen Wavecrasher's spawn point, is it in the room by where you click up to tower in the east wing?  We have spent probably four hours there and no pop though, so I'm starting to wonder, are we in the wrong spot?  Also, about how often do the named pop, 1 in 5, 1 in 10?  Worse?<br />
<br />
But hey, I got a GSot4W!  An Auliffe raid had one drop and I guess no one could use, so one very nice person helped me train up to there and I died right as I got to corpse to loot, but they were able to get a cleric up there with pacify and res me to get it!  Some people are way cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i wanna say an Krieger*sp* can be a PlaceHolder for a named. in my experiance, about 1 in 4 or 5 is named...all pretty randome tho.  and the loot usually just plain sucks...that ring of thunderspirits or an SP usually...but that shoudlnt keep ya from trying =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah, like 12 hours!?!?!<br />
<br />
I see.  So the 65 named don't have placeholders, they just pop every 12 hours on the teleporter, and the krigers are placeholders for the other named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">6 hour respawn for level 65 named. And west wing mini named pops in the bedroom, not the teleporter room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The towers also have uncommon named mobs with kriger placeholders.  You can get other pieces of ornate from them that most people do not associate with BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">6 hours, ok, that's not bad.  So worst case if you sit there for 6 hours you're going to get a pop.<br />
<br />
What is this talk of an evil dispeller?<br />
<br />
So in the tower any kriger is a placeholder for an uncommon named and they can drop ornate?  How common are ornate drops off the uncommon named and how tough are they compared to the minis in the wings?<br />
<br />
I also was able to loot an enchanted ring of torden off Auliffe along with my GSot4W, and have 2 gems now, so almost have a tower key, so if hitting krigers in the towers is a good place to possibly get ornate I'll give that a try.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the information.  I can always count on people here to provide a wealth of info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that the non level 65 named (read: level 64 and under) drop ornate most of the time, but they can drop different pieces once in a while. Ornate bracer mold being the most common one I've seen. The tower bosses drop a piece of ornate everytime I think, while the wing bosses almost never drop any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a BoT guide in the library payn i think. Can go check it there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the west wing named with PH kriger is a dispeller, hence he's almost always up, people hate killing him.<br />
<br />
In the towers, krigers are fairly common mobs.  The uncommon named mobs have specific spawn points with placeholders, who are also krigers.  So no, you cannot just tell which spot in the towers is a placeholder as you can in the lower wings.  You have to learn the spots by making the named spawn.<br />
<br />
Edit - this thread in library (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3143) lists the tower named and wing named.  It's fairly complete although I think Kuanbyr's tower is missing one named mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, those 65 named are mean.  Well, mean for a level 63 warrior with no defensive AA's with a group of four others level 62-63.   :)   We went up against Hreidar last night.  First pull was a disaster, got him to maybe 95%, couldn't get him slowed at all.  Second time got him partial slowed and were doing great, then bam, big dmg spike with those 1000dmg procs, or whatever they are he does.  Had him at maybe 80%.  Third time got him slowed, was doing great, but cleric was lom and had him at 60%, but another dmg spike got us, but we wouldn't have had the mana to finish him off anyways.  Throw in a couple dps classes or a dps class and another cleric and it might have been doable.  Need some more levels and aa's and some gear improvements I think.  Would probably help if I moved my 65 wiz off the same account as my war also.  :)  Are the regular named as hard as the wing named?<br />
<br />
Nice thing was another group of four was near there and rezzed us to the room next to him and we combined forces and took him down.  We had some trouble with the pacify pulling and ended up with him and a kriger, and since our enchanter is only 62 and they had no enchanter I offtanked the kriger.  Was a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regular named are roughly the same as krigers. IE no AE's, but they still can have those 1500 pt procs, which suck. If you're gimpy on the tank / healing side of things, BoT named get absolutely munched if you can run a charmed pet for the couple of minutes of the fight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defensive aa's help a lot against the level 65 named. My first time in BoT I was level 63 with 0 aa's and we had to recruit a 65 pally in the zone to come tank gaukr for us. Now I can tank him with minimal heals it's such a joke. I guess the fact that I have 2300 more raw hp than I did back then helps as well :D<br />
<br />
edit: oh most groups I'm in don't even bother trying to slow the level 65 named sometimes, they are so freaking resistant the risk of pulling agro by chain casting isn't worth it. However if I get a ton of procs off early I tell them to go hog wild til it lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warthor</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 4 wings.  north, south, east, and west.  There are 2 names in north, but the only one I've ever seen is Laef windfall, he is the boss and spawns near the CY teleporter, dropped a flowing water staff last night, sells for 60k, lost the roll, LOL.  Mini bosses have no PH, they just pop in front of their respective teleporters every 6 hours.<br />
<br />
South is the best wing for names as there are six of them.  Go in the first room, then left up some stairs, and then right up some stairs.  You are now at the &quot;Tables&quot; named for the tables which are right in front of the name PHs (krigers).  Safe spot is in the corner where no mobs spawn.  Names here are Thangbrand and Ymir Stormseer, kriger PHs.  Up to the left from here is the &quot;Forges&quot; where 2 more names spawn.  There is no safe camp here, so either clear the room below them and pull to there, or pull all the way down to the tables camp.  Names are Thorolf Sutherland and Valbrand and their PHs are krigers or the occasional jord far.  Keep going past the forges and you enter into a great room at the end of which is the earth boss Gaukr Sandstorm.  Instead of taking a left and going to Gaukr Sandstorm at the end of the room, go straight across to the opposite side.  Just down the first stairs is the PH for Rorek Steelthorn which is usually a kriger but can also be a militis.  Last of course is Gaukr Sandstorm at the very end of the main room.  There is a very safe spot to pull to in the left corner from the teleport pad.  This is a great camp for warriors because at 65 you can single pull the whole room without any adds.<br />
<br />
East has the easiest name to get to  Eindride Icestorm who is just up the left hallway from the first room, you can pull him to the courtyard after clearing only 2 mobs, kriger PH.  Keep going to the very end of that hallway and in the last room is Riodhr Torrentwind.  Kriger PH as well.  If you take a right when you enter and go all the way up you will get to Oreen Wavecrasher, the water boss.  He can be pulled after clearing only 2 corner mobs.  Pacify other mobs and pull him to the corner.  The teleport is right behind him.<br />
<br />
West is the easiest camp to get to, just go up to the top of the stairs and start pulling.  All the way in the far back right side are 2 names with kriger PHs.  Wybjorn can be pulled to the camp at the stairs and killed there but you better rush the room for Hreidar Lynhillig, the west wing boss, because he gates.  If you clear to the left side from the main camp you will wind around right to the teleport room. No names spawn in here but there is a little room off to the left where Torstien Stoneskin spawns, kriger PH.  You really should rush his room because he debuffs and gates.  Keep casters at longest range possible and they won't get debuffed.  Forget about melees because it is a fast 2 slot debuffer, just rebuff after the fight.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 druid which I park in the safe room to track.  Once you know where all these names are it is pretty easy to get there.  Just /ooc a campcheck and then throw together a group and /ooc moving to &quot;name&quot; camp.<br />
<br />
Travelling is fairly easy because you can invis to almost anywhere in the mini areas (not the towers).  There are a few caveats though.  Do not get too close to krigers or names as they will see you, running by is pretty safe though.  Do not stop and stand in one place too long while invis because you can be de-invised by little storms that pass by.  Finally be careful if running by elementals as they will see thru invis at times.  Thats because they are used as pets and when they revert back they can see invis.  If you see one of these carrying swords RUN LIKE HELL!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks much, that is some good info on the named spawn locs.  Last night I was pulling the east wing to the courtyard and noticed the kriger to the left was easy to pull.  Up pops Eindride Icestorm.  Down goes Telen.    :(  Of course another group took him before we could re-engage.  Ah well.  I box the cleric also and I think my healing strategy was just bad.  As soon as I got him to camp I threw on a supernal elixir, it hit right as he started to hit me, then I started a CH, but he hit me with a huge dmg spike including a couple 500dmg procs in there right in a row that dropped me about 1 sec before the CH hit.  The slow landed and stuck right after I dropped.  I didn't have fort/furious up, had a tough two mob pull earlier of two militis (chanter only 62 couldn't mez), so had popped it, so had to just use defensive.  Should I just spam supernal remedy until the named is slowed?  I am sure we would have been fine if I'd just had furious up.  The group was able to run him around and get him down to 60% without even tanking him.  Ah well.  Krigers are super easy for me to tank, haven't died to one yet.  Was really disheartening to die to Eindride and have another group drop him after we'd slowed him and everything.   :(<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, and  later on we were pulling the west wing on the stairs and had two mobs, we were doing fine, had one mezzed and under control, but chanter had pet also, so three mobs there.  Suddenly out from behind us comes an elemental with swords, and it's on the cleric, and at the same time the chanter pet breaks so the enchanter can't mez the mob on the cleric.  Cleric DA gets interrupted, and cleric is stunned and dies.  I think someone let go of their pet and it was wandering home or something and came by and ate our cleric.   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's better to have elixir land before the mob makes its first hit.  You can start casting elixir as soon as your warrior gets into range (this is not too hard to do while 2-boxing).  But when healing is really tight like you described, it is an even better idea to use the cleric's AA hotkeys.  Divine Arbitration is your oh-shit-warrior's-gonna-die-now button, it's instantaneous and zero aggro, and you should interrupt your CH to use it if the first heal isn't going to land.  When you just want an elixir and don't have time to cast it, use the Celestial Regen AA instead, as it is instantaneous cast and also no aggro.  Also, if you know that a named mob is the next pull, throw Vie on the warrior, and even a DI if you can afford the reagent cost.  When a mob is tough enough that you barely survive with disciplines, it is definitely tough enough to justify DI - and get a charisma buff from the chanter/shaman to go with the DI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Two corrections: Divine Arbitration takes 0.75 seconds to cast. It's the fastest direct heal clerics have, but is not instant cast.<br />
<br />
Celestial Regen does generate aggro, but not a lot since it's a heal over time.</div></div><hr />
