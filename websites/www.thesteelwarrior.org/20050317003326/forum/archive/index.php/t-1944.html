<br />
I asked some questions a few weeks ago and appreciated everyone who contributed their feedback.  We have the opportunity to try the Cursed cycle last week and we had a little problem. <br />
<br />
We spawned Glyphed and killed him without problem. Then while setting up for Exiled / going over strat we must have taken too long because he depopped.  We thought the depop time was 30 minutes but it must have been more around 22 minutes because we didn't anticipating him depopping on us until it was too late. <br />
<br />
So we are now going by 20 min for Exiled and Cursed until depop. Can anyone tell me a good way to keep them up longer than 20 min? I am told that Exiled DT's so is it possible to keep Exiled from depopping by throwing him someone to eat? If agro'd will he despawn?<br />
<br />
I don't want to accidentally blow the spawn again so any and all information is welcome.  <br />
<br />
Another thing... If you do blow the Cursed cycle because of depop does it still respawn in 6 days or is it sooner? If sooner do you know of the respawn time?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

I do not know how to spawn that on failed cycle since I have never see anyone fail on it, but probably by killing all TMs and Rhozth(s) mobs that are up. I wouldnt take more then 15 min between engages. No one should die on glyphed, except maybe MA. Exiled DT about every one min, so about 5-7 dead I'd say tops and those shouldnt be mana clases so your recover between kills should be minimal strategy should be definatley be in place before you do them, but then again those are luclin mobs so strategy is stick MA on it and heal him not much else really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, this is the thing about cursed cycle.  You have to move fast, waiting around taking 2 hours to buff to try the second mob in the cycle wont work.  Buff up, engage cycle, rez/buff people as they die, but for god's sake man, take only what time you need to take to finish loot, then pull the next one.<br />
<br />
Exiled is the hardest of the 3 in the cycle, though, cursed takes the longest to kill.  Make sure you have a 3 or 4 tank line up, as he DTs every 2 minutes,  and yes its like 22 minutes or so for depop.<br />
<br />
If you get caught in depop, or fail an encounter, you have to wait 2 hours to spawn the cycle again (the time it takes for TMs and Rzoths to respawn), you then have to fight Glyphedclones, and Exiledclones, that drop no loot, but otherwise have the same stats as their brothermob.  This is just to fill the cycle, nothing more.<br />
<br />
So, if you kill Glyphed and Exiled, and fail to cursed, if you want to wait 2 hours to try him again, you still have to rekill Glyphed and Exiled, though, without loot.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you just wasted too much time sitting around, you cant do that on these type of events, you have to keep at them.<br />
<br />
Dont wait till 5 minutes before a kill to talk strat when your on a timer.  Before you engage TMs and Rzoths, talk strat, so you dont have to spend an hour between kills.  Make sure everyone knows what to Expect from all 3 fights, BEFORE you engage glyphed.<br />
<br />
If you have to stop after every mob, and hold everyone's hand, you will fail every time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgor</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rhotzh / TM and warder are on 2 hours respawn time .<br />
<br />
so if you wipe on glyphed / exiled / cursed  you can just do  the cycle again, as said before. by killing all 7 TM 2 Rhotzh and 1 warder. But of course the mob you already killed will spawn in a fake version (glyphed --&gt; runed . exiled --&gt; banished ) with no loot but with the same abilities .<br />
<br />
Once cursed is dead the second Rhotzh will not spawn for 6 / 7 days making impossible to trigger the basement event .</div></div><hr />

I personally wasn't in attendance but am just hearing how things went after the fact.  I want to make sure this doesn't happen again so the info you guys posted will help motivate us for a next try.<br />

Thanks for the help,</div></div><hr />
