My warrior's gear is far superior to my clerics but I 2-box 99% of the time &amp; my cleric only has mana problems if the rest of the group is being total morons.  I have 200k to spend &amp; here are the magelo's.<br />
<br />
warriors...  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1030537<br />
<br />
clerics...     http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1045551<br />
<br />
if you look at &quot;coming soon&quot; in my warriors magelo you can see upgrades I've thought about. Those upgrades would net me +80AC ( I'd lose 6hp in the process ) I estimate it would cost about 100k for the upgrades I listed. Would I see a noticable tanking difference going from 1495ac to 1575ac? Or should I focus more on straight HP upgrades or blow the 200k on my cleric &amp; get him to flowing thought 15? If I went with straight hp upgrades I think I could maybe get another 200hp at best on my warrior. ( any hp upgrades at this point are very expensive )<br />
<br />
any input would be great<br />

(btw I play on FV so everything is droppable here )<br />

Go ahead and do your planned upgrades, there will be a noticable improvement with 80 extra AC.  Most importantly though, get some AA points =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go for AA on the cleric =&gt; you save your money for your Warrior (primary toon) when he will reach lvl 65 you would probably start to upgrade him even further because of the drop rule in FV server: Moreover as a bot your cleric won't need good gear, just is lvl (upgrade him to 65 to get a little more mana) and is AA will be suficient.<br />
But if you still want to go for upgrading your cleric's gear , don't run after FT15 but focus (even a 10% mana save focus on is healing power will give him more than going from FT9 to FT15).<br />

I had a 62 warrior twink on a different server w/ mostly cultural gear &amp; some ornate, he had about 1100ac or so &amp; the same hp &amp; the tanking difference between the 2 characters is like night &amp; day. I remember being killed on my old warrior by an unslowed golem in POV in under 5 seconds. With Gnowm I can tank HOH mobs unslowed with ease. The only mob I've found so far that can really tear me up is Krigers in BOT.  I'm 1/2 way to 65 now, then on to the tanking aa's..I'm sure my results will improve once I get the basic aa's under my belt. <br />

Mark of Retribution<br />
An 8kpp horse<br />

Yes, they're all on the cleric side.  A L65 100AA cleric is an enormously powerful toolbox, it's not just a heal-bot.  Your warrior is and will always be your cleric's pet, no matter what upgrades you make to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2box a Warrior and cleric too about 99 percent of the time. Normally I give preference to the Warrior. I would say though the biggest upgrade over 80AC would be to one hit 65 on both of them and start getting AA as fast as you can. I think that will be the biggest upgrade to your tanking ability. I would try to get the cleric to FT15 if you can and personally I recommend farming hard LDONs if you can for gear. Unbuffed my AC is only 1429 and raid buffed I get up to 1500+AC and 9700+HP and have tanked most of pre-EP and do just fine. I am trying to raise my AC but not being on FV and not in a real raiding guild or EP flagged guild it is abot the best I do. I tank hard LDONs and GOD trials and extras just fine 2 boxing all of it. I would worry more about your level and probably try to get your HP up some too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnowm</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">too be honest its a pretty crappy combo. No snare, no port, no evac, NO INVIS, no FD pulling etc etc. Warrior is the most one dimensional class in the game followed closely by cleric. War/Cler isnt too bad till 60, after 60 the dps of the combo is just too low to exp efficently. Almost any 2box with a melee is gonna be not so great 60+ but I'd say pally/shammy or sk/shammy would be best 60+   <br />
   The best thing about a cleric/war combo is you have 2/3 of the vital classes for an exp group. When I log on I can make a group literally within 2min. The whole reason I started this combo is when I reach 65 I wanted to do some of the older content with the least amount of people possible &amp; a warrior/cleric is by far the 2 most vital classes when doing hard content. <br />

slow, snare, all that is in the toys man</div></div><hr />

<br />
See ? Probably non.<br />
Parse ? Probably yes.<br />
<br />
If you want to get a HUGE tanking bonus, get the LDoN 10AC augments from Mistmoore 510 points.<br />
<br />
As for the droppable, i logged on FV 10 minutes to check the bazaar.<br />
Gave it up, too complicated &amp; too crazy.<br />
<br />
For the cleric if you want to boost him : FT15 &amp; Spell Casting Mastery 3.<br />
The rest is just extra bonus :)<br />
<br />
Best Combo is Warrior/Shaman for duo.<br />
But Warrior/Cleric has the huge advantage of beeing the core of any group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnowm</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True there are alot of toys that warriors can use for slow,snare, invis etc. The problem is alot of them are very expensive &amp; extremely unrealiable. Its unwise to depend on a snare proc when a runner would mean a train &amp; a wipe. Slow weapons are generally very bad DPS weapons so your losing DPS while praying for a proc etc etc.  <br />
    If you plan to play casually warriors are BY FAR the worst class to play in EQ. The very very small inate difference in tanking between a warrior &amp; a knight is COMPLETELY not worth all the utility you give up for that tiny tanking advantage. Warriors shine when using def disc &amp; if your truly playing casually def disc really isnt needed on any exp mobs. Although if your really playing casually I would have to say that no melee class is a good option, the way the game is set up ( on all but the FV server ) any melee in the absolute best bazaar equipment would be about 30% as effective as their time geared conterpart. I'd say that ratio is alot closer to 70-80% with a pure caster ( with skill the most important factor as opposed to 10% skill 90% gear for melee ) <br />
    <br />
   Now back on topic, EmiliaEQ I do plan on grinding out some of those 10AC LDON augs once I hit 65 &amp; get some of the basic tanking AA's. I just dont think the sub par exp I'd be getting there would be worth it until I reach my short term aa goal.  Plus I rather grind out the LDON augs on hard level for better exp better loot &amp; more points but I dont think I can handle those mobs till I fill out at least some of the tanking aa's. <br />

<br />
Cleric's gear is just fine.  Get him/her a horse, tho.  You'll notice a BIIIIG difference.  It was like night and day going from a horseless bot to a horsed bot.  I highly reccomend getting divine arb, all ranks of it.  In fact, I'd get 3 aa NOW and buy at least rank 1 of it!  Then go back and get your SCM3, HA3, HG3, RC3 and CR.  Those are very powerful tools for a cleric.  And, if the price is not insane, get them some ornate boots, mana pres is very nice to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a horse + a little bit of FT will go a long way for the cleric ... in the end nothing else matters other than that unless you plan on botting your cleric through content much more extreme than your average run of the mill groups<br />
<br />
warriors are entirely gear dependent, so blow your wad on your beefy tank after you get a horse and maybe 1 or 2 ft items for your cleric.  everything will sort itself out in time tho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As just a combo Warrior/Cleric is not very good. But just as someone else sad I look at it as a BIG advantage that I can see in detail how hard I am getting hit and know my character like I do I know when I need to heal or when things are going bad and I need a faster heal. I can see the spell casting bar and know how long before the heal will land and know if I need to stop a CH and go for quick heal or even DA. Like I have been in a real bad 5 pull in hard LDON and if it was not for me playing both the War and Cleric there is no way we all would have lived. Cleric with a quick DA cause I got hit fast, Celestial Renewal, then AOE heal, and then DA to save Cleric and then on Warrior AOE taunt as soon as AOE heal goes get good group agro from that and Furious into a Defensive as soon as that is over. Gave chanter enough time to mezz the 4 adds. There is no way to time all of that right if I did not play both so as a DUO is not that good but as the core of a GROUP works real well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...so as a DUO [warrior/cleric] is not that good but as the core of a GROUP works real well.<br />
<br />
I consistently (i.e. for both XP groups and raids) hydra a WAR and a BST.  They can barely solo at all (most recently, I had the BST pet tank while the WAR shot arrows from range, and when the BST ran out of mana to heal the pet, the WAR /defensive and stepped in so the pet could hit it from behind.  Yah.  Warrior bow damage &gt;&gt; all), but they make an *excellent* part of an LDoN group.<br />
<br />
With BST/WAR I can slow as early in the fight as I want to; on normal LDoN's, I will often pull with slow.  The BST's slow aggro lets me pump the WAR's aggro via Taunt, and being able to watch the BST's combat situation in detail lets me know when I need to intervene more directly with the warrior, and when I can let the BST tank until a Taunt succeeds.  Oh, and I don't have to watch for the slower's &quot;mob slowed&quot; message so that I don't taunt after a resisted slow.<br />
<br />
We're just on the verge of moving into Hard LDoN's now (WAR got CA3 and an Anger III aug last night), and I'm not sure how well this will continue to work.  I know I won't be pulling with slow, in any case.  But at least in the content I've done so far, WAR/BST makes an excellent seed around which to grow a group.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<br />
However,warrior/cleric is a great  foundation for  group finding at all levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistikat</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda off topic, but anyone got a suggestion where to level my baby 2-box cleric ? He's 53 and I want to maximize his XP with minimal trainage ( *sigh* ) and I have my 65 warrior to tank for him.  Any places spring to the front of anyones mind as a great spot to PL / 2-box and not worry too much?  Thanks ! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Optimal would be to get earthshaker and head to PoN. If you could get a few wizards and some chanters, you could split the cost of the ES and shakerpagepbaoe PL or AAlevel the whole lot..... <br />
<br />
Failing that I would think that the &quot;hot spot&quot; zones would be best for exp. <br />
<br />
Failing that you might try the Guards to TT in PoN as they are undead cleric might get some spells to hit them not sure though ... might have to get others to group with you though, but they pop fast enough. <br />
<br />
You could head over to Tactics if flagged and at least have a chanch at a polished gem stone worth like 14Kish each kill, but those mobs is tough to solo.<br />
<br />
Then there is the whole Taris Tull Zone, all the front side mobs are undead, but you might need more dps or more healing or both, dont need slowers or CC cause they are immun... and again you have a chanch to get the ivory skull worth over 10K on eadh kill....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really dont have problems boxing cleric/warrior (and chanter and 3 wizards). Divine Arb is a life saver get it fasts.<br />
<br />
Basically CH is usless more times then not. Once you get yur duration AA and the extend healing shield your HOT spells will last 7 ticks. Put Elixar on the Warrior and have yur social for SR on the warrior ready to press when HP hits like 50 percent or so. Mana regen is really critical for cleric and horse in number one for that, but the ornate wrists, solist ear, some neck items and I use that ldon mainhand claw with regen 2 aug or something will all add ups...</div></div><hr />
