<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I ws wondering where a lvl 46 org warrior can solo? I am a little bit of a twink with some regen gear and potions, so where should i hit it up at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll be interested to hear if you can solo anything that will give you exp at your level. As I moved through my 30's and into my 40's, I became increasingly convinced that I needed to have a healer grafted to my back.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the equipment that you have, you might succeed at soloing bloodgill goblins in LOIO. They have about 60% of the usual hit points for mobs of their level. Unfortunately, LOIO has a bad experience multiplier, so it might not be very profitable. You might also like to try frogs at either zone line in Lower Guk, as they hit very weakly for their level, and should be just barely blue to you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Microxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">in DL, there are 2 or 3 caves with Yeti or something. They don't hit as hard as anything else in DL. I was able to run back and forth from 2 caves to minimize down time on spawn rate. Drops also went for a good price in bazaar. <br />
<br />
I soloed there till 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I found the Taskmaster camp in Echo Caverns to be decent experience until 51/52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>smfannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">y solo, but Lower Guk safe hall for soloing, grab your buffs and split the spawn and then try to keep it split and xp should come rolling, Velketors is the shit but if you can avoid falling and soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have a snare-weapon, Kobolds in SolB are good for 45-50.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Where is the Safe Hall located?  I have heard mention of that several times and would love to give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's at the base of Lower Tower, right before you get to the x-roads that split off to the frenzied camp, ghoul lord, and slave camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Elroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I solo'd in the caves in Thurg through my mid 40's...was a while ago..but maybe you want to con a few next time your in Thurg.<br />
<br />
if you can and have better than starting faction with the dorfs..<br />
pull mobs to top of caves...icewell is close for a quick escape..the guards will help you if you have the faction..<br />
the mobs didnt hit to hard iirc drops were ok too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Echo Caverns underbulks and aliens are pretty easy to solo at that level. My gear isn't quite as good as yours, but I was able to mow through the blue cons there fairly easily and with minimal downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hey all,<br />
<br />
   I have been soloing Frost Giants in Great Divide. Everything but the Elites. I can usually get 2 scouts and a berserker before i have to med. and that is only getting down to 30 - 45% health. If they have a procin weapon. <br />
<br />
Someone asked why solo? Well i ask why not. I get probably 3% exp per kill much better than if sharing it with a group. And if i don't have a LDoN group then i am getting exp soloin. It's my goal to hopefully find a solo spot till 63. Then its just insane to try and solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>evilsofa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I recall in my high 40s low 50s doing Bloodtribe mobs on the northern edge of Scarlet Desert, using Greig's End zone as an emergency exit.  There's a corner to the west of GE zoneline that doesn't get wanderers.<br />
<br />
I was able to truly solo the mobs there with no help, presuming I single pulled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I solo'd Sol B kobolds in my mid 40's, having 2 at a time stops runners if you can manage it.  I moved to doing bugs and bats for my low 50's (still in Sol B).<br />
<br />
The zone has had a little bit of a revamp though and now theres a few semi-named that you have to avoid as they're a bit nastier than the average dog.<br />
<br />
Remember to /bug Kobolds casting SoW inside everytime you have to chase one too far.</div></div><hr />

Yeah kobolds are easy.  I'd say any old world zones are cake if you are twinked.  They hardly hit for anything and now that you can bandage to 70 that helps alot.  Just where ever you do it make sure you pull them down a hallway some so when they run you have some leeway.  If in solb I would recommend pulling close to one of the sola zone lines.</div></div><hr />
