<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laiina</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realize this thread is mainly for melee DPS, but thought it might be of interest to post my 65 Clerics'. (magelo 884343 if you want to see complete stats).<br />
<br />
2 hour span on the Exterminator VIII in Ak'Anon (the level 40 with something like 6 million HP). This guy is perfect for weapon tests, as he is pretty much unkillable, and he only hits you for 1-3 points, so you can get stats from 100% combat. I primarily used him for comparing various weapons and types of weapons on my Ranger, but was curious what a cleric would do.<br />
<br />
No buffs of any type. Using the clerics summoned hammer only, no nukes:<br />
<br />
Total DPS: 27.27<br />
Hammer damage DPS: 9.63 <br />
Process effect DPS: 16.52<br />
<br />
For info, I had a short run (about 20 minutes), of max buffs for dex, haste, and str - for that short period she did just under 41 DPS.<br />
<br />
Feel free to delete this post, just posting for general interest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Not too bad for a cleric :eek:<br />
<br />
 In 20 minutes I managed to get him down to 96% HP .....</div></div><hr />

If someone feels like re-parsing we can make a new one, but pulling the sticky outta this for now, and copying it to the library.</div></div><hr />
