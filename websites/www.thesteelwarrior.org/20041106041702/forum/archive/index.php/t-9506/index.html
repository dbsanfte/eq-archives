<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is my current situation, I just sold my BoC cause I needed to pay back a friend so now I have 200k and windspeeder (my only source of haste).  I am wondering if I should buy an Edge of Envelopement and get tribute haste till I can get a haste item or aug or get Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance to go in my mainhand and continue to use windspeeder in my offhand?<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo, any input would be greatly appriciated<br />

EDIT:: Its really a hard decision cause with the 2hs I would get less ripostes and all but my guild is doing ssra alot and hategiver/BF may not be to far in the future so SoMW seems like a viable option.... I dunno thats why im asking hehe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, one of the big advantages of a Haste Augment, is that you can move it with you to another item if you get an item upgrade. I think someone mentioned they go for about 400k or so. Depending on wether or not you ave an item with the appropiate augments slot and all that.<br />
<br />
I dunno what a Sword of the Bloodsworn for the mainhand would cost you these days, but I think it would suffice for group tanking until you get better ... heck, you could go and camp it for that matter. Might be worth it if you can get it cheap tho.<br />
<br />
Possibly get a couple of Anger III augments too (or the Ykesha ones) if you feel aggro is shaky.</div></div><hr />

so your suggesting that I get the 2hs and a cheap 1hs to hold me over?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sort of - I thought of just getting a cheap 1H'er (or camp it) and hold the plat until you can get a haste augment. And then afterwards, consider other upgrades, such as the 2H weapon and stuffs.<br />
<br />
Offcourse, don't take my words for absolute wisdom and all that, see what others think first before rushing off. Besides there may be other angles on the problem. After all you have a Guild to back you up. Maybe one of the other warriors have a 1H you can loan until you get something better.</div></div><hr />
