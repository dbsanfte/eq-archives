<br />
He has a 2.6 processor(intel), gig of memory on 2x512 sticks(he wants to upgrade that more too, so 4 slots would be good), 9800 pro etc.. anyways his current motherboard just crapped out and he needs a new one quickly... one he could find at a place like fries electronics store.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">damn near anything MSI, ASUS, DFI, ABIT, AOPEN, etc. look through newegg's selection, you might find a few good ones that you can buy locally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use an Asus P4P800, not top of the line, but it's a damn nice/stable motherboard. 4 ram slots with dual channel capabilities, onboard gigabit LAN card. Holds the p4 800mhz chips. Can probably get one for cheap now a days as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, just about any brand will do; just try to stick to one of the major brands that were listed previously, and try to not go too low end.   The better boards tend to be easier to set up and maintain.  The old saying, you get what you pay for applies to MBs.<br />
<br />
Since there are so many different  models, chipsets, sockets etc, I reccomend you decide what features you want and pick a few models  that meet those needs.  Then go to a site such as http://www.tomshardware.com/ and search for the models you want via the price grabber service.  Nice wayt to get hardware.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am fond of MSI products, and use a MSI 865PE Neo2  motherboard with  a 2.8 GHz pentium with 1 G Ram.  I think this may fit your needs not sure.  It has been a while since I bought it, but the chip set is a good match for your speed of chip, the later ones do not get you much more unless you want the new PCIExpress socket for the new graphics cards.  The better MBs also make updating MB drivers easy. <br />
<br />
With that graphics card, make sure you have a godd power supply.  Again a name brand such as Antec, preferrably 400w.  If your power supply is weak you can get some odd behavior that at times is not obviously the power supply.</div></div><hr />
