<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>freller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am considering which weapons I should choose for aggro. I current have (now, don't laugh) my epic and Sword of Nochular for aggro using 1hs weapons, Greatstaff of Thunder for 2hander aggro, and Ornate Greatblade for DPS. We are just now taking down the gods in Plane of Time. So, I wanted to get input from other high end warriors as to what I should exchange my DKPs for. Basically, I already have a DPS weapon and I need something that will set me up for very nice aggro. There's the 1hander versus 2hander issue that may cause more damage to the wielder or less aggro, etc. At this time, I cannot tank a time god, but maybe in a month or 2 I will be able to. <br />
<br />
So, here are some weapons I have in mind, and please do add your comments, suggestions and even other weapons that will work!<br />

Any idea what I should save for to be most effective? Using 1handers will cause me to take on more damage through rispostes and mob procs, yet the BoW will proc less often. I just want to make sure I am getting a wise weapon for aggro control, since my current setup is lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the general consensus is the BoW is the best aggro/DPS weapon we get. You'll have to weight what you think your chances of getting one are versus you chances at 2 good one handers. <br />
<br />
If you go the one hand route, I'd say Edge of Eternity + whatever else you can get, although I think I'd personaly go with the Etereal Destroyer for the fun of those few crit procs ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>freller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, we haven't killed RZ in months, but we do time every other day pretty much. I'm sure we'll do RZ sometime, but the chaces for an aggro weapon are leaning more toward Time loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bonk wandor on the head and loot his alt's gear :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>freller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I smack Wandor all the time, but that seems to have little to no effect! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get the 1HS from RZ in PoTimeB...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>freller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey, is Rallos Zek (Time) on Tier5 level? We almost have Tier4 complete.. .soo close, it ain't funny. Personally, I'd love the Edge of Eternity and Ethereal Destroyer. However, if I get the BoW, then I won't care for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Take a Corndog hammer. We still do him pretty often and we have gotten a pretty good amount of them so you probably won't have to wait very long to get one. Or pray for a BoW.<br />
<br />
BTW Shik - its only getting worse, and Freller is partially to blame since he has been my ethereal sheet supplier ;)</div></div><hr />
