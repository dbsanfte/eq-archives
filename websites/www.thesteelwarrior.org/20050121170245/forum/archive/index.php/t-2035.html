<br />
Cursed Cycle - Glyphed and Exiled both drop Corrupted Strands of Mana - Grats Rot.<br />
Btw our monks hated that encounter, after a dozen or more Cursed the first time he dropped fangs for our monks (we got 2 bloodfrenzies and 3 ranger 1handerS).<br />
<br />
But the biggest disappointment was emperor loot.<br />
Personally I cannot complain as i got the only good drop - a torque of the wyrmlord to replace my NToV neck (Runed Fang Necklace).<br />
But the others - 2 friggen horse bridles ?<br />
We had a horse bridle drop in the past from Grieg and once before from emperor as well.<br />
I have no idea what the SoE developer and QA was smoking to let that go through but a horse should never ever drop from a snake.<br />
In about a dozen or close to that Emperor kills we have exactly 0 robes, 1 caen, maybe 1 ft4 boots and 3 horses.<br />
Sure we got some 2handers, 1handers for the metal wearing melee classes, almost a half dozen rings but that is just plain wrong.</div></div><hr />

Seru can ride around out in DSP if he chose...makes sense. Grieg too if he felt like it.</div></div><hr />
