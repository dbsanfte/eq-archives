<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inkred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My main is a 50 Ranger on Stromm server. Let me tell you being a Ranger sucks :(. I have a great setup of gear. Sow is about the only thing that is going to be hard to give up. I just started a Barbarian Warrior. Twinked him out with a bunch of my ranger gear. Such as Sword of bloodsworn, and some pretty decent mid-level armor. Also wearing a Regen I ring that works great at newbie levels. I gotta tell you... so far this warrior is kicking some major ass. The sword of bloodsworn procs at level 1, and even though i dont get full use of all the stats im hitting for 20 just about every swing. I know people say that if you twink a character you do not build up your skills. Iv been fighting like yellows and reds, and it takes me awhile to kill them. I feel that im averaging out. Ill have to find out at later levels. If all goes bad i can always have a cleric or shammy friend heal me against some lame mobs, and just let the mob beat me for hours to build defense.<br />
<br />
Actually i just wanted to say Hello to all the fellow Warriors out there, and let you know iv come to your side.<br />
<br />
Getting sick of my ranger cause i draw to much agro, and i gotta constantly snare or i get yelled at. Id rather have a more kickback job, and do the yelling at Rangers. Every character iv ever played iv been very good at keeping agro. Iv been an SK, Bard, Ranger and i always somehow seem to be able to steal agro from anyone if i want too. That is why i think i am going to be a kick ass warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Normally I would recommend to snare after the mob has been smacked on for a while but before they start to run, like 50-20% depending on how fast they are killed.<br />
<br />
For all your yelling at Rangers needs: <br />
<br />
&quot;Put away the goddamn high aggro procing weapon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Snare damnit!&quot; <br />
<br />
Those two will knock most of them in line.<br />
<br />
However if they do not listen, then push every mob into the wall or behind a tree and also swing the mob around so they eat a few ripostes until they get the point.<br />
<br />
Should you need more than this, specifically on raids, then make sure that the ranger in question dies and make some ranger down jokes. This normally pisses them off to the point that they make it their prerogative to &quot;show you&quot; how well they cannot get aggro and do their job.<br />
<br />
If that doesn’t work then you add their name to the DT fodder and EE maker lists and wash your hands of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, you see a ranger trying to be an aggro machine, get the cleric not to heal him. Taunt after he dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">another good trick is when a ranger wants to go apesh!t with aggro; put your weapons away and yell things like &quot;Hai-YA!!&quot; and &quot;Avenge Me!&quot; and &quot;Damn You; YOu wanna fight? Fight ME!&quot;..<br />
<br />
be a monk. punch and kick &amp;whatnot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Holding aggro takes no skill with a class with the ability to do so, loosing aggro is the skill in that area :/ <br />
<br />
Enjoy your overtwinked fun killing the 4 year old content - it'll get tougher soon enough.<br />

Boy am I feeling grouchy for some reason :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when are you not a crotchety old grouch val?   :D you remind me of my uncle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not that I like to discourage anyone from doing anything they really want to, but I have to agree with Valeris somewhat.  Most good rangers know how to NOT get aggro,  whether they are strictly using their bow, or meleeing.  Jolt is a lower level rangers best friend.  Lose the procing weapons.  Never snare before 50%.  It's not really something to be proud of to be able to take aggro from a warrior.  There is not one Overlord on this board that will say they can hold aggro 100% of the time, especially if a Knight, Forest Stalker, etc... is TRYING to take it from them.  Any well played class knows their particular roll.<br />
<br />
Also, warriors are NOT a solo class.  There will come a point where even the LBs will make you think twice about engaging them on your own.  The reason being PLed at the lower levels is so bad is because warriors live and die and get groups by the group skills they acquire.  Aggro generation as a warrior is not innate as Valeris stated.  You need to learn in groups how to deal with the MoB's and the other classes you are playing with.  I don't care if you could steal agro as a SK, bard, or ranger.<br />
<br />
And unless you are just wanting to be DPS, which is not the reason most of us became warriors, being a warrior is not the most layed back of classes.  I don't really have the time to go into all that a good MT does.  Make a rogue if you want layed back.  As a rogue there's not a damn thing you can do when the warrior losses aggro and the MoB starts beating on the slower, or there's an add that needs to be OTed because no mezzer, you just keep on backstabing.<br />
<br />
I have a cold, that's what must be making me grumpy, Valeris is just normally that way from what I can tell :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am? <br />
<br />
Oh dear :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think Val is grumpy more realistic in a straight forward way.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just wanted to add to what Varaho said about the ranger pulling aggro thing.  You're using a sword of the bloodsworn and wonder why you keep stealing aggro?  What the hell do you expect?  I'm not saying this to be offensive, but learn to play your ranger and it might be more fun for you.  I have had to instruct plenty of post 50 rangers on what spells to use when and of course, the &quot;for the love of god why are you using a weapon with a high aggro proc?!?!?&quot; lecture.  Get past those hurdles and see if you're still constantly stealing aggro.  And if you're going to continue to play a warrior, be prepared to have aggro constantly stolen from you and to be unable to do a damned thing about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just wanted to say I agree with putting away the agro weapons etc... but as an ex-57ranger I can tell you... you are at 50... 1 level away from experiencing a whole new ranger world.... jolt kicks ass.. and after that cinder.. then jolting blades.. trust you me.. with those spells you should be fine...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;and yell things like &quot;Hai-YA!!&quot; and &quot;Avenge Me!&quot; and &quot;Damn You; YOu wanna fight? Fight ME!&quot;..&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking of keyboards ... mine looks great with all that mountain dew I just sprayed on it.<br />
<br />
LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Warriors aren't a laid back class.<br />
<br />
When I play my cleric, I can hit a macro every now and then and easily hold 2-3 conversations while pulling. The better equipped the group is, the easier this becomes. <br />
<br />
When I play my warrior, I can't type for tells except when the mob's near dead or in between pulls. I need to ne able to hit taunt at a moment's notice, or need my keys free to move around and mosition the mob, or to go chasing it cause some chanter from the shallow end of the gene pool thought it was a good idea to tash and slow the mob from across the room cause doing it from melee range &quot;scares him&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hell, playing a ranger is easy by comparison. All you have to do it jolt, snare once mob's at 50% and use non-proccing (and hence CHEAPER) weapons. The only reason not getting agro as a ranger *appears* hard is that most are played by idiots who like that frostbringer &quot;for the extra dps from the proc&quot; and feel offended when told to bag it because &quot;they never get agro with a paladin&quot; and why are you such a crappy tank anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Agreed Deadalus. Lots of people make the mistake of thinking tanking is a mindless activity. Just dealing dmg is far more layed back, losing aggro is a hell of a lot easier than gaining it..(monk, fd: ranger,jolt: rogue,evade) as a warrior especially.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Please tell me this post was made as a joke.  Warrior class laid back?  Seriously, you better just retire your warrior now and go back to the ranger, gain a lvl, get jolt, and around 40% of a mobs life jolt then snare.  Yes jolt THEN snare, so many rangers wanna get aggro from snare first, and then jolt.  God, I think I hate rangers more than pallies.</div></div><hr />
