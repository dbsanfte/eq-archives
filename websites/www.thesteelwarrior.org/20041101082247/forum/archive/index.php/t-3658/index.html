<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, i'm having trouble deciding...Like i mentioned before, i have a BoC with Anger3 in it. I've been trying to decide on what to use with it, and actually already decided. But now i'm facing a much bigger dicision.<br />
Here are my choices:<br />
<br />
- Curse-Smelted Long Blade (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23839) <br />
with Anger 3(600 aggro from Miragul's), Pristine Emerald of Harm(+2 damage from Takish), and anything for the first slot(type1, any suggestions)<br />
I can get this soon enough with the adventures i do. At least hopefully it will look different since not many people will have it ;) And of course it's high DPS<br />
-  GBoS (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17368) This one will be doing slightly less DPS then the one above, but more aggro since i will have 2 procs in it. However i can't do this alone so it will be much harder to get. In the last 5 or so raid kills one hasn't dropped, and i will have to do this with some friends. I don't plan on getting it as a raid loot though.<br />
 - Bloodfrenzy (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13242) Well...the first 2 are not a really big problem, this is where it gets really tough. I can get a bloodfrenzy when it drops, so far we haven't seen any in a few cursed kills so it should be coming up soon. I've wanted this sword all my life, before PoP anyway. And i still do! However, here's the BIG problem. In 1-2 months we'll most likely be doing RZ. Of course BoW won't drop the first time, i don't know if we'll *ever* do him enough times for one to drop. And i don't know if i'll be getting one if i just got a bloodfrenzy in the last few months. <br />
<br />
So, basically it's either get one of the first 2 options and wait for BoW, or get the 3rd. Also, to all you BoW users...do you ever use 1 handers once you got it? I mean, if there is a reason to use them, then bloodfrenzy might be a good idea, but if there's no reason i probably don't want to be taking one since it will only last me a few months. Could pass down the BoC, can't do the same with bloodfrenzy though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My advice ... go for the LDoN weapon for now Gir.<br />
<br />
You know you can get that hassle free. And it's just adventure points. Something you can always get more of.<br />
<br />
Cursed has been notoriously stingy with us thus far (no fangs yet either, one ranger weapon but enough pants to clothe an MC Hammer reunion tour).<br />
<br />
Regarding BoW vs. BF ... take whichever comes first.<br />
<br />
We'll do Rallos more than a few times. His loot's good. And if you haven't noticed, we got a LOT of flagging ahead of us.<br />
<br />
I just seem to think you'll get more chances at a BoW than you will Bloodfrenzy only because we always seem to get the caster loot dropping cursed.</div></div><hr />
