What I am trying to find out is if farming BoW is actually worth. The arguments are:<br />
<br />
 Does the EB proc on BoW proc more or less often when compared to DW'ing other EB weapons?<br />
<br />
 Would the increased DPS from BoW generate more agro than DW'ing two EB weapons?<br />

 How much damage from riposte is avoided when using BoW vs DW'ing two EB weapons?Thank you very much!</div></div><hr />

1. and 3. I was going to do today, 2. takes a little more work.<br />
<br />
1. I will parse the BoW proc rate with DEX ranging from 150 to 305 later today, on the human mob at the far end of Netherbian Lair (who cons green to 65 and has about 20-25k hp) even though I'm 99% sure the BF+BoC combo procs a lot more than the BoW.<br />
<br />
2. I will try to have myself using BoW, and another warrior using BF+BoC attack the same mob, with same offensive AA skills, same DEX (305), same haste, same ATK, and without taunting. Would be nice if anyone had a static, non kos PoP exp mob that could be used.<br />
<br />
3. Well I don't need 2 EB weapons to parse riposte rate, but i'll use a 15/19 and a 13/20 to make up for the BF+BoC weapon delays.<br />
<br />
Should be noted that if someone is going to parse BF+BoC proc rate over a decent length of time (on the mob I use, or Bloodmaw or something), your DEX should be included<br />

<br />
riposte dmg has been nerfed far as i can tell, but still, if you are trying to single tank something past 3min defensive disc, i would switch up to a 2her, even epic 2h. should have established solid agro by then anyway.</div></div><hr />

No it will not, especially if the BoW warrior has PB3. It might if the BF BoC war double procs on the inc, but the BoW warrior will get the aggro back.<br />
<br />
BoW is the best aggro weapon in the game, you don't need to parse to know it, and no one that wields a BoW and has had experience tanking with it will say otherwise.</div></div><hr />

Blade of War however is just so much of a DPS increaser if you have all the right AA that there is no reason to really ever go back to 1h weapons, hopefully they will give us a reason to be able to use one handers again, but for now I will take the 50% increase in DPS that BoW dishes out and not look back.</div></div><hr />

To the original poster:  You don't need parses.  Here are the simple answers to your questions.<br />
<br />
Does the EB proc on BoW proc more or less often when compared to DW'ing other EB weapons?<br />
Answer:  It doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
Would the increased DPS from BoW generate more agro than DW'ing two EB weapons?<br />
Answer:  It does.<br />
<br />
How much damage from riposte is avoided when using BoW vs DW'ing two EB weapons?<br />
Answer:  It doesn't matter.  If you avoid one more riposte from a 3k hitter, you are the win.<br />
<br />
Done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ainmer is right, nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No parsie, no farmie. <br />
<br />
Plenty of people saying it's better for aggro and plenty saying it ain't. I think there's a natural psychological tendency to overvalue this weapon because it's HARDER to obtain and drops off of a mob that gave great emotional satisfaction to every guild that killed him for the first time. We always tend to ascribe more positive qualities to anything associated with such events. <br />
<br />
Which is to say: there's a strong psychological bias inherent in comparisons between any loot dropped off of RZTW vs. AoW/Cursed/XtC.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ainmer is right, nuff said&quot; isn't the sort of parsing data that can lay this argument to rest. Even Crystara's post (which at least provides more valuable information) lacks parsing data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't know a single warrior who has a BoW and uses anything else to tank with.<br />
<br />
I had BoC+HG before BoW, and it was a definate jump in agro. Whereas before my agro would be somewhat shaky and easy to lose, the BoW is dead on.<br />
<br />
That isn't to say it's perfect. It's a 2h and when in defensive mode it can really take a few extra seconds to get agro locked in, but once it is you're not going to lose it.</div></div><hr />

I agree on the point of not needing parses, but Vova has specifically instructed the guild (warriors mainly) to obtain this information to prove our point(s) that a BoW would very well be worth putting Rallos into a farm-status.  Vova is very methodical and information-based, so he wants hard evidence.  It would be nice if Rallos would have dropped at least one BoW for us during our flag killings so we could test it to Vova's required extent, but we have not had such luck.  We have all our warriors now with BoC's (I was the last to get one in the guild but I'm the guild gimptank :p), but only one Bloodfrenzy and no HG's.  <br />
<br />
So that is why we are turning to you, the tanks of the Steel Warrior, to help us obtain such information and prove our request is worthwhile for the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">well this parse is shorter than I wanted but our raids are starting now.<br />

(Fennin/Xegony).<br />
<br />
For many encounters there isn't just one 'this is the best period' answer.  That's what makes the game interesting.<br />
<br />
On a tangent that's what makes elemental armour so broken. =/  Pre-Elemental 4 people I know, a warrior, a monk, a rogue, and a bard had vastly different ideas of what made up good gear.  The Warrior wanted hp &gt; all, the monk wanted regen capped, the rogue wanted the highest atk possible, and the bard *boggle* wanted the most AC.  This led to vastily different gear choices, now?  It all leads to elemental. *bleh* I hope time restores some of the trade off choices the game used to have...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's better than dual wielding EB weapons, if you have to have everything proven to you with parses, then get your own bow and parse it, because I already know its better, and I have better things to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">maybe yours is suped up, mine dont proc that much either. the problem is you need a BF in main hand and either boc/hg in offhand. in xp groups the dw holds agro over me fine, defensive tanking something uber, the BF hate procs + all the additional swings is better than bow for agro. why is this a prob? BF just doesnt drop enough and everyone and their brother is trying to kill cursed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">People who have the weapon know they don't have to parse, why waste our time when we have the weapon, saw the big difference with our own eyes?<br />
<br />
<br />
Common psychological bias. When something is more rare (the BoW) humans tend to ascribe more positive benefits and a greater value to that item. <br />
<br />
In experiments conducted by many psychologists across many different age groups, this effect is always seen. In one variation of the experiment, test subjects were asked to rate the flavor, quality, and tastiness of two different jars of cookies. The first jar of cookies had ten cookies in it. The second jar of cookies had just two cookies in it. <br />
<br />
&quot;The cookie in short supply was rated more favorably than when it was one of ten. The cookie in short supply was rated as more desirable to eat in the future, more attractive as a consumer item, and more costly than the identical cookie in abundant supply.&quot; -- Cialdini 1984.<br />
<br />
Identical cookies, two vastly different reactions to them depending purely on scarcity. I'm sure the test subjects would have replied, &quot;but I tasted the difference with my mouth. How dare you tell me that the cookies are the same!&quot;<br />
<br />
That's what's going on with the BoW. Guilds work LOTS harder to kill RZTW and therefore there's a natural tendency to justify that work by assuming that RZTW loot is superior to other comparable loot. <br />
<br />
Parsing is necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Parsing the number of procs/minute does not take into consideration the added aggro from DPS. Aggro is not a tangible number that you can parse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ouch, feel sorry for you guys that you have to put up with a bonehead like that :p<br />
<br />
If he refuses to listen to the advice of the experienced warriors posting above then I guess you have no choice but to either come up with some parses yourself or find a guild with better leadership.<br />
<br />
Btw, you dont really need to have a BoW to figure out what riposte rate it would have.. any 32 delay weapon should get the same rate of ripostes, so you can do that yourself.<br />
<br />
As for parses well:<br />
15 min sets on a certain banker:<br />
<br />
BF primary/non proc offhand = 44 EB procs<br />
BoC primary/non proc offhand = 28 EB procs<br />
BF primary/BoC offhand = 73 EB procs<br />
BoW primary = 31 EB procs (and I have several 40min xegony parses that confirms that a 2 proc/min is what you can expect with BoW).<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, please do not make the mistake to think that proc rate is the only thing there is to agro. As noted above the sheer ratio on BoW is a very significant part of its agro.<br />
<br />
Before i got my SEWS I used a crow footed lance(32/20, no proc), because by virtue of its ratio it held better agro than a BoC/AHB combo and was better DPS/less riposte damage.<br />
<br />
Also, since you mention that you only have 1 BF in guild, thats even more reason to farm some BoWs, because BoC's are utter crap compared to BF's.<br />
<br />
Anyway good luck with it :)<br />
<br />
PS: We have 5 BoWs in guild currently. Several of those people have BF/BoC combos as well, and exclusively wield their BoWs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Parsing the number of procs/minute does not take into consideration the added aggro from DPS. Aggro is not a tangible number that you can parse.<br />
<br />
Yes it is true. I know myself that BoW is better at keeping aggro than BF+BoC. Reason for why I wanted to provide parses to all 3 question in the first post, is to end the discussion on those 3  ONCE AND FOR ALL!!1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Let's put Timmok's data into a table: <br />
<br />
A = 900/44 = 20.5s between procs = 2049 aggro/min<br />
B = 900/28 = 39.1s between procs = 1073 aggro/min<br />
C = 900/73 = 12.3s between procs = 3414 aggro/min<br />
D = 900/31 = 29.0s between procs = 1448 aggro/min<br />

<br />
<br />
A = DW: BF + random 1h<br />
B = DW: BoC + random 1h<br />
C = DW: BF + BoC<br />
D = SW: BoW<br />
<br />
<br />
In aggro procs ALONE, the BF + BoC combo out-aggros the BoW by 235%.  That's a huge margin. <br />
<br />
Does an extra 100 DPS make up the difference?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was being facetious. Until we derive the formula for aggro-via-melee I am going on proc info alone. <br />
<br />
We don't know if damage-via-backstab has an entirely different aggro multiplier from damage-via-slash/kick/punch. This is a part of the game that is not transparent to us. <br />
<br />
This is quite transparent, however: <br />
<br />
A = 900/44 = 20.5s between procs = 2049 aggro/min<br />
B = 900/28 = 39.1s between procs = 1073 aggro/min<br />
C = 900/73 = 12.3s between procs = 3414 aggro/min<br />
D = 900/31 = 29.0s between procs = 1448 aggro/min<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, more than one warrior has stated that in &quot;aggro competitions&quot; between a BF + BoC warrior and a BoW warrior, the BF + BoC warrior was able to hold aggro off of the BoW warrior. <br />
<br />
Anecdotal evidence plus hard parsing evidence of procs is telling me that the BoW is overhyped and overvalued. It's not the first time that the EQ community has overvalued weapons or items simply because of rarity and scarcity. Tink bag vs. Nag bag. Box of Abu Kar. DE Illusion Mask. <br />
<br />
The list of items that are grossly overpriced (in terms of effort to obtain or price paid in game currency) is quite long. We are not good consumers from an economic standpoint.</div></div><hr />

Vova, make a poll here on the boards. Make it : &quot;Is the BoW worth farming to get our warriors out of dual wield?&quot; with a simple yes or no choice.<br />

<br />
Polls suck. If you ran a poll a few years ago that said &quot;should we farm nag bags for our guild monks?&quot; on monkly business, you'd see an overwhelming vote in favor of doing so. Psychological bias means that the BoW is overvalued, especially in THIS community.</div></div><hr />

Are you familiar with the concept of opportunity cost? How about churn and decay?<br />
<br />
Given the choice between four EP molds and a chance at a BoW, I'll go with the molds.<br />
<br />
Given the choice between farming Xegony keys and PoEb keys and a chance at a BoW, I'll go wit the keys.<br />

we DO raid 20 to 25 hours a week. nevermind what the hell it says on the front page. we DID raid more when we were in VT. but we no longer do, and now we're in elementals we are lucky to raid for 4 hours a night (5 to 6 days a week, depending on many things).</div></div><hr />

But you have one warrior with BF + Boc, the rest have BoC + one inferior tanking weapon.<br />
And you can't tank properly in the ele planes with BoC + SoD or AHB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">IF you dont want &quot;WASTE&quot; your time farming RZTW (2h raid at most).<br />

<br />
Stick with BoC+Piece of Shit. Your missing the point Vova.<br />
Maybe BF/HG or BF/BoC or HG/BoC will agro more than BoW.<br />
But thats not the issue.....<br />
<br />
Lets see ....<br />
How often does cursed pop  ? <br />
How many guilds farm him ?<br />
How often does he drop the BF ?<br />
How often does XTC pop ?<br />
How many guild farm him ?<br />
How often does he drop a HG ?<br />
<br />
And now ....<br />
How often does RZTW pop ?<br />
How many guilds farm him ?<br />
How often does he drop the BoW ?<br />
<br />
Ask yourself these simple questions ...... you should realise that<br />
<br />
1) RZTW is a PAIN to Farm<br />
2) RZTW is ALWAYS up to Farm<br />
3) He isnt FREE LEWT<br />
4) He actually DROPS the BoW often (More often than BF or HG)<br />
<br />
So lets see ....<br />
<br />
AVOIDED mob with small loot table VS CONTESTED gimps with huge loot tables.<br />
<br />
Sure the RVR isnt worth it, i agree 1000% on that.<br />
But dont you dare tell me &quot;we'll get BF or HG + BoC for everyone&quot; caus its impossible.</div></div><hr />

But you get what ? at most 1 Cursed / 1 XTC per month ?<br />
On Cursed BF seems to be RARE<br />
On XTC HG seems to be VERY RARE<br />
<br />
Thats a LOT less than the 10-15 RZTW (if TR/Levi/Vex dont reflag).<br />
RZTW has 6 loots and drops 2 every kill....<br />
<br />
People rarely kill RZTW more than 3-5 times.<br />
So they say &quot;WTF BoW is like RARE, we didnt get any&quot; .......<br />
Wanna know how many Cursed/XTC kills i've seen without BF/HG ?<br />
<br />
RZTW is SHITTY RVR. <br />
But its the most avaible (in both drop rate &amp; competition) EB source in EQ.<br />
And it drops THE BEST EB in EQ<br />
Sure its the hardest source, but its there, and drops more often than people think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Point of information: Vexare has not killed RZTW yet. <br />
<br />
Also: Leviathan kiled RZTW about 14 times before they got a single BoW to drop.<br />

<br />
So, Vova, you'd rather spend the hour to kill AoW or XtC (takes an hour to move there and buff), than spend this same hour to kill RZtW?<br />
<br />
AoW takes us 30 minutes from raid-start time. <br />
<br />
XTC takes very little time as well. We AE our way there.<br />
<br />
RZTW takes a long time, and we've run into script bugs that make this a higher-risk fight than it needs to be. RVR NOT THERE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">So you guys just suck at Rallos, and don't want to go back and try to farm a mob you're not even sure to be able to kill?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Valoran on Maelin killed RZTW 2 times, and got 3 BoW.<br />

Novae on Karana killed RZTW ? times, and got ? BoW<br />
<br />
I have seen 1 Hategiver (/wave kildace) in 10-15 XTC kills<br />
I have seen 2 BloodFrenzy in 15 Cursed kills.<br />
I saw 2 BoW in 7 RZTW kills. Thats all personal experience.<br />
<br />
Maybe Levi had bad luck it happens.<br />
But i'm willing to bet  RZTW BoW ratio is a LOT higher than XTC HG or Cursed BF ratio.<br />
<br />
BoC+Something isnt enought, you need 2 EB.<br />
And the other 2 are SOOOOO RARE.<br />
<br />
I would have the same problem if i were you.<br />
But i think RZTW despite the shitty RVR is worth it.<br />
Just because XTC &amp; Cursed have pathetic drop rates, and are very contested.<br />
Despite the calendar (which doesnt ensure the mob will be up)</div></div><hr />

Vova, so lemme ask ya why u think molds are all that? sure its a nice reward to the player base. its eye candy. but when it comes down to it you dont really need anything but flags, strategy and the personel to progress through the planes. as someone leading raids you want to maximize your margin for error. its your opportunity to rise to the occaison or fall on your face. most upgrades are marginal, upgrades over time are cumulative. dunno how your reward system works, but if its a system where gear is sprinkled out among the player base then the single best upgrade you can get a warrior is a BoW. If you are going to stack some tanks then perhaps outfitting them with raex &gt; BoW. <br />

We are severely lacking in gear. <br />

<br />
Of course some of the easy minis in PoFire/Water you can do dualwielding, so as long as you farm those I guess you can get by, just think you will run into problems later on the big hitters.<br />
<br />
But sure, maybe the extra gear can help on RZ fight.<br />
<br />
Personally I think RvR on RZ is just fine. Takes us 1 hour to kill and 10-20 mins to clear up the adds and do loot afterwards.<br />
<br />
Sure there are some sucky drops, but BoW/Mask/Earring are well worth it. The neck is crap though :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Just injecting some stats from a guild who farmed the f**k out of RZ...<br />
<br />
20 kills he dropped 9 BoWs or a 45% drop rate.<br />
<br />
http://raidpoints.bloodofro.com/mobs_history.php?mobID=158<br />
<br />
Given the overall gear of the guild in question you will not survive many encounters until your tanks have better aggro gear.  At the moment BoW is the best choice.  Is it the only choice? No, but  risk/time vs reward it certainally is. RZ script is start to finish 72 minute encounter.  This is from zone in to T-loc out averaged over our last 10 kills.  72 minutes for a 45% chance of upgrading MT of your choice significantly beats the rewards of fighting down to a mini and getting yet another set of elemental arms.</div></div><hr />

You've already been told the argo output is better in almost all cases, and the warrior durability while tanking with a bow is better then a dual wielder in all cases. Just what the fuck else do you need to be told?

<br />
Actually, there have been conflicting claims on the aggro portion of the listed BoW benefits. That's the whole point of this thread. <br />
<br />
As for durability, that's a solid argument and the main reason it's a potential farm mob at all. <br />
<br />
A weak gm is worse then any turnover you could hope to have. You don't have to beat that point into our heads over and over with each reply cause we already know it.<br />
<br />
If you only knew. =) It's easy to attack someone when you don't have any concept of them except a few posts on a board. This was a cheap shot and not based in any fact or observance whatsoever.<br />
<br />
A strong guild leader knows how to evaluate items and determine whether RvR is present in obtaining those items. On the RvR totem poll, the BoW is near the bottom. We can obtain more essential guild upgrades in less time in other zones. Only if nothing else is alive does this make sense at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Kbam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Until SoE decides to lift the covers off the secret aggro formula, trying to make a definitive argument concerning the aggro value and risk-vs-reward of certain weapon set-ups is not possible.  There is only one hard piece of data we know for sure:  the Enraging Blow proc is worth 700 units of hate.  We do not know with absolute certainty how much hate is generated by damage done (1 unit of dmg &lt;&gt; 1 unit hate), the hate values for various procs(stun, knockback, etc.) or whether the delay of the weapon factors into generating hate (seen strong arguments on both sides).   Add to it that the hate component generated from damage is going to vary widely depending on the AAs of the warrior using each weapon.  Trying to assign any type of reward value to a weapon using only hard data when the components and modifiers of the aggro forumula are unknown is pure folly at best.  When hard data is lacking you have to go off the experiences and opinions of those who are using the weapons every day and those opinions have been stated over and over.  <br />
<br />
There are very few instances where a decision can easily be made by just looking at and comparing numbers.  The best leaders do not blindly follow the numbers on spreadsheet; they are one factor to be taken into consideration.  If you wish to disregard the experiences from leaders of the community then so be it and good luck with doing the elementals with your BoC army.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But if you had read my (now) numerous posts on the subject, you'll see that I'm evaluating it from a number of different perspectives. The only place the BoW comes out clearly ahead is in riposte avoidance and AC. <br />
<br />
Resists: BoW loses<br />
Raw HP: BoW loses<br />
AC: BoW wins<br />
Riposte avoidance: BoW wins<br />
RvR: BoW loses <br />
Opportunity cost: BoW loses<br />
Guild advancement: BoW loses (right now, given our gear picture)<br />
Aggro Procs/min: BoW loses<br />
Total Aggro: Who knows. Some warriors in the EPs on this forum have said that BF+BoC out-aggros the BoW. And some say it doesn't. Nobody's conducted any rigorous taunt-offs, however.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Kbam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Vova, several of those factors you just cited are either irrelevant or based on incorrect assumptions.<br />
<br />
Resists:  Irrelevant.  If you don't have your key people with bards for resists by now I'm wondering how you got as far as you did.<br />
<br />
Raw HP:  Again irrelevant.  While there is a slight loss of HPs, giving up 25-50hps to reduce 3k+ ripostes is more than an acceptable trade-off.<br />
<br />
AC:  Again irrelevant.  While nice stat to have, whether or not one weapon has more AC than another has zero relevance in my decision-making process unless both weapon are equal in dmg/delay and proc.<br />
<br />
These three areas are minimal concerns at best and assigning any weigt to them in the decision-making process is about as important as how much CHA a weapon has.  I also noticed you happened to conveniently omit DPS from your analysis; a BoW will out-damage a BF/BoC combo by at least 50%.<br />
<br />
RvR and Opportunity Cost are both based upon faulty assumptions.  <br />
<br />
Actually going to stop with this now.  It was already obvious from your previous posts that you're not a melee class player.  Took a look at your Science of War page and it is apparent that those in charge are casters and that has a large impact on how you will see the value of weapons.  Actually, given that you were trying to factor in resists on the value of a weapon speaks volumes.<br />
<br />
You came in here set in mind already that BoWs are not worth the risk/reward to get.  You have stated as much and all the posturing you are doing at this point is to appease the warriors in your guild to make it look like you are conducting a logical argument of why BoWs are not worth it.  No argument, no matter how well presented is going to change your mind.  If I were to go to the shaman's board and ask their opinion on a matter and the overwhelming majority of are a certain opinion, I would thank them for their time and input and take it to heart, not press a case of why their collective experience is incorrect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh we do, when it really counts. <br />
However, on fights like Solusek Ro having a bard in range of the AE puts an undue burden on healers. Best to have the bards OOR. And we all know how bards love to get onto rampage when a rampage hole is created. They don't always survive for an entire fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raw HP: Again irrelevant. While there is a slight loss of HPs, giving up 25-50hps to reduce 3k+ ripostes is more than an acceptable trade-off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raw HP has to be built slot by slot. There's no way you're going to convince me that 50 raw HP is irrelevant across every slot. <br />
<br />
AC: Again irrelevant. While nice stat to have, whether or not one weapon has more AC than another has zero relevance in my decision-making process unless both weapon are equal in dmg/delay and proc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, totally relevant. Look at the sticky in this forum. AC is important in evaluating gear. No single piece will give you much AC, but you don't get to 2k+ AC by dropping 25 AC per slot.<br />
<br />
No argument, no matter how well presented is going to change your mind. <br />
<br />
Wrong. If I could find a couple honest warriors (one with BF/BoC and one with BoW) to conduct an aggro contest on a high-HP mob (that elf dude in FoB would be perfect) then I'd start farming this coming week. <br />
<br />
However, warriors in this thread have said that the BF+BoC out-aggroes the BoW. And warrios have said the opposite. Given the natural tendancy for bias introduced by scarcity, and the result is that the aggro picture is NOT clear at all.<br />
<br />
I were to go to the shaman's board and ask their opinion on a matter and the overwhelming majority of are a certain opinion<br />
<br />
I wouldn't. Dude, 80% of the people who post to that board are idiot newbs. Don't overestimate the value of the community. For every solid poster like Ainmer and Raaj there are 10 blithering idiots. Same goes for any class board. (Yah, I'm sure you think I'm one of 'em.) And I did not start this thread. I merely came here to steer it away from blind assertions of BoW superiority that are not backed by factual, scientific observations. <br />
<br />
You know astronomers used to go to jail for asseting that the earth was NOT the center of the universe. I fully expected to be villified when I barged into the warrior community and said, &quot;prove it.&quot; Your reactions are predictable and understandable, but you cannot deny that there ARE ways to test these weapons.<br />
<br />
The reason reason ya'll ain't taking a shine to me is because you don't like hearing what I have to say. Again, read up on the scarcity principle and how it affects human decision making. You are NOT being logical in valuing the BoW.</div></div><hr />

RZTW, however, has some mediocre boots, a mediocre collar, a nice mask and a nice earring in addition to the BoW. Given our gear picture (not the same as YOUR GUILD's gear picture) it doesn't make sense for us to kill him as a top priority.</div></div><hr />

Raw HP has to be built slot by slot. There's no way you're going to convince me that 50 raw HP is irrelevant across every slot. <br />
<br />
What is the primary purpose of the weapon slot of a warrior? Compare that with the primary purpose of all the other slots. What is the damage/delay of a warriors breastplate? How much aggro do his legs get him? All of the OTHER slots besides primary/secondary are equipped with hp, AC, and resists in mind. Any of those stats are simply bonuses on items that go into a warrior's primary/secondary slot. weapons are chosen for 2 primary reasons: how much DPS do they do and how much aggro they create. Anything else is very, very much ancillary.<br />

Again, totally relevant. Look at the sticky in this forum. AC is important in evaluating gear. No single piece will give you much AC, but you don't get to 2k+ AC by dropping 25 AC per slot.<br />

You aren't here to get information with which to form an opinion, that opinion has already been formed. You are here to argue your point.

If they hold aggro better and live longer, I could give a shit about DPS. There are mobs we can farm to up DPS. DPS was never a warrior's job in and of itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not across every slot, it's across one.  If the person who receives the BoW has a BF/BoC(just one of your warriors does) then he loses 50hp.  Ok let's say you are tanking fennin and your tank has 9.5khp buffed.<br />
<br />
Fennin hits 3k dmg on you<br />
Fennin hits 2.7k dmg on you<br />
Fennin hits 2.9k dmg on you<br />
You try to slash Fennin, he ripostes, he hits you for 3k. - ok, look.  That riposte could have less likely happened if you had the BoW instead of DW.<br />
<br />
First number = w/ BF/BoC, second number = w/ BoW.<br />
Before first hit - 9.5k/9450<br />
First hit - 6.5k/6450<br />
second hit - 3.8khp/3750<br />
third hit - 900hp/850<br />
riposte - negative 2100hp/riposte didn't happen<br />
ch lands - dead/9450hp<br />
<br />
See how that works?  Fennin can take a tank down in one quad, and that's w/o his AE.  Those are made up numbers, but he does hit for 3k.</div></div><hr />

Are you telling me that when you take your bow from mainhand to offhand and thus get less swings you all of the sudden get 1 *more* eb proc in your 15 min parse? Maybe if your parse and conclussion wasnt so rediculous flawed, it might be believeble that dual eb was 235% more proc aggro then a BoWar, but that sample just plain SUCKS.</div></div><hr />

Thats wrong! My guilds first 4 MTs uses bf/boc, hg/boc, bf/boc and boc/petsword and we killed everything up to xegony.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Ok, Vova, I'll be completely honest with you.<br />
<br />
I have two EB proccing weapons, and yes, they DO taunt more than Blade of War. There is no possible way I can test this, aside from what our Wizards/Nuke classes say (they say they can push themself more, when I am dual weilding.) You cannot parse the taunt that weapon damage does (2h is MUCH higher;) however,  you -can- parse proc rates, but really there is no need. Dual EB wins it hands down. Naturally when you're swinging as fast as you are with dual weild, your proc rate WILL be higher than that of the Blade of War. Yes, dual weild does taunt more still. Like it or not, Warriors.<br />
<br />
Riposte rate, however, with dual weild is higher. 9/10 (fabricated statistic, btw) of the time you can tank with dual weild and do just as well as with a Blade of War. It's that 10% of the time that the tank dies due to a riposte at a bad time that will make you wish that tank had a BoW. I tanked the biggest hitting mob in game (Tallon Zek in Time,) using dual weild, and tanked him from 100% to death, switching two hander in when Defensive faded.<br />
<br />
There -are- mobs that I still prefer dual weild over (mobs with heavy agro reducing abilities/self mem blur,) but overall, for maximum effectiveness out of your tanks, ideally you want them with a Blade of War. <br />
<br />
Just FYI, I (the main tank of Heaven and Earth,) tanked everything up to, and including Xegony, with dual weild. I did not have a Blade of War. Mind you, I also had zero pieces of Raex/PoP loots when we killed Fennin, also. We were the 3rd guild serverwide. I think some people exaggerate the effectiveness of gear, to an extent. Naturally excellent stats on your tank will help, but it is not the 'be all, end all.'<br />
<br />
I lead and plan raids for my guild, take this advice: Get your MT with a Blade of War (It will benefit the guild, even if it only prevents the tank dying once or twice,) then go back and pick off RZ when nothing is up in Elementals, or you just need a break from the mundane farming.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, while a Blade of War is -nice- for your tanks to have (it will increase their ability to stay alive due to lower riposte rates,) it is NOT necessary. It's a luxury (albeit a very nice one) but definitely not a neccesity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">As a guild leader, you have some decisions to make, some of which are based on &quot;return on investment&quot;, which you seem to be very interested in determining, but if you stick to that, you'll end up selling your guild short.<br />
<br />
Let me explain:<br />
<br />
I'm warrior_01 in your guild.   PoP hasn't been very nice to me, I've gotten maybe a small set of upgrades up to this point, perhaps a nice DPS 1h like Agnarr sword or Jiva sword, but which is pretty sucky for when I have to step up and do my job of tanking.   For the last 6 months or so, I've been helping this guild collect loot, runes, parchments, etc for casters and knights and whatnot, waiting ever so patiently for the &quot;magic moment&quot; to arise, the moment when I get to loot the first substantial upgrade for ME and my fellow warriors in the guild.    Up to this point, the game has failed me, because of the pathetic drop rates on BF/HG, so I'm dicking around with a BoC and maybe a Jiva sword, and am expected to perform my job by YOU when asked.  RZ is killed, and doesn't drop the one upgrade I've had my eyes on... again the game has failed me.    A second time, same thing happenned, a third time the same thing happens.... At this point, my guildleader says &quot;Well, I've run the numbers, and decided that RZTW isn't worth the RvR compared to the other mobs we could be doing, so we're going to forego RZ in exchange for elemental minis&quot;... a plethora of these mobs have again, caster or hybrid oriented loot table and perhaps a mold for everyone who can wear.    At this point, it's the guild who has failed me, or more appropriately, the guild leader.<br />
<br />
You can certainly say that BF/HG combo is better for aggro procs than BoW, but this doesn't alter the fact that your guild's warriors aren't wielding BF's/HG's, they're wielding BoC's + some undocumented crapola.    <br />
<br />
Guild leaders need to make some decisions based on more than mathematical formulae, but based on both return on investment AND in morale of their forces.   Trust me when I tell you, prior to RZTW, warrior morale is for shit, because they're struggling with aggro, particularly if they're equipped like your warriors admittedly are, they're not happy because they've compromised on just about every item they've picked up in PoP up to this point, and quite frankly, they're really really really pissed off about having spent the last 6 months farming stuff for casters/hybrids, and now that you can kill the ONE mob that will help increase their morale, you're deciding to forego it on the basis that something that you haven't provided to them may be better in ONE aspect, completely ignoring the DPS/Riposte factor.  Morale isn't quantifiable or parseable.   You, as a guild leader must show those who've been patient and helpful that you are aware about their needs and care about them, even if it means spending some time redoing the RZ script, which isn't THAT buggy.<br />
<br />
If I were a warrior in your guild, I'd be infuriated that my goals aren't even considered by my guild leader, only the total loot intake vs. time invested ratio.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the other consideration you fail at is the ancillary non-BoW loot table on RZ vs. the ancillary non-BF loot table of cursed, or the incidental non-HG loot table of XTC.    Non-BoW RZ drops won't rot... as a matter of fact, most of his loot table is a dramatic upgrade for your people, particularly the ID4 mask and earrings.   Loot of that magnitude simply does not drop from Cursed or XTC, and your chances of rot are significantly better on the 2 ssra mobs than on RZ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I think that Frodlin7th hit the nail on the head here.  The Bow is just as much about warrior moral and happiness as it is about gearing up the guild.  The BoW is the one item that warriors get wet dreams about.  Here is the fabled combo weapon that does the best DPS in the game for us along with the best or close to the best agro.  Previous to the blade of war warriors have had to intentionally nerf their DPS by using weapons with inferior ratios just to keep agro, now they dont have too.<br />
<br />
You might decide that as a guild the BoW isnt worth getting, but for most warriors in EQ there is nothing else that they would rather have.  This is probably why you are getting such push back from most of the warriors here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">I agree the morale part of the Blade of War is important on warrior.  Up to this point, only something like Stone Etched Warsword of some of the time weapons would be equivalent for me and I would probably go with the BoW if given a choice.<br />
<br />
We killed Rallos something like 8 times.  We got 0 Bow and I was personnaly so fucking pissed about the other guilds that just walked in there and got 1 after 1-2 kills (Hi Ludor).<br />
<br />
The weapon is special for sure.  The event is also much more painfull then most normal event.  It's apparent from our last run that we can kill him with ease now, but still before that last run, some noob druid that was kiting in the pit managed to fuck the raid over by aggroing rallos first and by making him banish all our raid (that was funny for a few secs thought).  This kind of shit can only happen with RZ.<br />
<br />
And a last personnal comment on the &quot;aggro&quot; issue.  I've tanked all the mob or so in the elementals planes except maybe Fennin/Xeg using an Ornate Greatblade.  As far as I'm concerned, I could tank most of these mobs using toothpick while defensive and keep aggro over an entire raid perfectly fine.  Mobs simply do not change target easily.  Of course there is a difference using these weapons over using Bloodfrenzy or other with similar proc.  You do not achieve &quot;Aggro lock&quot; and that can often be seen when you stop attacking on enrage and the mob turn around instantly.  But for most of it it work fine.  Anyway, people saying you &quot;can't tank mobs in elementals planes&quot; if you don't have a bloodfrenzy or bow are imo exagerating.  You probably want those yeah, but if you don't, it's not the end of the world.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Well, being bored at work and finally reading all of this thread, here are my thoughts.  No one ever said that BoW sucks for aggro, people are still hell bent that a BF/BoC DW combo is more aggro.  Sure it may be more aggro but how many warriors at that level of the game will be going full out with their BF/BoC combo when they aren't tanking.  The BoW will hold aggro just fine from what I have read/experienced in most raid situations.  <br />
I personally do not have my BoW yet, we have only gotten one out of 5 kills and it went to a different warrior (who was the MT at the time but due to work and such, he has been out for a while putting me in the position of MT).  <br />
I find myself tanking with my BF/BoC combo, I am much less efficient than our warrior with the BoW, even though I have more hps and about the same AC.  I haven't done much parsing of it but while tanking more than several times, I have seen in my hits window &quot;X mob ripostes you for X dmg&quot;  &quot;you have been slain by X mob&quot;.  <br />
If you have the warriors with a DW EB combo, then it may not be worth farming.  However as a warrior I can tell you I would glady take a 50 hps hit in my hands to gain alot more of the only source of consistant aggro (dps), even if my proc rate may be cut a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">BoW is indeed a pain in the ass to farm, my guild can not kill it with our regular farm raid, ie we need good attendency to do it, that I'd rather spend in elem gods attempt than in more farming.<br />
<br />
This said, I think that Stone Etched Warsword is roughly equivalent to BoW, ie you rely on dps not proc to aggro, maybe after 6 mn of fight BoW would outaggro SEWS 75% of the time, but my bet is that after 3 mn of fight aggro is similar most of the time (it may be even wrong if SEWS proc more, and it's what it seems : SEWS even better than BoW to lock down fast a mob), and really who care about getting an extra 5% hate after 6 mn or so ? I see people overaggroing MT after 30 sec of fight (healer , enthusiast nukers etc ...) but never after 2mn.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone over here using a SEWS that could confirm this guess ?<br />
<br />
Because that ring of mud is somewhat more suited to be farmed, it seemed to me to be a good idea to do so and jump on it every time we could, after 10 clean of ring of mud no sew yet ... and this mob has half the loot table of RZ, has SEWS been removed from the game ?</div></div><hr />

I can hold agro adequately with it, although it seems to me the agro lock is not as good as BoW: <br />
<br />
I can hold agro fine until enrage, but when I then take attack off sometimes some of the more agressively nuking wizards/dotting necros get summoned, I dont see this happening when BoW users tank(not as much anyway)</div></div><hr />

Let me chime in here as an &quot;enthusiastic nuker&quot; who regularly dies an ugly death immediately following the MT dying. As a wizard, my effectiveness is limited by 1 thing these days - tank agro. A warrior weilding 2x EB or a BoW &gt; any other warrior from a nukers standpoint. That is in groups or on raids. My nuke patterns for a 2x EB/BoW warrior are pretty much the same as when I have a knight tanking. No matter what you are fighting, your guild should be working towards getting your warriors 2x EB or a BoW. Either works very well when you are standing behind the tank and counting on him getting good agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>PinaduzRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Interesting thread, a lot of useful information, although I think its gotten somewhat off topic.  To respond to original post, IMO BOW out taunts BF/BOC, BF/HG combo.  My evidence is anecdotal.  We have 4 main tanks in my guild.  2 weild BoW, 1 wields BF/BOC combo, 1 wields BF/HG comb.<br />
<br />
Warrior 1 = BF/BOC, roughly 225 aas, all offensive aas maxxed, TM, IM<br />
Warrior 2 = BOW, rough 150 aas, no offensive skills maxxed<br />
Warrior 3 = BF/HG, roughly 150 aas, no offensive skills maxxed<br />
Warrior 4 (me) = BOW, roughly 350 aas, all offensive aas maxxed, TM, IM<br />
<br />
Warriors 1,2, and 3 have a substantially higher attack than me.<br />
<br />
I consistently hold or take aggro (while clearing) over other warriors while using BOW.  Warrior 2 consistently holds or takes aggro over warriors 1 and 3 using dual wield combos.  I consistently hold or take aggro from warrior 2 (which I attribute to offensive aa's).  Warriors 2 and 4 consistently out aggro warriors/knights using SEWS.<br />
<br />
When dual weilding BF/BoC or BF/Double Edged Stormblade I do not get the same aggro as with BOW.  Mobs will bounce between any of the warriors using dual wield combos, but usually sticks on warrior using BOW.  This evidence has been observed and held consistent over a period of 3 months.<br />
<br />
From this anecdotal evidence I conclude that BOW is equal to or greater than dual weilding BF/BOC, BF/HG tanks.  Also, offensive aas &gt; pure attack rating.<br />
<br />
Our guild has beaten Fennin, Corinav, Xegony using each of the 4 warriors, so dual weilding warriors are survivable against PoP bosses.</div></div><hr />

PS: There are now too many threads on this subject, so forgive me for cutting and pasting this interesting analysis from another thread: <br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like ~2 procs per minute from those two posts. Coupled with that DPS thats some mean aggro.<br />
<br />
Of course BF in mainhand procs 3X a minute (proven from parses) even without an offhand EB proccer.<br />
<br />
As a total guess, BF+ offhand EB procs probably about 4.5X a minute. Looking at the total aggro of the two.<br />
<br />
With full AA<br />
DPS of BoW = ~ 140 on most PoP mobs average<br />
DPS of 16/20 + 16/20 = ~ 115 on most PoP mobs average<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
As for parses well:<br />
15 min sets on a certain banker:<br />
<br />
BF primary/non proc offhand = 44 EB procs<br />
BoC primary/non proc offhand = 28 EB procs<br />
BF primary/BoC offhand = 73 EB procs<br />
BoW primary = 31 EB procs (and I have several 40min xegony parses that confirms that a 2 proc/min is what you can expect with BoW).<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BoW = 2 X 700 hate per minute = 23 hate per second from procs.<br />
BF+BoC = 5 X 700 hate per minute = 58.33 hate per second from procs.<br />
<br />
Total BoW hate = 140 + 23.3 = 163.3 hate / second<br />
Total BF+BoC hate = 115 + 52.5 = 173.3 hate / second<br />
<br />
I guess you can see why people argue which is more aggro, they appear to be roughly the same from #s</div></div><hr />

3 warriors and 1 sk in guild have BoW, 1 just quit.  I'm guessing you looked through the profiles so you only see what they have shown on their magelo, not what they have banked.
