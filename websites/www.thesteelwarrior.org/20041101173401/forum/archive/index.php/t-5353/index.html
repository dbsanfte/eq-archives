<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">crack open my magello (it is up to date).  Am I going to get creamed as the MT? <br />
<br />
Peeps I have talked with say I just need to make sure I have a bard pulling for guaranteed singles and all should go well.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions for a LDoN hard n00bler?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Judlail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hope your cleric has a deep mana pool.  :( Get your midigation and avoidence AA's  finished first.  Least that is my 2 CP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, that's sorta what I thought.  Guess only way I'm doing a Hard one right now is as a 6th wheel crappy DPS'er.  <br />
<br />
Which sucks because I have friends who are doing hards (Rogue, shaman) and loving the points they are getting who aren't any more &quot;ubah&quot; than I am, but because I need to soak up those hits and hold agro, well I get to play in the &quot;easy&quot; normal LDoNs (which can be some yawners if they are always single pulls or CC just kicks ass and there is no meyhem).<br />
<br />
Ah well, I need to keep reminding myself that Life 'aint fair :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Take a look at my magelo.  I consider myself about borderline for doing LDoN hard.  If the cleric has alot of AA's, and FT, then it is not bad...tho I still die at least once.  If the cleric does not have alot of AA's and FT, it is going to be painfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Red, you can easily tank hard adventures with your gear and AA. I think you are very much above &quot;borderline&quot;. Hard is about getting singles or having great CC. <br />
<br />
Ernie, imo you will need a bit more to do hards and not drain your group. Either better gear, more defensive AA, or both. If you cannot tank a mob unslowed without dieing then you will be in trouble.<br />
<br />
Borderline hard tanking to me is a tank with 5k hps unbuffed and only half defensive AA's done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Benlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am more or less at your stage of the game as well Ernie.<br />
<br />
Its a really painful and frustrating time, as I am 65 but I don't have the AA's (24 atm) my equipment is mainly cultral, and some of my stats need boosting (Stamina).<br />
<br />
I think alot of players go through this, you hit 65 and feel a bit frustrated that to make any progress will take some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Red, your magelo link on the bar to the left is busted...But it was salvagable, and your gear/AA are far and away beyond minimum.  I consider mine passable, and there is no comparison. My LDoN wins usually had me tanking at 7400 HPs or so...<br />
<br />
Ernie, unless you are afraid to lose, or unless you are playing the &quot;LDoN leaderboard&quot; meta-game, just try one and see how you do.  You might get your ass kicked, you might do ok and lose, you might just win.  I have been in all three of those situations.<br />
<br />
No real agreement here on which camp is the easiest, Ruj hard missions have been easiest for me.<br />
<br />
Hard missions are even fun when you lose.  Everytime we've killed a named mob, someone has equipped the drop on the spot.<br />
(Well, except for the 3 nodrop aggro-shields we got from Ruj...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Ahz.  If you don't care about the &quot;leader board&quot; or wins vs loss then do High adventures.  You will loose a few at first but after awhile you'll start to enjoy them.. then you'll do a normal and you'll /yawn.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the Mistmoore gather missions are by far the easiest of all the areas.  easy to get singles, the agro range is like null, and gathers in general seem &quot;easier&quot;. <br />
<br />
I find that pre targetting for the pull and using root &gt; all<br />
<br />
Communicate about the next pull, tell the group how your pulling, whos rooting which one, pre target them, and always pull with full hitpoints.<br />
<br />
What I normally do for a 3-4 pull room is have the rooters in the group pre target mobs.  Then I go pull, as I see the message for &quot;adheres to the ground&quot; I back up some, and more and more and eventually I have one mob on me and 2 or 3 more lined up rooted.  I always play with my enchanter.... but have them slowed/rooted/mezzed/controlled.  Then beat them down )</div></div><hr />
