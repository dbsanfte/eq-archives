<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I'm currently working on getting flagged for solro and ele planes, and am also looking at joining several guilds. What this means though is that my next few upgrades will probably be via ldon points, since new guild members don't get awarded loot all that often. <br />
<br />
I know which pieces of nro ldon plate would be enough of an upgrade for me to justify spending points, but I'm not too sure about things like earrings, shoulders, etc, because nobody here seems to mention any of them. I am hoping to buy an ornate bracer soon, and need some more cash for it, so I thought it might be a good idea to replace an earring or ring with a ldon piece of gear, which won't cost any plat, and will allow me to sell off a bloodmetal or valorium. I did come across one ring which seems to be a pretty nice piece of gear- <br />
<br />
Ring of Cold Precision (760pts @ EF camp)<br />
5ac 8sta 10agi 5wis/int 75hp 25mana, with 1 type 1 slot, and 1 type 2 slot.<br />
<br />
Aug'ed with 6stam or saves or whatever in type 1, and a hp aug in slot 2, and it looks like a great ring. Best of all, it requires nothing more than a week or so of casual exping, and allows me to sell a valorium to free up some cash.<br />
<br />
Since nobody has ever mentioned this item, or pretty much anything other than nro plate gear, that i've seen, I was just wondering if there are any other items that would be a significant upgrade for me, that don't require a ton of points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you are planning on being in the EP's shortly I would save the points for 40hp and 10ac upgrades. Gather a solid group and hit LDoN High Risk adventures. 2/3 adventures have named, some even have 2+ named. They have really nice non-visible drops in the 80-100 hp range. Check them out at Allakhazam's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">iirc the best type 2 hp aug that fits on a ring is 20hp/mana and costs a ton of points.  Generally not worth it unless you're near the top of the leaderboard.<br />
<br />
If you're not a fatty, you'd probably get more out of another stamina aug in that slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah I hadn't noticed that the 40hp aug, along with the other straight hp augs, were visible slots only. That sucks. I've also got just over 240stam unbuffed as it is, so more stam augs wouldn't do anything but make the magelo look better.<br />
<br />
Looks like I will indeed start getting some decently geared friends together to try some hards.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ring of Mold, from Guk/S Ro camp is very nice, and the Jeweled Ring of Ro Deserts from Tak/ N Ro is quite nice too.<br />
<br />
Ring of Mold, 1492 AP;<br />

Thats another good one from LDoN hards.  Dropped of some sort of mastacore, can't remember the exact name, in EF.  It was great for me because it allows me to upgrade other slots in Time before going back and spending rpp to upgrade my back slot.  (i.e. get the VZ helm for haste then go back and get a cloak)</div></div><hr />
