<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnowm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I guess there isnt too much interest in this weapon for a reason...its really crappy aggro. I got an early proc with this weapon in a group ( bellowed the mob to pull ) &amp; the enchanter still pulled aggro off me with tash. Also once the mob is shammy or chanter slowed when it procs you get the &quot;this spell will not take hold&quot; message. Correct me if I'm wrong but when a spell wont take hold its zero aggro. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spells dont have to take hold to generate agro.  The droga weapons generally don't really stun anything worth fighting, but they still generate good agro from the stun attempt on stuff that is worth while.  And I usually carry around a Swollen Fungusbeast Gland to pop off a few instant snares on boss mobs that I'm tanking, and even though pretty much all the boss type mobs I fight are immune to changes in runspeed, this still generates super aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tamov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">doesnt hold and immune to effect is two different things. immune or ineffective = aggro. proc doesnt hold = 0 aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Riaden D'Marr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tamov is right.  SOD is agro regardless because resists / immune are way diffrent then &quot;wont take hold&quot; messages.  It be nice or usefull if no slower in group but dont really see alot of agro genorated from it when mobs are already slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnowm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well good to know, you learn something new everyday. Well anyway I was VERY unimpressed by the aggro of this weapon. ( the enchanter &amp; shammy even remarked at what a lousy job I was doing holding aggro  = &lt;   )  Not only was my initial aggro bad but I would often lose aggro mid fight to the shammy's dots.  I'd rank this weapon well below CHOS aggro wise.<br />

<br />
I'm almost absolutely sure this is false.<br />
<br />
Will ask a shaman to test it.</div></div><hr />

Brutul can you back me up on this?  Or was I thinking of a different person or circumstance?</div></div><hr />

I play bst as main, its np at all to pull aggro with a 65% slow after a mob is already 70%+ slowed and the spell doesnt take hold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Does not hold, does produce aggro.  I'm 100% sure.  I've got a 65 druid, spend a good ammount of time at the tables in Fire.  Often times I've got a necro in my group, and when i'm kiting, my snares do not take hold (dark &gt; ensnare) and even though they do not take hold, I hold aggro fine kiting casting ensnare a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">as long as the spell accualy casts on the mob you get agro. if it cant cast you get no agro.<br />
<br />
only procs i think dont cast are the vs.undead and summoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">all you guys who say that does not hold doesnt produce aggro have either never really played a casting class ... never actually tested it ... or just plain dont have that many brain cells.<br />
<br />
<br />
i played a ranger main etc and would do aggro kiting A LOT in tier 2-3 PoP with my bst friend.  now for those of you that dont know .. bst pets produce a fuckton of aggro ... and so do bstlords when they go full offensive .... how did i hold aggro??? after i landed ensnare i would chain cast the .5 sec cast tangling weeds.<br />
<br />
the spell never took hold, but always let me stay on top of things with aggro.<br />
<br />
i imagine the club is nice aggro and that youre just having shitty luck with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">dunno most don't rate willsapper wavecrasher that high anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A spell that does not take hold will still produce aggro.  A proc that does not take hold will not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">How can you possibly say that with any manner of proof Bigrin?  Procs function like spells in almost every way; why would this be any different?<br />
<br />
Show me proof.</div></div><hr />

Proof please, I have never heard of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;dunno most don't rate willsapper wavecrasher that high anymore&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
there are lots better weapons to be had than these for much greater ease.  i wish they had a weapon that procced an ench based slow vs a shaman based slow .. shaman based slows are less aggro than a stun.  i would rate them probably at or just under 400 hate honestly (shaman slows).  i imagine the club is decent aggro, but by the time you have access to it, you should have much better.</div></div><hr />

It is in the &quot;taunt test thread&quot; in the library.  <br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1811<br />
<br />
I dont recall &quot;spell does not take hold&quot; ever being part of the discussion.  It was proven that resisted procs do incurr regular agro however.  I think you guys found a knowledge hole....not sure I've ever seen it addressed with a formal study....and no subjective observation doesnt count as proof at SW.</div></div><hr />
