You don’t really need time /ele gear to do this. If you can buff to around 8k hp +, id say youd be ok. Maybe just get more dps to kill faster and make sure cleric spams SL. DI also helps.<br />
<br />
It’s a quick farm of about 30-45  mins and I was doing this with a cleric druid and a botted bard /ench. The loots are<br />
<br />
30hp /mana aug<br />
10atk 2 regen aug<br />
FT2 Regen 2 aug<br />
<br />
Get the tipt expedition. Kill the first mob at ZI which normally sees invis. After that, you can invis all the way to the bridge. Kill the wanderer in the middle of the bridge and clear the golems on the far side. You only need to clear one on the left or right and middle one and you can skirt the other. Work up and kill the 3 spawns on the  ramp up to just below the trap area. From the time you kill the last mob before the trap area, time 15 mins for repop. Be careful though, theres a little trick on the last mob as it seems to alternate between a 1 spawn and a 2 spawn. <br />
<br />
3 people invis up and spawn the hatchlings. Then head back down  the ramp a little. Monk/bard pull hatchlings and kill. If your puller is good, you can get em all done before the 15 min timer runs out. Once last hatchling dies (6 total), maternal cragbeast spawns.<br />
<br />
You can rush to her and fight in the middle of the trap area, just in case your running close to the repop timer. With defensive/stonewall, max hit is around 1300 or so but that is without BV. She mitigates slow, but can be crippled which helps. She also rampages, so be sure to set up a rampage. Doesn’t have a lot of HPs. With our group, the only dps was mine, bard and ench and we still killed her in about a minute.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you kill, loot, rinse repeat till you (and your alts) all got what you want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One question, does this have to be the trial version of Tipt or will this work in the normal xp version as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the second spawn is the wanderer that uses that ramp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can get no see-invis mobs, or you can get nearly all of the mobs on the way to see invis, it's just luck of the spawns.  The cragbeast ring is up for both the progression version and the experience version.  Happy hunting.</div></div><hr />

He only has 20k HP so just burn him down fast and collect your free loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never heard of an 'xp' version of Tipt, is that what happens when you get Tipt without rondo / sewers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I'm refering to entering the zone without having the first 5 trial flags.  Will the maternal cragbeast still pop? or will it only work if you are in a trial instance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you dont need any of the previous trial flags to instance the zone. there is only one zone and that is the trial instanced version. its up toyouwhether you use it for exp or to actually do the trials. the cragbeast will spawn everytime. but once shes dead u have to get a new instance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyprex</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I been doing a lot of GoD trials but how do you instance the tipt zone? <br />
<br />
Apprentice Udranda gives the real trials for Vxed and Tipt. I don't know what to say to get the non-trial instance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help would truly rock.</div></div><hr />
