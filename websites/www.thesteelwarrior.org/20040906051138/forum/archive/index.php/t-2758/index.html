Actually, I did have a question (not warrior-specific tho).  In the hotkey section of our skills there's two I've never seen before.  Inspect and Open.  I put them in the hotkeys and target a person and click inspect and it says &quot;That is not an object you can inspect&quot;.  Same with open &quot;This is not an object you can open&quot;.  It can't be for doors, because you can't target doors, and I've been hearing everywhere that you'd be bashing or kicking the chests and stuff open.</div></div><hr />

Inspect and Open are only going to work on interactive objects.  You can bash them open, but you can also look at them carefully (inspect) and open them if you have the right skills.<br />

I don't think I understand this question, I'm sorry.  If you mean will there be items other than the Augmentation items in LDoN, then the answer is yes.<br />
<br />
Also, will there be another increase in the level Cap?<br />
<br />
Not for LDoN.  Right now it's too early to talk about that for future expansions.<br />

<br />
They will be a challenge for a group of your level.  Making content for groups of a certain composition would be nice.  But there are a lot of possible group combinations and right now we haven't the time to built content for the all wizard group, the all rogue group, the two paladins, one warrior and three enchanter group…<br />

We're looking at that.  We have some plans, but there are some issues (like the two epics that are, essentially, summoned items), so right now I can't tell you what we'll do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd like to know a couple things...<br />
<br />
  First, is LDoN an expansion that is going to be the &quot;next&quot; place for Plane of Time guilds to hit? Previous expansions, like Luclin and Planes of Power, allowed top guilds a new place to pick up and explore. It seems that with 36 person raids, the top end guilds in Time will primarily stay there or basically disolve their guild.<br />
<br />
  Second, what is in LDoN for warriors? Planes of Power especially widened the discrepency between melee classes and casters with the addition of new spells. Is this going to be a continuing trend with LDoN, or are warriors and other pure melee going to have access to new skills and abilities to increase their worth?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Do the raid adventures resemble the amount of regular group adventures?<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, I'm not real sure what you mean here.  There are more than 3 types of group adventures.  But there won't be as many raid adventures as there are group adventures over all, if that's what you want to know.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, is LDoN an expansion that is going to be the &quot;next&quot; place for Plane of Time guilds to hit? Previous expansions, like Luclin and Planes of Power, allowed top guilds a new place to pick up and explore. It seems that with 36 person raids, the top end guilds in Time will primarily stay there or basically disolve their guild.<br />
<br />
I disagree with the idea that any guild will dissolve because this expansion has content for raids of 36 people or less.  That's just as unlikely as saying that having the raid tool accept 72 members would cause guilds to dissolve.<br />
<br />
Time capable guilds will find some things to do in LDoN.  But the primary focus of this expansion is group adventure.  Members of those guilds, if they are so inclined, will also find those adventures to be a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Second, what is in LDoN for warriors? Planes of Power especially widened the discrepency between melee classes and casters with the addition of new spells. Is this going to be a continuing trend with LDoN, or are warriors and other pure melee going to have access to new skills and abilities to increase their worth?<br />
<br />
LDoN isn't an expansion for any class.  It's more about what kind of thing you enjoy as a player.  If you are a player that enjoys single group adventures, then you'll enjoy the expansion immensely.  If you are a raider, you'll find several new raids to hit as well.<br />
<br />
Class balance, while affected by expansions, isn't the focus of any expansion.  Class balance is done outside of expansions.<br />
<br />
A</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Let me expand on the caster/melee discrepancy... It seems by the new spells added, there is going to be an direct increase for all casters. It also appears that there will be increased number of spells with new functions. This will increase the abilities of all casting classes. Unfortunately, there tends not to be a similar increase in melee abilities and the scope thereof. While I understand that this is not an expansion with class balancing in mind, any addition of new types of spells will have a considerable inpact on class dynamics. <br />
<br />
  I suppose my question is more as follows: Are warriors going to get any new skills or abilities with LDoN that increase their functionality beyond that of simply doing and taking damage? Are warriors going to remain the one dimensional damage sponges that we have been since day one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Will their be a limited number of a certian dungon if one or more groups decide to do the same event (like pon maze), or a unlimited instance of the same event? if thats how it even works?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are 48 unique dungeons.  Any of those can be &quot;instanced&quot; as many times as needed, barring hardware restrictions.  We expect to be able to host something like 10,000 instances of any of these dungeons, in any combination.<br />
<br />
So if the group before you were to enter The Halls of Blood, your group and any number of others could also enter The Halls of Blood, though you'd almost certainly each have different goals while there.<br />

Like, in EC, you go to that Wayfarer camp, get a venture for Oasis trap door... does the door link to the same exact dungeon name every time, or 3-4 different dungeon names at the same time, therefore making alot of zones?<br />

<br />
No.  The portals can link to any of the appropriate dungeons.  That trap door could lead to any of the themed dungeons of the same type.  So if you're heading to the Rujarkian Hills portal you could be entering any of the 8-10 dungeons on that theme.<br />

I hope that makes sense.  It will make more sense once you see it in action.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">1. Is there going to be any solo content for folks who can, or are we going to be forced to group?<br />
<br />
You'll have to have a group of at least 4 to enter get an adventure.  Sorry.  We know that there are folks that solo, but we can't really open up 90,000 or more instances for solo players.  We've restricted it to 4 to allow us to be able to host a large percentage of the peak population at the same time.<br />
<br />
2. Could (for example) a level 50 go in and just massacre a dungeon made for mid-20's?<br />
<br />
Your group will get an adventure that will be a challenge for their level.  So if a group of 50s get and adventure, it will of appropriate difficulty.  They can request a hard adventure it they'd like, but we're not adding a &quot;Really Easy&quot; option.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will there be zombie elves? lol, thatd be sweet.<br />
<br />
No.  And no, that wouldn't be sweet.  That'd be... disturbing.  :)<br />

<br />
Seeing how LDoN seems to be an 'exp expansion' for lack of a better term, are there any plans to introduce any new AA's with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">1. What do you have planned &quot;outside the box&quot; for warriors? What can we look foreward to besides upgraded gear, in other words.<br />
<br />
That's a hard question to answer.  I don't know of any outside the box things specifically for warriors.  I can't exclude gear, though, because we've added some interesting new things, such as the ability for more than one power to exist on it item (like two procs).<br />
<br />
Undoubtedly warriors are the most difficult class to be innovative with.  Get too innovative and you're turning them into a different class.  I have no answers for you on that front right now.<br />
<br />
2. Currently Hybrids are the preferred tanks by many exp groups. How is this defieciency going to be changed with LDoN, being that it's based around single group encounters?<br />
<br />
Well, as I said, expansions aren't really designed to address class balance.  I think groups will want warriors in dungeons, but that's just my prediction.  We'll have to see what happens at launch.<br />
<br />
<br />
You mention there are things to do for elemental/time geared characters.. does that include gear that these characters would find beneficial? The trend in EQ has always been uber gear in one-two zones (which of course everyone strives to obtain such as TOV, VT, PoTime..), is this similar in LDoN or as you gain more adventure points do you get access to better treasure? To be honest the example augmentations shown on Alakazaam were not that awe inspiring...<br />
<br />
Well, if you can augment existing items, you make them better.  So certainly some loot will be of interest to even the most awesomely equipped character.<br />
<br />
Every successful adventure gives every member of the group a number of points.  Those points can be used to purchase items from the Wayfarers.  In that way it's very different than any previous expansion.  Save up for the items you really want.  You're choosing your own reward.<br />
<br />
<br />
 And before i derail the thread completely i'd just like to say LDoN looks amazing for the casual gamer and i think it will far exceed the expectations of many people in the everquest community.<br />
<br />
Thanks, and I agree.  :)<br />

Seeing how LDoN seems to be an 'exp expansion' for lack of a better term, are there any plans to introduce any new AA's with it?<br />
<br />
I'd call it a content expansion.  :)  No, there are no new AAs going in with LDoN.<br />

You know the deal.  If I told you, I'd have to kill you.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the reason behind not having any new aa being introduced in Ldon?<br />
<br />
Well, there are a lot of reasons.  First, once we had the outline for LDoN features, content and all that, there was more than enough to do during the dev cycle.  And this is a content expansion, not one for new levels, races, classes or AAs.<br />
<br />
It's not because we don't like the idea of new AAs, it's just that you can't do everything in one expansion.  At some point you have to decide your features and get to work.<br />

<br />
I am interested in this answer as well.. I want a 'hard' single group adventure akin to a single group clearing Sol B Fire giants at level 50 without Kunark+ gear.  For the most part, high level XPing is a bore anymore with pacification, high level mezzes, bard lull/Fading memories pulling, etc....   Dying *SHOULD* be a concern.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any effect that can currently exist on an item can be on an augmentation, from stats to procs.<br />
<br />
2. Are us Time-Enabled guilds going to have our work cut out for us in the &quot;hard&quot; instances? The single-group ones.<br />
<br />
They'll be hard.  Tuning continues right now in fact to make sure they are hard.  I don't think you'll walk through them, you'll have a challenge.<br />
<br />
I want a lot of lost experience...and from *non NDA breaking* reports...It's not happening at this pint. Make sure Hard is hard. I want to be scared.

<br />
:) There are no &quot;non NDA breaking&quot; reports, with four exceptions for web sites that we've given permission to talk about it.  If they are talking about beta, they are breaking their NDA.  Just wanted to make that clear.<br />
<br />
As I said, it'll be hard.  Tell your non-NDA breakers to get in there and test and use /feedback so we can make sure it's hard enough.  But no crying if it's too hard…  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Another little question... Will it be essential for a raid warrior to get the upgrades found in LDoN? Certain expansions or extensions (namely LoY) were optional with minimum impact on a higher level character. Are the item improvements going to be powerful enough to drastically change dynamics, such as an added second hate proc or something equally as important to a raid level warrior?<br />
<br />
I can't answer that, really.  &quot;Essential&quot; is determined by the players more than it is by us.  LoY was an expansion for levels 30 (or 35) to 60.  It wasn't really even built for those at the top end of 65.  I don't know that you'll see dramatic changes, but I can certainly imagine that some of the available items or augmentations will be desirable, even for Time enabled characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Do you feel comfortable with the fact that you are slicing a guild in half and asking them to chose and select which ones to take on the raid, leaving certain individuals out of your &quot;wonderful new content expansion&quot; ?<br />
<br />
If a guild has 72 members show up for an LDoN raid, they can take on two raids at the same time.  I don't see any real guilds leaving anyone behind in a situation like that.  No guild is going to be split in half over this.  If they are then there's more going on there than just this expansion…<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the time and the fine reception.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">What other kinds of things can you add to an item through augmentation?<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to turn an item into a 'clicky' having charges (or unlimited charges) of a spell on equipments? Obviously some spells (especially with unlimited charges) would be grossly overpowered, but some utility spells would certainly be handy to have on equipments.<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to add extra damage to weapons with augmentation gems? I could imagine that in some cases it could be a little overpowered, so, would you at the least be able to add bane damage or elemental damage to a weapon?<br />
<br />
Are you able to remove augmentation gems from equipments? If so, do you get the gem back, or is it destroyed?<br />
<br />
Are items with augmentation gems, provided the original item was, droppable? Or does the item convert to NO DROP once you place gems inside it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">You can't seriously sit there and say you do not foresee any problems with taking a guild, who has been forced to inflate their roster to compete and complete with your current end game content and shuffling them into two seperate raids. You will end up with the god raid, and the gimp raid, no two ways about that. I don't even raid with near 72 people yet I see this problem clear as day. I was really dissapointed in how last minute-ish the raid content of this expansion seems to be taking shape.<br />
<br />
Second issue that you have sort of addressed in regards to this community. No one is asking for the red phone to sony hq nor are they asking for a yesman to us everything will be alright. This community is simply asking for recognition, in the fact that we exist as a decent percentage of your playerbase and in the fact that we do have current and valid issues seemingly ignored month after month. <br />
<br />
Grey skies aside, I am looking forward to single group content - I am not yet sure if LDoN can be a valid answer for my hopes. The current system of points banking for things you want runs along the lines of my guilds item distribution, one I personally favor and have to give nods towards. On paper the system is looking good, but I have seen paper to game transitions go bad in the past.<br />
<br />
Finally, more frogs to kill!!! - something I've missed since kunark :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">While it was nice of Absor to poke his head in and answer some questions about LDoN, some of us missed out. I have a few questions that were only partially answered. If Absor notices such a thread and choses to respond, then nice. If not - shrug.<br />
<br />
1. Is the item list deep for each encounter? Aten Ha Ra for example has a deep list of highly desireable items and therefore guilds tend to do the encounter many times. Other mobs/encounters only have one or two items in their loot tables and are done a limited number of times.<br />
<br />
2. While there will be some content that will entertain Level 65 characters and items of interest to them, will there be any &quot;progression&quot; toward new endgame encounters (Flags for example)? Do you believe the rewards sufficient for this content to be a raid target for high level (65/Planar) guilds?<br />
<br />
3. The Charm slot was somewhat disappointing until the Wooden Totem &quot;giveaway&quot;. Will this slot be further itemized in LDoN or was what we've seen it at this time?<br />
<br />
4. Players were generally disappointed that there were no dropable Charm slot items, not a lot of choices, no known player made items that could go in this slot, and that Charms could only be obtained in zones made available in the (then) new expansion. Are the same things true of the augmentation slots?<br />
<br />
---------<br />
The following, while /oot, does respond to a statement made in the original thread:<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you all are waiting for us to get a chance to look over the situation with melee in general. I know that's taking a lot longer than you'd like, and I'm sorry.&quot; - Absor<br />
<br />
While most of us on this board are waiting for you &quot;....to get a chance to look over the situation with melee in general.&quot;, we are in fact waiting for much more:<br />
<br />
1. We want change, not simply looking over the situation.<br />
<br />
2. We want change of the Warrior class, not just &quot;....melee in general&quot;. Yes, changes to the Warrior class need to be done in context, but they also need to happen.<br />
<br />
3. While it is &quot;....taking a lot longer than....&quot; we'd &quot;....like....&quot;, we would prefer a well thought out and well executed solution and are hopeful that the months that have passed since Warriors first vocalized their concerns and SoE went on the record as having heard have been used to address them.<br />
<br />
SoE and the development team will make the determination when they will schedule looking over the situation, what if anything will be done, and when if ever it will be made live.<br />
<br />
Players however will express themselves with regard to these issues. While I may have been particularly vocal on this board, I assure you the level of concern in-game is very high. It is not fun to be raiding and have people yell at you to &quot;Taunt harder!!!!&quot; or to regularly &quot;/gu &lt;-lfg&quot; in the faint hope you will find a group where you can exp in the content that you worked hard to enter.<br />

<br />
From the mage board, he said:<br />
<br />
One proc per item. That would require another change to the way items work, and probably some other game mechanics, to pull off two procs on one item.  <br />
<br />
From this thread he said:<br />
<br />
That's a hard question to answer. I don't know of any outside the box things specifically for warriors. I can't exclude gear, though, because we've added some interesting new things, such as the ability for more than one power to exist on it item (like two procs). <br />
<br />
Bold was done by me, to emphasize what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
I suspect there is a reason for this seeming contradiction(say not being able to add 2 right click effects, but being able to have 2 weapon procs), but would like to have this clarified.<br />
<br />
2 weapon procs sounds truly awesome.  If both procs go off at once, you could generate huge agro(imagine EB + say Force Shock, proc a couple times and then run to the fridge, agro is yours).  If it worked where it checks for each proc seperatly(so you could proc either, both or niether on any swing), it enhances the chance of early agro generation, due to more procs meaning more of a chance of an early proc.<br />
<br />
If anyone happens to catch his next round of Q and A on another board and would be so kind as to ask about this, would be much apreciated.<br />
<br />
Edit -- and if you want to have a discussion, please don't pick the more &quot;special&quot; members of this community to address. I for one would really like it if you sat down with our good friend Frodlin. <br />
<br />
As I am quite possibly one of the  'special members' Haass mentioned(or at the very least, I represent a minority view on fixing warriors), I just thought I would mention that I agree Frodlin would probably be a good choice to talk to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Im just curious as to the benefits of experience will be to high aa characters with the release of LDoN. For my own part I have just about all the aa abilitys I could want(over 300 including stat/resist), and theres now nothing left for me to do with experience, I can't see banking aa as a viable option for future expansions because of the 30aa cap you had before PoP(which Im sure will be the same for upcoming expansions). <br />
<br />
Much of the enjoyment I had from dungeon crawls in expansions like kunark was based on two things, loot and experience, and from what Im seeing with LDoN, for many players like myself(and theres a growing number in my situation), the experience factor of the expansion is missing. So unless anything is being planned to change this, why not allow players to purchase adventure points using experience, or even allow a secondary set of shops that have a different range/types of items from the points vendors that sell items using aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I have a few questions:<br />
<br />
Will charmslot items be augmentable (aka the figurine)<br />
<br />
Does a hard dungeon mean its hard for good equipped characters and a moderate dungeon will be hard for moderate equipped group ?<br />
<br />
From what you said so far it seems old existing items, even time items, will be augmentable, and any stat is, does that include stats like &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot;, skill mods, &quot;NO DROP&quot;, class tags ? (ok I doubt a 30 dmg 20 dly priest 1hb, will be made augmentable into a melee useable item, but some items out there might be worth to get other classes tagged on)<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to trade in old &quot;gear&quot; for augmentations  ? (I see a huge area of exploitation there, like rotting elemental amors or weapons being looted just to be turned into useful augmentations) <br />
<br />
Will the dungeons work out for odd groups (rare class combinations) or is a mix of healer/tank/utility always required ?<br />
<br />
Are augmentations rewards you can buy for the adventure points, I am not sure what they give and if the dungeons only goal will be to achieve quest items and adventure points ?<br />
<br />
Will classes with special abilities be crucial, like rogues or classes that can cure curse/disease/poisons, due to them being overly used ?<br />
<br />
Are there class specific missions / quests / adventures ?<br />
<br />
Are the 10000 possible instances  meants for all servers together ? I am not sure how many servers there are currently, but is the number of instances per server around 200-400 ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just have a moment, but I wanted to clarify something.<br />
<br />
It is indeed possible to have two procs or effects on one item now. I emphasize possible, because it will certainly not be something that will be easy to come by.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Ittee Bittee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">If you are not adding any high end content in with this expansion, don't you expect more player burnout?  You guys might not care because the people quitting are probably still paying for their accounts even though they are not logging on, therefore you lose no money from it.  But people getting bored and quitting is hurting a lot of guilds right now.  For the guilds that have already cleared PoTime multiple times, what are they going to have to play for without any new high end content to work towards in this expansion?  I know my guild and many others have had a lot of people leave over the past month or two, and have had to recruit a lot to try to keep 55 people even to do decent raids.  And I saw that the other high guilds on my server had to do the same, as did Triton, FoH and many of the uber guilds on other servers.  People just retired or quit without saying anything, one day we had 107 people on by the end of the Rathe Council event when we won, the following week we were struggling to get 45 people for a PoFire raid.  Maybe it was frustration with flags, maybe it was boredom doing the same mobs over and over while working towards PoTime.  And other guilds had the same problems with people just not logging on anymore.  So what reason do the hardcore guilds/players have to keep playing EQ if there's nothing new to work towards in this expansion, and when there won't be another expansion for months most likely.  What do we have to do during that long wait?  Just EXP for 5 or 6 months til another expansion comes out with something exciting to do?  I have all the AAs I want, so other than exploring the dungeons a couple times I have no real reason to EXP in the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

Check the news section of Allakazaams ( my spelling is wrong i'm sure..) there was a small article about augmentations with some examples.  One item shown had 3 augmentation slots I believe..another had only one.  I'd link it but i can't access that website from my current location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">One quick question, Absor, if you would.<br />
<br />
You say it's possible for augmentations with flowing thought, vengeance, and the like to exist<br />
<br />
My question is, will you be itemizing  XP group dungeons with augmentations with these effects, or will they be limited to raids? <br />
<br />
If they are in group dungons, how rare will they be in comparison to items with small stat bonuses like the 6 to a given resist augs? I assume they're be extremely restricted in location that they can be inserted into, as well.<br />
<br />
Secondly, when speaking about stat modifying augs, are there &quot;levels&quot; of augs, like an augmentation that gives FT1, and a aug that gives Ft5 but is much harder to get and much more rare? Or a aug that gives 15hitpoints, and an aug that gives 50 more hitpoints but is again, that much rarer?<br />

<br />
Here is a question though, is there any possibility of instancing the &quot;old world&quot; boss mob encounters that are still highly sought after. Things like the ssra bosses where guilds run over eachother with the only purpose of keeping others out of VT or AoW. Even making these encounters doable by 5-10 different raiding parties at a time would be better than the training, ooc fights, kill stealing events that they are now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Leah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">You say that expansions have nothing to do with class balance, but with each expansion comes new more powerfull spells, which in turn effect class balance. <br />
<br />
With the release of PoP and now LDoN, all these new and more powerful spells, and no melee changes, thats what has created the problem we have in the 1st place.<br />
<br />
This is the reason why everyone keeps asking what pure melee classes get out of the expansions. Another expansion is just distancing the classes even further.<br />
<br />
What we're basicaly saying is we need something equivilent of all the new spells so we can hold our own. We can't solo, can;t get groups, atm we can only really raid, and we need your help.<br />

<br />
I'd like to say that I am amazed by your presence here, and I sincerely hope it leads to a productive result.<br />
<br />
My point here, with LDoN and any future expension, would be for you to consider giving everyone a fair distribution of power.<br />
<br />
What I mean, is the last pure melee upgrade we've seen were disciplines, and that was a long time ago. the got absolutely no upgrades, nor additions. We are starved for a tiny bit of diversity, and a measure of power.<br />
<br />
The AA we were offered with Luclin, and PoP left us very bitter compared to what other class got. Call it our greedy side, but in that department we felt totally ripped off.<br />
<br />
I am not asking for the impossible, or a total retroactive revision. what I am asking though, is that when you give say wizard mage, necro a new batch of spells, that you not forget us little pure melee.<br />
<br />
We don't want a bone, like /shield, we want measurable and adequate improvement compared to the other class.<br />
<br />
Also, we would be thrilled if items were made so that in all fairness warrior got a good deal, without pally feeling left out, or anyone for that matter. like we get a new item, warrior gets 10str/sta/agi/dex 100hp, knights gets 5 str/dex/agi/sta/int/wis 80hp 40 mana, so that items with multiple class on it don't make us lose simply because we can't use all of its attributes.<br />

<br />
As far as not being able to 'think outside the box' where warriors and other pure melee are concerned, i really think that that's a mistake.  Given how warriors in particular are absolutely tied around the two central points of balance in eq (aggro/DPS and mitigation) and that any significant changes could have serious ramifications throughout the game, then perhaps 'outside the box' is the only place to go to give us back some measure of personality/playability. I 'm pretty sure that with sufficient thought some interesting idea's that don't totally destroy the warrior concept could be implemented (see the war room for some pretty good, off the cuff examples)<br />

<br />
Some questions, in no particular order, what I haven't had a chance to test yet, or am just interested in hearing about:<br />
<br />
-how will &quot;twink&quot; groups be handled in instanced dungeons?  Will dungeon level be based in average, min, or max level in group?  If anything except max, how will groups with a 65th level toon + 5 baby twinks be handled?  Some rather interesting different permutations are possible depending on how you set this up, I'd suggest some real thought be put into it...<br />
<br />
-NO RIGHT CLICK EFFECTS FROM AUGUMENTS?!?!  WE LOVE CLICKIES!!!! PLEASE RECONSIDER!!! ;)<br />
<br />
-How about some &quot;cursed&quot; auguments?  Things with massive regen and build-in snare, or huge atk bonus and negative resists or AC.  Makes some tradeoffs necessary, which is a Good Thing vs. the regular +ac +hp +mana/resist stuff.<br />
<br />
-Please please please put in some melee-centric auguments with CHANNELING!!!! (not a question, sorry- but PLEASE!).<br />
<br />
-Can auguments give buff box icons any way except with procs?  Are bard-song type effects possible (nonvisible ones?)<br />
<br />
-How will NPCs react to tradeable items with auguments installed?  I.e. has anyone done any checking about sell back prices, quest item turn-ins, etc.?  Due dilligence things... perhaps add a &quot;nodrop&quot; flag for grossly powerful auguments or similar?<br />
<br />
-Auguments and faction modifiers- possible?<br />
<br />
-ZEM modifiers in instances- based on regular/hard?  Different ones for different flavors?<br />

More later. :)<br />

also, if you ever do want to get into class balance with warriors or melee's in general id request that you do another gamespy chat as i was there and it went very well (since rude questions where not asked and it was controled) and may i ask who is in charge in melee balance overall?

as for dmg discpline, id like to point out how usless that is please visit some of our idea threads concerning class balance and discplines to see why we think(and can prove) this is a piss poor attempt at a fix at the current set up, they would have to have thier focal point moved from raids to groups, as what use is that raid discpline if we can never reach a level where we can use it</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm not real sure what you mean here.  There are more than 3 types of group adventures.  But there won't be as many raid adventures as there are group adventures over all, if that's what you want to know.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree with the idea that any guild will dissolve because this expansion has content for raids of 36 people or less.  That's just as unlikely as saying that having the raid tool accept 72 members would cause guilds to dissolve.<br />
<br />
Time capable guilds will find some things to do in LDoN.  But the primary focus of this expansion is group adventure.  Members of those guilds, if they are so inclined, will also find those adventures to be a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
LDoN isn't an expansion for any class.  It's more about what kind of thing you enjoy as a player.  If you are a player that enjoys single group adventures, then you'll enjoy the expansion immensely.  If you are a raider, you'll find several new raids to hit as well.<br />
<br />
Class balance, while affected by expansions, isn't the focus of any expansion.  Class balance is done outside of expansions.<br />
<br />
A  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
thats just it tho, we love groups, but with our piss poor abilitys, and not exacltly being leaps and bounds over our offspring classes we CANT get a group meaning all this content is going to be behind glass for most warriors if a paladin or shadow knight is also looking for a group<br />
<br />
(also to those folks tearing into absor about splitting up time guilds, PoP was made for you, that was where the phrase was coined, let us smaller guilds have some fun please, also why split? since you all get private encounters why not just run 2 raids? is it to hard to get 2 people to lead 2 raids? its not like anyone is stopping you from doing multipule raids)<br />
<br />

Allthough I'm not an uber player in an uber guild I have been playing since summer of 1999.<br />

My concern is this challenging for your groups level thing, Things that most players from 54 to 56 find challenging are not always the same some will find it easy some will find it impossible.<br />
<br />
On that same note if you can only zone in with a group of atleast 4 hows corpse runs gonna be handle that could make things a bit difficult. What happens if a party member goes ld in the middle of the dungeon and can't seem to get back online during the next few hrs and what happens when the player gets back on?<br />
<br />
Will the experience be worthwhile in these zones if most the dungeons are meant to be completed within 2 hrs or so, will you be able to see the exp bar actually move? and will you get additional exp for turning in the completed quests or events?<br />

I do have to say i like the ideas of the expansion especially that it is also for lower and mid level characters.<br />

You can't, because it doesn't exist.    What people are saying is that it is inherently unfair of SOE as a company to create a situation where you've grown your guild to accomplish things with a certain class makeup, numbers, etc and then... after all is said and done, abandon that.<br />
<br />
Also, Gerick, please allow me to educate you on raid class makeup and the impossibility of simply halving the size of each &quot;raid&quot; and doubling it.   It's simply put, not possible.  I realize that you don't learn these things while running a casino in the bazaar, but it's the case.    <br />
<br />
Raid encounters require a certain number of certain classes.   There are a few basic requirements.   A couple of warriors, a bunch of clerics, a shaman, an enchanter, a couple bards, and some DPS (Wiz/Rog).    You have a lot more flexibility with 72 people to do unorthodox things than you do with 36.   <br />
<br />
If mobs hit in the 3k's-4k's on difficult raid targets, your cleric numbers will remain stagnant from the current ones, so you'll have to not halve the number of clerics... it'll remain the same, your cuts will come from other classes.   Warriors of course will benefit from this in a raiding environment, giving further ammunition to others to gimp us in an exp environment, hurting.....<br />

<br />
On the other hand, I tend to think that it's a good idea to please the widest variety of your customer base as possible.   I agree that soloers have little to no position from which to argue, but it's really more from a technical perspective than a philosophical one.   It's inherently stupid to have to purchase the massive amounts of hardware required to maintain enough instances to cover people soloing AND groups when you can say &quot;it's a grouping expansion&quot; and divide the equpment requirement by 4-6.<br />

<br />
While there's a lot of raid level targets for the smaller guilds nowdays, I don't think I've ever seen anyone argue that there shouldn't be more added.  Hell, I want to see more pre-50 raids, more pre-40 raids, and frankly, I hope this new expansion can pull that off.   I DON'T on the other hand feel that it's fair to send the message to guilds that you should have X number of people for this expansion, then have nothing for the next expansion (which is fine) then the 2nd one in a row to change the formula.   Certainly the development and testing time for raid level targets is difficult, but it's simply dishonest or ignorant to say 'well, you can split into 2 36 man raids'.<br />

<br />
as far as suiting what most people want that isnt the truth, only a few guilds can feild the people for most of the PoP events, everyone else has to put up with pick up raids, and many people would rather have events made for 36 people so their computer doesnt bomb out, and also another good reason for small events is its a lot less of a head ache to manage...<br />

<br />
No one has specifically said this, no.  But there is a definite implication that when PoTime guilds are done with their content, there should automatically be more content added for them.  Even if this comes at the expense of content for others.  The general message seems to be &quot;we've beaten our challenges, we're bored, now give us something new&quot;.  I don't fault people for growing bored when they've done all there is to be done for them, but then again, I don't necessarily think that a game designer should focus on more, bigger, greater challenges for those who consume them at the highest rate to the detriment of those that don't. <br />
<br />
You can't, because it doesn't exist. What people are saying is that it is inherently unfair of SOE as a company to create a situation where you've grown your guild to accomplish things with a certain class makeup, numbers, etc and then... after all is said and done, abandon that.<br />
<br />
Well, they haven't abandoned it.  The content that requires it still exists, does it not?  They just haven't expanded on it.  If they, as a company, see that continuing to require large masses of players for raid content is detrimental to the game, as they see it, don't they have the right, perhaps even the obligation, to change course?<br />
<br />
Also, Gerick, please allow me to educate you on raid class makeup and the impossibility of simply halving the size of each &quot;raid&quot; and doubling it. It's simply put, not possible. I realize that you don't learn these things while running a casino in the bazaar, but it's the case. <br />

<br />
You're some what correct, there will be obstacles in the way of the larger guilds.  However, I don't see them as obstacles that are insurmountable.  There will be some shifting around in who plays what class.  Some recruiting priorities will change.  People will double box different classes.  They will adapt, overcome, and prevail.  That is, if they wish to. <br />
<br />
If mobs hit in the 3k's-4k's on difficult raid targets, your cleric numbers will remain stagnant from the current ones, so you'll have to not halve the number of clerics... it'll remain the same, your cuts will come from other classes.

While in the normal difficulty group adventures anyone can tank, which will seemingly play to the strengths of Knights or even Rangers/Beastlords.  The uber Warriors will be in the best groups doing the hardest adventures getting the biggest rewards.  Casual Warriors will be bypassed for any number of other classes that can tank and will be getting pretty slim pickings.<br />

And you want the casual Warrior to be overly concerned about the fact that the uber guilds are going to have to jump through some hoops to adapt to the new LDoN raid environment?  I don't see the reasoning.</div></div><hr />
