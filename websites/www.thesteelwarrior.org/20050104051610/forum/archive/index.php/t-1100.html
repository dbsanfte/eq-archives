<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading some of SoE's future plans, most specifically the one where they mention the adding of the block skill to those that choose to use a shield I began to think... what would it take to make shield use a viable option for Warriors (and to a lesser extent Knights).<br />
<br />
My thoughts on the subject are as follows..<br />
<br />
1. Block skill with a pretty good rate of success that would work alongside our other avoidance skills.<br />
2. A proc modifier affecting the main hand weapon.. increasing proc rate of hate inducing weapons to offset the loss of a second procing weapon<br />
3. A mele focus effect making a single 1h weapon DPS come close to that of dual wielding.<br />
<br />
These same effects would be available to knights but to a lesser extent due to the fact that there are many high ratio 1hr's in the game for Knights as well as thier non-relyance on procs for aggro. The shields with the highest modifiers would be Warrior only.<br />
<br />
Thoughts and Suggestions?'<br />
<br />
p.s. I dont want to see any Knight bashing in this thread, just constructive critisism and ideas on how to make this work and possibly shrink the aggro gap between Knights and Warriors.. If it gets out of hand I will ask the moderators to close the thread.</div></div><hr />

If you're that far into the game, the Proc and stats alone might make it worthwhile using a shield. Would be curious what warriors that have had a chance to see these drops have to say about it.</div></div><hr />

ATM its the very bottom of my *need to get* list, right under fishing grubs for my ammo slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If FB is broken then regular bash is just fine. I use a Stormriders Carapace (FB IV) with a BF and I like that set up. It holds aggro as well as my SOD off handed and I get less ripostes and 74 extra AC and 125 HP. Great for tanking boss mobs.<br />
<br />
I'll get a second EB weapon one day and I'll see if having that in the offhand is as nice as the FB IV shield.<br />
<br />
If FB is broken then its really going to be uber if they fix it. <br />
<br />
Currently I use duel wield when tanking in exp groups for the increased DPS and I use 2 handers if not the tank.<br />
<br />
I don't think I'd even use it in exp groups since exp mobs arent really big hitters and I like the extra DPS with my second weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">shields are already more then viable to a knight cause of the stats/ratio's they get on their hybrid only weps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But even with outrages ratio 1hr's they dont approach the damage they do with 2hr's especially with 2h specific AA's. Knights would need somthing added as well to make it realistic to use a shield on a regular basis.. tho not nearly as  much as Warriors would need.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is a Warriors perspective as to what it would take for a Warrior to use a shield. We already know that it is viable for Knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the block thing?<br />
<br />
It would take knight ratio one handed weapons, FB would have to work, and bash would need to generate aggro equivalent to dual wield/two handed fighting stiles.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, stuff that isn't going to happen to answer your question. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People are asking for all sorts of things.<br />
<br />
It would take, for me, 1, and only 1, thing to get me to use a shield.<br />
<br />
I'd have to be able to hold aggro better with it.<br />
<br />
I don't care how this is done. I don't really care what else happens, although I would appreciate something that bumps my DPS back up to where it would be Duel Wielding, at least, if not 2hander.<br />
<br />
But the MAIN issue... I need to hold aggro with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All it would take would be a FB shield and a decent proc one hander.  I wouldn't use it all the time, but I'd use it sometimes.<br />
<br />
FB shields are waaaaaaaaaaay too rare.<br />
<br />
Some high ratio primary only weapons wouldn't hurt.  Would make dual wielding in general more attractive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so here is a slightly different scenario for you all to ponder.<br />
<br />
Would you use a shield if...<br />
<br />
1. Your DPS would be slightly less than Dual wielding<br />
2. Your aggro generation would be slightly better than DW hate weapons. (of Frostbringer or better quality)<br />
3. Your damage avoidence would be better thru the adding of the Block skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knights would need somthing added as well to make it realistic to use a shield on a regular basis.<br />
Knights already use 1h+shield on a regular basis. They had 1:1 ratio weapons as far back as Velious and they have only gotten better. Any time a knight is called on to tank a big hitter they should be using a shield. There are so many options for knights specific 1h weapons that they would be crazy no to. There is no existing 2h weapon that can match the stats of the best 1h+shield combos for knights, not even close.<br />
<br />
As for warriors using shields, our warriors where using them before most of them got BoWs. When tanking PoP bosses, the extra stats, particularly an extra raw 60ac help a bunch. We never had any trouble with agro with our warriors weilding BoC+shield. I would imagine if there were some better ration 1h EB weapons with good proc rates you might see more shields being used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;When equipped with a shield, this charm will cause the shield to be imbued with the same effect as the weapon in your primary hand each time it hits&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When equipped with a shield, this charm will triple the rate of procs on the weapon in your primary hand (Note: Not double, because you'd still be missing out on significant DPS/swing based aggro)&quot;<br />
<br />
Make these charms available via Parchment turnins, Add block and voila' warriors are happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackulle</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How bout add a delay to sheilds, add autobash (bashes like an offhand weapon) and let us use kick as well.  Then i'd think about it if it were a damn nice sheild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cuedyen2</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knights already use 1h+shield on a regular basis.

<br />
Knights typically give up shields between levels 51-53.  The reason, the 2hs bonus kicks in at 51 and by 53 most 1hs weapons are doing far less dps.  Shields do not currently add much incentive to give up even a little bit of dps.<br />
<br />
One idea on PoN is to give warrior's an innate ability to do 120% damage when using a 1hs weapon without a shield.  The actually percent should be whatever it takes to get warrior's ratio equal to a knights using roughly the same quality of weapon (basically how hard they are to get).  The warrior's dps would actually be higher due to skill caps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would gladly take lower dps wielding a shield IF it was offset by an increase in agro (the idea of furious bash I believe).<br />
<br />
As for block honestly see it as separate issue; its a shield attribute enhancer...to be honest it does zip for a warrior w/o the first question being addressed.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
- Furious bash as an AA skill  WARRIOR ONLY (expensive skill; class 3/6/9); this should stack with existing FB weapons.<br />
<br />
- Block as an AA skill All melee classes (2/4/6 moderate cost skill)<br />
<br />
- The FB AA skill effect being enhanced by the ingenuity AA skill (increased agro effect, duration)<br />
<br />
- Some friggin stun messages for Bash already (come on its been 3 years)<br />
<br />
- Let a shield work with the Rampage AA skill (AE bash)<br />
<br />
I think the charm idea should ENHANCE existing shield processes not be one in and of itself (i.e. it would increase FB chance, effect, duration based on an AA skill or item providing it).<br />
<br />
Personally I love shields.  I used the &quot;ruatha&quot; bash-switch method to max my skill a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackulle</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the idea of using a sheild, but its not practical anymore.  I used to Ruatha bash also, till they put in kick stun at lvl 55, then I gave up cuz it was easier to just hit the button than swap a sheild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigrr7th</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Frod said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cardinal</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just picked up an Aegis of Earth last nite and tested it a bit with BF in mainhand (the 75 AC furious bash V shield.)<br />
<br />
Was clearly able to hold aggro despite having 3 other BoW warriors present.  (also had the call of fire effect up from Aten gloves, but did not have Voice of Thule) I did notice that I was seeing the &quot;your shield glows red&quot; emote on my bashing,  I never noticed that before when I very briefly toyed around with the Zek Crested Buckler FB II shield (which I could never maintain aggro with).  Is it possible that they fixed FB now? Or did I just miss it before?<br />
<br />
The net effect is a substantial boost in hp v. wielding a BoW,  big boost in AC (about a 70Ac and 100 hp actual increase) for the cost of drastically reducing DPS .  It looks to be situational, next time we drop Xegony I will try to generate some parsing data to get a feel for how much extra mitigation it turns out to be....   <br />
<br />
It certainly is at least a viable special case alternative.  If the mitigation even only turns out to be an extra percent, versus the real heavy hitters out there, its easily worth the loss in DPS (afterall thats why you have trushot rangers right?).  The majority of fights there would be little reason to give up the DPS, but given the insane DPS of some stuff in Time, I see it has its purposes......</div></div><hr />

<br />
There, warrior agro problems fixed and we get a nice dps upgrade too.</div></div><hr />

That is when I would use one often.</div></div><hr />
