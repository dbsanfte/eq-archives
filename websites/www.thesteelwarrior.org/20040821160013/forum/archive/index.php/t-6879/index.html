<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe, EQW is third party software, not Sony's fault if the people that wrote it don't update it.  <br />
<br />
I assume the reason it broke is that there's a new front end with new graphics and an option to bypass the server select screen and go straight to your normal server.  Has been on Test for a week or so.</div></div><hr />

Well I'ma still blame SOE if the windowing code is still so borked that elements of the task bar and browser images transgress the Z-Order and show through my EQ screen ... or if switching window modes crashes the game every time ... or that I've yet to see that they got the windowing code in EQ to work as well as EQW always did for me.<br />

Crossing me fingers for the patch ...</div></div><hr />

Though I just tried my EQW and got in game fine so it's a non-issue.</div></div><hr />
