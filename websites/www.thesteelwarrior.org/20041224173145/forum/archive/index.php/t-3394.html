<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im a warrior, as most of you know<br />
<br />
I started this game around 3 years ago, just before velius if i recall right, i loved my class, my cleric was fun but it just wasnt &quot;home&quot; to me, it didnt suit me, my raw need for power and to be face to face with my enemy came thru in my warrior, with my dorky eye patch and my sarnak greatblade, a gift from sunnyeyez, a kind haffer, i set out as a newbie and starting killing, i loved it, it felt right, it felt good<br />
<br />
then when i got to level 28 i found out i completely fuggled my stats, i was a little upset, so after a transfer of my gear to my new warrior i started anew and got to 38,(keep in mind i had alot of alts so this took some time) again i relised this time, i fuggled again this time going with all STR (last time i put it all in agility and wisdom) and luclin came out so i started on my vah shir warrior, i got my stats perfectly, and required levels hadnt started so i got my levels back fast, in my good armor hehe, it truly represented how i felt about the warrior class, in the raw power and ferocity, the death and maiming were part of my duty as a man of travel, a roamer, killing things as i saw fit, justice i delt with the zen of virtue, i was the hero of my group, pulling SYASR all the time (saving your ass so run!) for my groups, people valued me greatly but i was getting less and less pick up groups, my friends didnt play often enough at the time and most had outleveled me with all my restarts, this is when i truly noticed paladins and SKs coming into their own, i felt a little worryed but i figured, im at the top of my game, it would be right to step on someone that has had their fair share of problems when i have had none.<br />
<br />
when pop came out,<br />
 things changed, i was 46 i starting playing a hell of alot more, struggling to pull myself up to my friends levels, as i really had problems getting groups because of my mediocer armor and weapons, canabalizing my alts via the bazaar i became all about powering up my warrior, i wasnt going down with out a fight, dev team and absor be damned, i wasnt gona start over again as a paladin. i made it to 51 and found the TSW forums and started venting my anger, the indignation i was being beaten out of the job by alter boys and the guys the necro's sent to bring them fresh corpse's to preform their art on.<br />
<br />
at 56 i pretty much burned out, loosing most of my faith in my class and the game makers, feeling really put off i took a long break from EQ, when i came back they had removed flags, so i went to PoS with those old friend i mentioned and i worked my way up to 63, now LDoN has come and i feel the game has gotten a little easyer for me, groups come easy with 2 tanks per group being the norm. ive heard promises from the main live site and the FF forum goings about whats being said and whats in the works and its enough to sustain me on EQ. <br />
<br />
tho, thoughts of trying linage, DAoC, and some of the others are coming more and more often<br />
<br />
forgive me for going on and rambling i just really felt the need to explain where im coming from, i really used to think about all the great things id get to see and do as i leveled, but now that im at the end game i am finding no one wants to do all the things my toon grew up dreaming of seeing, and it saddens me, but i look foward to seeing PoP gods and mini's, as well as LDoN raids. but again, i cant get to 65 with 100 AAs as easy as some classes, so thats kinda far off to :/<br />
<br />
sorry for the complete lack of grammer and spelling but this is my feelings on my warrior's development and how ive come to enjoy the game, the enjoyments gone and i felt the need to say why and how, its almost like the warrior stock market crashed, work is hard to find and idle hands turn to protesting and flaming the people that burned down the game class i liked most</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very very few people &quot;Win EQ&quot;. As an alternative, you might want to go fight in a wide variety of zones and see as much of the game as possible. If you grind to hard and too long, you'll miss out on a lot of fun that you could be having insted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boofus</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've watched expansion after expansion come out, seen casters get grossly overpowered, I've seen pets take away my job. I've seen casters with over 500 plus AA's, I've seen bands of wizards take out mobs that usually required a full raid force, and now recently potime knights solo'ing dragons and tanking potime bosses...whats next I wonder.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the story, Ger.<br />
<br />
I have played my warrior since '99.  Although I have around 8 alts she has always been my main.  I started crafting for her so I could horde away funds, all the extra sold loot goes to her upgrading fund.  Its been a long road.<br />
<br />
And three days ago I just gave in.  <br />
<br />
I'm honestly tired of playing Vig.  I love being a warrior and I dig the concept of being a raid warrior, but in truth I came into the raiding game too late and it would take too much effort to gear her up.  And, really, there isn't much to do if you aren't the top string in the raiding game.  So that leaves groups, which are even sadder.  I don't have much of a spot in groups.  Sure, I can get into LDON missions even as the &quot;add tank&quot; - but I get so infuriated at the concept, so tired of the &quot;in&quot; jokes about how warrior taunt sucks, that its not all that much fun. <br />
<br />
So I'll keep Vig and maybe bot her when needed.  Of course I still have so much attachment to the dang character I find I read the warrior boards about 10 times as often as the new class boards.  Hell, maybe SoE will fix this quagmire, but after listening to Scott Hartsman bullshit me to my face and squirm away from answering 100% legitimate questions with a parental admonition not to bring the subject up...its time to see how the enchanter lives.</div></div><hr />

/sigh<br />
<br />
/salute<br />
<br />
sorry to see you go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is why I wont quit.  I am a raid tank, first string. And the other night I had to bite my lip to not cry as my guild choose a shadow knight to tank over a me and the rest of the warriors.<br />
<br />
The day I quit being a warrior is the day I cancell my account. <br />
<br />
/salute to all who came before me and to all who still fight for our cause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knodis</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Felt really compelled to write here. Janari was my main for the longest time. There was something about standing in front of a Mob and taking a pounding, allowing myself to be beaten down for my guild. Jan was my Guilds SA and there were a lot of times that the MA didn't show so she was usally at the front hacking away.<br />
<br />
Our Guild Leader is a Monk, and I used to see him get upset over the hit that those guys took. I used to say to him, &quot;Don't sweat it bro, you can always group with me&quot; You see, the truth is I didn't get it. I used to wonder what his bitch was. <br />
<br />
I figured that as long as he could get guild groups, there shouldn't be a problem. Then slowly, but surely I started to understand. I watched time after time pick up groups grabbing SK's and Pally's over me. Then I understood that, guild groups won't fix the problem. <br />
<br />
I was glad that I had friends to support me in my guild and offer me spots, but it didn't matter how nice they were being, because my problem was not being addressed. There was no fix in my future that I could see. I left my guild to take some time away and solo a bit with my RL Wife (I love that Shammy), but ended up playing Jan less and less.<br />
<br />
I refuse to delete her, but there she sits, spinning around on my Character Select screen only used for time when someone begs me to take her out. Mostly now I play my alts, I have lost all hope in them ever fixing my Jan and it makes me sad at times. I don't have any bad feelings toward Pally's or SK's. They are just playing the cards they are dealt out. I dont blame those pick up groups for grabbing someone that can hold Agro better then me. <br />
<br />
I blame SOE. It's hard for me to say that too. I mean they provide a game for me to play that I love, and for the most part do a good job, But in this instance they dropped the ball. I wonder if I will ever play Jan again. She is 65 now with a decent amount of AA, but I just don't feel the same thrill anymore. Its a killer when Im trying to keep a mob in one place and it's just bouncing all over. <br />
<br />
Well thanks for hearing me out guys. I still come to these boards and a few other as well to see whats what. To those of you that still play and enjoy your Warrior, I envy you, and I wis you all the best of luck. Illegitimis nil carborundum (Don't let the bastards grind you down) It's too late for me.<br />
<br />
Jan</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hygardune said it best. We're Dinosaurs of the Kunark Era. I still don't mind though all these little critters are evolving exponentially around us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I don't blame knights for being better than us either. Like Knodis said, they're just playing the hand they were dealt, good for them.<br />
<br />
I started playing alts too now. The warrior was my second 65, there'll be more, I can put him down and play something else, or not play.<br />
<br />
...so why is it so goddamned hard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalantia</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's hard because we all develop sincere emotional attachments to our primary characters, the ones we play day in and day out.  I've always been one to think that our main is a reflection on our personality.. and that our attachment to that character is how much we like the way our lives are now.  A lot of us don't give up our characters because, in the hundreds of hours of play time we put into them, we stop seeing them as characters, but as extensions.. maybe even pieces of us, our mind and soul.<br />
<br />
I suppose I should flee that mob forming with the torches and pitchforks now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goern</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Goern was my third character, under Kunark. He was a incredible experience. He was me, in ways that I strive to be. Decisive, noble, sacrificing... I placed more of myself into the character than I imagined, and in turn I received more from him. I learned how to be more like I should be instead of what is easy.<br />
He is my only level 65, though I almost shelved him throughout the 50's. Now I look at my schedual, and my life, and say, &quot;do I still have it in me to put up with 3 hour LFG sessions when I only have 4 hours to play?&quot; I literally fell asleep at the keys after 2 hours LFG about 2 mornings ago. Only waking minutely to check my tell window. Where is the fun in a game that you cannot play?<br />
It's like a 2 hour loading screen... guild chat and Alliance chatter don't impact it... it's the realization that you CANNOT do what you used to. No one wants you... Do I still have it in me to log in? <br />
Sigh... Depressing line this turned into.<br />
<br />
I have a thought for Woody, A warrior Standing there going &quot;Dammit I broke down and said FINE I will make your damn coffee, why won't you group me now??&quot; and the casters saying &quot;Sorry, the dev team gave SK's and Pallies Coffeemakers thismorning, but don't worry, they only come in premium blends.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Altho warriors do need a bit of work, i doubt i could ever have as much enjoyment on any other class. In many ways i have had a blessed run with him. Leveled when warriors were still the first choice tank and was MT or one the MTs in every guild i was in. <br />
<br />
As knight classes grew more powerful i was lucky to be well <br />
equipped enough that i was never affected by that and at this stage have very little agro problems.<br />
<br />
This has given me a very biased view on warriors, i have been looking at the class through rose tinted classes for a long time.<br />
<br />
Personally i am very happy for knight classes, after needing help themselves for so long they deserved the changes they got, altho agrolock is a mistake, dumbs down the game.<br />
<br />
Someday we will get the fix we are after and so will monks. Hopefully sooner than later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny people complain about the bands of wizards and manaburn.  alot of kunark dragons were already dying at that point to single groups of the l33t.  But if one group can kill instantly.... that's overpowered....        cause that one group has to wait another 1.5-2.5 hours to kill another....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL...<br />
<br />
yeah now that group of wizards needs to cast 2 SoS's and still be 80% full of mana to kill that dragon...<br />
<br />
I am reminded of a Kurt Russel movie, Soldier.<br />
<br />
I see warriors as the grizzeled old veterans and the knights as the pesky bio-engineered newbies. And Absor as the desk flying officer telling us we are Obsolete...</div></div><hr />
