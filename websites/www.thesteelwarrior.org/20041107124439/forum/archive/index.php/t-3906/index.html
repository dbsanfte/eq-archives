<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So yesterday I was playing my cleric in BoT and the group I was in had a BST tanking. He had around 5500 hp (with all buffs except brells). He pulled with his 65% slow spell and tanked until the shaman slowed with his 75% then the rest of the group nuked the mob down. Rinse and repeat. So there, Beatlords are taking the tank spot and they are doing well at that role. From my understanding BST is a light attack class (monk/shaman hybrid) and they should not be able to tank. As this particular BST was able to tank without any AA's I wonder how better he would get when he has CA CS LR and ID etc. Also, personally I don't think these AA abilities should be available to the DPS classes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1 XP mob versus 6 of you isn't supposed to be a matter of life and death.  I have seen Enchanter tank and they actually do it pretty well with Arcane Rune, and Eldritch Rune is like a right click 1500 HP if they have it.  <br />
<br />
If it's not Paladins it'll be Shadowknights who can tank.  If it's not SKs it'll be Rangers.  If it's not Rangers it'll be Beastlords.  If it's not Beastlords it'll be Druids.  There's always someone out there that can tank and have better aggro control than you.  But at some point a typical group will say that maybe it's not worth it spending that much mana to keep up a druid tanking and let someone with more HPs tank.<br />
<br />
For example a Ranger has better aggro control than a Paladin and certainly does more DPS.  But you don't hear people say let's get a Ranger to tank instead of the Paladin.  Just because a Beastlord can tank doesn't mean he can tank well, and if you're dealing with mobs that can't kill you at all, it'd probably be wiser to get a Ranger to tank instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  It is true that beastlords tanking in BOT in not as uncommon as one may think.  Just because we are able to are we better at it no, it does not.  Beastlords are part shaman/monk so we get some of the Migration of the monk and our utility spells from the SHaman.  We have a pet for added DPS which much of our DPS comes from.  We can nuke and DOT to point.  Those AA helps us in that role, helps us to solo and for grouping. Beastlords are one of the most balance class in EQ I rather see warriors brought up than any other class brought down.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Come on guys this is silly....people aren't saying &quot;hey should we get a BST or that warr to tank?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can tank...others do it better and I lose damage when I'm tanking.  Can tank when I need to, but I prefer to help kill rather than hold agro.  When I'm FoM the entire fight because I'm doing enough damage that if I nuke any other time than the end I pull agro,it then hits me that warriors need help.<br />
<br />
And as someone said...<br />
<br />
Anyone can tank once the mob has been slowed.  Since tanking is two parts, agro and surviveability, once the mob is slowed, almost anyone has the capability since you need a much smaller amount of surviveability.  Necros and enchanters can tank when it's slowed by liftapping or chain-runing.<br />
<br />
This is, however, the main reason people should be pushing for improvements...because warriors sorely need them anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm not trying to push for a Beatlord nerf I'm just upset at what this game has become. You guys are right that no one chooses a BST over the usual tank classes but give them some time and my guess is we'll be having more competition for the tank spot in exp groups. No wonder my warrior never finds LDoN pickup groups where mobs hit for much less. I haven't seen an enchanter or druid tanking higher tier PoP mobs yet but I won't be surprised when I see one. It's just sad to see the game going down like this. I'm only venting, nothing more. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kathrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Improvements? Yes, I am getting bored with my lvl 18 warrior. I think because of the lvl (too high/too low). I would improve the bandaging or the heal rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">LOL this is all pretty much jive. <br />
<br />
You can set up your own LDON adventures if you have any initiative. <br />
<br />
If the exp is just Soooooooo slow from that you want Planes, then you are at the mercy of the group you ask to get in anyway.<br />
<br />
Having a BST be able to offtank well is great. It speeds up the pace of the Group immeasurably, as you are killing at least two mobs at once minimum, and by the time you are done with the first, the BST has the 2nd at 25%.<br />
<br />
Some of the fastest exp possible for non-ubers is bringing a 65 BST with you.<br />
<br />
BST's are fine. Leave em alone. It's not like there are millions of them running around, they won't tank over us in Eplanes, and DONT invite them to your LDON group if you are that insecure :p<br />

<br />
<br />
As PoN Ambassador to TSW it is your duty to intercept and hijack all threads relative to the knight or not and inject them with a message similar to &quot;Don't nerf Paladins.  This will not help you.  You like Paladins.  They are not the cause of your trouble.  These are not the droids, err I mean nerfs, you are looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
The jedi mind trick doesn't work on us.  The latest message is kind of funny though, &quot;if Paladins get nerfed then Wars will lose the tank role to pets, beasts, enchanters, monks, and rangers&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once and for all, here is the deal, I don't care if beasts, monks, rangers, pets, etc tank better than me, I just don't want Pallies to do it better than me. :p<br />
<br />
<br />

Monk avoidance superiority is not nearly as big as people seem to think. Monks avoid about 5% more hits. Hardly earthshattering.</div></div><hr />

I don't get it ... I go /lfg during a raid and I get 3 or 4 tells for LDoN adventures.  (Maybe this will change when I hit 65?  I'm only 60 today.)<br />
<br />
When I try to pull a beastlord, bard, or mage into an LDoN group, I often get a lot of resistance.  But the group is always happy with the outcome.  I don't do much in the Planes yet - most of the people I enjoy grouping with are sub-60, and doing a lot of LDoN XP-ing.<br />
<br />
I got plenty of things about the game that I'd like to see changed, but they're not about class vs. class balance, they're about game/world mechanics and plausibility (for example, I don't feel  that my  Sarnak Warhammer (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6613)  should be aggro-ing 56+ MOBs).  The Beastlord class isn't one of the things I need to see changed.</div></div><hr />

Beastlords can slow all by themselves. That makes them a very viable tank alternative if they've got the AC and HPs to take the punishment.<br />
<br />
Beastlords in LDoN are staggeringly good.<br />
<br />
Regarding beastlord mitigation and avoidance ...<br />
<br />
Beastlords have OLD monk mitigation. You know that stuff you all used to hate so much. Yup, Beastlords have it.<br />
<br />
They have pretty standard avoidance.<br />
<br />
And they have the wonderful discipline of stonestance.<br />
<br />
If Paladins, these days, make great actual tanks ... Beastlords are certainly AMAZING offtanks.<br />
<br />
And isn't that what got monks into trouble in the first place?<br />
<br />

Back to  h8/no-h8 for BST tanking ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Slow doesn't make you a good tank unless you only slow when you're tanking (which I swear some Enchanters do).  There is no reason at all why one of overpowered Knight classes can't grab the agro off the Beastlord the mob is slowed.  Even Warriors don't have that much problem pulling off Beastlords as long as they're not using a lot of mana for offense.  <br />
<br />
Beastlord get some innate avoidance bonus like monks but it's not as high as what monks had.  Although Beastlord have more options are getting gear with reasonable AC, it's certainly not easy to get very high AC as a BST.<br />
<br />
And if you're talking about tanking stuff that can't kill you, like LDoN normal, then the monks are the best tanks.  Between critical mend and stone stance you're looking at a class that doesn't even take damage about 20% of the time versus unslowed mobs.  If mobs are actually slowed, a monk may very well never need to get healed at all while tanking.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
God I hate this line in a FANTASY GAME.<br />
<br />
If you hate &quot;magic pajamas&quot; at least get a clue and insist on realism for everything.   That means INC huge AC nerf on all the jewelery slots: rings, earrings and neck, as well smaller nerfs for masks.<br />
<br />
After all, if &quot;magic pagamas&quot; is so damn upsetting, how the hell do you think your 20AC ((or more)) earring/ring is blocking shit?<br />
<br />
Face it, Magic &gt; physical nature of the armor.<br />
Generally its easier to find &quot;strong/hard&quot; magic plate<br />
then magic pajamas.   But in either case its the magic that makes<br />
most of the AC.<br />
<br />
You'd almost have to reitemize the entire damn game.   Put AC<br />
caps on all non-magical armor.   Then put &quot;magic levels&quot; which add a consistant amount of AC per level.   ((think Ad&amp;d plate+1 &gt; chain+1.   Yet Plate+1=Chain+4 or some such))</div></div><hr />

Lol.  the magic pajema melees in my guild have 1200 to 1600 AC<br />
and up to 7500 HPS Fully Raid Buffed<br />
<br />
The magic plate melees in my guild have 1600 to 2k AC abd up to<br />

<br />
So I'd say the big bonus to plate is roughly 400 AC and 4k HPS.<br />
Big enough for you?<br />

It not that magic pajemas shouldn't exist.  They are just rarer.<br />

Is 400 AC enough?  Beats me...you have to tell me what AC actually means first before we can find out if that is enough.  Because of past design decisions this is a meaningless number.  What is worse you are comparing AC, a meaningless number, on one class to another.  Doubly meaningless.<br />
<br />
Yes, I expect a Time Warrior to tank just a bit better than a Time Beastlord.  As I would expect a Luclin Warrior to tank just a bit better than a Luclin Beastlord.  Having classes with high avoidance isn't bad.  Its using it for long term that has a devistating effect on any class that is built around mitigation tanking.<br />
<br />
landrain is very right.  AA points are supposed to enhance features already in the class.  Could these classes tank before?  What are they enhancing?  If LR/ID AA skills can make every melee class tank, then WHY O WHY did they give them to every class?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't a little better.  Its hugely better.  It's amazingly better.<br />
I will not accept one of our BSTs as MA doing a Hard Adventure.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't that Plate Tanks are not &gt; Equally Tiered Chain/Leather Tanks.  because they are.<br />
<br />
The real probelm <br />
<br />
It's that the player base bottom feeds because of mudflation.  When you are in Plane of Time Gear and doing old world zones, or normal adventures you just plain overpower it.   You no longer <br />
need the best tank anymore.    Hell my Druid with LR5/ID5 elemental gear can tank on normal.<br />
<br />
But, the bigger question is what the hell is he doing doing normal?<br />
<br />
AA's + Levels Increase to 65, has so increased the overall powerbase, that bottom feeding is even more doable now than it was ever.<br />
<br />
PS: AC isn't meanless either.   When Im bottom feeding in LDON normal, I don't even have to slow a mob with Top Plate Tanks.<br />
Don't have any chain/leather tanks that I have seen tank<br />
LDON normal without any slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Thanks Thaak, it is so much clearer now! ^_^<br />
<br />
400 AC is hugely better?  Better than what?  I challenge you to tell me what 1600 AC on a Warrior, 1600 AC on a Paladin and 1600 AC on Monk really means.  AC is a worthless field.  You can barely compare it between players of the same class.  The only measure it gives is that 1600 AC on that player is better than 1550 on that same player.<br />
<br />
Okay ignore all of that.  Reguardless of how it happened, it happens (which I've been saying it happens for awhile now).  Who cares about the justification: light armored classes should NOT be able to actively tank &quot;modern&quot; content...EVER.  There is simply no justification for it happening.  This is yet one of those things that screws Warriors extra hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I blame itemization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">&quot;Slow doesn't make you a good tank unless you only slow when you're tanking&quot;<br />
<br />
Slow reduces the mobs DPS, improving the beastlord's ability to absorb damage. A beastlord with gaudy AC and HPs can take the punishment. A beastlord using flash of light, some cheesy disease spells and that slow can maintain aggro, like a shaman or a chanter can, because mobs hate those types of spells.<br />
<br />
So, in the world of tanking a beastlord can keep aggro if they want. A beastlord can absorb damage pretty well.<br />
<br />
Seems like they fit the requirement.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Beastlord get some innate avoidance bonus like monks but it's not as high as what monks had.&quot;<br />
<br />
Psssssst ... /em looks from side to side ... /whispers &quot;it's called BLOCK.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beastlords inherit it from the monk class.<br />
<br />
Block + high AC + NO mitigation nerf is what made monk tanks so overpowering.<br />
<br />
I leave the rest to your imagination, regarding beastlords. But I will say this, if a MONK can tank Fennin Ro, there's no reason a beastlord can't, with similar gear.<br />
<br />

400 AC is hugely better?  Better than what?  I challenge you to tell me what 1600 AC on a Warrior, 1600 AC on a Paladin and 1600 AC on Monk really means.  AC is a worthless field.  You can barely compare it between players of the same class.  The only measure it gives is that 1600 AC on that player is better than 1550 on that same player.<br />
<br />
Okay ignore all of that.  Reguardless of how it happened, it happens (which I've been saying it happens for awhile now).  Who cares about the justification: light armored classes should NOT be able to actively tank &quot;modern&quot; content...EVER.  There is simply no justification for it happening.  This is yet one of those things that screws Warriors extra hard.  <br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
That's the point though really.  1600 AC on a Warrior, paladin, monk, bst should all mitigate the same.  Warrior and Pally can reach 1600 AC far easier than a leather wearer.  <br />
<br />
Velios screwed up the itemization.  It made the top AC items<br />
All/All allowing that an NTOV level Warrior had roughly the same AC as NTOV Monk.<br />
<br />
POP fixed that at least.   Monks actually lost AC from thier Luclin to Time days.  ((no more 60 AC legs for example))<br />
<br />
now a top bst with 1600 AC in Time Gear &gt; Plate 2 Expansions  behind them with samish AC &amp; HPs.   Is that a problem?  No.<br />
<br />
Not as long as a plate at the same level of the game &gt; leather<br />
wearer at the same level of the game... All is good.</div></div><hr />

Wow.  I can't believe I missed this piece of bull.<br />
Thats friggen ridiculous.   beyond ridiculuos.<br />
<br />
That's like a cleric saying &quot;light heal priests should NOT able to actively heal &quot;modern&quot; content.. EVER.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's like a shaman saying &quot;light slowers should NOT be able to actively heal &quot;modern&quot; content... EVER.&quot;<br />
<br />
that's way over the top.  <br />
<br />
First) Modern content is a HUGE range of power.   Plane of Time down to Tier1/Normal LDON.     Of course people who way over power an area can &quot;tank&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Second) There's a huge difference between saying ACTIVELY DO something and DO IT AS WELL.   No light melee class should be able to tank AS WELL as an equal plate.  Guess what.... they dont.<br />
<br />
No Druid should heal as well as a cleric.  Guess what.  they don't.<br />
<br />
in either case, a group using a lesser fit is getting less XP per hour<br />
or doing weaker targets.  AS THEY SHOULD.<br />
<br />
When POT Plate tank ets 7500 for a CH.  and a POT BST is getting CHed for 5k.  Not only does the Bst get 5k damage quicker than the plate gets 5k damage ((AC))  but the heals are less efficient and they drain more mana from the healer.<br />
<br />
Can they do it?  Yes.   Should they be able to?  Yes.<br />
Can they do it equally well.   No.   Should they be able to?  no</div></div><hr />

AC has been, and as far as SOE cares,  a competely made up nonsense number.  Simply put: IT MEANS NOTHING.  These days it no longer even has a strong corelation to tanking ability.  Who cares how hard it is to reach some level on a number that MEANS NOTHING?<br />
<br />
It is never &quot;all good&quot; when classes that are designed to avoid damage turn into classes that actively seek it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I realize that.   But what also should get mentioned<br />
is substitute a matching plate tank for that BST and your looking at around 6500 hps.<br />
<br />
Now imagine the difference ont he healers mana.   Say the cleric<br />
was good enough to land heals at 20% life.  That means with BST they are for 400 mana ((less spec/aa)) healing 4400 compared to healing 5200 with the plate.  Thats roughly 20% more often the cleric is hitting CH.  <br />
<br />
Bigger question would be, do you think the groups Kills Per Hour<br />
would have gone up or down if you put in a better tank.<br />
I suspect down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">If you think Beastlord can tank you obviously never seen what Monks can do for easy areas.  They don't even take damage at least 20% of the time.  Anyway, slow is not part of the tanking quality because Slow is universal.  Once a mob is slowed anyone enjoys the reduced damage bonus, not just the person who slowed it.  There is no special difficulty to pull a mob off a Beatslord at least compared to a Shaman, and certainly the overpowered Knight classes can do this easily.  Warriors might run into trouble, but it's certainly no harder than pulling it off an Enchanter (who may need to tash).  <br />
<br />
By your logic, in a slower-less group, adding any slower would make that slower the best tank in the group since no matter who the slower is, he can tank any mob slowed better than the existing tanks can tank versus an unslowed mob.  It just doesn't work that way.  How well you can tank can only depend on what you can do that doesn't affect anyone else.  Druid's attack debuff line drops mob DPS by a noticeable chunk, but this doesn't mean Druid is a good tank.  Even if their attack debuff is so powerful that it makes mobs automatically hit for min damage, it doesn't mean groups are suddenly going to seek out druids for tanks because anyone with more HP that can grab the agro off the druid is still a better tank (and there's quite a number of such classes).  <br />
<br />
BTW, at least half of Fennin Ro's DPS comes from his damage bonus.  It is not at all surprising a high end monk can tank him.  I heard a rogue tanked Time Bertoxxulous for 50% of his health or something like that and I don't think a Rogue tanks better than a monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">There's a shaman in the group correct?  Put one of the hated Knights classes to tank instead of the Beastlord and I&quot;ll guaranteed that group will be killing faster than before.  Last time I checked people said being able to cast nuke as fast as possible and slow on incoming is the criteria for faster kills and certainly the hated Knight classes can do this, and they tank better than the Beastlord for sure too.  Or better yet just swap the Knight for the Shaman and have the Beastlord do DPS and slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That wasn't my logic.<br />
<br />
My logic was this ...<br />
<br />
A beastlord has the MITIGATION of an un-nerfed monk. You know that mitigation you all hated so much back in the day when you complained a lot about Monk AC from all/all items? Well beastlords have it. And beastlords can wear the same all/all items.<br />
<br />
Beastlords have BLOCK, the hideously overpowered avoidance skill you all hate so much.<br />
<br />
They have stonestance, the hideously overpowered discipline that you all hate so much because it encroaches on defensive.<br />
<br />
For all intents and purposes a beastlord is a pre-nerf monk when it comes to damage absorption.<br />
<br />
ADD TO THIS the fact that THEY can slow on their own, making the need for a slower less useful ...<br />
<br />
ADD TO THIS the fact that SLOW carries with it huge aggro (or have you forgotten all of those threads complaining about how warriors can't get aggro from the slower?)  ...<br />
<br />
ADD TO THIS the fact that they can debuff to hold aggro ...<br />
<br />
And what you have is a formula for a more effective &quot;TANK&quot; than a pre-nerf monk ever would have been.<br />
<br />
Why? Because they can HOLD AGGRO better than monks ever could, but can take the punishment that monks could take.<br />
<br />
It's sort of hypocritical to complain so much about superior monk tanking on one hand and then to totally dismiss a class that can tank just as good as that superior monk tank AND can hold aggro off of a warrior at will if they so felt inclined.<br />
<br />
ESPECIALLY when the overwhelming majority of AGGRO complaint threads I read here have to deal with HYBRIDS (what beastlords are) being able to hold aggro over warriors (something beastlords can do).<br />
<br />
So it really boils down to two things ...<br />
<br />
EITHER a pre-nerf monk was NEVER going to be a tanking threat, because as you can see, the SUPERIOR version of it, the beastlord isn't a tanking threat to the warrior class in the post-PoP era ...<br />
<br />
OR beastlords are more of a tanking threat than you give them credit for.<br />
<br />
Either way it doesn't bother me. Just pointing out the contradictions in your own warrior logic.<br />
<br />
If stun is overpowering ... a class that can SLOW to obtain aggro and then take all the punishment of the infamous PRE-NERF monk is certainly worth some of your attention.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Come on guys this is silly....people aren't saying &quot;hey should we get a BST or that warr to tank?&quot; <br />
<br />
- I havent heard that.  But after joining a recent group, someone accidentally said &quot;why do we need a paladin when we already got a BST to tank, AND slow.&quot; (I had just joined the group).<br />
<br />
- There is no reason at all why one of overpowered Knight classes can't grab the agro off the Beastlord the mob is slowed. <br />
<br />
- If you played a knight youd know that there ARE a good number of beastlords out there that give us the run for our money,  err mana.  I have gotten it to the point where I gave up on being a tank in some xp groups as agro from a BST is too high for me to play with as I have to deal with their  combination of nuking and  meleeing and they also have pets and they also slow the mob on incomings, and well, I just got behind the mobs and asked for ferocity :P instead of casting any more stuns on it in attempts to gain agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even in the thread you cite, you could find another Warrior with the same AC levels but with different gear and different AA skills will churn out different numbers.<br />
<br />
Comparing that AC number in a class is dubious because it doesn't reflect &quot;tankability&quot;.  Trying to compare that same crazy number across classes is somewhat baseless and borderlines on impossible.</div></div><hr />

But that confused people, so they made it one number which has very little relavance to anything at all, people just know that more is better... of course 1600 AC on a war is different than 1600 AC on a monk, but who really knows what that means..</div></div><hr />

Yeah it does.  I misquoted and added the word almost to the wrong spot.  Original --&gt; proper &lt;--- spot for &quot;almost&quot; was later when conclusion was &quot;For all intents and purposes a beastlord is a pre-nerf monk when it comes to damage absorption.&quot;<br />

should be reworded &quot;For all intents and purposes a beastlord is a almost a pre-nerf monk when it comes to damage absorption.&quot;</div></div><hr />
