<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few months ago the Overlord Trisun declared war on the Halflings of Norath. The Dreaded Overlord Trisun formed the WEAH (Wood Elves Against Halflings) his goal is to destroy all Halfings: Burn down Rivervale, disqualify them from wining loot, eat their children. The WEAH has recruited many people in thier Campaign of Hate.<br />
<br />
A few days ago Andrej could no longer take the Hate that was The Dreaded Overlord Trisun and decided to do something about it. So DHER (Different Heights Equal Rights) was formed to combat the Evil of WEAH.<br />
<br />
Please join DHER to combated the Evil of WEAH. show your support in any way you can. DHER in your sig, or shout it from time to time when you zone and spread the word when ever you can. WEAH wont just stop at the distruction of the Halflings they will move on untill only the Woodelves are left on Norath.<br />
<br />
*Pumps his fist in the air* Different Heights Equal Rights!</div></div><hr />

WEAH will destroy the Half Elves and High Elves also. if your not a Wood Elf then you are not safe from WEAH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rumoured to be one of the coming new LDoN armour pieces.  6,000 points.<br />
<br />
Can't take armour dyes, and is mebbe a wee bit more flourescent than an actual lime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hmmm based on lore, Wood Elves are the most tolerant of all the elven races. They are the only elves to accept Half Elves...<br />
