<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, been searching though the library, but have been unable to find anything regarding damage caps. According to Caster Realm, damage cap goes away at 20, yet my Tantors Tusk is doing like 60 - 65 max. I guess there is another cap at 30? I've even heard about a cap at 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Damage caps rise periodically as you level, yes. Think there's another one at 50, then more caps come in smaller increments all the way to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's not 30, it's like uhh...26 or 27 or something that your tantors tusk should start doing 120's.  I had a weighted axe when I hit 20 too, but it wouldn't hit for more than 60 or so until my high 20's, then i started doing the bigger hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is completely based on my brain, which as a warrior is rattled and squished around alot...however.  I remember a considerable damage jump at 20 when the cap is removed.  And another one at 25 when I got my first damage &quot;bonus&quot; (I was in high keep and feeling arrogantly confident at the time too).  At the time I was talking with some other melee and they mentioned similar damage bonuses every 10 or 5 or so levels, diminishing returns after the cap removed at 20, putting the most noticable jump at 25....but still something to look forward to.<br />
