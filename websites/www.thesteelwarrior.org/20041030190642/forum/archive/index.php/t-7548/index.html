<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkmoose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I got this here Magelo thing working. I'm happy with my str and sta for now, looking to up Dex a bit so it would be maxed with buffs. I know there's cruddy AC on the Seawind, but that Dex boost is awesome. I have a CHoS and SotB socked away for when I get higher, and of course am still trying to sell the SBoD I foolishly bought before finding this site. Other than that, I'm trying to get people to do EF LDoNs so I can work on the Anger augs. Appreciate any advice. Most I'll be doing is tanking for a small guild, so no huge raids in the future.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your gear looks just fine.  Go out and get some levels.  However, once you've hit your 50s or so, I'd try to replace your rings with Valorium Gallentry Rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkmoose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ugh, I forgot to ask in the above post if there are any decent charms I should go after for my level. I see lots of people with that Intricate Wooden Figurine, I think it is, but as I understand it that's for PoP. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are so overgeared for your level it's not even funny. Just level. Get the Wooden Figurine when you get high enough. Other charms are pretty much pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level 51 is required for the wooden figurine and it doesn't get stats until you start getting PoP flags.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">buy one of those 4 adventure point charms from the ldon merchant for now. what can i say but its cheap?<br />
<br />
as for grouping in everfrost to save up for anger augs. its going to take you 575 adventures there at 2 points per adventure at level 34. id say for the time being take whatever camp makes your group happy. indeed go for the ones that DONT have the gear you like now while the points are so poor because when you get in your 60s and the points head upward to 51 per mission you will be glad that you got the less important camps (like east com and south ro) out of the way. well i mean out of the way toward your 50win cap for the charm aug stats.</div></div><hr />
