<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deathcow</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been thinkin about some good grps offensively for BG. 1st offensively, i think u gotta have someone who can shapeshift (druid cat form) to carry the flag for speed.Next, a Warrior to Defend flag bearer. Also u need a good priest there to heal and Shield. But how about this...3 mages,  1 infront of flag bearer, 1 behind FB, and 1 close to FB all of which to lay down Frostnova, freezing everybody in place. If you can get to midfield before the fight, 1 mage can freez inital grp, 2nd mage to Refreeze em then the 3rd blink ahead to meet defensive grp and freeze. By the time the other side is done unthawing , u should be damn near the flagpole. Just a thought.... Any input would be helpful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, I find I play best while in the open field with a healer and some form of ranged attacker. we're great at scouting and cutting people off before they enter our base, and we're not far from backup at either end. if necessary I can intercept someone trying to gank our flag, and I can always lay down a fire sale of Hamstrings and TClaps if our flagbearer is being pursued.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">06-11-2005, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Driud to carry the flag, priest to heal and fear if needed, and any other classes to set off traps and slow defenders. Tauren druids will always have an advantage over night elves because of their stun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 4 Priests alternate throwing their 30 second cooldown 8 second fear. <br />
The 5 Mages blow things up with AE and sheep everyone constantly just for added cruelty.<br />
<br />
I sit back and laugh. =)</div></div><hr />
