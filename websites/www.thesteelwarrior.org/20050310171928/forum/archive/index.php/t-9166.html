Hopefully GMs will fix them up, but ... eww.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heard both good and bad...some folks getting their exp back, some not.  I know I would probably quit if I lost mine.  That would just be the last straw.<br />
<br />
Apparently it is tied to their method of payment, as it looks like those with expired cards and such were the key targets for this.  An oversight on the part of the Toon, sure, but should be easily replacable by a GM.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd think rathan de-activating the expansion they'd never allow it to go active. Oversight on the part of the toon nothing, they offered a pre-order and delivered the product. If they can afford to pop up the damn &quot;pre-order omens now&quot; screens for like 4 months, they can damn well afford to pop up a &quot;your credit card info is about to expire&quot; message too. They can't just take it away 2 weeks later. This happened to my wife and she's (understandably) good and pissed off about it.<br />
<br />
It took darn near forever for a GM to get back in touch with her, and then they told her to call tech support from 9am to 5 pm PST, and THEN she'd have to re-petition (and wait hours on end for a GM to show up AGAIN) to get her levels back. WTF!?! <br />
<br />
All that in addition to the fact she wanted to xp last night and got screwed.<br />
<br />
What the hell happened to the &quot;kindler, gentler SOE&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sad part is this same type of bug has seemed to happen after each expansion that allowed higher levels.<br />
    They might be different bugs technically with each expansion but you think by now they would have a solution or at least be prepared to quickly fix the people's accounts that get hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went and updated my cards expiration date before the new expansion was released for that exact reason.  It is amazing that it is not a problem with monthly payments, but it is when paying for a new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mishratm</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got me personally, no idea what the problem was, expiration date is a few years away yet (I updated it earlier this year). Had plenty of cash too, because I simply clicked buy OoW again today, and it took my money and gave me OoW again.<br />
Lost all my levels, but a guide *assured* me that I would get back xp and that GM's could do it while I was off line (I play aussie times, never have GMs on during our playtime). <br />
If they can't, it'll be 5years of eq come to an end.<br />
<br />
Funny thing was, that they managed to credit my beastlords account with omens, and my  wizbot as well. Both kept xp gained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I just got a call from my wife. She called SOE tech support, and after an hour of getting hung up on because of &quot;high call volume&quot; finally got some tool on the phone. Basically the deal is that their autobilling for the monthly fee can continue billing on a long expired credit card, but when they try to process a new transaction for the expansion it fails. Apparently they give it 2 weeks and then just roll it back. She preordered the expansion, and so they hadn't tried to bill until it was released.<br />
<br />
This is some serious stupidity on their part, first because of the terrible technical support and second just the stupidity of the situation in the first place. For the amount of money they make off this game you would think they could afford to send a &quot;your pre-ordered expansion was unable to be billed&quot; message, or even better, (heres a barn burner) try to pre-authorize the card when you pre-order to see if it's still valid.<br />
<br />
No idea what happened to mishratm, though.<br />
<br />
Or they could just check the damn expire date. I've written several e-commerce websites and every time we end up manually checking the expire date before even sending the card off to be checked. 3 cheers for &quot;herd-of-monkeys&quot; programming.<br />
<br />
This seems to be a commonish problem, too. SOE needs to get on a grip on this shit or theres gonna be a lot of &quot;voting with our money&quot; going on when WoW is released. <br />
<br />
p.s. Oh yeah. Last night she had to petition. She typed /petition and couldn't figure out the new &quot;customer service interface&quot;. Well it turns out you have to do a KB search before it lets you submit. So we do that. And it STILL won't let us submit the petition. Turns out you gotta open the (useless) article before it lets you. WTF kind of customer service is that? I never /petition unless theres a major issue with their programming, and they insult me with a list of KB questions like &quot;how will the new particle effects affect my gameplay&quot;. And it still took 6 hours for a GM to attend to the petition and do nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few people in my guild that have deleveld anywhere from 66-70 back to 65 because of a similar problem.  Someone said in guild chat that they wouldn't be giving the levels back but I doubt it.  I'm assuming that person is just the kind of guy that tries to make a bad situation worse because they like the attention.  I would assume they will give the people their levels back, but like anything involving a GM it will take lots of unnecessary hours to get it.  <br />
<br />
Sorry to all that have to put up with this crap   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mishratm</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was on late last night in the bazaar, and there was guide online.  I sent him a tell directly (which he assured me under the new guide program was fine to do) to find out about the xp loss etc. He said I'd need to wait for a GM. Sooooo, about 20mins later a GM-Admin logged in (Adhay). I sent them a tell, and ran to the bazaar (I was in PoK) and found them. Sat next to them in the bazaar where they stayed for approximately 30mins. Didn't respond to my tells, or my hails, or the fact I mentioned it was 1am and I'd like even a quick answer before I went to bed. After that, he disappeared.<br />
<br />
I've already petitioned (after re-purchasing OoW) and got a message back on the ticket saying that I'd need to contact tech support and/or re-purchase the expansion and then contact a GM for xp reimbursement when they are online. (yay for people who don't understand english very well). <br />
<br />
Frustrated, I logged into the chat area now, and I've just spoken to a GM, who has said (directly to me) that everyone would get back xp, it could be done while off-line (yay) and that the characters wouldn't be rolled back, but manually have xp loss readjusted. (Ie was stated that &quot;There would be no roll back of characters for this issue&quot;). I guess now it's just a matter of waiting for however long it takes for them to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the update Mishra, my wife will be happy to hear that she can continue playing and not worry about being rolled back, at least. Supremely frustrating for guides and gm's in particular to be so unresponsive... honestly, how many tells can they really be getting? if it's so many, they ought to have a special interface to help them ensure they don't miss important ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mishratm</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They do have a special interface for dealing with these issues. From my past 24 hours experience with them, the interface appears to be based around control + C, and control +V</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is intolerable.<br />
<br />
This happened with Kunark<br />
<br />
and PoP <br />
and NOW oow.<br />
<br />
Everytime they update the level cap this happens.  SOE needs to redesign the character reference file (once you purchase OOW and activate the first time this flag needs to be updated and coordinated with other subsytems).<br />
<br />
People I know who have had this happen HAD oow activated.  The problem is that some subsystem DEACTIVATED it.  This is a system DESIGN bug that SOE will not/cannot fix.</div></div><hr />
