<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ScruffyTheHonkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I'm new to EQ and I'm thinking of playing a Halfling warrior, because i like the funny little halflings, and i dont want to be a caster(spells too much cash) so if some ppls could give me tips it would be greatly appreciated (SP?) Thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First, do the tutorial.  There are some nice rewards if you talk to all of the NPCs in the tutorial and do what they ask.  If you are totally new to the game then this will give you enough info to get started.  You can also go up to level 5 by hunting monsters within the tutorial's caverns if you like.  I thought it was fun and worthwhile.<br />
<br />
When you decide to leave the tutorial, you'll appear in Rivervale at the warrior trainer.  The trainer has some quests for you which result in pieces of warrior armor.  These quests are a lot of fun and definitely worth doing.  As you gain each level, you'll become strong enough to do one more piece of the armor set.  By level 15 you will have a complete set of armor and probably a new weapon too.  This is the most fun and rewarding way to get up to level 15.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior gear isn't cheap to get the good stuff.  But, by all means do the tutorial and do the newbie quests from your trainer.  They are fun and give you decent gear for those levels</div></div><hr />
