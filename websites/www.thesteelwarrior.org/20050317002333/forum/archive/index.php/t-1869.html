Have these items been removed from the drop tables ?  When was the last time anyone can confirm BF dropped, seems like we used to get one every three kills or so, certianly not 20+ without one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigrr7th</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cursed dropped a BF for me a little under two weeks ago. Hategiver has only dropped twice on our server since SoL release, and one poofed in a zone crash/rollback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's remarkably bad luck on Cursed. In theory he drops a BF every 6th kill on average, as his weapons are pretty much even on drop rates. Read other people having no Rog daggers or G-rods etc etc after many kills.<br />
<br />
 Hategiver on the other hand you're about par for the course on. It's retarded level of rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got our first Bloodfrenzy on our 4th or 5th Cursed and another on the next one (mine) and none since.<br />
But have done Cursed about 10 times total only.<br />
But according to what i heard we were very lucky.<br />
Someone said in GC that he had a source from another guild on server that had 1 out of 30 cursed.<br />
I think we had only one Goldenrod so far.<br />
<br />
XtC dropped Hategiver only once for us so far in about a dozen or more kills.<br />
At least on Terris it is not that rare, i think there were at least 3 drops since we started killing him for other guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">40+ Cursed kills; 1 Bloodfrenzy, I believe on first kill ever<br />
<br />
XTC has been a bit more friendly; 4 HG's on about 30</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 2 frenzies (one guild, one sister guild) in 10 cursed kills, 2 in our last 3 kills to be specific. 1 hg (in guild) in 7 xtc kills. To sum it up we're lucky i'd say. <br />
<br />
Goldenrod's have been our rare drop, thankfully. 3 khalz, 2 rng claws, 2 monk fangs, 1 gr, 2 frenzies.<br />
<br />
*Make that 3 now in last 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 bfs, ton of monk 1h, few ranger 1hs, and no GR or khal.  with such a deep loot table, its real easy to have a string of bad luck.<br />
<br />
sad thing really is all our monks wanted the emp 2h heh, was a total waiste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">5 BF's on like 15 cursed and 3 HG's on around 20 XTC.  I guess we got pretty lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 BF in 8 kills for us BTW.<br />
<br />
1 HG in 10 XTC. By the time Ssra really freed up for us PoP was almost out so didn't get to farm them as much as we'd have liked=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ssra is a big clusterfuck on Terris atm.<br />
~ 130 in zone yesterday on prime GMT time, 5 different US guilds with the 2 bigger GMT guilds in PoEarth and VT.<br />
Btw we havent seen monk weapon off cursed yet, our common is ranger fang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgor</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we ve got 4 BF out of 20ish cursed and 1 HG out of 20ish XtC <br />
<br />
From what I heard from other guilds and from my own experience I would say that you can expect 1 BF every 5/6 Cursed and 1 HG every 15/20 XtC .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have have killed cursed 5 times, drops go Bloodfrenzy, Goldenrod, Fangs, Khalshazar, Render<br />
<br />
Next one should be a ranger claw and we've done the lot in sequence :)<br />
<br />
XTC first kill gave a hategiver, none since.<br />
<br />
AoW has coughed up 4 BoC in 6 killings.<br />
<br />
Tough to get these mobs - on Tunare this week 2 of our 3 time guilds killed AoW and Cursed respectively, gotta love that bottom-feeding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Briq</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">haven't had a BF drop in awhile, but we rarely go to ssra anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moving this to the battlefield for now, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 Bloodfrenzy in like 25 Cursed kills, one Hategiver in about 10 XtC kills.  <br />
<br />
I have a screenshot of AoW with 3 BoCs somewhere still, that was a good day..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got 1 bloodfrenzy, 2 khalshazare, 5 or so Goldenrod, a bazillions ranger weapon, and 2-3 monk/bst ones...<br />
<br />
I believe the rarest weapon drop is the Khal, but Cursed is extremely contested, and raced for on brell, so the distribution is weird at times.</div></div><hr />
