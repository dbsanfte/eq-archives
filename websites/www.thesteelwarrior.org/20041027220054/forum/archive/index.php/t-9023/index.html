<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What this is not:  An &quot;uber&quot; versus &quot;unuber&quot; thread.<br />
<br />
What this is:  a legitimate concern that Sony has placed a mob smack in the midst of the Epic 1.5 that requires post-elemental geared folks with strong saves.  <br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm mistaken (and I really may be so I'm totally down with honest corrections here), but I thought I understood Epic 1.5 to be generally for the non-raiding warrior while Epic 2.0 was hands down intended for the raiding warrior only.  In addition, Epic 1.5 was intended to be completed with solo, 1-group, and 2-group content. <br />
<br />
If that is accurate, and I believe that it is, did someone on Sony's development staff miss the memo?  Why must we kill Girplan Devourer,a  mob that rampages, flurries, and hits for max 2500-ish; while also casting a DoT that inflicts 500hp/tick?  This is an honest complaint and point for discussion, so I'd like some thoughts on it.  Am I over-estimating the difficulty of the mob?  I've seen &quot;casual&quot; raids of 40+ people fail handily on Sula Dar from the first couple casts of his DD which do 2k and is cast every 24 seconds.  The DoT does that same amount of damage in the same amount of time.  I can read that it may be dispelled by his other AE, but theoretically he won't cast that AE immediately after the DoT so folks are going to take at least a few ticks of the DoT each time unless they have massive resists, which most nonraiders do not.  How exactly, then, is this mob doable for nonraiders with less than a semi-zerg force?  Honest question, here.  I'm open to suggestions.  If nonraiders _really can_ take him down with the 1-2 groups that I understood Epic 1.5 was intended for, then I'd like to hear about it. <br />
<br />
(I moved this to rants, not necessarily because it is a rant, but because I was worried about what it had the probability of becoming, but I really would like folks' thoughts and insight on this...)</div></div><hr />

either they are one groupable with top non raider (after reaching lvl70, 900AA and having the top one groupable gears of all EQ -&gt; being hardcore gamer for me). but then it means EP will be accessible to one/two group forces ??? <br />
well answer is clear, we are the exception of the statment &quot;most of the epic [1.5] could be done solo or with 1 group, but not all of it&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You so realize this is a type 8 augment weapon with in the neighborhood of 200hps and a Time quality ratio with time quality stats right?<br />
<br />
As long as your defensive works on this mob and it's hps are relatively low a minor raid force should be able to drop this mob.  I'd be miffed if it was alll doable solo/duo or with a six-man strike force.<br />
<br />
I'm just now lv 69, and starting this quest soon after i finish up my new defensive aa's and maybe delay death.  I hope it's hard and long.  I want my epic to mean something.  With the stats this thing carries ... content must reflext content.  I dont mind haveing 2 EP-Timish encounters required to get it as long as they are triggerable.<br />
<br />
Look on the bright side ... you aren't locked out of the zones these fights take place.  Sony dropped those kind of requirements (which is good) ... but dont expect them to spoon feed you stuff now that it's open.  Everyone still has to kill the same stuff to get the same junk  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm hearing some epics are requiring Elemental access (like the shaman or necro)...although I think those pieces might be droppable.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it may not just be a Type 8 augment.  If it's anything like the SK 1.5 epic, it will have both a Type 4 and a Type 8 augment.  We'll have to wait and see first though.  There's a few hard mobs in the epic quest so far (Girplan Devourer being a good one, from what I see), that should give non-raiders a good workout. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm thinking/hoping this will not be a huge problem. There are going to be enough people that want these mobs dead that are not in raiding guilds that it should be possible to get &quot;pick-up&quot; raid mob raids together.  The thing that will tell us if SoE put a decent amount of thought into these is whether or not the raid mobs drop some other goodies for other classes that will entice them to come help out.  Or if they put drops from more than oe epic on the same mob. Something like that to encourage people to cooperate.<br />
<br />
Anyway, old rules still apply....if you want help with your epic mobs, go out of your way to help other people with theirs. :)<br />
<br />
Now, everyone proceed to the part where you say pick-up raids don't work, not worth it, etc, etc..Myself, I think it should be a good time, and fun to have a quest worth doing again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">but I bet that only one proc can fire from augs.<br />

<br />
I will reserve judgement on this until myself and my friends are all level 70, have most or all of our spells, and have had a few equipment upgrades.  If said group, along with another nearly identical group cannot defeat Girplan Devourer, then I may start to question the reasoning behind the 1.5 (It's a halfway point reward?)<br />
<br />
Girplan sounds rough at the moment, but I'm waiting for the hammer to drop.  The quest hasnt even been solved yet, there is something much bigger and meaner than Girplan hiding around the corner me thinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you missed the part of my post where I mentioned I believed we were TOLD it would be 1-2 groupable.  I suspect you were too busy admiring your own asshole prose. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is I don't actually mind time sinks and I don't mind extremely involved and long quests (I think its a fucking travesty that SKs and Necros have already completed 1.5) .  What I DO mind is the idea that we were informed 1.5 would be 1-2 groupable and it may turn out we need far more groups than that. <br />
<br />
I was told by a guildie last night that one of the epics may require an EP raidforce of nearly 40 people to handle a 30-add encounter.  I personally don't know anything about which epic or which encounter so it's pure hearsay at this point.  But the fact remains that many players somehow walked into this expansion believing 1.5 weapons would be obtainable through a time-consuming quest that required only 1-2 groups.   I mean, hell, maybe we all imagined that statement. Honestly, I just don't know. <br />
<br />
Maybe Moruk is right and at level 70 we'll be able to take Girplak out with 2 groups (Although I doubt it.  I'm not worried about my ability to tank a mob that flurries for max 2800.  I'm worried about the raid's ability to withstand the AE), in which case this is a moot point.  Except if Moruk is also right and we have a much more difficult encounter awaiting us down the line....</div></div><hr />

<br />
As did the quest designers. And BECAUSE of Kunark epics being that way, they SAID the new epics weren't going to follow that model. They SAID that 1.5 was going to be something, as Vigdis points out, small groups could work towards and acquire. They said the full epic 2.0 was going to be something that required big raid forces.<br />
<br />
It seems they may not have been completely honest about their quest designs however.<br />
<br />
SHOCKING where SoE is concerned isn't it?<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where exactly?<br />
<br />
They said that groups would be able to do it. For some reason, people see 'groups', which is plural, and pretend it means 'a single group'. That's just not the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think you are probably overestimating the difficulty of the mob somewhat.<br />
<br />
Fast forward a few months, when you and all your friends are level 70 and have gotten your runes.<br />
<br />
- The mobs hit you worse and your aggro is better. <br />
- Your AC, HP, DPS and proc rates have all gone up, purely through levelling and skill upgrades. <br />
- On top of those you may have new AA's and obtained better gear on the way. <br />
- Buffs are adding probably 700-800 more hp to everyone than they did in August. <br />
- Everyone's hp/mana regen have gone up. <br />
- Almost all classes are doing at least 20% more DPS. <br />
- Heal over time spells have improved hugely (ridiculously, even).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I agree with you Sass.<br />
<br />
Saying that a mob is far to difficult right when the expansion comes out is.....well....stupid.<br />
<br />
I can see the difference even from 65 to 67, I can't wait for 70. Is this really supposed to be so easy that anyone that just bought the expansion, has no new spells or levels or AA's or even gear is able to do it?<br />
<br />
I would think that you could no longer call it an epic quest. Give it a bit of time, most of us do not want it handed to them on a siver platter.<br />
<br />
If you can handle the Vxed part, and have a similar group or two to help you, you should have no problems killing the Devourer with the right tactics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see the word groups and thought it meant exactly that. Small groups. Like I said. Never once did I think they meant Raid Force.<br />
<br />
But, eh, I'm too used to playing a different game now. One where content is actually designed for less than 40 people.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Depends on what you're comparing it to I guess.  Our original epic absolutely required a pretty large raid force to get when it initially came out.  And if the stats of the other class's epic 1.5s are any indication, ours will be superior to most if not all of our time caliber weapons.  That may or may not include DBotW but most likely will include EoE.  That being the case, epic 1.5 should NOT be a walk in the park or you basically wipe out the need for any weapon of lesser quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm going to side with Sass and Moruk and say that we should wait until people get full groups of 70s with their spells to see if the Devourer is too difficut for 1-2 groups.<br />
<br />
Also remember, with GoD and some of the WoS gear the equipment you have can go up rather fiercely, as well as the tradeskill augments and tribute (anyone taken a look at some of that guild tribute?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't yet seen anything one-groupable that I consider to be better than my current planned upgrade path.  I trust that something may be found (or even that I may be wrong) but so far I just haven't seen it. <br />
<br />
As for the wait and see, I'm willing to wait out to 70 and see if it becomes more doable, but the concern was on my mind NOW as things are being unveiled (besides, it would have about .00067 percent interest coming five months from now  :p ).</div></div><hr />

I dont think I'm being unreasonable or jumping to conclusions, but I've been wrong before, I'd actually love to be wrong about this.<br />
<br />
I have read the 1.5 walkthroughs for necro, SK, warrior of course (up to date anyway), and now shaman.  My point is, that unless I've missed something in the shaman 1.5, it's not even in the same league.<br />
<br />
<br />
SK?  You get to fight a  mob that sounds rough.  &quot;Bring friends with you, as he quads for 2526 max, casts an AE for 2khp/1kmana, and does a single target 2 second stun. AE is every minute at -175 prismatic check, stun is every 30sec unresistable. He also single target rampages.&quot;  See: http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=22866<br />
<br />
Necro:  (http://necro.eqclasses.com/viewtopic.php?t=3240&amp;sid=96dbaea8eb6ddc67caab8fdeafdaa95b)<br />
You get to fight a mob that sounds rough.  &quot;I took 29 GoD equiped full time raiders, could be done with less. He hits for 3190ish max quad. Has an ae that can only be described by pathetic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warrior:  Girplan Devourer and Dragorn Champion sound a crapload harder than anything in the shaman 1.5, and the warrior 1.5 isnt even solved yet.  More baddies to come?<br />

Shaman (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23653): Where are the tough encounters that are enjoyed by the other classes?  Hardest hitting mob in their 1.5 is triple 1300?  This reaks of imbalance.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I'm concerned about.  The whole epic 1.0 thing was such demoralizer for me personally that I never want that kind of gross imbalance to occur again.  I was hoping that a lesson had been learned and past mistakes were not going to be repeated.<br />

 With no knowledge of the event before hand we managed to pull it off with about 20 EP geared people. <br />

C'mon now.  Let's BLOW the all of this out of proportion, shall we?  We're not talking about the German fucking Wehrmacht when we think 20 people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I play mostly with a small group of friends.  Guilds really don't interest me at all, too much politics, and well, too many ass-wipes.  I've come to realize that EQ isn't really the game for me, but for now it will have to do.  I'm waiting on EQ2 and hoping it will be better for the casual gamer.  If not, well I'm sure other games will come around that will be.  If it takes a raid force of 20 for epic 1.5 I won't be seeing it, and I won't really be crying about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Pappee Puddlejumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Why must we kill Girplan Devourer,a mob that rampages, flurries, and hits for max 2500-ish; while also casting a DoT that inflicts 500hp/tick? This is an honest complaint and point for discussion, <br />
<br />
I will give you two hints how to gimp this mob.<br />
<br />
1. you can bind in this zone<br />
2. he does not regen fast at all<br />
<br />
Dragorn Champion on the other hand will be your bottle neck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I am at the Devourer stage now, and plan to do him with 2-3 groups with most of us still working towards lvl70.<br />
<br />
He really does not sound that hard if you are setup right, even more so with being able to bind in the zone.<br />
<br />
Had a few groups of friends and guildies kill champ not long ago also, so even he is not that bad. Only a few of us have post-ele/KT level gear.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest bottleneck for non-raiding warriors is going to be Vxed as you can't ask around for more numbers. (At worst on the other mobs you can /random between warriors in a pickup raid as for who gets the drop ala how old 1.0 used to be done back in the day)<br />
<br />
Vxed pretty much requires good DPS and a decently geared tank (or good ench/snarer combo) seeing as you have to go to the 4 corners of the zone.</div></div><hr />
