<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azlana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">jes postin on any questions bout expansion....<br />
<br />
mebbe dat be right time ask bout mes arma modifications?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So long as the replies to his post are well thought out, relatively intelligent and not overtly inflammatory, he might even read what we have to say. That is, of course, assuming he even comes here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hope for his sake he doesn't come here with anything else in mind than &quot;I know Warriors are broken, help me help you.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, he's likely going to come with the party line of &quot;Look what exciting new features you're all going to get.&quot; Except we aren't going to be getting anything. <br />
<br />
(I'd love to find that thread on the old board where we were told that warriors are as good as we're supposed to be. It was back around the launch of Luclin, if I remember correctly.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">mebbe dat be right time ask bout mes arma modifications?<br />
<br />
I imagine that would be a great time.  That would probably be the only question asked by a Warrior that might actually get a response.  Good luck on the whole cleavage thing, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can just see the item augmentation now.<br />
<br />
Effect: Cleavage (worn)<br />
1: Increase Agro Multiplier by 120%<br />
2: Increase CHA by 255 (L30) to 305 (L65)<br />
3: Limit: Player(Female only)<br />
<br />
Or even:<br />
<br />
Effect: Cleavage (Must Equip, Casting Time: 1.0)<br />
1: Mesmerize(2/75)<br />
2: Limit: NPC(Humanoid only)<br />
2: Limit: NPC(Non-Eunuch only)<br />
Resist: Unresistable<br />
<br />
Anyways...that's what happens when you stay up too late.<br />
<br />
You know, I completely overlooked the fact that Absor mentioned that PROCS might be able to be augmented onto items.<br />
<br />
From the Necro board, I believe.<br />
Augmentations can add just about any effect that can be on an item (including procs). What effects will actually be attached to augmentations I can't tell you. :) <br />
Stun proc anyone?  Now that I've seen the system, it's looking a bit better than charms in my opinion...but time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stun procs are nice and all, but when all is said and done they're still procs.  A couple of Droga weapons have stun procs, and they seem to work okay, I have a copper hammer of striking, they're not a complete fix.  Because of course when you want a weapon to proc the most is invariably when it procs the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We never know, might be a clicker =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dunno, I could see Cleavage requiring racial/gender xp penalties.  Considering the heftiness of the cleavage effects for a barbarian female, I could see them getting a significant penalty.  Would lizards and snacks, er, gnomes even get Cleavage?<br />
<br />
Seriously, if Absor actually does post on here, could you all at least try to be civil?  Presenting rational, well-spoken points will likely get us a lot futher than simply screaming &quot;Absor, wtf is wrong with you?  Fix warriors now!&quot;  Honestly, considering the general mood on these boards right now, if I were Absor or any other developer, I wouldn't voluntarily post here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">that's equivelant to throwing a filet mignon to a pack of hyenas...<br />
<br />
poor bastard absor would get ripped from head to foot if he stepped into any thread here these days :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Will he or wont he? Tune in tomorow for another chapter of &quot;Does SoE care?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not supposed to swear here about our small but vocal idiot mob so I won't. Suffice to say I hope he doesn't stop by here until any changes are made to our class(about 1/20th of what people here seem to think we need). Because if he comes here before then he'll never, *ever* come back. And neither would I.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2758</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oogmol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I notice he has appeared nowhere on the SK board. SK's get no Absor-lovin. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Crydee Ossirian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">thankfully he hasn't shown up on the public ranger forums either... too many idiots there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lol and he's a ranger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thought he was a bard...<br />
<br />
That looks like a lute strapped to his back...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bard, Ranger... They're both sissies, does it matter which sissy he is? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Absor's visits were purely to get folks excited and go purchase LDoN. Nothing more, nothing less. They probably tell him when to come post and what he can and can't say. <br />
<br />
Here is a site owned by a guy who has been the lead developer in two major MMORPGs. Ultima Online and SWG. He talks about how to motivate the online community. He's good at it.<br />
