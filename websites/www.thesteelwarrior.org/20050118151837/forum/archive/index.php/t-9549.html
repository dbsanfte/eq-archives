I would like some suggestions for pure dps weapons that I might could use on raids...<br />
<br />
My guild is just getting into BoT, we do griegs, IV and other mobs similar on a regular basis.  I do not have a large supply of cash, but might could come up with 20k or so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that your current weapons 15/19 and 15/22 aren't bad at all.<br />
The best regular buyable DPS weapons are the &quot;Velium Gemmed&quot; weapons i think. They are 16/20 for one-handers and 34/28 for two-handers. The price for these is around 10k on our Server. (I'm on AB too)<br />
So the cheapest option would be to spend 10k (or even less) for a Velium Gemmed two-hander.<br />
everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26894<br />
<br />
If you can spend some more and have no problems to buy Attunable stuff then look for an &quot;Edge of Envelopement&quot; two-Hander in bazaar 44/34 with a DD proc.<br />
everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30812<br />
Price for this is pretty high. Have seen them for 100k+ several times on AB.<br />
<br />
There are some other Attunable weapons from OoW with great ratio (Cepter of Cruelty) but i have seen this stuff very rarely and price is incredible high.<br />
<br />

edit:<br />
after a closer look at your Magelo:<br />
Dont spend too much money on a new weapon! At least keep some plat so you can get rid off your Orc-Fang earring and that incredible crappy ring on your Finger  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dented</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ring is showing wrong stats... its much better than the VRoG.  Also, our guild is camping POtG in the hole... I am in line for the earring there so there is no need to buy right now for that slot either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you got something like the two-hander described above, you might look into the icicle strike aug out of Mir. It's 100 dd proc, type 4, and is only 100 adventure points I think. It's not much but your dex is pretty good, the weapon would have an empty aug slot, and 100 points doesn't take that long if you can talk some friends into a grind evening. And certainly you won't gank anyone's aggro if it goes off.</div></div><hr />

Thats the most common DPS weapon I see being used by warriors and pallies at least as far as the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSo4W is what i was going to recommend also. Whatever you end up with I would not get too concerned over it. Velium Gemmed would be fine, Warmarshals Bladed Staff would be fine, Edge of Envelopement works. Warrior DPS not something i'd lose sleep over when not tanking for the vast majority of situations. <br />
<br />
And I would not spend any guild merit or DKP to increase your non-tanking dps at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WMBS or Windblade would be good dps.  If you do BoT then the GSo4W would be better DPS.<br />

<br />
Personally I went for a Velium Gemmed 2hb w/ a 150 cold dd proc aug'd in it.  Would love to get a GSo4W though.</div></div><hr />

DPS isn't half bad.</div></div><hr />

There are also some nice 2hb weapons pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />

Grats - Now use those plat to get something instead of that Obsidian Bead Hoop in your ear !  :D <br />
<br />
Or a haste item of some sort.<br />
Unless you are planning for some drop.<br />
<br />
I agree with Okka about putting in a nice augment, the 125DD Ykesha augment is fair aggro for the amount of LDoN points it costs.</div></div><hr />
