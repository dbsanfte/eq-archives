I just bought a velium gemmed great sword (34/28 and crap stats), is this better DPS than most average 1h buyable weapons at 65? I've been playing this game for 5 years and I still don't fully understand how to work out 2H vs 1H DPS. I read a lot about DPS figures in the library but they all seem uber time weapons.<br />
<br />
Armour wise I know exactly what my upgrade path is, so I'm not too worried about that. I will never be raiding (unless I get fired), I just 2-box with my 65 shaman and get the occasional guildie group.<br />
<br />
To summarise, I'm only looking for DPS (not agro) primarily, is a 34/28 2h better than most buyable 1h combinations?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any responses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given that you can't get even close to a 1:1 ratio in a buyable 1-hander, I'd be shocked if you could find a setup that would compete for DPS. A pair of velium gemmed longswords or augged ldon weapons might be able to come close.<br />
<br />
Download a parser (yalp, eq companion) and test it out. My experience was that my WMBS significantly beat out a CHoS/SoTB combo (10-15dps avg) so take that for what it's worth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly what I was looking for, thanks.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
I came up with a little list for 2h ratios:<br />
<br />
Widebladed 1.0<br />
WMBS 1.107<br />
Windblade 1.136<br />
VGGS 1.214 (interestingly this is the same ratio as Palladius axe of slaughter)<br />
GSoft4w 1.322<br />
GBoW 1.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not just the ratio that is taken into consideration.<br />
<br />
If two weapons have the same (or very similar) ratio, take the one with the lowest delay (so long as it doesnt go lower than 28).  This is because of the way the damage bonus works (remember the old adage &quot;the fastest weapon gets the most dps?&quot;  It works for 2h as well, assuming the dmg/dly ratio is the same)</div></div><hr />
