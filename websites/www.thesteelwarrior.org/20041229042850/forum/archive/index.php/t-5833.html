<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tollan</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing EQ for nearly 4 years, but mainly as a ranger and shaman.  Lately, I've been wanting to make a tank alt.  I've settled on either a warrior or an SK.<br />
<br />
With the new melee changes, do warriors now have comparable snap aggro to knights?<br />
<br />
Are there any significant differences in tanking between SKs and warriors in the mid-level game?  say up to level 55?<br />
<br />
I don't intend for this tank to make it to 65 or go on raids.  I just want a solid tank to take up to the 50s and enjoy.  If warriors are doing much better these days with maintaining aggro and getting groups, I would prefer to go with a warrior.  But honestly, if knights are still getting exp group tank spots over warriors, I would go with the SK because I didn't make an alt to sit LFG...<br />
<br />
So, honestly, what's your opinion of knights vs. warriors in the pre-55 game?  Especially in their ability to get pickup exp groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashbomba</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pre 55 its easier to get a warrior geared in good equipment for a lot less. actually for most p/u groups a knight and a warrior are interchangable imho.<br />
<br />
as to the snap aggro, knights still have a big advantage. i was chain pulling in BoT and using incite to guarentee that i would aggro. as i came into the group the paly tosses a stun, i stand next to the paly and mob comes in straight to him 90% of the time when it didnt paly stunned again and bam he has aggro over incite after 3 or ticks. <br />
<br />
i believe that a sk would have no problem also stealing the aggro in the situation i was in. <br />
<br />
so warrior aggro is still not snap aggro its just alot better. for pure tanking warriors will have the edge on a comparably equipped knight. for utility knights have the advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want a tank who can take agro easily to mess around up to level 55, the answer is not warrior.<br />
<br />
Thing is, I wonder how much trouble it will be to get a group as an SK.  My impression is that the paladins are probably the 1st choice tanks at those levels for xp groups.</div></div><hr />

Yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there any significant differences in tanking between SKs and warriors in the mid-level game? say up to level 55?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, not really. SK's can pull better. SK's can solo better. Warriors can probably do a smidge more DPS at that point, depending on what you twink with. SK's can Feign Death and drop aggro really really fast. Those are about the only differences, and none of em really relate to tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seirnak</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I am playing a baby war that is well tweaked.  He is level 31 and he will outtank SKs and Pallies of equal level.  As far as agroe goes I keep it an easy 90% of the time.  Only time I have ever had issues with keeping agroe if when we have a well equiped rogue in group.<br />
<br />
I have played a pally to 24, a sk to 28 and now my war to 31 and in my oppinion I think the war is a better tank.  (Also most of the spells the Pal and SK have at those levels are useless compared to what their parent classes have.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
any knight as long as he has mana has no agro problems(asuming here he knows how to play)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, but why worry about what the character will be when he reaches his end-game and retires?  He's concerned with getting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors should be more than sufficient now with the provoke line.  When you're going from 1-55, 99% of the time you can hold aggro just thru sheer DPS.  Provoke line should take care of the rest.  If you have your heart set on a warrior, go for it, there's no reason not to now.  We can do the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LastLizard</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make your decision on what you like best (crits&amp;dps or spells), not what class is strongest atm.. next patch or re-&quot;balance&quot; and you might find yourself with the weakest of the 3 tanking classes again.<br />
<br />
Warrior is the preferred tank atm, but -<br />
<br />
All 3 tanking classes can tank. <br />
You can equip all of them nicely with baz gear at any sub 65 level (warrior maybe easiest, because you dont have to worry about mana or ft at all and RZ Cultural is the best tank-stat wise).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Anger procs from Everfrost LDON dont work until 60. Its got that 'recommended level 60' on it, which i assume means it wont proc until then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomflayer</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends what race you want also, Ogre/Troll SK have nice cultural tank armor also, but the rest of the races don't. A Gnome warrior would have nice 40% haste clickable arms, a Gnome SK also, but rest of the armor is bad for Gnome SK, the Gnome warrior could wear RZ armor with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My level 30 troll sk is a far more capable/versatile tank than my warrior was at his level, but the sk is in better gear and my warrior was that level long before all the recent melee enhancements.  At this point, especially from  that level to the mid 50's, most of the differences I've seen are gear related. The only reason to pick a hybrid over a warrior is utility.  So if you just want to tank and dont care about soloing or utility roles, warrior is just as good a choice as any.  If you care about those things, go sk/pally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My tank is only 53 and I have run him in LDoN's since they came out with a SK partner with my wife's Cleric and a good Chanter friend and I have had no problem keeping aggro from the SK. The dang cleric gets aggro only occasionally if she sits too close after a CH. Now I say that I have no problem if he realy works at it and casts a ton he can pull aggro away from me but normaly one or two casts will not hurt at all. <br />
<br />
I use Taunt, the new abilities(when we insult the mob's mother), and Beg along with my weapon procs and works well. <br />
<br />
My wife also has a paly main who is level 54 and I have taken her out with my 65 druid and I will tell you she can keep aggro but is a mana suck for heals bad. She can drain me at 65 on a horse with FT7 and Mana pres 4 and KEI and Druid Crack and BL crack it is unreal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lucy shows the level of all the Anger augments at 0, so they should proc at any level.</div></div><hr />

I can for sure say that in the past I for sure preferred a Knight tank because I could use a ton of DoTs and slow and stuff and not get aggro, which greatly increases my DPS.<br />
<br />
But with the changes lately, it's certainly brought the 2 closer together.  I'm not sure if I'd say they are even yet, because knights just get aggro for free.  But warriors are required to get special non-utility aggro weapons in order to tank.<br />
<br />
I've still mostly grouped with SK/Paladins lately, but a few of my recent (pretty twinked) warriors have been positive and they do hold aggro well.  But a warrior with no aggro weapons and shitty gear is still a shitty tank.</div></div><hr />
