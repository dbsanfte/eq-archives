vindi bp offers more hp and much better saves at a small sacrifice to ac.<br />
<br />
Go with vindi.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warlords. 1ac = 6hp always. So the difference is 74hp and resists aren't vital enough to make up the difference. AoB isn't either. If you're not capped on sta, it makes the choice much closer however. In that case, I'd say whichever you can get first. <br />
<br />
Just get a 5ac aug from ldon and slap it on the vindi if you are concerned about ac... <br />
<br />
  Wtf? First, I don't remember any 5ac augs from LDoN that fit on a BP. Second, 40hp &gt; 5ac, so it'd be better to grind out a 40hp augment anyhow. <br />
<br />
  Remember the formula. Math doesn't lie. 1ac = 6hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I saw a 5 ac aug on an ldon vendor that could go in chest I'm pretty sure... I'll check again tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ummm...pardon me for asking what may be a dumb question, but do AoB items stack? The Vindi BP, Turtle Belt and Stonewood Compound Bow all have the same effect. If I wore all three, would I have 6 regen and 30 ATK? If so, excellent, but if not then would a Vindi BP be worth it when you'd probably get more out of a BP with better AC, coupled with another AoB item, like the Stonewood Compound Bow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yes they stack upto 250 atk and 50 regen.</div></div><hr />

yes they stack upto 250 atk and 50 regen.  isn't it 30 regen?<br />
<br />
And that includes ALL worn atk (including Vengenace) and regen (including replinishment on ornate arms and other aura of ___ effects)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">30 regen worn, yeah, i was thinking vengence which maxes at 50.</div></div><hr />

ok AC does matter, here is the break down.  If war lord is only better than Vindi because of AC, i think i would go with vindi.  Cuz i am very close to 1300 AC soft cap, so after i guess it would not matter much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cuz i am very close to 1300 AC soft cap, so after i guess it would not matter muchNo such thing any more - that is unless you plan to ONLY play in pre-SoL zones. If you do anything in PoP or GoD then AC is very important. I bagged Vindi for Tak BP. 69ac is good. In this case, I would go for the Warlord's. 14ac &gt; 10hp and AoB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I believe in LDoN there is considerable impact with ac as well, above that in pre-Luclin. This is just as an addition to Wandor's post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Changing your AC by 100 moves the mob's modal hit by 1 DI.<br />
<br />
So 100 AC changes the amount of damage you receive by about 4%.<br />
<br />
So is 14 AC a big deal?  You decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Warlord's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Honestly, I would take the Warlords BP.  The HP loss is insignificant compared to the AC loss.  Unless you don't really tank very often.  I'm glad I got the Vindi BP because I generally don't MT or even ST, so the resists are doing more for me than the AC would be.<br />
<br />
Better yet, just farm Eindride.  He isn't hard and is up as often as Vindi is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Like Wandor said, if you play at all in PoP, LDoN, GoD stick with the warlords.  AC is huge now.<br />
<br />

<br />
He's actually easier than Vindi imo.  Wandor put together a good guide here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4626).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">even at a less conservative AC-HP ratio id still go for the warlords. sure the resists are nice, but they dont matter so much for day to day tanking.</div></div><hr />
