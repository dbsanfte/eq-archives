I could use some pretty good advice on what to replace. Any other suggestions would help too. I don't exactly have a fat bank account (The few plat one my warrior.. a whopping 17 or so. I plan on spending time farming. Which is no challenge because the best plat I can think of that is in my level range comes from the crap that Green Goblins Drop. Can get a little over 9 platinum a kill (I let the Fire Elemental do all the work), if both Heads and Blood Vials drop. Hate killing things when other people could be getting experience, so I take time and direct a lower level player (Assuming they're levels 5-9) to the Dwarf Skeletons near the Druid Ring (No Adds there that I know of) or give them the camp if they ask.), so I can't go out and buy whatever I want (Cloak of Greater Pernicity)... stuff that is both affordable and functional would help. Hopefully I did the Magelo right and linked it right as well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you're doing too badly. No one is going to mistake you for Supertwink the DestroyerofZergables, but you'll be able to do you job for a bit.<br />
If you can run a bazaar trader, I'd consider farming silks and hides. Go to EQtraders, then go to their message boards, then to the tailoring and smithing sections for some tips on where to farm silks and hides. Everfrost used to be a prime spot for farming spiderling silk (a subcomponent of player-made smithing stuff) but after the newbie armor quests were introduced for a wider range of Barbarian classes, the spiderling loot table was changed. Now I believe that the common thinking is that Shadeweaver's is the best place to go.<br />
If you can't run a trader for some reason, you might be doing about as well as you can with your farming. I spent an ungodly amount of time at your level Killing wisps and turning greater lightstones in at the North K. gypsy camp (to female gypsy who's name starts with an &quot;M&quot;). she'll give you a &quot;book&quot; that you need an empty enventory slot for, and you can sell it to the other gypsies in camp for 9-10 plat. But, that was a long time ago and I don't know that it's close you your best farming option nowadays. The best thing is if you can run a trader.<br />
Generally, in terms of classes of gear, I'd say your armor options coming up tend to fall into about four categories:<br />
1. Player-made LDoN armor such as Gothic &amp; sandblasted. Check prices in Bazaar, but also check the dwarf vendors in the smithing building in PoK, because players who skill up on this armor often do so in this building and often simply turn around and sell whatever they are making to the vendors next to the forge. Vendors in turn will sell pieces to you for about 100 pp.<br />
2. Crafted and crusty armor. In theory, you will soon be able to quest some of the crafted pieces, but as with so many quests in this game, doing so doesn't make any sense. You can find these pieces sometimes in the bazaar for about the cost of the gem subcomponents. The common thinking is that crusty holds a slight advantage over crafted, but you can compare several armor sets here: http://members.cox.net/radhazzone/rad_armor.htm<br />
3. Player-made stuff. I note you are wearing some old-school player-made armor (fine plate collar, ornate coif). Fine plate and this chain stuff are still fairly common skill up products for young smiths (though the plat. chain is a little unusual; most smiths I think do gold rather than the plat). Sometimes you can find a smith working on this and get a deal on it. I don't think I'd buy it from a vendor, though; you can check but I'm 95% certain you'll get more bang for your buck with the LDoN armors.<br />
4. Odds &amp; ends. The game is full of various items that are not &quot;standard&quot; sets of gear but which might plug a gap or two. As a Barbarian warrior you can wear all kinds of different stuff. Search in bazaar by class, religion, race, your budget and order the results by AC (but also look at STA and hitpoints).<br />
<br />
Players skill up in jewelry will also sometimes sell their products in the bazaar, so I'd check your finger slots every once in a while; as with the visible armor slots, you want to start getting a feel for the price of warrior-wearble gear on your server, even if you can't afford to go on big shopping sprees quite yet.<br />
<br />
I'd also seriously consider saving up for two opal encrusted steins, which you can look for in the bazaar. They add +25 CHA each, and will pay for themselves in better prices from vendors in very short order. On my server they are around 20-25 plat, I think (haven't checked for a while).<br />
<br />
I think your weapons are okay at the moment. You might start pricing things like the Centi hammer (15/32, which is slow, but not a bad offhand at all and it will train up your 1-hand blunt skill) and maybe when you hit level 21 something like a Sarnak Battlehamer (2H blunt, 30/40, sometimes cheap because it's warrior only; yes it's slow but I used to be able to hold aggro with it surprisingly well and it will slowly work up your 2H blunt skill). Be careful when you buy weapons because of the recommended level thing. I'm out-of-touch with which weapons this has and hasn't affected, so just be careful. Another weapon I used to use was a Centi short sword (1hS 12/25 and +5STA), still quite a usable weapon.<br />
<br />
If you are still broke down the road (say, in your early 30s) and you do some hunting in outdoors zones like the Overthere and later the Dreadlands, here's a pretty old-school thing I used to do to hold aggro as an untwinked warrior. For this to work, you have to have a Weighted Axe and you have to be the puller, and you should have SoW. On long pulls from camp, you initially hit the mob with the weighted axe, which is a 50 damage, 150 delay (!) weapon. It will do eye-candy level damage if you actually hit the mob, and it will generate a lot of aggro for a single hit. One the way back to camp, switch out the Weighted Axe for your faster regular weapons. Ideally, you cycle through the weighted axe's 150 delay while you run back to camp, and you're ready to go when the mob arrives. As soon as your delay recycles, you can tag with an arrow too. Again, before you get excited, make sure that the effective damage on this weapon actually works at your level. And note this weighted axe pulling will not work if the pull is short, since you'll be standing there with the mob in camp but your delay will not have refreshed yet.<br />
<br />
Okay, I'll stop boring you. It looks like you're making your own arrows, which is good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telluros</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback. I'm well aware of my main weapon's process, but with the dexterity boost I do a fine job Skilling up in Fletching. Plus, it doesn't proc at my level. Could be frustrating to lose a temp (which I really should start getting), but I figured it will get me somewhere in the time being (might be able to use it Offhand, since I don't think weapons proc offhand). May try to work on 2HB as well for the Greatstaff of Thunder (I my distant future) and 2HS as well for the BoW (Probably really far off...). <br />
<br />
Since I want to have options of raid-capable class, I'll train my three current characters (Magician, Druid and Warrior) as I see fit, although the Mage will probably be desired for CotH (which I bought cheap off a vendor in Felwithe). I'm trying to work on archery as well, but that's when I'm chasing the mobs that flee. Average about 22~24 damage a hit, with the occassional critical hit. I want to get on par with my brother's 33 Berserker, who hits for 120 some times (I'll need to try to get a good 2HS or 2HB for the high Riposte mobs... Some random player gave me a really nice two-hander... Greatsword of Savagery I believe... but I can't use it well enough yet), and has nailed a poor mob for more than my Shock of Spikes with a 176 Critical. Perhaps I'm too weighted down. I'm planning to invest in a pair of Velium Fire Wedding rings for those Bare finger slots. A fellow guildie warrior mentioned the Crusty gear (as you did), so I may look for it. I'm too big for Gothic though. <br />
<br />
As for the Steins... I got lucky and found two sets off a vendor in PoK. I bought two more sets, oblivious to their value, and gave them to two Dorf newbies I was helping (I have a 152 in Fletching with the Mage, So I made them bows and arrows as well). I bought them for a little over 2~3 plat each. With 149 Charisma (with the Steins) with my Mage, I get good prices in PoK (Since I have Kindly Faction with some merchants in Shadow Haven, I may get better prices there). May do the Faction quest with my warrior, since I hear Shadow Haven is a good Tradeskill place.<br />
<br />
I like Everfrost near the PoK book. I'll eventually get an area Nuke, because of the swarm of Mobs around the book. Good place for Wolf and Bear pelts, but the nerfed drop rates of Spiderling Silks doesn't make it good for those (The silks). I hear Ferrott has a decent supply of spiderlings, so I may try there. Spider Silks, on the other hand, are easier to get (Giant Spiders in EC occassionally drop two). The area also has Bears, Wolves and Lions, so it's not a bad place for pelts either. Not as safe as Everfrost because of the occassional roaming Griffon. But an &quot;/ooc Griffon near Orc 1&quot; usually fixes the problem.<br />
<br />
I tried comparing my gear to similar gear of players around my level for all my characters. I'm far from average (My mage has been smoked in the Intelligence / Mana area by over 300 mana). Then I came here because I figured you guys would have good reccommendations. I'm more than satisfied now, but any other suggestions that anyone else may have will be an added bonus. Good to know I'm not a twink either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you mean that you are a large race, be sure to search for &quot;large gothic...&quot; It's not always around, obviously, since someone has to make the stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telluros</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somehow the idea of Large Gothic (I shoulda known better) slipped my mind as I was posting. I will try to see if they are for sale the next time I check the bazaar. Doesn't matter to me if they're Steel or Ringmail.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I'll get lucky. I think the Ringmail types of Gothic require HQ ore, which has to be restocked via quest if I'm not mistaken. May be easier to get the Steel versions. Probably uses tempers too. Kinda makes me want to work on Blacksmithing, so I can save the trouble and make armor myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">High quality ore is needed to smith the kind of ornate chain that you are wearing (the coif). It's sold in limited amounts on vendors (if memory serves), or can be made by melting down fine steel weapons.<br />
The LDoN armor's bottleneck has to do with tempers, which drop or are foraged in the LDoN.<br />
The plate armor almost certainly has more AC than the chain (I'd say it does, but actually I've never compared them). So go plate if you have a choice.<br />
<br />
Smithing can be fun (er, for those of us who think it's fun) but it's a very very expensive way to get your armor. You'll get the best armor a smith can make faster if you sell farmed smithing components, take the cash, and pay a smith to make you stuff.<br />

Yes, it will proc in your offhand and dispell you. Just start looking for something else when you get close to getting it to proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try to get FAST weapons of every kind so your skills raise fast.<br />
Try to build up all your skills, you maybe need them later, yes piercing too   :) <br />
Some cheap and fast weapons to look for:<br />
<br />
1HS:<br />
- Glowing Black sword (you already have, nice for the +20 DEX and pretty fast, wont proc until level 40 i think<br />
<br />
1HB:<br />
- Smoldering Brand 9/22 + 14DD, procs at level 1<br />
<br />
2HB:<br />
- Poison Wind Censer 20/28 (proc at level 40 or higher?)<br />
<br />
2HS:<br />
- Nathsar Greatsword 17/30 +10STR<br />
<br />
Piercing:<br />
- Crystalline Spider Fang 10/22 + 12 DD, procs at level 1<br />
- Blood Point 10/21 + 80 lifetap procs at level50<br />
<br />
<br />
There are tons more of course, just a few suggestions...<br />
<br />
<br />
Other general tips for the low levels:<br />
- Get items with DEX on it for faster skillups.<br />
- Get as much AC and Hitpoints as you can (Velium fire Wedding rings are nice)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WaardarMT</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always dig people trying out the warrior class, just a word of advice:<br />
<br />
If you're not someone with a huge ammount of resources, you're going to find yourself hating life in your early 50's if you plan to keep this warrior going until then. Most of us curse our 50s for this reason... if it's not a class you plan to make your main then, you might as well save your time and make a chanter, wizard, necro, bard, etc.<br />
<br />
That being said... I used glowing black sword for ages. Also look into Venomous Axe of the Vellium Brood, Lamentation, Bed Leg Club, Sarphlung Spear, and since you're Rallos Zek Diety, Feirce Heraldic armor is the way to go once you can afford it. (Hell, I'm in PoTime and I still have one or two Helanic Tundra items)<br />
<br />
Also, once they start proccing, Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn are must haves for a warrior twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with teh comment that life in the 50s can be rough on the warrior main who has few resources.<br />
Partly that's because in your 30s and 40s you can really do your job well with relatively inexpensive gear.<br />
But suddenly in your 50s you need expensive weapons, expensive armor, and expensive haste and it will seem like you need them all at once. You'll start doing the math on the cost of what you need, and you'll compare it to the rate you can farm plat and that will discourage you, heh. But hang in there.<br />
<br />
Also, don't be discouraged by the difference in your current bank account (you say the warrior has 15 pp) and some of the weapons listed above. Just use them as a list to check prices against.<br />
Also, be careful to look everything over carefully before you buy it. Things like the bedleg club is really fast--same delay as a lamentation--but it was one of the weapons which was affected by the recommended level changes. At your level it would only be a 1 or 2 damage weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telluros</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Domo Arigato<br />
<br />
I'm getting lots of good suggestions. I spent a little time farming yesterday and made about 250 plat, so I picked up two Gold Geode Rings (If I had spotted Gold/Platinum/Velium Fire Wedding Rings, I would have saved up or bought them instead. Not like I can't get the money back in two or so hours) and a Throneblade of the Ykesha (which my brother's dwarf berserker uses. Better stas than the Argent Defender I was using, which I sold it when I got Dual Wield). <br />
<br />
I'll look into those low-delay weapons (Since I like to be capable in all five classes of Magic with my two casters, I figure a proficiency in the 5 main weapons I'll be using would help. I don't really think too many warrior weapons are Hand-to-hand, and I don't recall seing a 2H piercing skill. Perhaps it falls under Piercing... hell if I know). When my main swords starts to proc (40 I think), then I'll replace it and save it in case I make a class that can use it.<br />
<br />
Being that my 1H slash is maxed, I'll either change my offhand to Piercing or 1H Blunt, start on the 2H Slashing again, or save up for a 2H Blunt and start on that.<br />
<br />
I've seen a few pieces of Large Gothic and some Sandblasted stuff. So far, the stats are better on the Gothic, after comparing the two Chest pieces. Wisdom is good for a Cleric or Paladin user, but the bonuses on the Gothic are better suited to my tastes. When I get to the recommended level for Fierce Heraldic (46 I think, which is incidentally the same level you can enter the Plane of Tranquility if my memory isn't off. Plus, at 44, I think I can group with anyone up to 65 (Not that I'd use that as a crutch. I'd be happier with those closer to my level for LDoN and other purposes. Not really a challenge when a EP or Time-geared Warrior (Not in a raid situation) is beating the royal snot out of everything for you.), correct me if I'm wrong (I'm fairly sure because I think the formula is half your level added to your current level. Thus 44+22 =66), outside of LDoN.), I'll invest in that.<br />
<br />
I plan on playing a warrior until I can fully understand how they work. I may or may not get him to 65. When I get my mage high enough, and start getting new farming options (I can solo Forest Giants (still haven't got one to drop a damned Forest Loop, though I did get a couple of things that sold well. Not as rewarding platwise as obliterating the Goblins, but I don't really like killing what someone else could get experience on... But it's the only way I can think of to make good money at the moment... ) now, But HGs, SGs and a Cyclops are out of the question. Nukes get a bigger punch at level 34, so I may try at 35 or so), then I'll get some good gear for my two alts (15 Barbarian Warrior and 17 Wood Elf Druid). I want to try to understand how each class works, so I will know what to expect of my group. I plan on making other classes later, but for now I'll wait until I have an understanding of the three I have. And have the resources to spare...<br />
<br />
Ok, enough rambling from me for now (Gomen nasai... I had a bit of things on my mind). If I need any suggestions later on, I know where to turn. I look forward to taking on Rallos Zek one day. My Mage and Druid don't need the bad faction from their Goddess though...</div></div><hr />
