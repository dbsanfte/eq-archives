<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, considering the worthless pile of crap that the &quot;working as intended&quot; thread has turned into (thanks, Guyfencin), I figured that I would just start a new post, so it would actually get looked at.<br />
<br />
Now, I agree, there should be NO way that taunt would be 100% sucessful on higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
However, why not just make it exactly like tradeskills??<br />
<br />
Here is a chart, with &quot;trivial&quot; levels, and the sucess rate at them, with varying skill levels: Tradeskill Trivs (http://www.crimsonsnow.com/pdfs/charts/zeralenns_trivchart.pdf) <br />
<br />
Percentage of success = (skill - (trivial x 0.75) + 51.5<br />
<br />
Now, replace &quot;trivial&quot; level, with a mob taunt-resist level, based on level of the mob, and a variable, so that a level 70 mob would have a &quot;taunt skill&quot; triv of, say 335.  That would be around a sucess rate of ~30% with a taunt skill of 230.<br />
<br />
Some things to note about tradeskills:<br />
<br />
1) You can NOT fail on a triv 200 points lower than your skill.  IE, you would have 100% sucess taunting a level 1 mob.<br />
<br />
2) The higher you skill, the higher the chance you have of suceeding on a triv that is higher than you skill level.  IE, a level 25 warrior would fail to taunt a level 30 mob a lot more than a level 65 would fail a level 70.<br />
<br />
3) Once your skill is high enough, you have a 5% chance to fail on a triv at or below your level, up to the 200 points below rule, at which point it becomes 0%.  This would make 95% sucesses on trash mobs.<br />
<br />
Now, you could then vary the variable by hand, to make certain mobs more resistant or less resistant to taunt.<br />
<br />
Example: Leve 70 mobs, one with a taunt mod of 4, another with a taunt mod of 5.  Mod 4 = exp mob, mod 5 = raid mob.  You would have a 71.5% chance of taunting the level 70 exp mob, and a 19% chance of taunting the level 70 raid mob.  This would allow for raid mobs that are level 55, that are relatively taunt resistant, by giving them a mod of 6 or so, making them slightly easier to taunt than the level 70, if thats what the devs would want.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm bored at work, and looking at tradeskill stuff, and thought that might be a change to push, as it would be a better, more tunable, yet familar system (as its used already).  <br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This system accomplishes absolutely nothing.  Currently, system only depends on taunt skill and level difference the mob, and it might look something like this, assumed taunt skill is maxed:<br />
<br />
You    Mob   % to taunt<br />
65      1       75<br />
65      65     50<br />
65      70     25<br />
<br />
Now you propose adding a taunt resist level, which would end up like this:<br />
<br />
You   Mob   'To Taunt'             % to taunt<br />
65     1       X                          75<br />
65     65     Y                          50<br />
65     70     Z                          25<br />
<br />
Where X, Y, Z would be set to ensure the same level of taunt success as before.<br />
<br />
Changing the system does not change the result.  There is no indication whatsoever that the % to taunt a mob will ever be changed, because there's really no reason for it to be changed.  Different systems still have to implement the same success rate.<br />
<br />
And if by some miracle SoE decides that there is something wrong with the % you can taunt mobs, it can be implemented in the current system.  For example you can say just treat any taunt on a mob light blue or lower as an AE Taunt level skill.</div></div><hr />
