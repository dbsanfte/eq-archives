<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>grumush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys<br />
Check magelo then insert opinions based on my plans so far please.<br />
Given that I just moved to a new spot after a long time of moving around.  I want to upgrade my bubba.  I can always have a elemental flagged 65 Dru RL bud, who's guild is farming time now, help me out as well as various others to form a full group (on a decent day :P).  Used to be in a family type guild but it kind of petered out.  So now I'm wanting to join my druid-bud's guild, but it will be a while before I get a place with good cable connection. <br />
Current plans are :<br />
Step 1:  keep doin LDoN's till I have my AA's<br />
AA route-finish CA3, CS3, then hit WA2, Sturd1, then LR5, then PD3, PP5, then ID5<br />
then move it on to other cool ones (not sure route yet).  Opinions on this route?<br />
*Can also use this time to LDoN some tak boots together maybe put haste on em<br />
so I can do the Loyalist shield quest and dump flames. (don't want trib haste).  And get AC and HP aug's.<br />
Step 2: Now that I got the AA's go to GoD hit Natimbi up for Aug's, do sewers till I can get a turepta ring and stonemite mask.  Not sure what I'll be able to handle after that to up my gear.<br />
Step 3: REPLACE MY BUTT LOVING SoD.  I hates it with a passion I do's.  But as a realist I prolly won't be able to replace it till I start raiding with RL bud's guild and join them.  He seems to feel after talking with his guild that a BoW is forseeable easy for me after joining.  So 2h is no worries.<br />
So given what I have and what my plans are what do you guys think and suggest?  I feel like I'm at an impasse.  Remember do not include the guild in this as it will be a good while before I'll be able to be in it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BoW is never foreseeable easy.  But it looks like you have a good plan.  I'd work on non visible slots and worry about getting raex when you hit elements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>grumush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I say forseeable easy because all their war's have one and they have the RZ script down pat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">first and before anything else : swap your DW combo!!!!!!!! the A3-BoC is far better aggro than a Ykesha-SoD so it must go in primary.<br />
For the rest it's OK like this. But I would suggest to fing a better exp place than LoDN because you don't have way of improvement with AP except some aug that won't be replace by GoD's one so you can try BoT, afterall a GBoS would be an improvement over your SoD (even if its an OK aggro weapon).<br />
OH and go for a bit of WA between some def AA in order to finish them with just WA5 and Sturd(3/)4/5 left.</div></div><hr />
