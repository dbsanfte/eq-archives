<br />
OKay, so Y = the stam I would have with maxxed innate stam AAs.<br />
And X = the amount of HP I'd gain for having maxxed Stam AAs.<br />
<br />
If I were to max ND first, then go back and max the innate stam AAs; would I still gain X HP? Or does ND ONLY factor in the stam you have when you buy the skill, and the extra stam from innate stam wouldn't count if I get it after maxxing the ND AAs?<br />
<br />
<br />
...sorry if this has been asked alot before, but I couldn't find another thread about this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fatz</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I could be wrong though, but I always thought the amount of HP gained per stamina point is based on your level and that ND doesn't affect that number at all. I'm pretty sure ND only affects raw HP items. Correct me if i'm wrong!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goska</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stand corrected, I did a few calculations to veryify and ND does effect +HP items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">calculations? Just put off and on a 100hp item :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goska</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have ND yet, so I put ND1 into Magelo then calculated my HPs to see if it match.<br />
<br />
Of course that assumes that Magelo is calculating it correctly, which im pretty sure it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ND affects HP from stamina, and Raw hp from items.<br />
PE and PD also act the same way ND does<br />
<br />
With max HP AAs (ND3, PE, PD3) you get a 16.5% bonus to your HP, which includes all stamina HP (Including stamina from buffs) and raw HP items (it doesn't affect raw hp buffs like symbol and virtue, and brells)<br />
<br />
so no, getting innate stamina before ND is kinda stupid, as you will be shooting yourself later when your at 360 stamina buffed, and your thinking of what you could have used those AA points for that actually helps ya.<br />
<br />
taking 15 points for 30 points of stamina, that you will get through gear and buffs, is a waste of AA, unless you've already bought anything, and want to play around with your nakid stats.</div></div><hr />

Half the people said it only accounts for the stam and HP items you have when you buy it (which would suck, majorly) and the others have said what you all have said. Would hate the waist points on innate stam for it no have to real effect, but I would also hate to have NOT put the points there if it only factorred in to stam/hp of the time you bought it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replys :D</div></div><hr />
