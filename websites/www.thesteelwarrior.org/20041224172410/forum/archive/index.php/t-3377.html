<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The moderators have the right to change or bend these rules as they see fit. If you think something you're about to post might violate one of them - don't post it.<br />
<br />
The main goal of this forum is to allow people to post their whining about anything they would like. Your day at work, the paladin you were grouped with, the guild that trained your raid - whatever. <br />
<br />
for those who read this<br />
<br />
However, the moderators and I WILL NOT allow this forum to be turned into a hellhole of profanity and personal attacks. If that happens, it will be shut down just as quickly as it was put up.<br />
<br />
It's close to this forum going bye-bye. VERY close. Poking fun and arguing over things is fine. That is what this forum is for. Not what it's become the last few weeks. This forum is meant for VENTING. Not aggravated internet assault.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. No profanity in the subject lines. If you feel the need to have it inside your posts, that is fine. However - if moderators have to constantly edit your posts because they have no value whatsoever - you will lose your posting priviledges to this forum.<br />
<br />
2. If something is even remotely not safe for work, put NSFW in the subject line.. Many people browse these boards from work or school. This rule will be enforced strictly. <br />
<br />
3. No porn. No exceptions.<br />
<br />
4. If you have a disagreement with another poster - fine. If you want to yell at them - fine. If you want to babble off mindless profanity, use the private message feature.<br />
<br />
5. If you're going to post pages and pages of nothing but meaningless drivel and overall finger-pointing I will just nuke the thread so fast your head will spin.<br />
<br />
6. Vowels are your Friends. Please use them when applicable for the sake of all those lonely Consonants.</div></div><hr />
