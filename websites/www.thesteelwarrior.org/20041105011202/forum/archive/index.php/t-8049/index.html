I think anger3 would be enough aggro on vanazir, with Weapon affinity aa, you should kick enough proc in.<br />

Waza</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vana is more than enough agro specially augs i would say<br />
<br />
Don't waste ya DKP<br />
<br />
If u want a DPS weapon on an off night just take out aulffie for a GSo4W<br />
<br />
or if you have High Atk then general druav's 2hander pretty much rotts after the 1st few kills...and he's 2 groupable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">VDD is a great tanking weapon, it's also a great DPS weapon.  I'd aug it, tank with it until you get Darkblade + another 1-hander at which time you can remove the aug and have a kick-ass DPS weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">VDD's dps is good enough to hold agro when other people aren't competing for agro.</div></div><hr />

Use vanazir for dps, put a dd proc on it.<br />
<br />
Get a Bow/Sews for aggro and anger3 it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VDD better aggro then sews / bow.  I'd say a3 it and use it for tanking imo.  Get a cheap dps with a couple groups from fire / bot whichever.</div></div><hr />
