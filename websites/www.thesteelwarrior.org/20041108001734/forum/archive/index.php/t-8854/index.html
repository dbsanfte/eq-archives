<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is anyone using this for tanking raid level mobs? I read the forums alot and have not seen any posts on this. Seems like a nice utility (50% aggro Multiplier). If so is there a stragegy you use (Like a combo of discs with this one during a raid mob fight). I did a search in the Library and only got a hit on the post that lists where the Tomes are bought.<br />
<br />
Just curious..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've experimented with it a bit over the last week actually...it burns alot of end but it can make a tank switch more possible when ae taunt is down.  Usually use this followed by furious as soon as my name comes up in HOTT.  Limited though as you need to chain this, furious and then def/evasive if using as a tank switch...I can barely manage this with my end pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it has limited aplication. and subjectively small window of use.<br />
<br />
tank switches are one , as mentioned but its use comes at an extream cost at that point.  ie hal rots<br />
<br />
we can go through 12 tanks on a mob if the heal rots are not synched to the mob dps at point of aggro.<br />
<br />
the heal rots are by assumption not tottaly synched the first 5-10 seconds of aggro obtainment.<br />
<br />
so if u want to tank without deffesive discs those first moments...<br />
<br />
its ballsy plain and simple. a gamble.  write your own tank cred checks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use it after defensive drops sometimes just for the hell of it.  Trying to get aggro on something that requires defensive/fortitude I usually find that it's too risky.  If you're fast you can click it on, hit incite, then click it off and hit defensive for a tiny bit of almost free aggro, but I also find this to be more trouble than it's worth usually.  When defensive has worn off you usually have solid aggro but what the hell, no reason not to hit it.<br />
<br />
Definitely not our most useful discipline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Muurlat McKrom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">perhaps its useful to get on the rampage? from my exp, ive seen that when i use furious at the begining of any tanking job that i need to do, my aggro is locked until i die.  i use my dathor hammer during furious so i suppose the dps that happens during that time is whats causing all of that aggro.<br />
<br />
anyways back to my point... since my aggro is locked, i believe that sor would be a good tool to obtain rampage then once you have it click it off and go defe, stone, evas</div></div><hr />

<br />
Muurlat, why would you want to build up aggro while you're on rampage?  1 arrow will get you on it, from that point on you would want to stay lower on aggro so you don't steal it and die.</div></div><hr />

Prove it incite is a spell line and it mods spell hate.  I call bullshit.  Oh and the fact that if it didnt it would only mod bash aggro which the majority of warriors dont even use so logic is your friend.  But yeah spirit of rage is 99% useless.</div></div><hr />

I don't have any conclusive proof one way or the other, but I doubt this is true, at least for Enraging blow procs.  I don't have echo of anger, but from the reviews on it, by warriors who primarily use direct hate procs for aggro I am doubtful on that as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How would you only get hate from EB/A3? They don't proc unless you swing... I think people generally underestimate the amount of hate they're getting from swings, especially when you start adding in hate mods like VoT and EoA... <br />
<br />
For my own experience, my aggro took a significant jump going from CHoS to GBoS, and the only thing that explains it is the higher dps.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone who has both would try to argue that you should mainhand a BF over a n FB but yet it's direct proc hate output is in a whole different league.<br />
<br />
All that being said I've never seen Spirit of rage to be a useful disc, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The difference with echo and/or vot is immense so theres really no possible way it can only affect dps aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have a fleshbiter (I assume you're not talking about a frostbringer  :)) but I would be interested to see a fleshbiter go head to head with a bloodfrenzy (no augs).  I wouldn't be suprised if the bloodfrenzy did very well in terms of pure aggro.  I know my blade of war blows my BF out of the water for DPS but is considerably less aggro.  I have another 2-hander with roughly the same dps as my BoW and it is absoulte shit for aggro (which is why I have it).  <br />
<br />
EoA/VoT would not have the impact that they do on aggro if they only effected your melee dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">unauged bloodfrenzy is more aggro than fleshbiter.  Fleshbiter unauged is pathetic for aggro.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've used the disc on Blur mobs to reasonable effect at times.Single target rampage is about timing your placement on the list not overall hate output.Once you're on rampage you want to mitigate the ramp well,but, keep your aggro production low... so this disc has no place in rampage tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually you do bring up a very good point.  The so called &quot;blur&quot; mobs in ikkinz dont really blur you, they just dump aggro off of the top person on the aggro list by xxx amount.  If you stack up aggro buffs and he bumps you there is still a fairly solid chance that you will have aggro since you are pretty far ahead of the rest of the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Prove it incite is a spell line and it mods spell hate.  I call bullshit.  Oh and the fact that if it didnt it would only mod bash aggro which the majority of warriors dont even use so logic is your friend.  But yeah spirit of rage is 99% useless.<br />
<br />
Easy.<br />
1.  Proximity+Incite with Echo of Anger takes the same amount of aggro to pull off of as Proximity+Incite without an aggro mod, I've tested it.<br />
<br />
2.  Terror line generates the same amount of aggro with nothing, Voice of Thule, SCS, or Voice of Thule and SCS.<br />
<br />
Also, you're forgetting that it would mod melee aggro.  Near as I can tell it doesn't mod bash aggro (or offhand, since both of those have a 0 for the portion of its aggro which is getting modified and 0*anything is still 0).  D+(DB*(Mod1/Mod2))=hate/swing.  D=Dmg, DB=Dmg Bonus, Mod1=Class Mod (not sure how this is affected by level, for a 65 War it's between 1.3 and 1.4 for a 65 SK it's between .82 and .84, all I know on mods), Mod2=Aggro Mod.  Now as far as an offhand or bash go, you don't get a DB on it and from aggro testing you can easily see that an offhand weapon generates less hate/swing than the same weapon as mainhand further backing my point, but since you have no DB the formula for offhand or bash would essentially be D+(0*(Mod1/Mod2)) which would be D+0 or simply D.  When you're talking about your mainhand where you do get a DB though, thats where aggro mods are giving you a bonus (in addition to a bonus on non direct hate procs) in addition to the bonus they give you on non direct hate aggro procs such as Ykesha (which btw generates far more aggro than Anger plus some damage, why you all refuse to believe that I don't know).<br />
<br />
So, as you said Aspit, logic is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't know if it means much now, but back when the combat abilities were being tested a dev had confirmed that Spirit of Rage would stack with VoT, Echo of Anger, and would mod incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would buy that it doesn't work on Incite.  Incite is a fairly insignificant amount of aggro with or without mods.  Not that it doesn't work on enraging blow though.  As I mentioned, my weapons *only* proc pure aggro spells, and VoT makes a very significant aggro difference.  Enough that I can immediately tell when it drops without looking at my buff bar.  That's a much bigger difference than 12% of my shitty dps aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can retest it but I doubt it's changed from when I tested and what I said was the case.</div></div><hr />

I meant to say Anger 3 sorry.  No spell in the game provides better hate on a per use basis than Anger to my knowledge.  As far as Anger 3 vs Ykesha though, Ykesha absolutely blows it away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SlinkyTWF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One of our guild MTs used to like starting RZtW with Spirit of Rage rather than go straight to /defensive.  I have seen it work, but I personally disagree with this tactic, and think it is dangerous on elemental+ mobs.  I have also seen the aforementioned MT get 1-rounded twice on Rathe Council.  I suspect that if the potential mob DPS is less than 5K, you can get away with using it on incoming to help secure aggro.  otherwise, you are taking too large a risk.  My usual employment of SoR goes in the following pattern:<br />
<br />
Trigger /defensive before engage &gt; engage &gt; Hold taunt (or AE taunt if the taunt fails) the slow to land &gt; /incite when first taunt used (or when 1st aggro proc lands) &gt; /Furious when /defensive fades (allows me to give heal rot heads up &gt; Spirit of Rage (to solidify aggro) &gt; Swap to 2-H &gt; /Fellstrike &gt; switch back to 1HS/Shield for duration of fight or until KIA.  Trigger incite at all opportunities.<br />
<br />
Common sense and reactions to changing situations will always induce situational variations, such as using /furious or /fortitude at the beginning of fight instead of at the end, or saving SoR/fellstrike endurance if there will be multiple opportunities to trigger /defensive.<br />
<br />
Additionally, if I know I am mez-tanking a low to moderate DPS mob, I will frequently use Spirit of Rage early in the fight to rack up some extra hate in case I have to back off later on when the mob gets beaten down too far (such as in latter engagement mez-tanking stages of Rathe Council encounter).<br />
<br />
Not sure if that helps answer the original question of when to use CoR or not, but GL finding your own tactical balance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I own both an Anger III and an Ykesha augment and could not disagree more.  Many of our pallies have been complaining about their stun resist aggro being lessened with recent patches, and that may account for some lessened effectiveness.<br />
<br />
It does produce aggro, moreso than a standard 125/250c DD would, but I have not seen it prove anywhere as effective as Anger III.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then they really need to not listen to you. =/  Anger3 &gt; Ykesha, no question about it.  It's been discussed here over and over and that has pretty much been the overall consensus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">And your consensus comes from feeling it or from actual proof?  Although I will concede that Anger 3 would be superior in lower end content such as Luclin or low tier PoP due to the way spell aggro works.  I'll post some proof up for you in a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">There have been numerous tests done yes, if that's what your asking.  I guess I could go look them up and post a link but your a big boy and can do that yourself.  Honestly tho, either way I don't see how it matters much.  I have no issues whatsoever holding aggro.  Once a mob is locked on me the only time it ever gets pulled is if another warrior over-aggro's.  BTW when we gonna have some more Qvic fun?!~ lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Any time your pullers wanna be morons I'm up for more Qvic fun, I mean it takes a real genius to try wiping another guild with a 50 mob train but wipe yourselves instead.<br />
<br />
Did a quick test (meaning you're going to call bs, but oh well... I'm atleast able to back my claims up unlike you).  Used Qinimi mobs for this, on these mobs Cease is worth ~790 hate/cast and the ancient stun is worth ~810, call it 800 on a casted stun (it's worth far more in Kod'Taz, Inkuta, Qvic, etc... btw so keep that in mind when checking these values, if you know how I come up with this you'll know that it's extremly difficult to get Kod'Taz+ parses so just know that this aggro will be higher there, by alot... around 60% actually but I can't get beyond close approximations due to the offensive ability of the mobs in the zone and the resources I have aviable to test with). <br />
<br />
Used swing counting to determine aggro.  Proximity used initially, meleed until I got a Ykesha proc, zoned the mob if I didn't get exactly 1 Ykesha proc and nothing else (only Ykesha proc weapon I had access to on a Warrior was on a weapon with another proc so I had to repeat until getting a Ykesha only)<br />
<br />
No aggro mods were used to limit variables I had to deal with.<br />
Test 1:<br />
War - 16 swings+1 Ykesha at 62-64 hate/swing.  992-1024 melee hate+1 Ykesha.<br />
SK - 31 swings at 54 hate/swing needed.  Last swing Triple.  1566-1674 total hate needed.<br />
Ykesha Range=542-682<br />
<br />
Test 2:<br />
War - 5 swings+1 Ykesha at 62-64 hate/swing.  310-320 melee hate+1 Ykesha.<br />
SK - 17 swings at 54 hate/swing needed.  Last swing Triple.  810-918 total hate needed.<br />
Ykesha Range=490-608<br />
<br />
Test 3:<br />
War - 15 swings+1 Ykesha at 62-64 hate/swing.  930-960 melee hate+1 Ykesha.<br />
SK - 28 swings at 54 hate/swing needed.  Last swing Double.  1458-1512 total hate needed.<br />
Ykesha Range=498-582<br />
<br />
Test 4:<br />
War - 12 swings+1 Ykesha at 62-64 hate/swing.  744-768 melee hate+1 Ykesha.<br />
SK - 25 swings at 54 hate/swing needed.  Last Double.  1296-1350 total hate needed.<br />
Ykesha Range=528-606<br />
<br />
If you combine the valid ranges from all of these you'll see that on Qinimi mobs Ykesha is generating between 542 and 582 hate per proc.  As you can see, in Qinimi, Ykesha is very close to Anger 3 aggro wise, and as I pointed out above if you know anything about non direct hate spell aggro you know that it scales up as you get higher end.  Which means, that at slightly above Qinimi level you're crossing over into the range of Ykesha outdoing Anger 3 and far out doing it at the Qvic level (should be getting about 900 hate/proc there following the pattern of other spells)<br />
<br />
In short, this is the exact same principal as Terror spells vs CD, up until about level 52 (varies by hunting zones, but thats the general level used) SK's are better off using Terrors because the mods allowing CD to outdo Terror on the mobs are still small enough at that time to keep Terror generating more.<br />
<br />
Oh, it doesn't matter much since you're going to be seeing a maximum of about 616 more hate/min which means very little when you're generating 23k/min but people saying Anger 3&gt;Ykesha gets on my nerves, espically when I know for a fact they're wrong if they're in anything thats level 60+ content.  So, I'm just sharing a bit of knowledge I've managed to figure out with everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well as far as that goes, there's always 2 sides to every story, not gonna get into a pissing match with ya about that!~<br />
<br />
and as I pointed out above if you know anything about non direct hate spell aggro you know that it scales up as you get higher end.<br />
<br />
Maybe I've lived in a hole forever, but I've never heard that.  So your saying that if you stunned a KT mob, it would generate a larger hate # vs. if you stunned say, an orc pawn?  Extreme example, I know.  For instance...<br />
Stun ---&gt; a cragbeast = 600 hate<br />
Stun ---&gt; an orc pawn = 20 hate<br />
Is that what your saying?  If so how are you arriving at that?  I'm not saying your wrong, I've just never heard it or seen any evidence of it.<br />
<br />
Also, where do you get your numbers for hate per swing?<br />

I sure dont.<br />
Im a warrior.<br />
What exactly do you mean by non direct spell hate aggro?<br />
<br />
I know Anger III is a spell, (Due to no procs when silenced) so I really dont understand.<br />
<br />
Your gonna have to break it down a bit more as I dont cast spells and have no clue what aggro your speaking about.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">yes,  that's what he's saying. This is why level 9/15 spells(stuns for pal, clinging darkness/fear for sk's) are used at the high end of the game. The &quot;debuff&quot; or attempted debuff(including resisted fears, snares, stuns) scales to the mob you are fighting somewhat since you are in effect limiting something with a larger capability.<br />
<br />
edit #1:<br />
<br />
What exactly do you mean by non direct spell hate aggro?<br />
direct hate agro(set to give a numerical amount of hate):<br />
anger 1-3 <br />
terror spells<br />
enraging blow<br />
<br />
things that knights use to get agro don't have a &quot;set hate value&quot;, neither do things like druid atk debuffs, slow, cripple, etc. These things give more agro when they are cast on &quot;harder&quot; mobs.<br />
<br />
edit #2:<br />
<br />
Also, where do you get your numbers for hate per swing?<br />
prolly from here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3789&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1)  and here (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=18154)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If he is right, an 8/23 SSoY still wouldnt beat out a 15/20 BoC, the agro per swing of the BoC would win by far,  even if the BoC didnt have a proc at all I would wager.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna try it, not like I have anything else to spend LDoN points on anymore  :p <br />

<br />
Thanks for the parsing and the input, but I still disagree.  Ikkinz is as far as I've been  in GoD, so there may be some truth to what you are saying regarding the higher end GoD mobs, but up through the elemental planes and the GoD zones we have raided, Anger III has been more effective than my Strike of Ykesha.  You don't need to parse the procs when you can observe for a lengthy period of time the feedback messages and judge which proc is consistently causing the mob to snap back onto you.  Based on my experiences, if your parse is returning contrary information, then I would question the validity of your methodology.  Perhaps it might be more useful if everything we fight wasn't immune to the stun component (which is everything from about 55+), but I haven't really gotten a chance to examine the difference in fighting in, say, The Deep vs. Plane of Fire.<br />
<br />
Obviously, you feel differently, and I hope others who also share your opinion can chime in with additional support for your position (even thought the thread was about Spirit of Rage, so I hope your efforts are not lost to the majority who could benefit from the discussion).  I still like my Ykesha augment, but I have long since moved it from my BF to an off-hand DPS weapon owning to what I felt was inferior aggro generation.  Only one other warrior in our guild has tried the Yak, and he traded it back in for the points to go toward a second Anger III, reporting that he was disappointed in the performance.<br />
<br />
In any case, yours was a good, thoughtful post!  Thanks for the additional information, and for backing it up with an argument!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Thanks for the parsing and the input, but I still disagree.  Ikkinz is as far as I've been  in GoD, so there may be some truth to what you are saying regarding the higher end GoD mobs, but up through the elemental planes and the GoD zones we have raided, Anger III has been more effective than my Strike of Ykesha.  You don't need to parse the procs when you can observe for a lengthy period of time the feedback messages and judge which proc is consistently causing the mob to snap back onto you.  Based on my experiences, if your parse is returning contrary information, then I would question the validity of your methodology.  Perhaps it might be more useful if everything we fight wasn't immune to the stun component (which is everything from about 55+), but I haven't really gotten a chance to examine the difference in fighting in, say, The Deep vs. Plane of Fire.<br />
<br />
It's not contrary information at all and fits in exactly with what I said before with lower end content, Qinimi is pretty low end (atleast my definition of it) being a mid 50's zone.  As the content gets higher the aggro generation gets higher, that quick test alone proves that it's worth more than the ~Anger 2 that many people were believing it was worth (although I could see it being worth that much on Fungus Grove or Sol B mobs or something).  Mobs being immune to the stun component have no bearing on aggro generation, spells are the same hate each time wether it's a resist, hit for any amount, or crit (excluding dot's which just have bugged lame aggro) just like a melee swing with a constant weapon/aggro mod/class is worth the same wether its a miss, hit for any amount, or crit.  The results from that proved exactly what they were meant too, also it wasn't included in the raw dataset but test 3 was just borderline with it's final attack from the SK, the slightest difference in distance changed the mob between me and the warrior so it was extremly borderline (I only kept distance equal to within 1 foot, didnt get more exact than that since well, it's a gigantic pain in the ass) so I would expect Ykeshas hate to be along the very top end of that range between 570 and 582</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If he is right, an 8/23 SSoY still wouldnt beat out a 15/20 BoC, the agro per swing of the BoC would win by far,  even if the BoC didnt have a proc at all I would wager.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna try it, not like I have anything else to spend LDoN points on anymore  :p <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info Brael.  :)<br />
<br />
BoC's have great aggro for a 1h, atleast for Knights, only the stun procing mace in Vxed is capable out aggroing a BoC until Tacvi (and at 70 the BoC will be superior again suprisingly) for Knights.  Fortunatley theres more to weapons than aggro or else it would be pretty sad that a Velious 1h is our best weapon.<br />
<br />
At 3 ppm for a Warrior (going to ignore ranges here to save myself some typing) with lvl 65 an SSoY would be generating 26 hate/swing, with ~1.76 swings/round so 45.76 hate/round, with 110% haste it would be 48.46 rounds/min, so about 2218 hate/min from melee.  The proc would be variable aggro generation, using the 60% increase over Qinimi that you have in Kod'Taz that woud mean around 912 hate/proc, 3 of those per minute plus the melee would get you 4954 hate/min.<br />
<br />
Doing the same thing with a BoC, 33 hate/swing, 1.76 swings/round, 58.08 hate/round, 63 rounds/min, 3659 melee hate/min.  Plus 3 procs of 700 hate, for an extra 2100 so 5759 hate/min.  As you can see, the SSoY still wouldn't win and even if through some fluke it was able to it would be far more proc based rather than melee which would cause your aggro to be extremly inconsistent thus horrible for situations where you kill lots of mobs quickly such as exp groups or yard trash clearing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are you determining hate per swing Brael? I would have thought BoC would be quite a bit more than a 27% increase in hate per swing over an SSoY even with the extra swings factoring in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Damage+(DB*(mod1/mod2)).  The threads were linked elsewhere in this thread where all the work was done to discover it, although they don't quite cover everything since I didn't post everything I've done with this.<br />
<br />
I'll break the formula down into 4 parts.<br />
Damage - This is very simple, it's simply the damage on your weapon, bane damage is counted for this as is Elemental damage.  When using Bash it's the AC on the shield and 25 for shields with 26+ AC.<br />
<br />
Damage Bonus - This is quite literally the dmg bonus shown on your weapon.  When it comes to offhand weapons the DB is 0.  Bash has a DB of 0 as does Kick.  AA's that increase Bash/Kick/Offhand damage while behaving like a DB for the dps portion have no effect on aggro, they're quite literally aggro free dps (just like crits are).<br />
<br />
Mod1 - This is a class based aggro mod.  For SK's it's a base of .84 for Warriors it's somewhere between 1.3 and 1.4, I haven't done enough work to get it down exactly (and I would suspect mods have a level adjustment too so it's very possible these will change at 70).<br />
<br />
Mod2 - This has a base of 1, aggro mod effects will alter it.  If you have a decrease of 20% to aggro (SCS) you will add to it so the new mod would be 1.2.  If you have Echo of Anger (15% more) you would subtract making the new mod .85.  If you have Echo of Anger and Voice of Thule it would be 27% more making the mod .73 (I think, stacking on it's never been proven conclusively or how it works).<br />
<br />
This formula has worked perfectly every time it's been used so far so I'm pretty confident it's correct.<br />
<br />
So for a SSoY in the hands of a Warrior without Echo of Anger it would be 8+(13(1.4/1)) and a BoC would be 15+(13(1.4/1)).  I don't see where you're getting 27% from though, I'm seeing 64.97% more melee aggro over time and 16.25% more total aggro over time.<br />
<br />
The one drawback to Ykesha that I've seen is in Uqua )and it's more assumptnion than anything) but taunt spells tend to give very little there and pure hate seems far superior so you may notice a difference for the worse in that one zone everywhere else it should be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">33 is a 27% increase over 26, was talking about the hate per swing only not over time. It makes sense now that I see the formula though.<br />
<br />
Very nice info, no idea how I missed it, probably when I was skipping over all the baseless 'what a crock of shit' accusations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why will the Boc be superior at 70?<br />
Is it because it closes the gap in levels between the player and the high end mob which takes away the Yak's scaling advantage?<br />

<br />
No, because I've spent lost of time tanking with and beside both procs.I went anger from the start.I prefer anger 2 to ykesha tho that is debatable imo.I don't think Ykesha procs compare favorably at all with anger 3 for aggro.Do you?<br />
<br />
Er I don't get the latest gear must have thingy.I used ykesha procs innate and augged.I used a2 and liked it better(yeah ppl will debate this i don't care they are close),then I got anger 3 and like it a lot more.Other warriors i play with feel the same.So I have that opinion yes.So what is your point?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Where is the data to back up that aggro scales up as the difficulty of mobs scale up?  This thread is the first I've ever seen mention of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">First of all, I did some testing for the aggro mod on Warriors and got 1.32.  I then managed to successfully predict the number of swings it would take to pull aggro using any given setup of Terrors/cast numbers and was successful each time so it looks pretty solid that 1.32 is the mod for Warriors (atleast at 65, after I'm 70 for a bit I'll probally retest to see if the mods have a level based component to them beyond the increase to the dmg bonus you would recieve).<br />
<br />
Using this additional data I went back over the previous parses with Ykesha aggro and can narrow down the hate generation further.  From the possible 40 hate range it had before I've managed to narrow it down to 8.  Heres the adjusted results:<br />
<br />
Test 1:<br />
War - 16 swings/62 hate. 992 hate+1 Ykesha.<br />
SK - 31 swings/54 hate. Last swing Triple. 1566-1674 total hate needed.<br />
Ykesha Range=574-682<br />
<br />
Test 2:<br />
War - 5 swings/62 hate. 310 hate+1 Ykesha.<br />
SK - 17 swings/54 hate. Last swing Triple. 810-918 total hate needed.<br />
Ykesha Range=500-608<br />
<br />
Test 3:<br />
War - 15 swings/62 hate. 930 hate+1 Ykesha.<br />
SK - 28 swings/54 hate. Last swing Double. 1458-1512 total hate needed.<br />
Ykesha Range=528-582<br />
<br />
Test 4:<br />
War - 12 swings/62 hate. 744 hate+1 Ykesha.<br />
SK - 25 swings/54 hate. Last Double. 1296-1350 total hate needed.<br />
Ykesha Range=552-606<br />
<br />
This makes the new possible range for Ykesha on these mobs 574-582 not that it really matters a whole lot since I've already made my point with hate scaling and just how much Ykesha is on anything a level 65 or even level 60 is going to be fighting.<br />
<br />
Now, Kilzalot since you want some proof I'll give you 2 forms of it.<br />
1.  Go hit a moss snake with Cease then cast hate spells on it, I can guarantee you it won't require 1000 hate (or even the 790ish that Cease generates on the same mobs I tested Ykesha on)<br />
<br />
2.  I did a quick test in FG.  The Warrior I was using at the time didn't have any Ykesha procs so I just used the SK for Ykesha procs.  I had 54 hate/swing and proced after 1 swing so 54 hate+1 Ykesha.  Using the above data on Warrior aggro I was able to simply hit the mob with the Warrior using a Fine Steel Dagger (12 hate/swing) until I pulled aggro.  I got a bit unlucky with swings and got a flurry on the turn so it took between 32 and 35 swings to pull aggro which means 384 to 420 hate required to outaggro 54 hate+1 Ykesha on this mob (light blue &quot;an underbulk&quot;).  From there you can do some simple math to see that 54+Y=384 or 420 so 330 to 366 hate was generated by the Ykesha proc.  However since I have subtlety (20% decrease) you have to correct for that which means 330*1.2 and 366*1.2 giving a range of 396-439 hate.  Theres some proof of hate scaling.<br />
<br />
Also Raaj, it appears you're correct about the Incite line.  I did a test with Provoke using proximity aggro and then Provoke (used mutant dregs for this unlike the bug things for the other tests).  A full run of Provoke should generate 595 hate but with Voice of Thule on it was requiring somewhere between 661 and 684 hate to pull aggro (Double Attacks are a giant pain in the ass).  This means that either both parts of the line are getting affected or just 1 is as 662 and 676 hate both fall within that valid range.  Since it's such a minor possible difference in aggro however I simply don't care enough to verify it either way, if someone else wants to they can all the datas aviable.  So Brutul was correct there although his suggestion of Spirit of Rage+Incite is such a minor increase it seems like a waste of endurance to me.</div></div><hr />

Your warriors are idiots if they listen to you.  Ive used them both for a long time and ykesha is shit aggro it really doesnt matter what numbers you post.  There is a significant different in aggro both short and long turn comparing anger 3 to ykesha.

I have never actually done this.  It wouldn't take much END if you clicked off spirit of rage right after hitting incite, but as you say it's a pretty insignificant amount of aggro.  It's about as useful as anything else you can do with spirit of rage tho :p.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Brael,<br />
Yes; assuming the formula is correct, it makes sense. After I posted the question I realized that the default denominator had to be one. For some reason I had it in my head that you were suggesting the default was zero, but you didn't and of course a denominator of zero doesn't make sense.<br />
By the way, although I knew about the library post here, I didn't know about your test thread, Brael; extremely nice work as far as I can tell.<br />
I'm still thinking about your claim that Anger III &lt; Ykesha in hate generation. The accepted point of view among warriors is that Anger III &gt; Ykesha by more than a bit, if I'm not mistaken. However, I'm not aware of warrior testing of this issue, most especially against non-green mobs.<br />
If your numbers are correct, then as you tested Ykesha, it generates 542-582 hate on Qinimi level mobs. Assuming your assumption about scale-ability for non-direct hate is correct, and that all non-direct hate spells behave the same way, then at some point Ykesha &gt; Ang. III's 600 hate.<br />
This is not the &quot;feeling&quot; warriors have. It's not the way that Ykesha &amp; Anger III augs are priced, either. Now, it's been demonstrated for some time that untested &quot;I-know-it-works-that-way&quot; theories are often incorrect, so the fact that warriors' &quot;experience&quot; that  Anger III &gt; Ykesha is no proof (actually, it holds some weight, but then so does the opposite &quot;experience&quot; of the warriors you've convinced to switch). And, although in the case of the various levels of Anger augs and the relative power of armor, LDoN prices correlate to the value of the item purchased, merchant pricing variations in Ykesha and Anger III augs is also not proof one is more valuable that the other.<br />
If I'm not mistaken, then, your idea that Ykesha &gt; Anger III against top-end mobs is based on the following assumptions:<br />
1. the melee formula for non-proc  weapon hate production is D+ (DB * [Mod 1/ Mod 2] for mainhand/2H weapons.<br />
2. Lucy's listed hate of Anger III at 600 is correct.<br />
3. The hate generated by direct hate spells is a constant unaffected by mob level.<br />
4. Incite and Anger III function as direct hate spells.<br />
5. non-direct hate spells produce hate which scales with the level of the mob.<br />
6. All non-direct hate spells scale in the same way.<br />
7. Ykesha is a non-direct hate spell (at least the stun component of it).<br />
<br />
If you are correct in these assumptions (and I'm using &quot;assumptions&quot; in the broadest sense, as the levels of evidence backing these statements vary somewhat, but none are without some foundation), then warriors appear to have 1) underestimated the hate production of Ykesha, and 2) underweighted the value of the hate produced by the non-proc &quot;potential damage&quot; aspect of their weapons. (Especially, it seems, in regard to the DB*Mod 1/Mod 2 portion of the equation for mainhands, and perhaps in particular the effect of the difference in warrior Mod 1 value and the Mod 1 value of other classes.<br />
Is that a fairly accurate summation?<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, your findings on the way shields work is exactly in line with Ruatha's observations a long time ago as he was fiddling around with ghetto bashing.<br />
Have you attempted to attack a mob with a warrior who is only using an offhand weapon (something like fishing pole in mainhand) and then casting a spell that would modify Mod 2? If your assumption that Mod 1/ Mod 2 are multiplied by DB is correct, the modifying spell would have no effect on offhand hate production.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">quote from Brael in post #28 of this thread:<br />
 &quot;If you combine the valid ranges from all of these you'll see that on Qinimi mobs Ykesha is generating between 542 and 582 hate per proc. As you can see, in Qinimi, Ykesha is very close to Anger 3 aggro wise, and as I pointed out above if you know anything about non direct hate spell aggro you know that it scales up as you get higher end. Which means, that at slightly above Qinimi level you're crossing over into the range of Ykesha outdoing Anger 3 and far out doing it at the Qvic level (should be getting about 900 hate/proc there following the pattern of other spells)&quot;<br />
<br />
So, yeah, that's what he's saying. In fact, he's saying that early on the Ykesha is not that far off, and eventually it exceeds Ang III by substantial amounts.<br />
<br />
Looks to me like basically if you grant him his melee formula, and that non-direct hate spells scale like he says, then the only question is: does Y-stun work like other non-direct spells?<br />
<br />
Actually, I'd be surprised if he were correct. On the other hand, I've been surprised before, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is true than my BBotE with a Ykesha aug should be a champ for aggro.  I tried Tipt with a BBotE mainhand and a GBoS offhand last night and it was immediately apparent that my aggro had gone in the shitter.  Both the rog and cleric asked me within a couple mobs wtf I was doing and why was I not holding aggro.  I hadn't said anything to them about swapping weapons.  I switched to an A3 bloodfrenzy mainhand and the BBotE offhand and had no more aggro problems (usually use A3 BoW).  The stun-proc test wasn't completely fair, because neither weapon was aug'd.  I will probably buy a Ykesha aug for my BBotE soon and experiment with it mainhand vs. my A3 Bloodfrenzy but it's hard to come up with more than just a &quot;feeling&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">This makes the new possible range for Ykesha on these mobs 574-582 not that it really matters a whole lot since I've already made my point with hate scaling and just how much Ykesha is on anything a level 65 or even level 60 is going to be fighting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm, interesting tests Brael.  I'm curious to see how significantly the aggro on stuns and debuffs scales as mob level increases.  If Ykesha is really almost 600 hate on level 65ish mobs and potentially more than 600 hate on mobs greater than 65 as it looks like your tests are suggesting then I may try switching to ykesha augs and see how I like it.<br />
<br />
As for the idea of using Spirit of Rage, IMO it's completely worthless.  The only time a 50% aggro boost would help me is right at the beginning of a fight.  The only type of fight where I care that much about aggro is a boss or a named.  If I'm fighting a boss or a named I'm popping Furious at the beginning of the fight to allow time for slow.  I'm sure they meant well when they added it but the fact that you can't use it in conjunction with the furious or defensive lines makes it completely useless.</div></div><hr />

Goto KT and fight with one warrior until you get a proc.  Then stop, turn around (so you don't riposte any) and have the second warrior hit it until he steals aggro.<br />

Are you sure of it. looks strange to me because GoD is known for its low HP mob (compared to PoP and other)and you said that stuns generate more aggro in low-GoD than in low-PoP. Can it be on lvl or on max DPS (afterall the max dps of mobs seams to scale with difficulty in PoP and GoD).<br />
<br />
There is a cap Flair, from testing I've been able to narrow it down to somewhere between 1170 and 1250 per effect ...<br />
<br />
do you mean that a proc with one effect (stun only) is max 1200 hate but a proc with two effects (stun and debuff) is max 2400 hate. Sorry but I don't think it's consistant with spell hate, and up to now we have concidered procs as spells. for exanple the new OoW max DD spell of wiz is Core of Fire, 4070DD, that would generated with no AA/focus/whatever on an opening (4070*2/3)*1.4 = 3799 hate for only one effect. and if you think it's not a proof because it's a theory not a parse, then you can go for graff's parses of Strikes of Solusek, 2740DD, that draws 1827 hate on a normal basis, and that generate 2557 hate when the wiz isn't on the hate list (use of SoS to enter the hate list)...<br />
tell them that hate generation is capped at 1200 per effect and see how they react.<br />
<br />
But now, since you parsed 'a cap' on the hate generation of proc, then it may come from something else, not because there is a cap. for example it might mean that you can't generated more than 1200 hate at once because your tools aren't as powerfull as wizzards.<br />
<br />
If you could share your in between parses, ask comment on them to find a formula hidden beyond. We would be able to give more accurate thought rather than 'na, it's not like this because I don't feel alike...'<br />

That makes way more sense than HP or even level.  I could have done this much damage but I'm stunned so I now I'm really pissed.  I'm still waiting to see something that backs up Braels argument that its hitpoints, not atk rating or level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Mobs being immune to the stun component have no bearing on aggro generation, spells are the same hate each time wether it's a resist, hit for any amount, or crit (excluding dot's which just have bugged lame aggro) just like a melee swing with a constant weapon/aggro mod/class is worth the same wether its a miss, hit for any amount, or crit.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I don't buy this.<br />
<br />
Granted, a hit = a miss = a crit (for melee).<br />
Granted, regular damage = partial resist = total resist = a crit (for spells).<br />
<br />
Where I disagree with you is your contention that IMMUNE aggro = resist aggro.  From testing in PoFire (second castle, first floor) with a pair of 66 warriors (one with Blade of War + A3, the other with Greatstaff of the Four Winds + 125 Ykesha, no taunts, no aggro mods, simultaneously engaging the mobs), I found that the GS4W could draw aggro from the BoW with 'resisted' ykesha procs, but not with 'immune' proc messages.<br />
<br />
Since the EQ combat engine first checks if the spell/proc is resisted, THEN checks if the target is immune, as the level of the mob goes up, resisted (ie full aggro) ykesha procs go up, and 'immune' (ie low or no aggro) procs goes down.  Therefore, a Ykesha aug will naturally cause more aggro in Muramite Proving Grounds than in Bastion of Thunder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps I'm having a slow day, but I'm having trouble following this. If the resist check is first, and it generates the same hate resisted or not, how could a subsequent check on immune matter in such a way that mobs more likely to be immune hate the attacker more?<br />
<br />
Also, Brael's proposition is for the aggro to scale per proc/cast in a graduated fashion, not &quot;full aggro&quot; or &quot;low aggro&quot; either/or result, if I understand what he's saying.</div></div><hr />

I think he's saying it scales to the mobs hit points (dunno where he gets hitpoints from though.  he said he eleminated level but I dunno how he did it).  The amount of hate per cast on any particular mob will be the same (at least with stuns).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Aye, I'm trying to figure out how that &quot;scales with hps&quot; would fit in with Bigrin's description of immune proc generating low aggro while resist proc result generates high aggro. Bigrin's description sounds like a description of an &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; hate result on each proc, whereas Brael's sounds like a more graduated scale of aggro based not on the mob's immunity to the proc but on the mob's hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Brabble:<br />
<br />
Try thinking about it like this:<br />
Step 1: Check Resist<br />
 - If Resisted, apply full aggro<br />
 - If not resisted, go to step 2<br />
Step 2: Check Immune<br />
 - If Immune, then stop.<br />
 - If not immune, then apply full aggro<br />
<br />
<br />
Brael contends that Resist aggro = Immune aggro = regular proc aggro.  I disagree.  I think that an unresisted proc on a 56+ mob (ie a proc that generates the 'your target is immune to the stun portion of this effect' message) stun is little or no aggro.<br />
<br />
This leads to the theory that a Ykesha aug will generate more aggro vs a level 72 mob than vs a level 56 mob, since the level 72 mob will resist more procs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">think of Actual_proc_hate = Based_proc_hate x Mob_Modifier x Immunity_check_mod x First_attack_check<br />
<br />
thus the hate generated can be turned on/off/half off by the immunity_check_mob, and when there is no immunity the hate generated can scales with a mob's modifier based on HP/DPS/ATK/LVL/whatever. and finally the first_attack_check lets pure hate spells/skills to be capped when the 'caster' isn't on the hate list. and we can even had another mod to cap the global hate generated depending on the spell/proc/skill (wiz have no cap on their DD's hate value, but Breal seams to have found a cap on stun's hate).<br />

in such conditions you will spam your chat with 'out of range' errors, but if you get a proc before going back in melee range this means we will be able to test the difference between proc and spell because we will be able to 'cast' our procs without any melee domage.</div></div><hr />

As Haas pointed out, most of the stuff from the velious days got eaten by EzBoard a long time ago.  I can offer you the anecdotal evidence that I tanked my way through velious using a willsapper, doing slow-immune mobs like Vindicator, Tormax, the AoW, etc. dozens of times using nothing but my willsapper and primal, and held aggro just fine, which doesn't seem likely if the slow proc on my sapper wasn't putting out any aggro.  At the same time, the SoD was the end-all be-all tank weapon, and it's stun didn't work on almost *any* boss mob.  <br />

Anyhow, you're the one trying to challenge the common wisdom, so I'd say the burden of proof is on you.  Do a scientific test or get used to people discounting your theory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given the number of things that have changed since Velious, I'm not willing to take it on faith that &quot;resist = immune&quot; anymore, if it ever did.<br />

What would you consider a 'scientific test', and how much of the raw data do I need to post?  My methodology to date has been to go into BoT with a CLR, SK, &amp; WAR.  The SK pulled with an arrow, then cast Terror of Thule, at which time the WAR beat on the giant with a ykesha-aug'd Fine Steel Two-handed Sword until gaining aggro.  The SK had a brewing trophy &amp; shield euipped to eliminate ripostes.  As I mentioned previously, the WAR pulled aggro with 'resisted' procs, but not with 'immune' procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">The fuck are you talking about?<br />
<br />
Everything 55+ is Immune to stuns, and I hold aggro just fine with my SoD and Copper Hammer.<br />
<br />
If I didn't, there would be a real difference between shit 55 and higher, and stuff below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">to improve your parse you have to cast multiple times ToT (lets say 100 times) then count the swing# and the resist stun # and the immune proc # and the landed proc # (easy on this one ;) ).<br />
then do this parses again and again with mem blur in between.<br />
<br />
if from one test to another, you see :<br />
swing#1 + resist#1 + immune#1 = constant (close to constant because of the swing# that will vary) for each test then resist 's hate = immune's hate<br />
if not, then you will need a lot of test to use statistic to get the ratio between resist's hate and immune's hate. if so you will have to cast ToT alot more in order to reduce the test#.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">If someone has all the old patch msgs they should be able to go back to shortly after Velious and pull up the patch msg when they changed aggro on debuffs like slow. They stated that the aggro generated was dependant on hps of the mobs and since Velious allowed hps to go past 32k now it made them generate large amounts of aggro. It's been a while but as a shaman it's something I definitely noticed and saw the difference after the change. Wouldn't suprise me if stuns worked the same way too.<br />
<br />
As for a test mob, thriftling focusers of what ever those guys by tunare are? Not the easiest mob to work with but an absolute ton of hps and a joke for dps delt now a days.</div></div><hr />
