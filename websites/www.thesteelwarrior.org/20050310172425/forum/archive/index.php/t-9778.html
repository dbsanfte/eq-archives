Since EQ 2 came out we barelly can pass 30 players online so its barelly free night or augs farming in Anguish \ epic fights . It will probably get worse with WoW and even worse with time untill everyone as got there quota of doing circle to square one .  On my side i do not intend to quit anytime soon but this is very painfull ... people disapearing with out warning can turn off EQ loyalist . <br />
<br />
Are we forced to move to EQ2 and become casual without been able to progress in EQ1 or are we supose to keep doing loop to square one by recruting again and again ? <br />
<br />
Any others guilds having the same problems ? I have no doubt  but will we have any surviver out of this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">alot of guilds biting the bullet right now.  it's just like with WoW beta and uqua.  rebuild, reflag, regear, move on.  or you could just give in and quit, that works too heh.  <br />
<br />
either way, a couple weeks ago we had about 45 people on one night, so we started recruiting.  had 65 on last night :\  just gotta suck it up if you wanna keep playing, it's a tough choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no doubt that the combination of EQ2 and WoW will take the biggest chunk out of EQ that has ever been taken out of it.  That said, I think it's a little early to panic.  Don't disband your guild because you have 30 people on raids for a week or two.  I think that there will be plenty of people left in EQ.  You will see some guild mergers and probably just about all big guilds recruiting, which will take a bite out of the smaller/lower level guilds.  Some guilds are gonna fold.  Some of the people that are gone now will be back though.  I'm sure a lot are trying out the WoW open beta, but not all of them will buy it.   A lot of people will play EQ2 for a week or two (or a month or two) and decide it's not for them and come back.  Others plan to play both games, since EQ2 is supposed to be more casual, but are mostly playing EQ2 right now because it's new.  Some of them are playing Half Life 2 and will be back when they beat it in a week.  Some of them are gone for good.  <br />
<br />
If I was an EQ1 guildleader right now I would be telling people to relax, go grind out some AA, work on their epics, get their spells, play Half Life 2, or whatever, and in a couple weeks we can evaluate what we have and decide where to go from there, but I think it would be premature to say that EQ is dead and all the guilds are gonna go belly up.<br />
<br />
My guild has been averaging about 10-15 less per night than usual the last week or so.  We are still killing our farm targets but are short numbers for progression raids.  Recruiting is harder on test than most servers, but we'll see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember hearing Stormhammer figures to 400 on peak.  Now if you figure at most 1/4th the people is willing to pay 4X the price to play EQ, that means other server still peak at around 1600.  In reality I'm sure the ratio of people willing to pay 4X is a lot less than 1/4th.  <br />
<br />
Your server forms a certain amount of guild based on its current population.  When you have a noticeable drop that is distributed roughly equally serverwide, then this kind of behavior is expected.  Since most guilds tend to recruit just enough, losing 10 people would hurt a lot.  On Drinal the public guild seems to be doing just fine since they always have large numbers anyway, so losing 20 out of say 100 doesn't cripple the guild's ability to function, where as losing 20 out of 60 does.</div></div><hr />

My guild disbanded. You either anticipate player loss and recruit recruit recruit (and accept the fact there will be more new faces than old eventually) or you let it die.<br />
<br />
In my view there are no advantages for a guild to be small anymore. Recruit.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of players that put in a lot of playtime and can make the commitment needed for high level raiding. Besides, 3 raids a week is plenty/7 is not really needed. 50% attendance (not 10%) can be handled/100% is not manditory.<br />
<br />
Equipping a new member need not be an issue for high level guilds. High level raiding is not rocket science, guilds need not only recruit so-called quality players (except for attitude) - quantity has a quality all of it's own.<br />
<br />
I think server #1 guilds will persist. Other guilds will either be aggressive about merging, forming alliances, recruiting or accept dying out.<br />
<br />
Only 20 people showing up on raid night? Recruit 10 new people this week and 10 the next. Those not showing up don't deserve the guild to protect them from 15 Warriors all wanting the same piece of gear. By not showing up, they asked for the guild to have 15 Warriors so those wanting to raid can. The absent gave up having any say in the matter. 90 people showed up??!! Raid two targets.<br />
<br />
BTW, don't ever simply cancel raids. Choose a new target. EQ has legitimate targets for 72, 50, 24, 18, or even 6 players. You aren't up to an 18 player raid? Others are - by showing up they indicated they they are ready to raid and enjoy an EQ guild activity (rather than being eager to get back to CoH or WoW). It's the officers responsibility to insure there is a guild and activities. Never ever cancel raiding - choose another target.<br />
<br />
EQ has years left in it. Wether you do or your guild is a seperate issue.<br />

I haven't really raided in months and eqlive has become progressively worse every patch to me. OoW just hid that fact for about 3 weeks but it came back full force. Haven't logged in for almost two weeks and doubt I will much at all till the acc's run out this month. <br />
<br />
Was a good run but the whole trying to play with 70 other people raids really turned me off of the game I was a diehard player in. Now it's just fun to read the boards and watch the rats jump as I smirk and realize I don't have to be around certain players anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if EQ1 is really &quot;dead&quot;, but I do think it's realistic to expect a big hit for the next 6 weeks between WoW, EQ2, Halo2, Afterlife2, and the holidays.  Any one of these would be a hit...the fact that they are all coming at the same time means a larger hit than normal.  Of course, how many people claimed EQ1 was dead when DAOC came out??   ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of time is doable with 30. And I don't understand this hostility towards highend guilds. Is it just that they have phatter loot? If your guild hasn't seen 30 people on all year, its barely a guild, and unless youre happy with it, its your own damn responsibility to leave. Everyone has the option to raid in this game, if you choose not to for whatever reason, be it schedule problems, laziness, or you just like to hang out on the anti-uber bandwagon, thats your own problem. Unlike life, EQ gives everyone the opportunity to rise the ladder with time.</div></div><hr />

I actually had zero intentions of jumping over but my guild disintegrated so I said WTF lets try it.<br />
<br />
But having played EQ2 fairly regularly I can honestly say it completely outclasses the orginal in almost every fashion OTHER than gigantic raid-army content. The design is solid and seems to have many many wrinkles that allow for better game play over the orginal (I was a day one EQ1 player btw).<br />
<br />
EQ2 has allowed me to have fun again, its focus really isnt on loot and i can count on 1 hand the number of idiotic /ooc /shouts I have seen in game (on a jam packed server).  Dunno I think as folks get better wind of this the only peeps will stay in EQ1 are the &quot;hard core&quot; raiders.  Question is how much fun will it be to be uber when you are the only ones left (king of ashes?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Taunt WORKS, AET you get  at 14 is freaking awesome.  We get a skill at 16 called &quot;Hold the Line&quot;, its roots you but EVERY hit you make is a taunt hit and it last for 12 hrs you click it off anytime you want.<br />
<br />
  Warriors can SOLO and do a damn good job of it, there is NO down time over 30 sec, a tank (no healer) group can kill as fast as mobs can be pulled with no downtime at all.  <br />
<br />
  Quest WORK and are worth doing, you get items that are above you that you grow into not items 10-15 lvls below you, you get EXP, I got 16% exp for one quest last night that I did solo.<br />
<br />
  Anyone that plays a game to have FUN would never go back to eq-I after palying eq-II unless you like to sit and watch the game.<br />
<br />
  AND YES you still die and some times a lot.<br />
<br />
Just my two coppers, 95% of the people you see leave this time wont be back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played EQ2 in beta and prefer EQ still by quite a bit.Even with 0 raiding i like the old version better.The new one has all sorts of limitations in place to solve old problems with player grief by reducing player freedom.It has a negative effect on immersion for me.It also seemed very dumbed down.Too user friendly almost hehe.:)I hate the little flashing chain buttons.They make me feel like im playing a console fighting game instead of a rpg.<br />
<br />
My guild has lots of members in EQ2 and WOW that  raid with us still and show up for regular groups etc.We will expand our club to some degree so people can keep in touch.EQ2 is new,some of it is very pretty and I expect SOE to foucs on improving it.However,the majority of folks I play with either feel that EQ is simply a better game(for it's raiding or otherwise),or,they have too much invested with characters,friends and our guild to see EQ2 has a better alternative.<br />
<br />
Yeah,it's early and time will tell.Imo something far better will come along not too far down the road and make a far bigger differance than EQ2 and WOW.It's a tough time for guilds in EQ tho.Lot's of guilds are collapsing under the strain of a shrinking playerbase.Final Door has a lot of good folks that have a healthy EQ outlook and we seem to be doing well.We have been getting a lot of fresh blood recently due to stress on other guilds.Of course, we're pretty casual and have a lot of content in front of us.I don't think EQ is dead yet.Lots of fun to be had hehe.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I have seen, EQ2 is for people who like flash.  Your character does spinning attacks with glowing weapons if you can glue your eyes to the screen and catch when your special attack openings come up.  When it comes down to it though, you are killing rat_05 to get exp to make your character more powerful and get loot so you can kill gnoll_04 and then move on to bandit_08, etc.<br />
<br />
I think with EQ2 and WoW some people will leave to try them, some will come back, others will not, just like any other game that has come along.<br />

<br />
Remind you of anything?<br />
<br />
My guild has suffered major because of EQ2. People pretty much log on, raid, log off, and if a raid is called they don't like, they log. We still get 50-60 people a night, but the problem we face is all the healers left. EQ isn't dead, I doubt it will be until people can solo anything in the game they want because their characters are so powerful.<br />
<br />
I remmber quite a few times when EQ was &quot;Dead&quot;, but it rebounded, as it will this time. To many things happened at one time to not expect a HUGE hit at the very least.<br />
EQ2,Halo2,Halflife2,WoW,Holidays,etc..<br />
<br />
I have no intentions of leaving EQ, for anything. I'm not really hardcore either, so the &quot;only Hardcore will stay&quot; arguement is dumb. Good luck with EQ2/WoW/etc, hope they treat you well.</div></div><hr />

Some people *may* come back to EQ1 after trying the other games, but not all of them.  If there aren't many new people signing up for EQ1, well...  it's just a matter of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, I took a completely different view.  I felt the only ones left would be the casuals, who still have a long way to go to reach the end of the game and - theoretically - still appreciate it even when they aren't surrounded by 383010110 other people.   I've just been thinking about the longevity of the game and it seemed to be that of the types of players we see in EQ, those who require raiding to have fun will the most effected by lack of numbers.  <br />
<br />
(And, no, Brutul, this isn't intended to be a casual v. raider debate  :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Vigdis and Flair are probably both right: Some hardcore guilds will be hit hard and some casual guilds will be hit hard. Others in both categories will not.<br />
Lots of people play this game to no small degree because of the folks they know in game. So, you could have two very similar guilds with two different outcomes: in one guild, not many folks move to a new game; in another, a few people move, say they like it, others join them, then their friends join them, and pretty soon if you want to play with your friends you're playing the new game too.<br />
I wouldn't say that the difference will be along casual/Uber lines. Uber folks might leave EQ 1 because either they feel <br />
A) they've seen all they're going to see in this game, or <br />
B) their guild takes a hit and they have to decide either to find all new friends (and perhaps have to repeat same old content) in the old game or stick with their old friends in a new game. <br />
<br />
Casuals, however, can also feel both A and B. The particulars of A and B will vary, of course, depending on the players' situations, but some of the basic potential concerns will be the same. And, on the other hand, some folks in both categories won't really feel much pressure from either A or B.<br />
Some will leave and some will stay til the lights go out.</div></div><hr />

It is not at all surprising that EQ isn't growing, so of course it is losing #s, but it is a bit premature to call it dead seeing it's still the biggest MMORPG in US/Euro areas (Asian markets are not on an even competing field due to lack of US PC penetration).  <br />
<br />
Actually saying EQ is dead reminds me of people saying Japan's going to run out of people because the average couple in Japan have less than 2 babies (need about 2.2 to break even).  Yes the # of people might be going down but it isn't exactly something to worry about just yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe I'm mistaken by what you mean here, but the Asian MMO market is huge and much more promising than our own. Unfortunately for EQ it also has several games that already have it pretty much cornered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Asian PC games are very undeveloped compared to the rest of the world, even Japan.  In the case of Japan, xenophobia also helps to stifle foreign competition (for example, Diablo 2 was licensed by Capcom in Japan).  FF11 ran pretty much unopposed in what's probably the 2nd biggest gaming market in the world.  To put things in perspective, only 2 or 3 adult PC games (Fate, Air, maybe Tsukihime)ever sold more than 100K in Japan, and adult PC games are mainstream there unlike here.  I don't know the non adult PC games number offhand but it's hard to imagine such games do any better in a culture that does embrace adult games.  Certainly when I ask my Japanese translator friend to name some famous Japanese PC games the adult ones come up first.<br />
<br />
Other Asian markets are in similar boat (though maybe not nearly as adult-oriented).  Although Korea may have a zillion computer cafes they certainly do not embrace western PC gaming which gives native games a very significant advantage.  I've bought native MMORPG from Taiwan that you can probably make better with a RPGMaker and there's supposed 100K+ or whatever people playing those too.<br />
<br />
Though I do think Korea is emerging as a pretty decent software powerhouse, since having 3 million, or even 1/10th that, peoplepaying a monthly fee is a ton of money.</div></div><hr />

I believe there was once a Korean EQ server (Lord Nagafen), but apparently that was scrapped.<br />
<br />
Aside from MMORPGs, Koreans are huge fans of Starcraft, Counterstrike and Warcraft 3.  However, my immersion into the Korean gaming society has been pretty much nonexistant since I got my home PC and internet connection set up (almost 6 months ago), so my information may be a bit outdated.<br />
<br />
Completely off topic, but it would be interesting to see whether or not WoW makes any kind of impact in Korea.</div></div><hr />

You may not notice it because it's not trickled to the high level yet but without those neverending supplies of newbies to grow into hardcore raiders the candle can't keep burning bright forever. <br />
<br />
I'd hate to be in a smaller guild come the next few months as your members get scooped up by the circling vultures to replenish their ranks. If you've got clerics I'd suggest you make them happy as rain or you're going to get dicked hard. <br />

But at least now the Koreans have reason to stick to their native games since they're getting pretty good at making games, no doubt thanks to the generous support of its native population.</div></div><hr />

I've tried EQ2, and although the game looks immaculate, it just doesn't have the same atmosphere to it.<br />
<br />
I've been in WoW, and I'd hate to be seen to be jumping on the bandwagon, but I hadn't been so excited about playing a game since I first started EQ. I even had the same &quot;I should take the day off work and level/not sleep&quot; feeling I had in the first couple of months of EQ. <br />
I've been frustrated a little trying to adapt to some of the newer controls (Am I the only person that doesn't like W,A,S,D and mouse to manouvre?) but it's actually fun. Something that disappeared in EQ for me a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

I highly doubt that SoE will put in any real effort into EQ1 when EQ2 is successful, which does just mean that more crappy expansions will come.<br />

And for the dead, the dieing process is already on, almost no more newbie guilds, midlvl guilds on SolRo are dieing, uberguilds are merging (at least on US Time). I guess the 1st server mergers will be in a 1/4 year<br />

And I don't understand this hostility towards highend guilds. Is it just that they have phatter loot? If your guild hasn't seen 30 people on all year, its barely a guild, and unless youre happy with it, its your own damn responsibility to leave. Everyone has the option to raid in this game, if you choose not to for whatever reason, be it schedule problems, laziness, or you just like to hang out on the anti-uber bandwagon, thats your own problem. Unlike life, EQ gives everyone the opportunity to rise the ladder with time. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry Solanthus I didn't mean to come off sounding hostile.. I am not lazy and am definately not anti-uber. My guild was a collection of friends that I had played with over the years which toward the end of last year was working on VT progression. I myself only have about 4-5 hours a day to play. (hell my wife thinks thats too much) I have been in several guilds in my casual playing over the last 4 years and when the other guilds folded and players moved on to bigger better places. I applied to those guilds along with them. But alas I didn't get in . Most recently over the last few months as this guild was going downhill I started apping again. Just to find that my 100AA's arent enough, not the right type, not enough flags,  not lvl 70 , don't have the correct gear etc. and be denied.  I'm not mad at the upper guilds on my server. In fact grats to all them.  I'm glad they can do time with 30 people. But just maybe with the flood of people leaving for EQ2 / WoW now maybe they will need to look to people like me to fill the ranks of pople that are leaving. Before I decide to move on also.</div></div><hr />

Youngest just left FFXI with a level 75 character with extraordinarily good gear for a non-Japanese player and most flags. He feels when you've hit 75 there isn't much to do.<br />
<br />
Son and friend did WoW Beta. Friend did EQ2 and not buying it. He said it's like Coke Classic/New Coke - it will increase the Coke market somewhat but there's not enough differance between the two for most to abandon Coke Classic nor to cause additional people to try New Coke just because it's new and they always meant to try Coke.<br />

They don't want to deal with mostly younger players who think they are ready to play a MMoRPG now.<br />

Anyway Are those things all dead?  well some are officially dead because their servers were all shut down.  But as in the Txt muds and UO...some people will hang on for 20 years.  It won't be a growing or thriving world...it won't be THE THING...It might be hobbled, pathetic, outdated, feeble, desolate, sad, dreary, and pointless...but it will technically still live, even if only 100 people are left per server and each uses 4 accounts with 8 alts all 70th level and Time flagged....Kinda like the 55 year old guy down the street who still talks nonstop about being the Highschool football star.<br />

If OoW had been another PoP/GoD, I definitely think it would have been a serious nail in the coffin for EQ, but since it wasn't and seems to have been fairly popular with everyone, not just the casuals and not just the raiders, I think it has probably helped to breath some new life into EQ.  Of course raiders will slowly trickle away as they get to the point where they've conquered all the challenges worth conquring.  That just tends to be way things go.  It really isn't realistic for SoE to keep the expansions coming at a pace that will keep the heavy duty uber raiders interested while also maintaining any kind of quality.  I think they've shown that to be true far too often already to really be debatable.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, but I don't see EQ attracting large numbers of new players.  And if that perception is correct then EQ is destined to slowly fade away.  But that fade may take a very long time indeed.  Lots of people will play the game to the bitter end.</div></div><hr />

You see, most characters don't really die. After five years away from M:TG, I went to a pre-release tournament. Not enough to get me back into the game but the barrier to re-entry isn't high.<br />
<br />
And young players have moved on from Poke-Mon to Yu Ghio to playing M:TG to asking dad where he keeps his cards to playing Type 1. My middle son was quite happy to have my power 9 and resume a game he quit in his teens.<br />
<br />
The same will prove true of EQ.<br />
<br />
There may be also some shift from guild raiding to horribly overpowered former QVic+ groups killing every pop in WoS. I think the whole zone could be held by three groups using two pullers (Ranger and a Bard) each taking almost every named pop. Should be fun 8P.<br />

I can just imagine a guild made of entirely such people defeating Mata Muram and it drops a 8/20 weapon, and everyone rejoices because inflation is curbed.  No items more powerful than the original EQ has dropped despite defeating an encounter that is manyfolds harder than anything original EQ has to offer.  But all in the name of balance, right?<br />

Er no.Final Door on Stromm has never missed a week clearing to Quarm in months.HE has apparently also reinforced itself recently and gone back into Time.You guys just got there I know,but,FD has been there awhile and never failed to clear Time since our first Quarm kill on the weekends.Even though before the last round of backflags we were doing it with 40ish ppl.Our raids in GOD instanced stuff are over full atm and Time normally has 50+ ppl.Not sure how you got this idea how VA was the only guild on Stromm clearing time hehe.:)<br />
<br />
I am sorry to see you guys fold tho.It's a very tough time in EQ for many guilds atm with perhaps harder times to come in the near future.It sucks to see good guilds fall.With the release of WOW we'll see another hit to the playerbase and time will tell how remaining guilds fair.When you get to Time from what 've seen guilds tend to take a morale hit.Same after you kill Quarm.It's great to win and it feels good.However,it can have a negative effect on numbers.Hope you guys find other fun stuff to do.VA did well for itself on Stromm.I'm sorry to see it end.<br />
<br />
Final Door is doing well atm btw.We're progressing  have good numbers and high morale.EQ is not over Imo,lots of fun stuff left to see and mobs to kill for many folks.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, meant to say European time zone guilds. I think the end of VA pretty much is the end for any raiding guilds outside of the US time zones.<br />

We are trying to organize one &quot;last hurrah&quot; type raid just to go out with a bang, but with the exodus to eq2 and wow, I don't really see much hope for it.<br />

Apparently eq2 hit the European guilds much harder than the US ones. And I read that eq2 is the first ever online game to be #1 in sales in europe.<br />

I am in the US, but due to my work hours I simply cannot play or raid much with a US guild, so this pretty much ends EQ1 for me.</div></div><hr />

Well,I'm sorry you guys got hit so hard.Certainly a lot of guilds are suffering atm.Hopefully ,in a few months stuff gets a little better and stabilizes.Btw we have had lots of happy euro members.FD may not work,but, theres prolly happy raiding left somewhere in EQ for you.</div></div><hr />

One our Euro guilds high end got killed, disbanded. Other seems to be doing ok. Our Asian guild is struggling. Our highest end guild appears to be fine but is cannibalizing the hell out of high-end players on the server and cross-server. Overall Time+ is getting crushed, PoP EP level is a wasteland and there are several working on to getting into EP/VT. Family guilds abound as we are preferred server (MS).<br />

Don't get me wrong; EQ1 needs a lot of time invested to reach your goal; but with mudflation you all know the route. EQ2 is a little more wide open to chance and the final outcome isn't as foundationally solid as EQ1 is. Maybe in 5 years EQ2 will be like EQ1. For now it's a nice world and ( All IMHO of course ) designed by fixing all that was wrong with EQ, especially the high level end result.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played probably the worst &quot;MMORPG&quot; ever for about a year and a half (Runescape, /shudder if you know what i'm talking about), and when a friend turned me onto EQ, I ditched it pretty much for good.<br />
<br />
Although I don't really have much to show for it, I've invested a lot of time into my warrior, despite having only played EQ since June.  Even so, and keep in mind that I haven't played WoW yet, if it's a flat out better game, I'll probably drop EQ like a hot potato.<br />
<br />
Several reasons I feel this way.  First off, I live in Korea.  During my evenings (5pm-10pm my time, 3am-8am EST), my server is deserted.  It's damn near fucking impossible to get a group.  This effectively limits my progression time to the weekends.  My time zone also prevents me from joining any mandatory raiding guild, because I am unable to raid during the week (when I'm at work during EST evenings).<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love EQ, but I can't effectively progress with a high level warrior in my current situation.  The exodus that WoW will most likely cause only adds to my situation.<br />
<br />
In any case, as soon as I can get my dirty little mits on WoW, I fully intend to test it out.  If it's as good as everyone says, I'll most likely be saying &quot;Bye bye, Everquest&quot; and &quot;Hello, WoW&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have fun.  I'm just saying that if I had to do it over again, I prolly wouldn't have played EQ period.  I mean, I enjoy the shit out of it.  But I sure enjoy smoking too, but I still wish I had never started ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For my guild pre-release of eq2, wow and halo2 I made a poll in our members forums, asking mainly 5 questions. Which games people plan on quitting for, Who plans on staying til the end.<br />
<br />
 <br />
There were about 40 people who picked staying til the end. About 10 who said they will be playing eq1 and the other games, about 3 quitting for eq2, 2 quitting for WoW. We averaged about 47 people per raid each night before the games...Our numbers have actually risen since these games have come out to above 60. We haven't recruited anyone recently, old people have been coming out of the woodwork and back to eq. It seems as if eq is gaining as many people as its losing.<br />
<br />
    Last weekend I was doing &quot; Froggerx's Friendly Odd Casino &quot; at shadowhaven steps where everyone who rolls is a winner (let people /ran 100, whatever they roll they win, only one roll per person) came well anyways. Ended up chatting with one guy and he was mentioning how the plat should help him alot and his co-workers, him and about 8 others started eq this week and were still learning and said they were having fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
  When you ask yourself why you play this game, the answer is likely to be one of these:<br />
<br />
<br />
-Made some friendships that I wouldn't have made anywhere else, when color, race, and or size dont matter, just a persons personality<br />
<br />
-I've been playing so long that giving up all that i've worked for is like winning the lottery and giving it all to charity.<br />
<br />
-Its fun. Why lie.<br />
<br />
-It fills a void in my life that no woman, child, job or pet could do.<br />
<br />
-The game gives me an escape of the hectic and constant stresses of real life, it allows me to expand my mind and imagination.<br />
<br />
-I play eq so I can get off by looking at the pixel shading of female characters in the game! <br />
<br />
I could keep going and elborating on reasons people play eq, but I think you all get the point.  We all play this game for a reason, we will all continue playing eq for that reason. EQ is not dying, infact - its thriving, which is why they made eq2...To *try* to build another cash cow like eq1 was and is. <br />
<br />
<br />
The customer service hasn't seem to go down any, if anything its gone up. Gm's are answering gm's faster, programmers are finding and fixing problems more efficiently. The test server is continuing to have patches/updates that will be going live soon to improve the gameplay.      <br />
<br />
I'm probably the only guildleader who posts on these boards. I'm the guildleader of Collective Assault (http://www.cassault.com) on Saryrn Server, from what i've seen so far (on Saryrn atleast) only one of the top guilds have folded and that was just to follow the other sheep to eq2 and remake the guild to try to succeed there.  To keep your guilds in check, make sure there is a drive, and people striving to be great you have to work hard. With that being said, speak with your guilds leadership...Ask them to take a day off from raiding or whatever you do daily and make a scene on the server doing something fun. We have monthly guild events to ease the pressure we give people on exping and flagging etc.<br />
<br />
Some examples:<br />
<br />
Drunken Gnome Run; (destinations can be changed) We'd start this in steamfont mountains at the zone in to akanon, beacuse there is two torches that you can make a line of bags or corpses that people can start behind. Make sure everyone is level1 and tagged for your guild. Give everyone 3 stacks of beer from a mage, tell them not to start drinking until you say go. What they have to do is get to the end of the butcherblock docks without death. Everyone turns in their books to the PoD's so they cant be ported and they all have red names, when you say GO (shoot off fireworks then turn into a skeleton with an AoN or something) they chug their boo's and start running off toward lfay line...getting attacked by skeletons, rats, kobolds, and other annoying things that force a person to slow down, die or run even faster.  First 3 to the dock win prizes (I gave away a manastone, amulet of necropotence and holgresh elder beads when we did this event, since guildbank money wasn't really being used on much besides emeralds and occasional coffins.) and thats your gnome run~<br />
<br />
<br />
Ogre Obstacle Course;The night before the event you make a halfling, level him to 10 and leave corpses with phantom plate armor on. Use Blue and Red armor dyes, What you'll do is equip the visible armor plate pieces from the phantom plateyour summoned by a mage. then die, do this over and over a few times, til you have 15-20 bodies all one color (blue or red), then Do the same thing with another 15-20 bodies, and make them the other color (blue or red). Then drag the bodies around in Ferrott and call the corpses &quot; cones &quot;. <br />
(day of the event)<br />
have people running the event stand at the end of cones with items, after showing which way to run and what laps to do. Have people /ran 100, people under 50 on one team, people over 50 on another team then even them out, have them form groups - give copper to one person (like 50,000 (this is just enough where you can move slowly but not get stuck or stopped)  People run through the cones and reach the person on the other end, get their item from the person there then they turn around and run back to their team, hand the item to someone that hasn't gone yet. That person walks/runs to the end and turns in the item they were given for a different item, whichever team can get through the most/all of the items first wins. (we used sapphires, pearls, emeralds, black sapphires, diamonds, malachite, opals, peridots as items and had an order listed in our officer forum to go off of when handing them out in order).<br />
<br />
<br />
Alot of these events aren't hard to run, I bet they'd be a load of fun if ran serverwide by a GM with added effects/tricks and stuff, but they are too busy answering people who have deleted their chars or sold their accounts to play the oh so promising eq2 and WoW, to only find out a few days later that they are already at endgame, and everyone else is there with them and get bored which leads them back to eq1.    :) <br />

<br />
Unfortunately I think EQ1 will die off.  I stopped playing a while ago because I seem to have hit the ceiling of my progression.  The time I had to play the game or any game was just enough to get me TO 65, but not beyond that.  I play enough that regular games like FF, GTA, Halo, etc can keep me occupied for some time, but I usually beat it too fast.  EQ was the solution . . . for a while.  Once you start getting Elemantally flagged and all, it just takes way too much time to get anything done.<br />
<br />
Many people will jump ship and go to WoW.  I have and was playing during beta, had a hell of a time.  Some will go to EQ2, but I haven't heard too many good things about its content.  Those folks might come back to EQ1, but who knows.<br />
<br />
For those folks who feel like they've hit the ceiling, I would suggest you try WoW out.  The good thing is that you CAN get things done, even if you are the only one in the area.  There will be lots of content later on, but that 1-2 hours you do spend on the game makes you feel like you have progressed.<br />
<br />
In a month or now I'm not sure how much time I will have.  But if I only did have 2-3 hours to play that night, which game will allow me to have fun?  My money is with WoW, I can roam the horde lands and PvP some folks during that time.  I DONT want to spend that time LFG in order to get anything done.  WoW for the win.</div></div><hr />

Final Door is doing well on Stromm as well.We actually picked up some more folks recently and applications have increased.This is due in part to the pressure on guilds in EQ atm do to the other games tho.When the playerbase shrinks it will make things tougher on some folks. :( <br />
<br />
Like Frogger's guild we're not hardcore or in a hurry.Fun with our friends seeing new stuff without a lot of pressure is our game and that has stood us in good stead imo.We have members in WOW and EQ2.Most still play with us and raid tho.I was in EQ2 beta and didn't think it was a better game.Some friends like EQ2 and WOW for lighter entertainment and a few will actually leave for them.From what I saw the guilds that were highly stressed lost the most members to the new games.New races to win and the hope of greener grass proved too enticing.Really, I think a certain amount of those people were just looking for a reason to leave.<br />
<br />
A lot of our older members think that this will be the best time ever to play EQ.A lot of the powergamers and griefers have left to get a headstart elsewhere,leaving folks who really want to play more breathing room.How this bears out time will tell.I'm hopeful for FD though,stuff is looking good. :)<br />

I say they make Starcraft first person AND overhead view, hook up with the creators of eq2, morrowind,&lt;insert other games that blow the hell out of the competition for a certain area, graphics/sound/content/cinematics etc..&gt; and halo, and form the ultimate roleplaying, first person shooting, strategy game. =p</div></div><hr />

EQ is long standing, and there will always be people that are loyal to it, yes some people will go and stay at their new games, but a lot of people will come back. It's happened before and it'll happen again.</div></div><hr />

My guild is still doing well, we've only lost one so far to EQ 2, but most of our members are still here. A few have said EQ 2 is not very good. The only problem with EQ 1 is that it's not very newbie-friendly. All the low lvls running around are twinks. <br />

The &quot;other&quot; top end guilds on Stromm sure the heck aren't doing well! Congrats on being top dog now, and not super hardcore raid! The guilds really got shaken hard on Stromm with the balanced family/raid style winning out vs all the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I don't think you'll lose the casuals as easy as you think, I think most of the defections will come from burned out top enders. Most of the casuals I play with and talk to have too much to do in game that they never did, and with less competition pushing downward on progression paths, it will be easier for them to do this stuff. Everyone here who hasn't been in top end raiding at one point knows just how the lack of spawns for a gaggle of high end guilds led to a lot of lower progression being yanked for various reasons (boredom, alt farming, plat farming, etc.) With those folks leaving in droves for EQ2 and WoW, the pressure is off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing WoW for the last 5 days and I have to say, it really is a superior game to EQ in many ways.  Yes, the shear volume of content isn't there yet, but it wasn't there in EQ when it was first released either.  And many of the things EQ has tried to do over the years and either fumbled on or implemented shabbily, have been done quite well in WoW.  Frankly I would say that WoW is a far better choice for the casual player than EQ.  The raid player, I don't know about. <br />
<br />
But seriously, WoW has a well implemented trade skills system.  A well implemented level restriction on all but the weakest loot.  Yet still the items are very good when you're allowed to wear them so it's not a case of the item being subpar when you can finally equip it.  Loot comes fast and replacements are in abundance.  The quest system has been well implemented as well.  I, someone who basically hated EQ's quest sytem and wasn't thrilled by CoH's mission system, think very highly of WoW's quest system.  The quests range from a walk in the part to difficult in the extreme and the rewards are in relation to the difficulty.  And to top it off, quite often it's a bonus for hunting what you would have been hunting anyway which makes xp come much faster via questing then not.<br />
<br />
Frankly it's almost as though someone sat down and went over item by item every possible thing that EQ had done wrong or could have done better, and fixed it.</div></div><hr />

Although recent events havent effected my guild and casual friends at all, its blatantly obvious the higher end packed up.<br />
Never did I have to play anon before or get hassled for RSS and MPG trials.<br />
<br />
/who all 70 war ususaly shows from 8 to 15 peeps.<br />
And Karana used to be a hevy server.<br />

On the other hand some of the other casual guilds on our server are getting swallowed up.<br />

<br />
Overall the server seems a lot quieter, I went looking for xp outside peak times (1pm Euro/7am EST) and there was 1 group in MPG, and no-one at all in WoS...a few hours later it is still relatively quiet 12-20 in WoS, when a few weeks ago there would be 40+ there.</div></div><hr />

Congrats on being top dog now, and not super hardcore raid! The guilds really got shaken hard on Stromm with the balanced family/raid style winning out vs all the others.<br />
<br />
Aye,well some folks were ready to move on imo.EQ in the raiding scene can be pretty stressful socially.It can pay out really well and give lots of entertainment.It can also wear people out.EQ asks a lot of a player,but, as these kind of games go the investment can be very worthwhile.Most of the guild changes didn't come as a big surprise, tho I'm sorry a lot of folks got lost in the shuffle.We're not competitive or top dog anything hehe.Just out to kill stuff with friends and have fun.<br />
<br />
Certainly, these games are having a big impact on the EQ player base.I still think EQ has more to offer long term than WOW or EQ2.WOW from what I've seen may suit very casual players more.Atm a lot of it is that these are new and all sparkly hehe.I think it's likely that many players will come back to EQ.It's already started to happen in our guild.For me neither of these games represent the next big &quot;upgrade&quot;.Something  not too far down the road may raise the bar and assert itself  much more solidy with the player base these 3 share.Many folks are still playing EQ and I believe it  probable that EQ will live on despite WOW &amp; EQ2 and do just fine.Hope so anyhoos.<br />
<br />
The loss of so many people on our server kinda hits me 2 ways.I don't like to see guilds fall.It can happen to all of us Imo and it sucks.Lots of nice people are left hanging in the breeze who loved raiding.There's a sense of anxiety about this kinda shakeup that worries folks too.However,there is more room to breath now.With luck,SOE will leave it that way for some time to come on Stromm.<br />
Over crowding has it's own sucky side.Hopefully, stuff will level out and people of all styles can go back to enjoying their EQ time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things look fine for those still raiding on Stromm atm.Final Door is doing well.Only time will tell,but, atm I still think the next big thing is as yet unreleased.For now the new games look like alternatives offering a differant style of play ,or, for some folks just some distraction from the EQ grind.

I'm very tempted myself.  I know if I break down and buy WoW I'll probably never be back to EQ.  Now the little stuff that used to be only annoying, those things are now becoming more of a contributing factor of me buying WoW.  Stuff like lockout timers on failed mpg trials, etc.  The crap that we have just accepted because there wasnt an alternative game, well now there is an alternative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The release of WoW and EQ2 didnt harshly effect my guild as in our numbers vanished overnight.<br />
<br />
There is more of a long-term problem being the big fish in the pond.<br />
<br />
The release of WoW and EQ2 took its toll on the lower guilds that we depend on to replenish our numbers due to normal attrition. Players moving up to the more accomplished guilds were in the nature of this game.  With the lesser guilds being less successful the quality of available applicants has been effected. <br />
<br />
Thats why I posted here that we are looking. I have no desire to wait for other guilds to collapse. It would be preferable to find geared, appropriate AA, and players ready to go.  <br />
<br />
A centralized recruiting effort across servers could and should be the next step in EQ1's evolution. Having a broader option for players who are looking to continue their current content can be helpful. Not just from the endgame but any level. Its a win win situation.<br />
<br />
I would support the administrators of this board creating a forum to support this.  <br />
<br />
If something to this fact was mentioned or buried somewhere before then I agree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An old guildie of mine is doing just that. He is an experienced gamer and is having fun in WoW and making 'progression' (hate that word) but still logs into eq1 about 1/2 the time.<br />
<br />
He doesn't think EQ1 is an entirely superseded game... tho what he does say is that he can't see NEW players picking up EQ1 now over EQ2/WoW because the learning curve is too steep and the player base so concentrated at the highest level. <br />
<br />
This seem about right to me. I played WoW beta and intend to play it on release but it hasn't turned me into a rabid WoW evangelist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have lots of friends in my small guild who are all playing WoW, and pretty frequently, but claim that they haven't given up EQ1.   I think they are just having a hard time putting away the old sweater that fits so well. <br />
<br />
I don't view myself as an absolute WoW fanatic, but I do believe it to be a far superior product for a variety of reasons.  Maybe some people really are having the same amount and type of fun in EQ1 as I and my friends are in WoW, but I doubt it.  I played EQ1 for five years but the last few years have felt a lot like obligation and true addiction then anything else.  I didn't want to put away the game because I had so much invested in my character and the social circle within the game.  On many - too numerous to even count or imagine - I logged in not because I wanted to but because I felt I owed it to the guild or my friends to log in.  Maybe I'm all alone in this strange kind of obligatory play style I had, but listening to others talk and post I don't think so.   With a true alternative now on the market, people are diving in and having FUN again...but many folks still have a hard time shaking the obligation and putting on the shelf a character in whom they spent hundreds of hundreds of hours investing.  Eventually, I think these fence-sitters will fall on the side of WoW, but maybe that is the fanaticism talking.  :p</div></div><hr />

I just recently have gotten back into the game. <br />
<br />
I Read article after article, post after post about the new games. WoW to me looks rather childish...kinda along the same lines at the Final Fantasy series, Guild Wars doesnt sound like it is customizable enough for my liking... a more templated game then EQ, and EQ2 sounds like the grind to end all grinds...two day quests for food and water and such, also EQ2 sounds like SoE kinda felt obligated to put out another game.<br />
<br />
Are sequels ever as good as the original? Not IMO have they ever been. My 2cp is that i HOPE they integrate EQ1 into EQ2 somehow so us die hard EQ1ers dont have to quit, start a whole new char, and have to abandon our time and money if EQ1 ever wanes and falls away.<br />
<br />
Im not the end all know all of computer gaming development but the problem for developers im sure is attracting new players right? EQ1 still gets a flow of new players, dont fix it if it aint broken, keep making expansions for old timers and lower the price to play. <br />
<br />
I dont know how Guildwars plans to make money with no fee and constant server upkeep like EQ1/2 or maybe its just bugfree...haha yeah right! EQ1 for life!!! And for gods sake someone tell me how to put my (name) for a magelo link instead of this long ass address, God im a noob!<br />

WoW is a great game but it has serious flaws.<br />
<br />
Being able to solo upto lvl 60 is great, but when it's the best way to goto 60 then there is problems.<br />
<br />
The resist system is REALLY bad. Anything more than 3 levels above you and casters can forget landing spells. Melee is not affected as much but it's still there, people hitting from back hits more often so that might be why they can still function somewhat abit longer.<br />
<br />
This is no problem for solo play or duoing but it becomes a big issue for groups. The groups need to fight higher level mobs to be efficient and also to at least have some challange but they can't because of the almost binary resist system.<br />
<br />
I think it's sad when the best way for progression is solo or at most duoing, at least for a supposedly MMO.<br />

<br />
Interesting...I've been playing WoW the last few weeks and I guess it depends on how you play.  If you want to power level then I suppose soloing is best, although it's getting increasingly difficult at my level (26 now), and you definitely loose out on the good loot that can be had in the instanced dungeons.<br />
<br />
For me, I'm usually grouped because it's more fun that way.  (especially when 6 mobs pop on you at once and everyone has to scramble around like mad to get the situation under control :eek: )<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it comes down to whether or not you are racing for the end game.  In EQ I always felt pressured to race to the highest level, but I personally don't feel the same way in WoW.  I spend my time doing quests and tradeskilling, and every now and then I notice I've gained a new level...the thought of &quot;level grinding&quot; and &quot;optimal xp efficency&quot; has never even entered my mind while playing wow - which is pretty odd because I'm a power gamer by nature.   ;) <br />
<br />
As to the resist thing...again, I think it comes down to what you're looking for in the game.  If you're trying to grind out levels as fast as possible, then I guess it's an issue.  For me, I look at it as more of a challenge.  <br />
<br />
By the way, I've found mobs that the casters could hit with spells, but I couldn't hit with my gun (playing a hunter)...so I think it varies based on mob type.<br />
<br />
Anyway...play what you like and have fun with it!</div></div><hr />

eq is still heads and shoulders more fun than wow is for me, wow is not perfect by any means...tho its not a bad game by any means.<br />

i am fairly sure if wow was put out by a different company, it wouldnt be near as succesfull...wehre as eq has pretty much always been successfull DESPITE the company running it, wether it be verant, or soe. that right there says alot to me as to which is the more solid game<br />
<br />
i much prefered verant personally, they werent popular but i really believe they always did what was best for the game in the long haul, even if it took alot of convincing to get them there ;p(think knights in kunark) which is why vangaurd is probably the best game at being my own personal &quot;eq killer&quot;, cause wow definatly isnt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  EQ2 for me is everything I had wanted as a Warrior in EQ1. Taunt works, I have  helpful skills in a group (alittle more useful then in EQ1) and most of all, I can SOLO! Now, of  course at my level, xp will come very  slowly compaired to a group. But when I only have 20-30 minutes, and don't feel like LFG, I can atleast kill mobs for quests or drops. Or I can just do some exploring, and fend off aggroing mobs.<br />
 My AC is compairable to other tanks. Palys,Sks,Guards and us Zerkers all wear the same armor. (of course, knights bitch about this too) We all have very comairable damage mig compaired to non-tank classes, so we are all capable of tanking. We get duel wield, but I have noticed no more damage compaired to 2handers other than looking 'flashy'.<br />
 Berserkers and Guardians are aggro gods. I have a single mob taunt, a single mob taunting blow, a group knockdown taunt and regular group taunt, and rescue that instantly puts me at the top of the hate list. I even have 2 attacks that are AoE's, that work well........well...it gets adds very well at least.<br />
 I have 2 stuns, a power drain, 2 interrupts, a /shield for group members, a attack I can do while stunned and one that lowers the enemies attack for a few seconds. The only down side to these attacks (all generate hate) is that I'll burn power very rapidly. But, it is enough if you are playing smart. Turn on attack, and only push the buttons when ya need them to taunt while in party. <br />
<br />
 Knights don't seem to like us, and get mad when a group choses a warrior over them in a group. For example, a 27 Paly got pissed while I was chosen as a tank....and I'm a level 30 Berserker. I had a higher AC by a few hundred points, hps by almost 500 points and a higher attack value. I dunno, seemed silly to me.<br />
Knights can tank just fine. Have nice buffs and are very very good emergency healers. They work great for tanking adds and off tanking, and VERY good tanks if I take a dirt nap. Knights in my party have been the deciding factor in many battles, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.<br />
 Sadly, I'm confused why alot of Knights seem to think they should be better tanks than Guards or Zerkers, and get pissed when we get aggro, and keep it (without trying to). <br />
<br />
 Anyway, I do miss the raids from EQ1. I can't see large-scale raids happen in EQ2 like in EQ1. However, the game is new, and has alot of potential to do so. I also like the tradeskilling system. Anyone can do out for free, and gather almost all the materials needed for crafting. You can see what is needed for the recipe, and affect the quality of the final product by using skills. Yes, it does take longer than put this, this and this in a box and hit combine.<br />
<br />
 Inventory overflow is a wonderful thing. You never drop anything on the ground. Banks need more room, but you're better off than you were with room than when EQ1 first came out.....at least ya have shared banking slots off the bat. I have found Crafting to be a great way of making friends. If I need patterns to make an item, I trade something I can make to someone that can make the things I need.<br />
<br />
 I don't like the flashy graphics during fights and turn the majority of particle effects off. It's too damn bright, and as a dorf, blinds me every time someone casts an ice spell. However, world graphics are stunning.<br />
<br />
Well, all I have atm. I don't think EQ1 will die out, but I don't think as many people are coming back like people think. Everyone I have met from EQ1 that has played EQ2, has either cancelled their account, or been inactive. Sadly, our guild in EQ1 is hurting badly. I intended to continue to play EQ1, but as much as letting go of a 5+ year account hurt, rediscovering what I fell in love with when I first started playing EQ, was too hard to pass up.<br />
<br />
 I hope all of you in EQ1 have guilds that will bounce back to raiding status, and that they'll fix alot of needed bugs, quests and balance issues. But I'd be lying if I didn't say I'd love to see you all in EQ2. All of you tanks and Knights would be pleased with the balance and fun play style.<br />

 Have fun, be safe, and get those epics and l33t gear!</div></div><hr />
