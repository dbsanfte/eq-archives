SOME SNIPPETS FROM THIS DUMB #*@$<br />
<br />
&quot;*** is up with Warriors not trying to get their taunt fixed? I have lost a lot of respect for the Warrior community over this&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors are played by the wimps of EQ I guess&quot;<br />
<br />
AHHH what a moron =(  it's sad</div></div><hr />

Knights got their &quot;dual wield&quot;, they made it so two handed slash does so much damage it exceeds dual wielding. Knights got what they wanted! To bad most people are to blind to see that. BTW, a SK soloed VS, thats okay too right? They can solo, and get groups easier than warriors, so they can pick which ever is better for exp/loot and go with it? <br />
FIX WARRIOR TAUNT SHOULD BE OUR BATTLECRY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt needs tweaking, Warriors *have* been saying this. Don't believe me? Check out the class balance forum of the Paladins of Norrath EZBoard. I think it's up to Part4 now. You obviously don't read The Steel Warrior, either. So you're making these comments without any real understanding or information backing it up. What leads to bliss? Exactly.<br />
<br />
The only real problem with Warriors is that they don't have snap aggro like a Paladin or SK and have to rely on the taunt button to refresh. All my Paladin does is cast Cease, Stun or Holy Might. I have three choices, and with spellhaste from a Cleric I don't need to load up the taunt key. Warriors still: a) take damage better, b) dish it out more when they're not defensive and c) shine on raids and where you need something that would turn a knight into puree, thankew /disc Defensive.<br />

I no longer care, looking at WoW, not crappy old EQ. FoH board &quot;warriors frothing over taunt...&quot; etc,etc,etc, who cares, Sony is just counting your money. <br />
<br />
Whirlwind, Shield Bash, Defensive Stance, sick of EQ and Sony's BS.</div></div><hr />
