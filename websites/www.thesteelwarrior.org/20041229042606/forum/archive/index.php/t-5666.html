When I click it, I get an icon on me, that says wardlord's tenacdity, and nothing happens....</div></div><hr />

Total frigging waste of aa.... on a god damn 1hrs reuse time...wow...</div></div><hr />

First level is 500hps, second is 1000hps, third is 1500hps.  Each dots you for one minute so you take 120% of the amount healed in dot damage.</div></div><hr />

We already have a &quot;get out of jail&quot; card, anyway, with furious/fortitude. And it does not take a buff slot.</div></div><hr />

Heh, Innate Cha is an important aa for the raiding warrior.  Helps with firing DI.</div></div><hr />

This AA is like another /disc furious, it's a get-out-of-jail-free card.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said I won't buy it until a long while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you already have sturdiness, weapon affinity and the offhand damage one maxed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I look at it like, when have I ever needed that?<br />
<br />
1) Weapon Affinity? When have I ever needed more procs? Oh yeah, just like ALL THE FRIGGIN TIME. Buy that.<br />
<br />
2) Hit points? When have I ever found myself under 100/200/300/400/500 life and said to myself &quot;wow, if I didn't have those hitpoints I'd be dead right now&quot;. That happens more than I'd like, so better buy those too.<br />
<br />
3) Extended shielding? When do I find myself thinking &quot;Damn, I wish shielding had a bigger range!&quot; That's pretty much what I'm saying every time I used the damn skill... So I'll be buying that.<br />
<br />
4) Tenacity? When do I find myself going &quot;man, if only one more SR had landed, we'd have won that fight&quot;... Basically it's pretty damn rare, so this is low priority for me.<br />
<br />
5) Offhand damage? Basically I'm not going to spend a dime here, I'm hoping to get a BoW soon.<br />
<br />
The one everyone seems to be buying that I'm holding off on is Run4/5... I raid a ton and until I have the AA knocked out that will directly help with that, people can put up with my pokey dwarf butt.</div></div><hr />

it doesn't help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If 120% of the heal is deducted from you by result of a dot, don't see point in doing this AA.  Taking a buff slot sucks too.<br />
<br />
That is an extra 100hp damage you take per lvl of the AA .. so 300hps if at lvl 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you need to consider that :<br />
<br />
1 - it take a buff slot. we have only 15 and most of the time we must click stuff to allow Heals to come.<br />
<br />
2 - it MUST takes a hotkey to be used, or the &quot;emergency&quot; part of this ability will not aply. does this ability worth an button against taunt, kick/bash, incite, assist, AE taunt, shield, furious, defensive, inc message.. I already need all my hotkeys. <br />
<br />
3 - does the effect worth the dot ? I'll say no. We are warriors. we TANK and we take heavy damage continuously. I am not interested in a simple emergency ridiculously low heal as I already have : DI, Furious/fortitude, defensive, a healer behind me, a pally to loh me, even some back healer or another CC trick, to save me. <br />
<br />
I do think we dont need another &quot;get out jail&quot; card. We already have some. This ability as it is will not interest any of  the nine warriors in my guild, neither any of the ones I talked with to find an utility for this, considering the cost and the counterpart. this is Warcry 2. You'll see, berserk will have the &quot;berserk tenacity&quot; with an awesome effect soon :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I look at it like, when have I ever needed that?&quot;<br />
<br />
I do the same thing sometimes. And that's what's led me to my odd AA path thus far.<br />
<br />
Run 4 and Run 5 ... well, as a monk I pull. So yah, that's top priority. What sucks is GoD makes it useless (I could have run 0 in there, they're just too fast). But in all other content, it's gamebreaking.<br />
<br />
After that, offhand damage bonus. I dual wield. And most of my guildmates like the 2handers. It's time to stake my claim as the dual wield monk, get some of the REBB people to back off. They snaked battlefists. Now they're NOT gonna snake elemental 1handers from me. Enjoy your 7's sticks! Get the hell off my blue fists!<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Anyways, my warrior friend went with the hit points first. He's a hp fanatic. I don't think he plans to get run 4 or run 5 yet for quite some time. So you won't be the only pokey kicking around.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

I don't plan on getting it for a very long time (like after Packrat 5 or something).  I can understand if you bought the ability and are upset, but most of you obviously didn't buy it, so why does it concern you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is NOT another get out of jail free card, a 1500hp heal does jack. Fortitude WILL keep you alive from melee, this saves you from 1 hit. You might be lucky and the heal will land, but more often than not youre dead anyway, and you get another hour till its up.<br />
<br />
If they made reuse like... same as defensive, it would be cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boub</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see a use, lets say you have multiple mobs and get low on hitpoints the moment you reach a critical low all other mobs start to summon start to beat on you, with a good timing you can avoid it hence one more card up the sleeve to play when perfection is required.<br />
<br />
Of course the reuse time and immense AA cost to get the most useful level is in my opinion out of balance and needs revision.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why people always imagine mobs never missing and hitting them for max every hit.  I have 11800 HP and let me assure you the difference between me and someone sitting at say 10000 HP is not just one or two hits.  If 1500 HP matters to little to you then why not have next patch all class's max HP reduced by 1500 HP?  I mean it's just one hit, no big deal right?  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you can't see the value of 1500 HPs.  A lot of time that's less than the margin you get killed by.  With the reuse time at 1 hour I certainly won't be making this a priority, but to act like these HP do not matter is silly.</div></div><hr />

Definitely not a priority; but still, a 1500HP heal that you control, can't be bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like a 500hp leap, and the reduce somewhat.<br />
<br />
The take a buff slot was never mentioned anywhere, and thats what makes it very crappy, not to mention 1hr reuse time, and getting a dot on ya....<br />
<br />
Anyway, shouldn't have let the rush of happiness from sturdiness affect me :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree..1500 can be several hits even from mobs like RZ or Quarm.  I do dislike that it is not a /disc and burns a buff icon, or at least they could make the icon go into the bard buff box or something.  <br />
<br />
Note: It's also been changed on test to have less of a DOT, about 10% less.  WT3 is now 1500HP with 200tick DOT (instead of 225/tick).  It is a good 'oh shit' too regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i got around to buying the first level of this today after grinding out Sturdiness.  Warlord's Tenacity is broken, or is now simply a small LOH/DoT for us now instead of a short duration HP boost/DoT?  It did not add any HP at all when I was totally unbuffed, but it cause me to take DOT damage.  <br />
<br />
I'm confused as to the purpose of this AA now after my beta experience, where it actually added 500/1000/1500 HP boost...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It allows the cleric to use their mana more efficiently.<br />
<br />
When I have this or Fortitude/Furious available, I let the cleric know and the cleric compensates by waiting longer to CH.  Most of the time, the CH just lands for more and I don't have to do anything and we just run more efficiently, but when I get unlucky and get hit harder than expected, Warlord's Tenacity buys me just a little time to survive till the CH, which would otherwise be late, lands.<br />
<br />
The DoT doesn't bother me at all, just keeps me from using it solo.  Being at 7500hp with a DoT on me is better than me waiting for a rez.<br />
<br />
I want all the &quot;Get our of jail free cards&quot; I can get so that my group and I can push the envelope and survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Edit: NM apparently it doesn't function like it did when I tested it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know that question &quot;when would you have used it&quot; is a good one.  <br />
<br />
Basically I'd use this any time I'm MT and furious is down (or I am out of End) and *something* happens so that the mob DD procs like 4x in a row, a patch isn't going to hit me in time, a CH guy gets whacked...you know that agonizing quarter second where you see you are going to die with a sliver of red life unless a patch hits you THEN.  On that basis I'd use this a least a couple times a week.  <br />
<br />
Remember folks not all of us tank plane of time bosses.  1500 hps can actually be real helpful in those situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many times have you watched as your life hung at &lt;15% waiting for a heal and dying, only to be told the heal landed right as you died?<br />
<br />
For me, the number of times that's happened is too numerous to count, and with god the way it is, there have been plenty of times where I've lingered that low and I've used furious to buy time.<br />
<br />
The dot isn't really that big of an issue, because the concept is that you'd be able to buy time for a heal to land, and realistically, the dot is fairly minor.<br />
<br />
And I'm not saying to go and get it first, but atleast recognize that it is useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">renasu</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did finally get to use this as an anti-mezz in pvp and it did work as expected.  Sorry, I didn't actually log or parse anything, but here's how it went.<br />
<br />
Knowing there was a couple enemy chanters, I had it ready to go.  But I did get raptured fast and could not activate it until it wore off.  <br />
<br />
I then fired it off, got raptured again soon, but it broke one second later.   Another mezz of some sort hit me soon again, but also broke before two seconds.   <br />
<br />
The chanters got smart and started to dispell me, but the dot as expected stayed.  This did give me enough time to pumice off their runes and start smacking them around.   But lures and dots were eating me up so I had to run away.  Darns Pandas!<br />
<br />
Not a great use for this AA, but sometimes the unintended uses are the most fun. :D</div></div><hr />
