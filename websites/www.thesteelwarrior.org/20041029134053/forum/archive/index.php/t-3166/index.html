<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't found any post verifying a win with four people...sure you can go into the dungeon with four, but is it the same difficulty as with six??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have won 3 times with 4 people now, as for difficulty, I am not sure, but it seemed as if the mobs had slightly less hp.  Avg and Max hit was about the same, number of mobs was the same etc, but they did seem to have less hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That’s interesting.  Possibly they scaled down the hp to compensate for a less than full group?  Has anyone noticed whether the mobs seem to have less hp’s with a caster-heavy group?  It’d be curious to see if the adventure is designed by also taking into account the average hp of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The one time I did it with 4 we lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frawdo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One time we started the group as 6, but before we could zone into the dungeon we lost two members to LD. So when we zoned in, we only had 4 and stuck with 4 until we lost.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this counts, because we officially accepted the adventure with 6 in our group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried one with 4 last night, probably didn't have the optimum set up for it, me (warrior), shammy, chanter, and druid.  Only reason we did it was we were all sick of the stupidity of LDoN pickup groups, decided to go with just the guildies that were on that were interested.  We did a slaughter mission, needless to say we were unsuccessful mostly because of a lack of dps, however we finished in regular time with only 10 mobs left to kill.  The druid went LD and we decided not to attempt to finish it in the extra time, though I'm sure we probably could have finished.  <br />
<br />
I didn't personally notice any difference in the mobs though, seemed the same to me.  I imagine the slaughter missions could be done though with the correct mix, our group certainly wasn't dishing out too much damage and we were reasonably close to completing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did a slaughter on normal few days ago, while waiting for raid time.<br />
<br />
4 people in group, finished with 26 minutes left<br />
<br />
The group contained the following<br />
<br />
65 Warrior (me)<br />
65 Paladin<br />
65 Cleric<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
<br />
we severely lacked in DPS, but we still finished with a lot of time left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Me, monk, cleric, and one other (can't remember atm =\) did a slaughter with 4, finished with a good amount of time left.  All 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what I have seen / read dungeon's are strictly based on level, not on class composition of the group or number of members in the group.  I have done quite a few 5 person missions and they were all exactly the same as the 6 person missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With a mezzer, 4 in a group is perfectly feasible on regular setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shirmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did it on normal with 4 my 58mnk 62 necro 65shm 65clr was our first time doing an adventure so we went slow at the start but watching the time we started to rush finished with 7 min on slaughter. <br />
With monk i have done a 6 grp also and i didnt really see any difference in mob difficulty we went throught them alot faster more dps. BTW i started both adventures being the lowest lvl in grp might have made a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sshaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have odd play times and do a lot of missions with 4. Mobs do seem to have less hp, and I don't do anything but slaughter, so I can't comment on other types of adventures.  But with 4 it can be done.<br />
<br />
(War/Cle/Shm/Mag)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Janya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My very first dungeon was with a party of 4.  Myself(65 War), 65 Sham, 65SK, 65 Pally.  We did fine on the slaughter dungeon and won with 11 minutes to spare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">a friend 4 boxes adventures using a  Enc, Cler, Shm and himself a warrior. He said it was hard boxing the adventure but I would assume if he can do it as 1 person, 4 people should be able to do it np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raiddinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I personally did it with 4, one being 65 Bard (me) another was 65 RNG (MT, guild is at RZ fighting lvl, she uses stuff with +riposte and dodge instead of ATTK items), 2nd RNG lvl 65 with elemental bow, 65 druid with gear that is sub NTOV.<br />
<br />
Did that rescue NP at all, rangers just tracked to the rescuer and we killed the whole way NP.<br />
<br />
I got a friend that is the MT for one of the top 2 tied for first time guilds on RZ server, he says he 3 boxes trials all the time with his war/clr/enc and some random extra he adds in the group just so he can zone in, but who never actually goes in the dungeon.<br />
<br />
End result: 4 person or less groups are very feasible on easy difficulty.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Matsuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">did it with 3 when paladin went linkdead.  collect quest had 29 wizard, 31 shaman and me as 33 warrior.  had a 30 paladin but she was a badly equipped and horrible player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Loredena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just won a rescue one in Tak with 4 people.  Made even more fun by the fact that my husband and I were both 2 boxing :)  I honestly didn't figure we'd be able to do it with just us, but we finished with plenty of time to spare, and then went and killed the named that was up before our 30 minutes cleanup ended.<br />
<br />
Oh, and at Fan Faire they said the group ones were balanced around six, and the raids are balanced around 36.  The do NOT take into account class or numbers when spawning your adventure.  The only thing looked at is easy/hard and the average age of your group.  (Dungeons are in 5 level increments).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Won a gather mission with just me a beastlord, paladin, and bard, still had tons of time left when we got the last peice..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Done two missions with 4 people now.<br />
<br />
Me, me 2 boxing druid, shaman, beastlord.<br />
55 mob slaughter. Finished in 80 minutes. Guk.<br />
<br />
Me, me 2 boxing druid, bard, necromancer.<br />
59 mob slaughter. Finished in 70 minutes. Mistmoore.<br />
<br />
Definately lower HPs on the mobs. Everything else remains the same.<br />
<br />
Even done some missions with apparently out of whack groups. Like Warrior, Paladin, Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, Druid on assasinate. Finished with half an hour to spare.</div></div><hr />
