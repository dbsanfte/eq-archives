<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys was just lookin for some info on this guy.  Wanting to try him today with my guild we are Elemental Lvl.  Fought him once and we lost the time I was there BUT I did have the lovely pleasure of getting knocked back halfway across the zone.  With his debuff is there any sure way to get a Levi type spell so that half the raid dont get knock backed and fall for 20k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kill him fast, junk buffs, hope to god that people can kill him before everyone gets eaten, and he AE pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its one of those fights that Buff order can matter. Start with 6 Junk buffs on everyone, then the least needed good stuff first and have lev or DMF as the last buff.  Also a bard in the Tank group to get all the resists to 500 seemed to help.<br />
<br />
    Of course I have tried him 3 times now and failed all three. The bad part is we came closest the first time but it was also with mostly pre-elemental and I ended up as the best equipped Tank at 8500 HP, 1500 AC. And it was the AE rampage that seemed to be the worst part, couple of those on the casters and we seemed to be down to tanks and healers too soon to have the DPS left to finish him off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He AE rampages?  Huh, I never got even scratched once fighting him and although I tend to automatically float out at max melee range I sure wasn't paying any special attention towards doing so (Rogue here).<br />
<br />
Throw up a few junk buffs first, load up on resist buffs and a bard or two and go to town.  We took overkill in the form of 55-65 people ranging from barely elemental to barely time in gear and the thing dropped like a rock with I think one or two deaths perhaps.  Heck, we lost more people outside of VP doing turn-ins.  I used a couple of clickies but never lost any buffs of importance during the fight, although having them in a reasonable order is never a bad idea.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I used DMF and never got knocked anywhere, although I might have been resisting that AE I guess.  I did end up snared for a little while though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">His &quot;ae ramp&quot; is more like Infuriate in that it hits a certain limited number of people.   <br />
<br />
Some people are still under the impression that there's only 2 types of rampage in EQ, single target and AE.    The lack of understanding of rampage is sad, but I suppose kind of cool.<br />
<br />
Here's a couple of things to keep in mind about Rampage:<br />
<br />
1. Single Target:  A list is kept based upon the order in which aggro was gained.   Regular single target rampage will hit one additional person per rampage.<br />
<br />
2. &quot;AE Rampage&quot;:   Kind of a misnomer.  Instead of a linear &quot;rampage&quot; list where a single target is hit, this type of rampage simply hits everyone that's in range who's performed a hostile act on the mob or a benevolent act on someone who's performed a hostile act.   (Casting a beneficial spell on someone on the rampage list is considered a hostile act).   Standing near the mobm or &quot;proximity aggro&quot; is 0 hate, and thus does not place you on the rampage list or subject to being hit, thus making &quot;AE Rampage&quot; not really AE, but an unlimited multiple target rampage.<br />
<br />
3. Limited Multi Person Rampage:   Suled Dar's Shade, and any mob who &quot;Infuriates&quot; does this.   An undisclosed number of persons on the rampage list get simultaneously hit on rampage, but it's not everyone on the rampage list.    This is the one mistaken for &quot;AE Rampage&quot; but it's not.    Infuriate has the benefit of giving advance warning prior to it happenning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;selective ae rampage&quot; for lack of a better term started in the LDON era, so anything pre is either ae ramp or single target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Northerner : KB is a proc, on MT, not AE.<br />
<br />
AE snare, + kb proc on MT can be annoying. MT1 and 2 in same group than a mag help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Northerner : KB is a proc, on MT, not AE. <br />
<br />
Evasive helped with this when I tanked him (kinda like old Sont).<br />
<br />
Had a couple mage rings on me when I tanked him for insta click lev.<br />
<br />
Had 2 tanks open up on him with furious (approaching over the lava) to buy time for slows to land.</div></div><hr />
