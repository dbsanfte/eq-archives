I'm 58 with some ok equip (3400hp 1220ac unbuffed, copper hammer main and ghaib's longsword offhand) but I'm just really short on playtime with it being football season.  Is there anywhere i could solo for some ok AAxp?  I can solo PoJ prisoners, but they're pretty slow between kills. I have run3 and regen1, hope to have regen3 soon then will move on to CS or CA next probly.  Thanks for the input!<br />
<br />
    EDIT forgot to mention i have a velious BP to help with healing. thanks!</div></div><hr />

I'd suggest getting a slowing weapon and a fungi tunic to help further reduce your down time inbetween kills as well. AAs in those two spots are tolerable solo as I've been doing the solo AA grind for awhile now, I'd also suggest getting 60 before concerning your' self with the AA grind. AAXP below 60 is just too slow when you are soloing.</div></div><hr />
