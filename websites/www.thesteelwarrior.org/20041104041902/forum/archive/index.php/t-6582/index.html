<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raramooga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings warriors!  My wife and I currently duo a 58 cleric and 58 warrior, and occasionally bot either a 65 shm or 62 ench for pulling/buffing purposes.  We have had a lot of fun tooling around in Veksar; the place is really a lot of fun, neat looking and some areas quite challenging (had some scary moments in the undead slave tunnels...).<br />
<br />
Wanderlust is beginning to set in again and we're a bit curious if anyone has some experience to share on some other spots which might be of similar or better XP/challenge.  Was thinking possibly chardokB?  Neither of us have ever been there before.  How does this place compare to Veksar?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the hardest part of chardokB is getting down there if you dont have the faction. over all, i think the pulls are just as easy there as in veskar. the drops are compairable as well as the exp. it's definatlly not as big as veksar so it might get *worn out* faster. at your lvl the best place for exp and loot will be veksar chardokB and droga. you might be able to do CT (the zone). your gear is alot better than mine was when the zone was revamped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raramooga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks so much for the reply.  We have since packed bags and moved to ChardokB.  Your right, it seems smaller and the zone-in tends to be the main area that is camped, so I think first order of business will be figuring out which areas are good spots to set up camp deeper in.<br />
<br />
One of the things I really loved about Veksar was it was so easy to move around in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rara, have you considered Sol C?  It also might be alot of fun for your duo.  Also as said above CT might be fun in sewers.</div></div><hr />
