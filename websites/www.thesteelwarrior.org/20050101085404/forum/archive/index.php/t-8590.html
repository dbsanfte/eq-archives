<br />
Now my big choice is either &quot;innate deffense&quot; OR &quot;Sturdiness 2&quot;<br />
<br />
Unbuffed im only around 5400 HP, got decent mitigation from CS3 and PE.<br />
<br />
is the 8 AA for Sturdiness 2 a better choice for me that starting ID? which is 3AA per level so is 15 in the end.<br />
<br />
im sure there is a sencable reason I should choose one over the other but I cant seem to see which is better to be able to mitigate more or have more HP for my current mitigation.<br />
<br />
What would/did you all do in this place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ID 1, 2 and 3 (9 AA) is going to be much better than the 100hp from sturdiness 2 (8 AA). I'd definitely max out ID before putting more points into sturdiness. As another note, ID comes in 5 small upgrades, so each rank makes it easier to get the next rank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I'm not MT for my guild, usually a few down the line, I would still recommend ID first.<br />
<br />
The choice of upping your max hp cap by +100, or being able to mitigate that much or more (am assuming without any parses to back me up) for equal AA spent.<br />
<br />
If you're strictly worried about hps on raids alone, you'd get more than 100 hps from buffs with higher stat cap if you bought 4 ranks in Planar Power, compared to Sturdy2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WarSheol_EM</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Planer Power is the other at top of my list sence on most raids all my skills are buffed to the 280 cap.<br />
<br />
So Sturdiness not worth it for a while then? Only reason I considered it wsas ive beem MTing a lot more boss mobs i.e. Grummus, TZ, Carp ect but guess your right as much as I wanna see big HP numbers maybe I should be able to take a hit first heh hmm.<br />
<br />
Still not totaly clear but seems many think Mitigation first, they ever release an official % per AA on ID here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I recall, it's something like 1% increase each rank of LR, and 10% total from CS. I don't know how accurate that is, but it sounds about right.</div></div><hr />

I think ya need a little help here bud.  Your hit point total is not the be all/end all.  You tank ALOT better at 5400hp with all your defensive AA's than you will at 5500hp without the crucial AA's.<br />
<br />
The 2 clerics who have had the oppurtunity to heal me in the last year or 2, have both said the same thing when they group with XP group tanks...they think I'm a god amongst men.  It's not because I've got stellar gear, it's because most of the average XP group tanks you're going to run into don't have all the defensive AA's yet. They really do make that big of a difference, and when you finish them, and get a chance to stand side by side with a tank in comparable gear who just hit 65 and hasn't started on AA's yet, you'll see it.  Until then, trust us when we say don't fuck around with Sturdiness and don't fuck around with planar power.  Both are complete wastes of time if you have the goals that you do...of moving on and tanking bigger things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at it this way.  Maxed out CS/CA/PE/LR/ID should be roughly 32% less dps on you than you take without defensive AAs.  So your 5400 hp life bar with full defensive AAs moves like a tank with well over 7k hps and no defensive AAs.  That makes hps from planar power and sturdiness look like a joke, and all that costs 59 AA, Sturdy by itself costs 60.  This is a no-brainer.<br />
<br />
ID should be roughly 1% per level just like LR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To make Brutal's argument even simpler:<br />
<br />
Both ID and LR reduce incoming melee damage by 1.5%/level or 0.5%/AA. Putting that into HP terms that is 0.5% of 5400 or 27 HP/AA for unbuffed HP. Buffed at 7500 HP ID/LR get you 37.5 HP/AA.<br />
<br />
Sturdiness give a 5400 HP tank 1.8% more HP for 4 AA, or 0.46% more HP per AA unbuffed. The math for Sturdiness is easy... 25 HP/AA (for level 1) and that does not change with buffs.</div></div><hr />
