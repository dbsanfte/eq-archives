<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cherrylime</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there, I'm new to the Warrior class, and am confused on a few things. Mainly taunt, I'm not sure when to press it.. how does it work? Does it immediatly add some agro?<br />
I've heard a few things about it, not sure what's true. Some Warriors tell me to press it whenever it pops up, and some say it's only useful when the NPC is attacking someone else..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Violent5</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few threads on this board debating the use of taunt, you can probably use search to find them.  I used taunt whenever it was available to me at the lower levels to raise my skill, but after my skill maxed I saved it to try to get aggro when I needed it.  I set up a hotbutton like this:<br />
<br />
/doability 1   (taunt)<br />
/attack off<br />
/doabilty 2  (beg)<br />
/attack on<br />
/doability 5  (sense heading)<br />
<br />
That way taunt, beg,  and sense heading skill were maxed pretty esily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt<br />
<br />
Taunt is a skill that checks many factors that only SoE know about. However, I believe its based on:<br />
<br />
1) Skill level in Taunt<br />
2) Level of Mob<br />
3) Level of aggro between you and the person the Mob is currently beating on<br />
<br />
If successful, taunt will put you at the top of the Aggro list and the mob will start to hit you. Note, this effectively makes taunt useless if the mob is already hitting you (your already at the top of the aggro list)<br />
<br />
Tactics for taunt<br />
<br />
Only taunt when the mob is NOT hitting you. Otherwise you waste 6 seconds or so before you can try again.<br />
<br />
Stay close to the Mob, proximity helps aggro, more so at higher levels, but its good form, so learning now helps later.<br />
<br />
Aggro<br />
<br />
Aggro is what people term how much a Mob hates you, if you have aggro you are somewhere on the list. The number 1 on that list is who the Mob is hitting on.<br />
<br />
Aggro is generated in different ways:<br />
<br />
1) Hitting a Mob (DPS aggro, or damage per second)<br />
2) Taunting a Mob (related to the skill)<br />
3) Kicking/Slamming/Bashing. These generate aggro, though how much /shrug. Not a lot I find (Maybe bash/slam, but being a Halfhooman I dont do it often)<br />
4) Proccing a weapon (Proc = Process, the firing of a random effect on your weapon) Certain procs have more aggro than others, highest being (in no order) Slows, Stuns, Tash<br />
5) Sitting. Some mobs dont like you sitting, can be useful to postion a stubborn mob.<br />
6) Some warriors feel Disarm/Beg also adds aggro.<br />
<br />
How to taunt<br />
<br />
My personal belief is that taunt works best after hitting a mob, so if you lose aggro to an over-zealous caster, wait till you get a round of attacks in then taunt.<br />
<br />
Factors affecting taunt<br />
<br />
1) Root. The spelll Root and its variants will cause a Mob to hit the closest target, regardless of who is number 1 on the aggro list, make use of this to get up close and personal on the mob<br />
2) Low health. When characters get below 40pct health, some creatures frenzy and automatically attack that person, no amount of taunting will stop it. Best tactic is to root, or heal the person (or both)<br />
3) Stunned/Runed. If your stunned or runed some Mobs tend to ignore you and hit other people, deal with it.<br />
4) Dual Wield vs 2handed weaps. At the lower levels, dual wielding two 1hers generates more aggro than 1 slow 2her. At higher levels and better weapons, the reverse is true.<br />
<br />
Other uses for taunt<br />
<br />
1) Breaking mes. If a mob is messed, I generally taunt 1-3 times before breaking. Other factors come into play of course (has the chanter blurred? Rooted? Anyone &lt;40pct health?)<br />
2) Annoying Paladins and Sks that have taken your livelyhood from you.<br />
<br />
When not to taunt<br />
<br />
1) When your not the MA/MT (Main Assist, Maint Tank). If your not the one the healers are concentrating on, DONT TAUNT!<br />
<br />
Training Taunt<br />
<br />
1) Although VI have said they changed it, I would still visit your trainer and put 5 points into it.<br />
2) Use against EXP giving Mobs<br />
<br />
What next?<br />
<br />
1) Join other warriors complaining on how Taunt needs upgraded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cherrylime</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another question, about the Warrior epic. Everyone in my guild says the Warrior epic is useless, and looking at the damage/delay I agreed. But now that I look at the effect, does it help with keeping aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The red blade has the effect of +500 aggro.<br />
<br />
The blue blade has +40raw attack<br />
<br />
The combined 2her has a +500 aggro too.<br />
<br />
(All this as I remember it)<br />
<br />
They are not useless, but depending on your guilds raid habits, you could concievably get better weapons (not cooler looking tho) much easier.<br />
<br />
Most warriors view the epic as a Rite of Passage. Something to prove your dedication to the Cause. The epic weapons are good, not excellent, not ubber, but still good. 14dam is nice, 24 delay is nice, the effects are nice.<br />
<br />
I dual wield a fleshgrinder and swiftblade of zek. Nothing great and sometimes I have trouble with aggro. I plan on doing my epic for the 2her and the redblade for dualwielding with fleshy.<br />
<br />
Comes down to your personal preference, I would suggest only doing the Epic if you REALLY want it. Otherwise, raid more and you'll get equivalent or better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as said only taunt when you need to regain agro, or puond it duing a fight for skill ups. in a good group were everyone knows their job i sometimes don't have to taunt at all. other times in bad groups i have to puond the key through the board to just barly keep agro. <br />
<br />
yes you will soon hate every pally sk you see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groticus</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Epics are good till you start getting high end weapons.  Then they become utility weapons for when you need resists and possibly to boost your attk.  Red epic is still nice off hand till you start hitting mobs that will resist it.<br />
<br />
  In my experience no Warrior who has gotten their epic regrets it.  The people who say it is not worth the effort do not have theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, you did not say if you had a different charater that was higher level.  Anyway, I try to use taunt and some key times.  <br />
<br />
-After the first heal<br />
-After tash<br />
-After slow<br />
-When I lose aggro<br />
-When I see a nuke land<br />
-If I am not pulling, once the mob is in camp.<br />
<br />
I have my group spells on so I can see my group members casting and I can tell when someone is being a tard and trying to over aggro.</div></div><hr />
