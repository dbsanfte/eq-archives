<br />
I pop my DE mask, I get a plate graphic (because DE clerics can wear plate) but as a race without another plate wearing class, I get stuck with the chain graphics!<br />
<br />
I want my plate back damned it!<br />

Give barbarians plate damned it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think he's complaining that there's a lot of armor out there that look plate, and probably should be plate, but have a chain graphic when worn by barbarians.  However, I think he has the old Guise of the Deciever, and the complaint stems from the fact that he can go to DE and get a plate graphic, yet it has a chain graphic on his barbarian form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iksar can't wear plate. So as barbarian warrior NONE of my high end armors (Coldain +) armors have a plate graphic so Iksar can wear them. Look at any barba  warrior wearing better than Hate armor. Its all chain!</div></div><hr />

I am a barb, got the mask NBG (before we we called it NBG). Since the iksar have been released all my top end armors have the same texture as some of the shaman chain. In stead of a plate graphic, I have a heavier chain. (Kailyn is female, so there is the low cut lacy chain, and then a high cut, heavier chain. The shaman armor out of PoG has the same look.)</div></div><hr />

But I know what he means.  Kinda looks like chain on a lotta classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gromes have paladins and clerics, both of whom wear plate and can't be played iksar. So they have a real plate graphic.<br />
<br />
Races who don't have plate: Barbs, Ogers, Trolls, Iksar. All becuase of the iksa. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Coldain + is all chain to you?  Turn on old models or something.  Champs is plate.  Myrmidon is plate, Heraldic/Tundra is plate, Ornate is plate, what else are you bitching about?  I think you're on drugs personally because I don't see no damned chain on anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see what Iksars have to do with it. Are you complaining about the legs? I seem to recall Luclin barb palte legs looking chainish, but that has nothing to do with Iksars, that's just what the plate graphic looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iksars can wear velious plate...odd yes, but true.  Looks like plate to me.  Has chain underneath it (then again all plate armor has chain underneath it).  Maybe graphics bug?  A friend tells me my PSC on my bst looks like chain every so often, I just take it off and put it back on and it looks plate again to her.</div></div><hr />

Gnome! I mean how could you resist being a whirling machine of destruction at 2 foot 6? <br />
<br />
Can just see it now  &quot;The toughest person in your party...comes up to my knees... on tip toes?&quot; Imagine how HoT dragons must be mocked after beting tanked by a gnome!<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor Bob couldn't even tank...an GNOME!!!!&quot; (dragon falls off his barstool he is laughing so hard.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking for these?<br />
<br />
&lt;drops a bag of gnome heads and assorted dragon remains on the bar&gt;<br />
<br />
Dont blame the Legion for your lack of good fashion, go out and tank a dragon or 8, it will make you feel alot better.  Bartender!  A beer for the Barbarian, he is feeling kinda Rangerish.<br />
<br />
P.S. All the barbs in my guild that are wearing vindi , warlords, ornate or even myrmidons, in luclin graphics, look just fine.  I have not run into any chain issues with the barbs so far, but it has been a while since I have taken the luclin graphics off. <br />

Try either turning velious textures off or running luclin barbarian models (cos there is only one texture for plate in luclin) and you'll see that your plate is infact plate and not chain.</div></div><hr />
