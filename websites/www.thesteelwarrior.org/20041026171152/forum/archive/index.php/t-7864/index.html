<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chicklet23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, This is my first warrior ever and I was curious if anyone had any deicent  solo exp spot  ideas.   He is on Kael faction so have been killing coldains for heads  in Eastern Wastes.  The only times I  find myself able to get a group is for Dulak harbor since I dont have LDoN on this account.  Really getting tired of Dulak so was hopeing for a change.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on some places where mobs dont hit too hard or have few  hp? I'm sitting around 3050hp unbuffed at lvl 43  if that helps with any ideas. Here is the magelo.  Figured someone may have a good  idea since people are so knoledgeable in these forums.  Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only in the mid 30's  myself but you could try out overthere, seems to be a bit empty nowdays but that is a good thing if you intend to solo, mobs are not all to bad hitting for 80-100'ish tops, if you like dungeons perhaps a trip to crystal caverns could be fun. most my chars are on Claws faction so killing giants in great divide has been great, perhaps those bear like mobs around the velketor entrance is soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From lvl 43 - 48 i was soloing in Great Divide. The giants, I built up faction and got started on collecting some heads and toes. Just have a snare weapon, and carry some heal pots.</div></div><hr />
