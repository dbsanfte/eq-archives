<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know I am well twinked at my level but I had 180K on my old main and wanted to make a warrior.<br />
<br />
I am duel weilding a Wavecrasher and a Frost Bringer right now and my warrior is level 28.5 I have a RBB for haste atm and mostly cobald/cultural i also have a regeneration BP. I still need to get an earring of the solstice. I also have a cloak of piety or whatever it is called for back. I forget the exact name but I think that is it. I know this gear will last me a long time but I would love to know what to look for now. I plan to be the MT for my guild later in levels and really want to make sure I can hold agro. Can anyone give me an idea what I should start working toward other than quest gear? I prefer items that I can either camp-farm with my main or buy as plat is not much of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Orggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be fine holding aggro. I would start working up your SS or Kael faction and mq some of that armor. Upgrade to a better haste item. Not sure what jewelry you have on but i'd go with Valor rings and Bloodmetal earrings of engagement when you are of high enough lvl. Prolly lots more stuff you could buy but im not sure without seeing a magelo.</div></div><hr />

I hope that is it. I have not got the cultural  armor yet so I have not listed it. I am going to get a helmet and a bracer soon and I know a lot of the stuff I have needs help.<br />
<br />
EDIT: (Brutul) link fixing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmm ok I can not seem to get it to post my link. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong? when I copy it and paste it it says java script. when I type it in like above it doesn't find it. I can click on the link in Magelo and it pops up but it doesn't give me an address i can copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sisthar-<br />
<br />
Not sure what the problem was but I took out your url tags since the board automatically converts urls to links and I think it's working now.<br />
<br />
As far as your gear goes, like you said, you're a big twink and everything is great for your level.  You might pick up a glimmering mithril torque for your neck, better ac and should be pretty cheap.  Dragon tooth choker would be another option.<br />
<br />
If I were you I'd just keep leveling and save for more cultural armor as you can.  You could go to your 50s easily in what you're wearing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Barbed Dragonscale Boots<br />
Barbed Dragonscale Pauldrons<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace (neck)<br />
Helm of Raldukan (head)<br />
Silver Chitin Wristband (wrist)<br />
Bracelet of Fortitude (wrist)<br />
Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves (arms)<br />
Grimling Contraption (face) <br />
<br />
Those are a few pretty nice items that doesnt have a Rec or Req lvl on em that give pretty good HP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks i will look into trying to find those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you like hp maybe those blood runed guants that have like 60hp and 16ac.<br />
maybe a good 2hs and a better ratio in primary with a nice proc. also ToD.</div></div><hr />
