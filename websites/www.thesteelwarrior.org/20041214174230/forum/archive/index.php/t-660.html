<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me start by saying this isnt a fix to sk/pal  issues but rather my pet hate of discs and how they operate.<br />
<br />
Thoughts on minor modifications to disciplines<br />
<br />
Notes<br />
<br />
Disciplines should stack like other spells, with discs taking 'slots'. Warriors should be able to terminate a discipline whenever he or she wishes, which starts the reuse timer immediately.<br />
<br />
LEVEL 30: /DISC RESISTANT<br />
Slot: 1<br />
Increase to +20 at level 30 to +50 at level 60<br />
Duration: 3 minutes. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes.<br />
 <br />
LEVEL 40: /DISC FEARLESS<br />
Slot: 1<br />
Duration: 10 seconds at level 40 to 30seconds at 60 <br />
Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes. <br />
<br />
LEVEL 52: /DISC EVASIVE<br />
Slot: 2<br />
Duration: 3 minutes. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 5 minutes. <br />
Modifications: There should be no decrease in hit percentage with this disc. There is already a risk of taking a string of max hits, the loss in aggro generated with this disc should be removed.<br />
<br />
LEVEL 53: /DISC CHARGE<br />
Slot: 5<br />
Duration: 20 seconds. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes. <br />
Modifications: Additional +10pct haste over the cap (bard type haste), increased chance to proc weapons (perhaps +Dex)<br />
<br />
LEVEL 54: /DISC MIGHTYSTRIKE<br />
Slot: 5<br />
Duration: 15 seconds. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes. <br />
Modifications: All hits have a small chance to stun.<br />
<br />
LEVEL 55: /DISC DEFENSIVE<br />
Slot: 2<br />
Duration: 3 minutes. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 5 minutes. <br />
Modifications: Increased chance to riposte (~15pct increase)<br />
<br />
LEVEL 56: /DISC FURIOUS<br />
Slot: 3<br />
Duration: 12 seconds. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 60 minutes. <br />
Modifications: Increased chance to crit hit during disc ~20pct (high as it only lasts 12seconds)<br />
<br />
LEVEL 57: /DISC PRECISION<br />
Slot: 4<br />
Duration: 3 minutes. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
LEVEL 58:/DISC FELLSTRIKE<br />
Slot: 5<br />
Duration: 20 seconds. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes. <br />
Modifications: Increased hit percentage ~10pct<br />
<br />
LEVEL 59: /DISC FORTITUDE<br />
Slot: 3<br />
Duration: 12 seconds. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 60 minutes. <br />
<br />
LEVEL 60: /DISC AGGRESSIVE<br />
Slot : 4<br />
Duration: 3 minutes. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Matrix Form	Slot1	Slot2	Slot3	Slot4	Slot5<br />
<br />
Resistant	X<br />
Fearless	X	<br />
Evasive			X		<br />
Charge						X<br />
MightyStrike					X<br />
Defensive		X	<br />
Furious				X<br />
Precision				X<br />
Fellstrike					X	<br />
Fortitude			X<br />
Aggressive				X<br />
<br />
NOTE: 	Slot4 and Slot2 would be prohibited from working together (pointless anyway)<br />
	Slot5 and Slot3 would be prohibited from working together<br />
<br />
Possible Chaining of Discs<br />
<br />
Defensive Chaining<br />
<br />
Defensive (3mins)<br />
Resistant (3mins)<br />
Fortitude/Furious (12/12 seconds)<br />
MightyStrike/Charge/Fellstrike<br />
<br />
Offensive Chaining<br />
<br />
Fearless (30seconds)<br />
-Furious/Fortitude  (12/12 seconds)<br />
Aggressive (3mins)<br />
-Charge/MightyStrike/Fellstrike (20/15/20 seconds)<br />
<br />
*- Not at the same time<br />
<br />
Experience scenarios<br />
<br />
You can stay in defensive/evasive 3mins in every 6 (close to what it is now).<br />
You can stay in aggressive/precise 3mins in every 8 (a lot better than present)<br />
You have no way but to stop attacking to lose aggro (although you can use Fortitude/Furious if needed)<br />
<br />
You can use eyecandy every 15mins and keep your defensive disc ready (much better than <br />
present)<br />
The eyecandy also has useful applications (stuns for casters, increase hit pct, or haste for burst)<br />
<br />
Overpowering? Maybe...but damn it would be fun<br />
<br />
Thoughts welcome.</div></div><hr />

That would at least employ some strategy (ie: dont go precise if you're gonna need defensive in the next 3 minutes...instead of the hour? it is now) The timers in 5 different slots would be way better than it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like it if they worked like /shield ( one at a time ) and cut the reuse time down to at most 30 min on the ones that take ore than 30 min.</div></div><hr />
