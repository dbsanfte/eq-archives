<br />
Of course, we call those OoW items 'poorly itemized.' despite the fact that Tacvi is still harder than just about anything outside of Anguish.<br />
<br />
The biggest obstacle to doing Tacvi is probably not the loot quality (because honestly most of the stuff is as good if not better than OoW stuff once you get past the 30 hp/mana) but because the need to flag people again to access Txevu.  A fresh recruit would have to go through at Uqua + Inktuta at the very least to catch up and no one likes Uqua, and Inktuta is fun but fun is not what compels people to do encounters.</div></div><hr />

haha, 3 weeks after Cestus Dei and Arch Overseers beat the same encounter.  It's part of the zone lore and was expected by anyone who paid attention.  Besides, the first Tunat encounter is a breeze.</div></div><hr />

Why bother ?<br />
<br />
Tacvi is way too hard for its reward (or i should say MPG is way too easy).<br />
<br />
Anyway OOW = Inflation land, everyone will be uber before EQ1 dies.<br />

You needed EP to win Time.<br />
You needed Time to win Uqua.<br />
You needed Qvic to win Txevu<br />

You can win MPG with EP/Time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually let me try to put that into something numerical for you, might make it easier to comprehend.<br />
<br />
Let's say you raid 4 hours a night.  If you were to do a Tacvi clear (or as much as you could reasonably attempt in 4 hours), you could clear Zun in txevu (4 loots), Xxeric (2 loots), Riel Tavas (2 loots) and ZunA and ZunB (4 loots).  Could also *probably* do north snake (2 loots), but that'd be right around 4 hours.   That comes to 14 total loots for one evening.<br />
<br />
Now swap it over to OoW.  in one 4 hour sitting, you could do 6 MPG's (18 loots + 12 70th runes), or king + queen + ture (7 loots and a handful of augs/spells).  Could probably add feratha and chailak if so desired as well (2 more loots, 4 more spells). <br />
<br />
So in all fairness to tacvi, it is quite possible to go clear it out and get some decent loots (barring you don't get evil necro daggers and wiz wands and other pieces of garbage /destroy loot).  But you get a better bang for you buck so to speak out of OoW, and far, far less crap ass Spiked Steel Batons.  FAR less spiked steel batons.</div></div><hr />

Tacvi should make the class only weapons much rarer seeing most of them are now obselete in the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

As much as I hate to say this, as it was certainly not the most enjoyable content, Vex Thal, in my eyes, is perhaps one of the most brilliantly itemized zones.  Of course, most of the loot was changed/revamped, of course, but it still stands that Vex Thal, even today, is a gold mine for guilds entering that progression tier.<br />
<br />
I wonder how it achieved this?<br />

I also think GoD wasn't horrible if you weren't trying to smash your head against the proverbial walls (especially in Uqua) right at the release. It wasn't a bad idea, just wasn't thought through well enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TR left Stormhammer for various reasons, but the main reason is the same as my guild (Precision Strike) left to go to the Rathe server :<br />
<br />
Stormhammer is dead.  There's almost no influx of high-level players coming to SH, which limits recruitment except by poaching from your compeditor guilds, and poaching can only carry you so far.  Also, SOE never gave SH what was promised (except maybe the first two weeks or so), and after a while, paying $40 is/was just not worth it.<br />
<br />
Here was a post by Terathel on the EQBoards (also posted on the Stormhammer.org boards - http://www.stormhammer.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5243)  that got nuked by SOE :<br />
<br />
With the upcoming move of PS, nov 20th and soon to follow *** off of Stormhammer, we arrive at yet to another one of SOE's collasal failures. <br />
<br />
Let me share with you all what a few members of the SOE staff who represent Stormhammer have told me. <br />
<br />
For the last few months they have been going to Brenlo's office (Allen Crosby) telling him of the issues with our server, the lack of support from the development team and other key resorces. <br />
<br />
Here was Brenlo's response to this, he said he did not see Stormhammer as being broken, or having any issues, and that the loss of PS and TR was not a big deal since they were only a few of the total accounts still on Stormhammer. <br />
<br />
For the last few years the services pitched in the selling of this server have been comeing up short to absolutely not delivering on what was promised. Rather then do the moral and ethical thing which would be to refund the accounts for services not rendered, SOE and especialy Brenlo have decided on a different course of action. <br />
<br />
The tact they have chosen is this. Dont do a thing, remove little by little the few things the sever still has while milking those of us here who were promised things like items for EQ2 for staying on SH wonder in perplexment why we are not getting what we paid for look like fools. Have you noticed even the once beloved and only saving grace (our GMs) are no longer online as much?. (mind you its not our GMs fault, they are trying their hardest to save our server in fact). <br />
<br />
This tact is so that people dont start an uproar, that little by little everyone who has become disanfrancised will leave Stormhammer, and when they decide to pull the plug no one will be left to complain. <br />
<br />
Hats off to you Brenlo, your tact has worked to perfection, you have achieved your gaol. If you had even a fraction of moral fiber or ethical values you would refund those of us on Stormhammer who paid for services not rendered. Indeed false advertisement. <br />
<br />
If you worked for me i would have fired you a long time ago. www.planbny.com i deal with thousands of people a year and understand what it is to provide service and make sure that what i promise to sell is achived in a manner that the customer if happy with it. <br />
<br />
Shame on you sir, shame on you. <br />
<br />
To those the CS team on Stormhammer past and present, thank you very much for making the best of what little you had to work with, i personaly appricate all those extra things you did for us and the time you vested in making sure we always had the best of times on the server. Without you this place would never have merrited the cost. /Salute to the Stormhammer staff. <br />
<br />
And here's our take on it from our homepage (www.precisionstrike.net):<br />
<br />
Precision Strike – A Stormhammer guild?<br />
<br />
Maybe you’ve heard, maybe you haven’t, but either way you’re going to hear it now. <br />
<br />
Precision Strike is moving to The Rathe! <br />
<br />
A lot of thought has gone into this move, and there are quite a few motives that ultimately led to this decision. Let’s travel back in time a little over two years ago… <br />
<br />
SoW was a fledgling guild with very high standards. Very few had faith that the guild would grow and flourish with such strict recruitment policies, but boy were they wrong. Twelve people at maximum were invited each month, never more than that. I personally had to wait as an applicant an extra month when I joined because the previous month (January, 2003) they had already invited twelve people. I didn’t mind, I knew it would be worth it in the long run. A month passes, I’m still camping VT shards and my Emperor ring and I’m finally invited. I finally discover what a real, skilled guild is all about. <br />
<br />
Cut to now. A few of our rival guilds have left the server over the past year. Europa /mourn left and now have very little competition on their new server. Leviathan left, and now they are, against all odds, amongst the top guilds in EQLive. Vexare left, changed their name to “Plan B”… then “Prodigy of War” (how original) and finally Vindictae. I think they’ve disbanded or something. <br />
<br />
The current content that we’re fighting is uncontested, the zones are not overcrowded, and the churn of the server has slowly come to a standstill. <br />
<br />
So why are we leaving? <br />
<br />
1. This server is pretty much dead. People are leaving the server everyday, and not enough are coming to it. <br />
<br />
2. There is no recruitment base. There are very few people on this server who are up to our standards, and we will not lower them in order to fill out our ranks. On top of that, it is almost impossible to cross-server recruit and get people to shell out $40 a month. Which brings me to the next point. <br />
<br />
3. We are not getting our money’s worth. Is this really worth $40 out of your pocket a month? SoE is marketing this server to the level range of roughly 35-50. The majority (80%) of active EQ accounts highest level character is somewhere in that 35-50 range. See all of the GM events lately? Oh, that’s right, you couldn’t go because you’re too high level. Oh look, that level 49 Berserker was awarded a PoTime BP. <br />
<br />
4. LFG times. Do you like sitting with LFG above your head for hours on end? I know I sure don’t. <br />
<br />
5. A new environment. Change in general is good. There will be a better variety of players to recruit, without having to poach. <br />
<br />
So to summarize: We can make recruitment easier without having to poach. We can save lots of money. We can meet new people, hopefully enjoy it again, and get pretty much the same customer service we (now) receive on SH with the new petition system. Hmmmm… that’s a tough decision. <br />
<br />
Sorry to post such a lengthy explanation but at least you have info from the people involved.  I was a Stormhammer member from the day the server opened, and the ONLY reason I never left SH was the fact that I was a member of a great guild and had great friends on the server.  Yeah, $40 was a bit more to spend, but at the same time, I had people that I did not want to abandon - and I know that same feeling is/was shared by a great number of people from my guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
cause they were fed up with the $40 a month bill for dynamic events that target a non-existant  pre-50s level group,  barely any 65+ events (one since ive been on the server?) and all in all shotty service.<br />
<br />
theres no server population, theres no Economy because theres no enough people farming non-uber gear, and you have to deal with all the 10-year-olds who stole their daddys credit card eBayed a lv70 charecter.<br />
<br />
if my old server didnt blow donkey balls (which it does) id go back... i cant blame TR or Precision Strike for leaving (ps went to rathe). kinda funy tho, top guild on the server just got to time about 2 weeks ago</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually, for two years, Frax, it wasn't that bad. for a long time, the server generated a lot of interest, and new people were always transferring to SH.  eventually though, the well just dried up.</div></div><hr />

If it is true they have killed the real one why hasnt there been any screenshots or loot links.Its not as if it isnt a big deal as the real Tunat could probably take on every named in OOW...maybe it was possible with a full raid of all top equipped chars,but the way things are now i dont see it happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the real tunat has not been killed. There's a lot of confusion about it since most players will refer to the trigger mob (first tunat) interchangeably with the real one, and a lot of players didn't really understand Triton's explaination. Part of the lack of motivation stemmed from (besides having Anguish to work on) that most of the items were data mined back in GoD, and were pretty much all 250ish hp items in line with the rest of the zone, and all inferior to MPG or Riftseekers drops, let alone Anguish.<br />
<br />
More than likely that's different now, but with the tune happening right before the holidays and Jelvan event then Arch Magus taking priority, we won't get around to Tunat for a while. It would be funny if we beat OoW before GoD, and it's looking like an extremely strong possibility right now. If we get stuck on Mata Muram for a while, it might go the other way, but we're getting close on Arch Magus now so I kind of doubt it.</div></div><hr />
