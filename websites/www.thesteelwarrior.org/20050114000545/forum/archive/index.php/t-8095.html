Granted they will both have a3 augs in them for aggro, but i didnt no if that 750 pt. proc compared to a 150 pt. proc would have to do with any diference in aggro production, although EoE comes with a stun which is also good for pissing a mob off...i didnt no if more pt. proc damage would have anything to do with aggro production.<br />
<br />
thanx for anyone that looks or replys to this thread. :)</div></div><hr />

What he said<br />
<br />
Besides EoE looks sweet, ED... doesn't.  <br />
<br />
One very good thing about EoE is that its a 68 stunner, so all your grind mobs will get stunned by it.  You'd be surprised how nice it is to proc during a mob's CH/Gate and actually interrupt.<br />
<br />
But looking at your magelo, I would think EoE would want to go in main hand, and you can put jagged shard in off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use ED main and EoE off atm solid aggro and as i said in my above statement =p</div></div><hr />

In offhand the ED blows vs the EoE.</div></div><hr />

This means that while an ED might come up as more damage than an EoE for a bard, it might not for a warrior. I'm not making claims of which one WILL do more DPS for warriors, but just keep that in mind when using bard to warrior comparisons.</div></div><hr />

EoE imho doesnt proc much at all for me compared to ED even when i used ED in offhand ED procs alot. What i am saying use it 1st before just saying its not good based on procrate mods and such.<br />
<br />
Just trying to give correct information based on what the items i own give.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well for a weapon to swap in for DPS when you are not tanking its a fine choice. Our warriors who won one had very little competition for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do the math, figuring -15% proc mod, WA5, and some extra DPS from crits, you should end up with around 33 dps from the proc on an ED. That might just be enough to out-DPS an EoE. However, I don't think the ED would even compare in agro. Potential DPS is not even close due to ratio, and stun proc &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DD proc. Not a bad DPS weapon if you have all the AAs.</div></div><hr />

I have parsed the ED in prim/sec hand. and proc alone does good dps.<br />
<br />
Secondary -  we are talking ~18 dps just from proc<br />
<br />
Primary -  we are talking ~30 dps just from proc<br />
<br />
 My DPS compare page (http://webpages.charter.net/camacneill/FightData.html)<br />
<br />
I was surprised how much better the dps was compared to a JSoFF with 2 150dd procs.</div></div><hr />

I really would try to do a full buffed comparision, since ED will seriously fall back in the dps department compared to other better ratio weapons, proc rate wont scale up with max haste and some atk buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have an ED and it is usefull for a lot of things (besides making people in pick-up LDONs really jealous).<br />
<br />
For instance, if you are doing trial 1 in Time and are one of the tank mezzers, the ED does tons of damage with the 750 point procs.  So by the time the other mobs are dead, your mob is almost at 10%.  <br />
<br />
It can shorten the length of the trial in other words.  <br />
<br />
Not extremely important to the success of the raid, but kinda fun anyways  :D</div></div><hr />
