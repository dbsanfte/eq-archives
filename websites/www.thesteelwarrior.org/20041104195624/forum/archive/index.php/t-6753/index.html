<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey. Was just wondering if anyone had an opinion on the Blood Earring of Rage Vs. another Bloodmetal earring. My dex is kinda low, and my sta is much easier to max with buffs and will be self buffed maxed when I cash my Ornate legs in at 55. So is it worth giving up 20hps and some nice saves for the 15 dex? Or does that 15 dex make so little difference as to be trivial? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My vote is that the 15 dex is trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are tons of buffs for DEX, Vallon's have DEX, Strenght of the Diaku has DEX, Focus has DEX, all these stack and the amount of DEX they give will cap you for sure.<br />
On the other hand, you cant cap your HP :)<br />
<br />
If I could get another Bloodmetal, I would, but given my current back account, Im just pretty happy with the Blood Rage earring Im using :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess not, but pretty much every time I've died in this game 20hps wouldn't have mattered either  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">But they add up ;)<br />
<br />
What if you had 100hp left and the mob hited you for 110? If you had those 20hp more, you would be alive for another round and maybe a CH landing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The leading cause of death in Norrath:  Lack of hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, but....  what good are the lousy 20 hps when you can't hold aggro because your dex sucks ass and you can't get your weapons to proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">15 dex will have approximately zero effect on your proc rate.  <br />
<br />
Don't give up ac/hps for anything except haste.  Don't give up anything but agi for dex.  If you're that worried about maxing your dex, get a shaman to cast avatar on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">15 dex will have approximately zero effect on your proc rate <br />
<br />
Yeah, but 15 dex here, and another 15 dex there, and another 10 dex there, and suddenly you have gained a lot of dex and upped your proc rate significantly.  Same thing with hps.  20 hps isn't jack, but add 20 hps in every slot and it's significant.  I was really just being facetious, I'd definitely take the bloodmetal earring over the blood earring of rage.  Only reason I wear the blood earring of rage is I got a very good deal and bloodmetal earrings are very high on my server.  But...  I still think 15 dex has some impact on your proc rates, it may be minor, but it does add up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But...  I still think 15 dex has some impact on your proc rates, it may be minor, but it does add up.<br />
 Sure it does, but the difference in max 2 per minute at 305 dex and 1.5+ after 150ish is so minimal that 15 more would be hard to parse. I might even stretch in saying nearly impossible given the 1 second interval in log files and the RNG.<br />
<br />
So is it worth giving up 20hps and some nice saves for the 15 dex? Or does that 15 dex make so little difference as to be trivial?<br />
<br />
My answer is that it is not worth it. Like has been said... the only thing that seperates you from your armor is hit points, or lack there of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are worrying for agro, you are in a group / raid. Group / raid will lead you to buffs, buffs will lead you to a maxed DEX, maxed DEX will lead you to the dark s... errr... <br />
<br />
The point is, there are more stackable buffs that affect your DEX than are those that affect your HP, like I stated, you can have Vallon's, Focus, Strenght of the Diaku and if you are not capped with that, your DEX must be like 90 :p If you dont have a shammy, a BST can buff your DEX almost as nicely. You can even get NDT illusion! There goes your DEX :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lorce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All previous posts are telling him about buffs that will max his dex, but he is lvl 47 I don't see him getting avatar or sov in normal exp groups.  A good way to get dex up is to get boon of garu (sp) when you with a chanter, and when with a shaman even at lower lvls  should still be able to get ou up high engouh for a good proc rate.  Since those are teh two major slowers your group should usually have one so deffinantly go for the hps.<br />
<br />
Another easy way to get your dex up without losing any hps or ac is to pick up a  fabled screaming mace.  It procs a buff that is avatar line spell, so should stack with most buffs you have at lvl 47.  Lasts for 20mins so you can simply use it on a mob late in a fight and get it to proc once and switch it out and use your regular weapons.   DOn't remember exactly what it adds, but its a good number maybe 20dex not to mention some ac and str.  Soloed the fabled emperor crush as a 65 warrior and didn't get hit once, but at 47 you should prolly bring a healer (also sorry if fabled got removed, I haven't really payed attention to it recently)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>werdara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fabled Screaming Mace proc is Berserk, a shammy / bst buff.<br />
<br />
Adds 11 AC, 25 Dex, 29 Str and lasts 20.5 mins.<br />
<br />
I love mine, except when it won't proc for 3 mins straight with 180ish dex in main hand.  :confused: <br />
<br />
Also, it doesn't seem to be Avatar line like I thought when I picked it up.  I've had it stack with Ferine Avatar and amost fell over in shock. Then it got overwritten by... Call of Earth.  I guess because of the AC.  Seems like a strange line to be in, but there it was. CoE killed my str / dex buff.  It also seemed to not stack with Augment (mid level Enc haste) on my 40s froglok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;The leading cause of death in Norrath: Lack of hitpoints.&quot;<br />
<br />
Followed closely by server connection issues. So what would be better for your toon, 20 more hit points or a better internet connection? <br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Also, it's kind of odd reading answers to questions before they're even asked. So in the interest of organizational skills, allow me to PROPERLY place a query and its answer from this thread:<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you had 100hp left and the mob hited you for 110? If you had those 20hp more, you would be alive for another round and maybe a CH landing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;pretty much every time I've died in this game 20hps wouldn't have mattered either &quot;<br />
<br />
In other words, you know how 15 hp per tick REGEN doesn't do jack to help you against, say, a mob that hits for 1200 and quads?<br />
<br />
Yeah, those 20 hps ain't helping much in those same situations.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Sure, I've had times where my fungi ticked me back into consciousness, and I was able to get a feign death off and save myself. THREE times. I can count them on one hand.<br />
<br />
Same applies to those mythical 20 extra hit points you think are going to save even though at the time you're getting beaten upon, you don't really have them to save you.<br />
<br />
hahahahah<br />
<br />
NOTE: None of this post implies that 15 DEXTERITY is of much use to a person EITHER. So don't approach me from that angle. If given a choice between 20 hit points and 15 dex, I'd opt for 20 hit points too. ALL I'm trying to point out is that those 20 hit points are pretty damn MARGINAL as well. So don't treat them like they matter much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, those 20hp don't matter much, or those other 20hp in that other slot, or those 10hp in that other slot, or those 35hp there...<br />
<br />
You're right, 20hp *probably* won't save you, but those 20hp in multiple slots will.  Makes me question your intelligence as a warrior when I hear you say hp, any amount of hp, don't &quot;matter much&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">n/t</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Uh, well.<br />
Look, your Magelo says you're a lvl 47 warrior with 3233 hps and 1135 AC and at level 55 you have some ornate you can slap on.<br />
You're certainly well enough geared so that you could level straight to 55 with what you have.<br />
Hitpoints are handy, yes, and reliable and a few here and there in every slot do add up. Your hitpoints don't have to proc. But unless you think prices are going to go up significantly (or pp is no object to you) then I'd just go ahead and get to 55 and see what deals present themselves to you.<br />
<br />
Lack of hitpoints are only the proximate cause of a toon's death. Far more often the final cause of death involves 1) somebody goofed, 2) lack of knowledge of the mob/zone, 3) somebody goofed, 4) train, 5) somebody goofed in an unbelievably stupid way, 6) lag, 6) somebody who should have known better goofed, 6) bad luck, 7) somebody goofed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">EDIT: I'm just in a bad mood today. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: I'd take Engagement over Rage if price weren't an issue. But I still don't think 20 hit points is going to make or break this warrior or any other warrior in the game and you won't die a lot more becauase you bought a blood earring of rage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was just saying there are more buffs that will raise your DEX than are those that raise your HP. I use a Rage earring, and a Bloodmetal one. Based on the available buffs, I say the Bloodmetal might be better. I love having my DEX high too, Im just saying that everytime I group I have it capped with buffs, from my experience, so I would take those 20hp that cant be capped and wasted.</div></div><hr />

Of course not, I'm well aware of the value of 20 hps to me...<br />

Hehe, clerics are cowards most of the time.  I got 13 Max CH's on myself in one night in earth when I was sitting at about 8600 hps.  Only died twice  :D .  Me and my cleric bot joining a group is any backup healer's worst nightmare.  The druid I group with on a regular basis finally just told me he wasn't going to heal me anymore becuase he was tired of watching my hps and having heart attacks.<br />

I imagine these guys with 10k unbuffed hps get CH'd for max about every time.  I think it was Brutall that posted a screenshot of that 11k crit on himself.</div></div><hr />

Not at all, Illia was an awesome cleric, problem was that 99% of the time, I was grouped with a druid as a main healer, and a 5k KR just isn't the same as a 7500CH.<br />
<br />
That and the fact that 7500 is like 95% of my HP...it's a REAL close shave to land one of those.</div></div><hr />

Well, not landing heals at 5% isn't necessarily a bad trait in a cleric :D.  Pushing my luck is just something I do to keep myself entertained in boring exp grinds, but most tanks probably don't like their clerics going for the purple club on every CH.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't take much to change a perfect purple club heal into a corpse :D</div></div><hr />
