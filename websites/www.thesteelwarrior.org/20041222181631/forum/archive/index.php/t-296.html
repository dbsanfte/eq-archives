He always dropped runes, chain legs, or an earring when we killed him every 6 hours.</div></div><hr />

I was xping there last night, and killing &quot;zone trash&quot; (read: level 65 mobs, that see invis, and hit in the 700 range, and sometimes quad) and I have been there for clearings of a couple differant halls leading to the 5 &quot;mini&quot; bosses... and have never seen a single ornate drop. Only Xzui or whatever his name is dropped a plate bp the other day (course I was LD, and kept going LD over and over, till finally I could not get back in) and missed the drop. Damnit. =\ But as far as random mobs dropping molds, I've never seen it.<br />
<br />
I want ornate planar gloves though... I'll tell you that much<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevian</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">saw plate boots and gloves drop in the yellowhouse in HoH, though it was before they nerfed the drop rate in HoH to hell.  Trash in sol ro does not drop molds, however protectors of jiva do, they can drop anything but bp legs probalby, seen arms and bracer drop so far while farming jiva.  Named otw to protector in Sol Ro may as well though i haven't seen it myself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess we can update this now.  Oreen doesn't drop plate gaunts (that I've seen anyway), but Riodhr Torrentwind in the east wing does.<br />
<br />
Plate Bracer off of Thangbrand in BoT South wing.<br />
<br />
And of course, it's still dropping like candy in Sol Ro, last I heard, unless today's patch fixed that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ornate BP: Eindride Icestorm  (67th, raid mob)<br />
Ornate Vembraces: Elif Whitewind (64th)<br />
Ornate Gauntlet: Fogl Iceshard, Riodhr Torrentwind (64th) <br />
Ornate Greaves: Gaukr Sandstorm  (65th--6 hour spawner, as I understand (BoT newbie)<br />

No Ornate hat in BoT?</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but the name of the rare eludes me but thats where i got mine from.</div></div><hr />

He's a named war wraith, seen him once in the time I've been hunting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overlordbarreck</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dunno about what mobs in Sol Ro drop molds but I have 2 friends that farm the area for molds.  One .. a wizard .. quad kites, not sure if any named are soloable but if not then trash mobs do drop molds.  He's had ornate vambraces and some ornate silk.<br />
<br />
Another one of my buds, a monk, duos with a pocket shaman, has gotten some silk molds so far.  If any named are soloable/duoable then disregard this.  But if they aren't then they're just killing regular trash mobs in the tower so just thought I'd let yall know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ornate does drop off any trash mob in sol ro. I just obtained my Sol Ro flag this week so i've been hittitng it up pretty hard. My first group I had there withing 10 minutes we had ornate chain boots drop off a regular trash mob. About 2 hours laters we had leather pants drop from a trash mob. Later we decided to kill Jiva so we took a few groups up and while clearing to Jiva we had 3 pieces of ornate plus a nice tradeable back item drop while clearing to Jiva. I haven't been in Sol Ro long but it looks like it's gonna be some nice plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Sol Ro every mob can drop all Ornate but BP, BP's only drop from named.   I have seen every piece but BP drop in the 3 stairs. area.</div></div><hr />
