<br />
You can argue with me as much as you want... <br />
<br />
I don't really care how I compare with a Knight at this point. <br />
<br />
I have more than enough agro for how I always wanted to play this game.<br />
<br />
I feel as though I can stand toe to toe with just about any DPS class or slower and get agro back on a very fast basis.<br />
<br />
This is the lowest 510 point ykesha aug btw. God forbid what you all look like with Anger III on two EB weapons.<br />
<br />
I consider this to be around 110% of the fix I needed to feel good about the game I want to play. (casual, just need exp and groups)<br />
<br />
Every group I have done since getting this has told me that I am a great warrior, and no one has remarked on my agro since I got the augs. (put on CHOS btw)<br />
<br />
I can keep agro vs. a elemental level rogue with no problems.<br />
<br />
I cannot wait to aug my offhand.<br />
<br />
For those of you who haven't experienced this yet. GET THEM.<br />
<br />
Tell groups that you have them. Tell people when LFG that you have them.<br />
<br />
You won't have any trouble getting groups again if people are paying attention.<br />
<br />
I never was a fan of agro lock. I don't think it is good for the game. <br />
<br />
All that being said, I have PLENTY of agro during a fight. If a mob pingpongs once during a fight, or your slower wont stand next to you when slowing, big fricking deal. <br />
<br />
I never wanted a game where shamans and enchanters could tash and slow all day long 4 times and never gain agro.<br />
<br />
Anyone else feel this way?<br />
<br />
P.S. 510 points for a ykesha aug is a FRICKING STEAL.<br />
<br />
I feel happy.<br />

I am sad for me.  :(   I have YET to even get a guk group.  On my server the only dungeon that I have ever been able to get a group in was MMC.  And then as soon as I recieved my first 510 points, I find out that the MMC anger II proc is TYPE 8!!!  ....Kill me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say that now EVERY level 60+ warrior has the ability to get the two droga weapons and put anger 3 augs into them for agro that pre-LDoN could only be obtained with Bloodfrenzy and BoC / Hategiver offhand.  Not bad considering that you can camp the droga weapons very easily or buy them in the bazaar, and that all you need to get the anger 3 augs from miraguls is just win a few miraguls missions.<br />
<br />
I mean you still have to work for this stuff, you don't get it for free, but this is something that anyone with a few friends can do. Its not like you need 30+ people to raid mobs just to get superior agro weapons anymore.</div></div><hr />

It only breaks the game MORE.  Any toon that is the desired choice for the mob to beat on being able to SECURE that choice RUINS THIS GAME.<br />
<br />
I refuse to /ooc my weapons/augs/AAs just to get a group.  Nothing we can obtain, or do brings us even close to Knight snap aggro.  Don't fool yourself into this delusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have YET to even get a guk group <br />
<br />
Couple words for you: MAKE YOUR OWN GOD DAMNED GROUPS.  And don't try and feed me that bullshit line that encs and clerics don't ever want to go to guk; that is bs and we both know it.  All classes benefit from adventures in all of the dungeons; for spells at the very least.  In fact, if you have trouble finding a cleric, grab a good dr00d; their 1460 armor comes outta guk, and trust me, they're after it.<br />
<br />
I have never gotten invited to a guk group in my entire time playing since LDoN came out.  I have, however, made more than a dozen groups on my own, and have had no trouble at all attaining the points I needed to acquire the augments I was after.   Anyone that whines about not getting into Guk enough is facing a serious laziness issue, and you shouldn't ask what is wrong with other people, merely what is wrong with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who cares about snap agro.  I surely don't.  Warrior agro is in the best state now that it has ever been.  Due to the combination of easily availible agro weapons / easily availible agro augs and the complete weaksauce melee abilities of mobs in LDoN easy mobs agro is a complete non-issue for me now.  <br />
<br />
That said I have pretty much perma-bagged my BoC and GBoS and I only pull them out if I am going to main tank on a raid or if we are going to do a hard LDoN mission.<br />
<br />
Since LDoN came out I use my slow / non-agro proc BBB 99% of the time while playing for extra dps.  It holds agro well enough to tank, and if the mobs pull off me to a wizard or something who cares.  Mobs that melee for 300s just dont scare anyone these days.  Usually in LDoN we just pull 4 at a time, I tank the main one, while the shaman offtanks the other 3 after slowing them.<br />
<br />
Now I am not saying that knights and warriors are balanced, but you are kidding yourself if you think that knight agro is what is getting them groups.  I think knights are getting groups because they tank 99% as well as us, have 95% of our hps and have all those useful spell things that we dont have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Man, if you only knew how off you are.  You have noooo idea how hard I try and get a group or try and put groups together myself.<br />
<br />
The FACT is, I play late.  Its very very hard to put a group together.  But just for you I will leave work early and go to GUK!  Huzzah for me!<br />
<br />
You need to calm down...thats it, take a deep breath.<br />
<br />
Sheesh  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I attempt to pre empt your lame excuses, and yet you still toss them forth.  You bore me.<br />
<br />
But just for you I will leave work early and go to GUK! Huzzah for me! <br />
<br />
Oh bring on the pity party!  I am playing the world's smallest violin for you; truly.  As though we all don't have a life similar to yours...<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter what time of day you play, there are people like you around.  I play all hours of the day (and night) because I have a work schedule that is incredibly erratic, and shifts constantly.  Get some friends, get some guildies, get someone for god sakes.  It's not really that hard, and I tire of hearing whiners like you.  If you play once a week because of your work schedule or RL that is FINE... just don't whine about how bad you have it, because we all go through the same stuff as you to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple things:<br />
<br />
1) Just using aug'd CHOS with Strike of Ykesha and un-agu'd red epic. My agro is superb.<br />
<br />
2) I never got a guk group. I formed every single one that got me the points I needed. Guk sucks, everyone knows this. 10 wins, 5 losses. All good groups too.<br />
<br />
3) even if you can't get guk groups, you can get anger procs from Everfrost, a place lots of classes love.<br />
<br />
4) This agro is really big agro. Teach other people not to be stupid. The amount they need to not be stupid is down to a tiny, tiny amount. This agro is enough to keep people from dying in your LDON groups EASILY. That is with only one aug, not two.<br />
<br />
5) Anyone can get this stuff. If you are super hurting for agro/camps/friends. then just get a GSOT and get either 510 guk points or 1150 Everfrost points. You will have 4 procs a minute coming off that thing and 31/30 DPS ratio. More than enough. Don't mash your taunt and keep your slower next to you, so you don't miss any swings.<br />
<br />
6) I for one think this is a great fix. Uber warriors had good EB weapons that helped patch their issues. They can aug these. They gave us GSOT, CHOS and SOTB. We can aug those. I personally wouldn't care between having a pally and a warrior on any adventure now. Having defensive discs on Named helps though :)<br />
<br />
7) Good fix IMO. I can't imagine the stick on agro you have on stuff that you are actually allowed to raid MA for 15 seconds before calling assist. You could have three or four procs in that time period now, if you are lucky.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montagor</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I placed Force of Ykesha on my Blade of War.  The added 125dd is a nice boost in dps.  The *cough* stun portion of Ykesha gets resisted 99% of the time but gets the attention needed.<br />
<br />
Once I get the points, i'm going to add Anger3 to the BoWar to see how well that works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dual wield a Great Blade of Storms (w/anger 2) and a Sword of the Bloodsworn (w/vampire talon - 50 point tap) and my aggro is the best it has ever been.  Although the tap isn't actually a good aggro mechanism it procs 3-5 times per fight in my offhand and is like having a couple hundred extra hp :)  .  When I am done with the Tak armors I need I will most likely upgrade to anger 3 and a bigger tap next...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Question:  Is there any mechanism for cashing in partial point refunds when you upgrade from say Anger2 to Anger3 or are ya just fubared on those first 510 points?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Last thought.  Although it is nice to have some buyable enraging blow weps (ie conversion via point augments) and this has basically addressed the complaints from non AOW/Cursed Cycle warriors, we still are heavily dependent on luck and the RNG for our aggro.  I did two Tak advens last night with a group of war - clr - dru - bard - mage - monk and absolutely could not keep the mob from bouncing off me to the monk 4 or 5 times per fight.  I marked it down to him having better innate or equipped haste (I have 31 percent item and Kiz gaunts) and just a better dps (GSot4W).  This was kind of like a deja vu from 3-4 months ago lol... perhaps I will make sure a non-bard haster is available next time or bump up my haste with the 36 percent MM aug.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really the last thought.  Thanks SoE.  We asked for the average war to be able to get enraging blow type weps and you gave them to us with anger2 (200 hate originally) and anger3 (300 hate originally).  Then, you beefed the values up to 400 and 600 respectively.  Although we all agree that this is a small move and we need more tuning, any progress at all is better than no progress which has been the case for a while.  I like to think the ball is now rolling.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buun<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: original anger3 hate value was 300 not 400</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have CHOS with Ykesha on it and a red epic.<br />
<br />
I also have 31 haste. I went up against an eplanes monk with GSo4W.<br />
<br />
No problems at all.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is the anger II not being enough. Ykesha works like a mofo.<br />
<br />
P.S. let me put something into perspective for those of you who still don't recognize the magnitude of these things :)<br />
<br />
Putting Anger III on a main hand weapon is the same as having another 4 red epics in your offhand from a proc perspective. LOL<br />
<br />
How would YOU like to grow 4 more offhands and put red epics in them?<br />
<br />
(and no, not DPS we talking procs here :) )<br />
