<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had been lurking these boards, and the old boards for a long time.  I have always been passive, search for shit before asking, only ask when it is very important for me to know the answer and have been unable to figure it out due to lack of comprehension on the subject or lack of time to research it.  I went to the link that someone put up on one of the threads here where a paladin was afraid of being nerfed.  I say “yay” and funny.  I decide, let me browse their board see what else is up.<br />
<br />
Can someone explain to me what the fuck is the problem with us?  Can someone explain why a damned paladin board has a sticky for SOE to look at addressing the agro issue and we do not?  Yet again, can someone explain to me why a paladin has a suggestion up on how to fix us?  I just about had a heart attack and died.  What kind of bullshit banding together is going on here?  If most people have a great idea here or most… yes I said most cause we aren’t all going to agree… why not post it as a sticky, make edits based on suggestions.  Of course keep it locked and only moderators can edit it etc… but mother of god can we please get our shit together and do what paladins seem to have done for us?<br />
<br />
Flames bite me.  I don’t see how I could be flamed aside from the fact that someone is too lazy to simply compile all this shit and put it on a sticky that says look at this SOE.  But still I encourage flames sometimes, as you’ll be surprised how much good shit people think up when they’re pissed off.  So, can we please get our shit together and do this?</div></div><hr />

Glatius and Frodlin went over there x-linked a few dozen threads from other classes, ran some numbers, said some words ect. and finally showed the problem to the paladins who then sticked the first idea they liked.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have not come to a consensus to what needs to be changed. We know it’s fucked up, we are just trying to find as a hole the best and single least game-breaking idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some suggestions have been; Adding hate to taunt, Adding hate to melee dps, Adding hate to kick/bash/slam, Nerfing spell aggro, Revamping /disc timers, Adding innate mitigation to warriors, Nerfing the hps/ac of knights, and a few other things I can't remember at the moment. <br />
<br />
There is a reason I made a poll about this you know~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And besides, I like arguing with Paladins almost as much as tanking.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taallyn</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, Glatius.  You just like baiting Goodwind :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes raaj, that would be great, i kinda thought it was the outhouse for a while, because class balance for us is a lot like spitting into the wind,  VI decided not to do that a long time ago.</div></div><hr />
