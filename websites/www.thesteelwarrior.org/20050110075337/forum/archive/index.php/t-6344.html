<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">32000hp each<br />
Both use Dragon Roar:<br />
<br />
Fear(1) <br />
Recast Time: 36<br />
Resist: Magic Resist Adjust -150 <br />
AE Range 300 Interruptable: Yes <br />
Short Buff Box: No Target Type: PB AE <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental <br />
Duration: 1 ticks @L1 to 3 ticks @L3  <br />
<br />
Nagafen uses Lava Breath<br />
<br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 500 <br />
2:  Cancel Magic(9) <br />
Recast Time: 12 <br />
Resist: Fire Range: 300 <br />
AE Duration 5 AE Range 200 <br />
Interruptable: Yes Target Type: Targeted AE <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental <br />
<br />
Lady Vox uses Frost Breath<br />
<br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 500 <br />
2:  Cancel Magic(9) <br />
Recast Time: 12 <br />
Resist: Cold Range: 300 <br />
AE Duration 5 AE Range 200 <br />
Interruptable: Yes Target Type: Targeted AE (pretty sure it's point blank)<br />
Spell Type: Detrimental <br />
<br />
Vox also has an annoying habit of complete healing herself and nuking. Best to have enchanters mana sieve her early so she can't cast.<br />
<br />
Nagafen hits for 96 min 255 max, Vox for 225 max, not sure what her min is.<br />
<br />
7 day spawn time +/- 24 hours<br />
<br />
As far as strategy goes remember that the longer the dragon lives, the more AEs that go off and the more healing you have to do. Group heals work good, but since they have so few hp just burn them down.<br />
<br />
I think that's all acurate, been a long time since I fought either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zugs Slugs</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is off the top of my head so i may not be totally accurate. I haven't done Vox or Naggy in over a year or 2.<br />
<br />
1. 32k each<br />
2. Vox uses a cold base 500 DD, 2 point dispell, and fear. She also Cheals which is very annoying. Naggy uses the same Fear, DD, dispell except it is fire based. I think their fears are magic based.<br />
3. They hit something like 250 max.<br />
4. (all is forgotten about strat sorry)<br />
5. 7 days I think<br />
<br />
Make sure the warrior has like full FH armor and a couple GOOD weapons. Try and get a bard in there for resist songs also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulenticer</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest bestest advice I can give you on these two is to not fight them at their spawn points. Use walls to prevent ae damage on those that don't need to get hit (clerics+patch healers). I pull vox to zone in, keep the force small (10 or less) so she can blow all her mana before she gates, or just have chanters mana sieve. I don't even clear to her, just invis in and train her to zone. The giants will come first and by the time you finish them all off she'll come in last. Her body has a harder time traveling thru walls then the giants. You have to train her past the king room slowly at first, once you get past that you can go straight for the zone. By all means have a 65 cleric as main healer if you want, she is only going to banish the cleric outside, by the time you get back you can get off another heal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given the current collision detection problems, with mobs warping all over Norrath, I don't think pulling Vox to ZI is a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulenticer</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that mobs don't summon unless damaged I doubt you will have any problems. I think the bigger problem is the fabled mobs in the way. Maybe you would but I doubt there are many people that would pull a summoning mob with a 1k+ nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fabled king thex IV? he hits for 170ish but has crap for hp and doesn't nuke. Still a green con at 65, plus he's not always up :)</div></div><hr />
