<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dravok</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I would just say hi to all the other warriors on this forum.  I'm just starting into Everquest again after taking a hiatus from the game after moving into my house.  I thought I would start up three different classes (tank, caster, and damage dealer) just to get the whole feeling the game has to offer.  I know it is probably best to stick to one character and I will do this.  I just thought I would try this out to decide which I like the best and stick to one while messing around with the others when I can't pick up a group.<br />
<br />
For damage dealer I decided to go with a half elf rogue.  For my tank, I want to go with a human warrior but I had a couple of questions before I start.  I know it doesn't really matter which race you pick but I thought I would ask anyway if humans make decent warriors.  Also since they can't bash without a shield, how difficult is it to keep bash and dual wield skill up?  Since they are nightblind, does this make life hard for them?<br />
<br />
Before I leave, I was also wondering what would be a nice race/class combination for a caster class.  I was thinking of an intelligence class and was thinking of maybe wizard but if you guys have better suggestions I am open to ideas.<br />
<br />
Talk to you guys later and I hope to be welcomed with open arms and pints of ale  :) .</div></div><hr />

If that is how you want to play your Warrior do it. I made my human warrior in 1999 and I still don't regret it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it's just the people i've seen/grouped with, but too many large race warriors use kick instead of slam.  I've found that slam is tremendously useful.  It can mean the difference between a particularly annoying caster mob successfully getting off a CH or gate versus an interrupt, courtesy of slam stun.<br />
<br />
In the end, however, it's your character, play the game to have fun and to hell with everyone else.  Welcome to the boards, as a relative newbie to EQ myself, I've found the information here to be tremendously helpful.  Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

It's not very hard to keep Bash up with Dual Weilding if you are not a big race, its called Ghetto Bash, you swap out your secondary weapon for a shield, bash, and swap back, it wont take even a second and you are bashing and dual weilding :).<br />
<br />
Race is a matter of preference and choose what makes you happy :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Freeport always was the center of Norrath since the early days; but with port stones now it really don't matter much where ya start; any city is about 10 seconds and a click away</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's right, it's not an issue now as there are a bunch fo cheap and useful lightsource items around.<br />
But it once was a real irritation to my first Barb warrior, lol. Backing down the cave to Blackburrow, getting smacked by gnolls you can't see...grrrrr.<br />
<br />
There's a thread somewhere (tavern?) in which I asked about what alts people here have. Responses were all over the place; I concluded that there wasn't much correlation between a person with a warrior mindset and any give alt class. Wizards are fun because you can, as Wandor put it once &quot;get shit dead fast.&quot;<br />
If you like tradeskills, make a shaman or an enchanter with the same race/deity as your warrior (hmmm...humans can't be shamans, though). Or, make a completely different race/deity and start in a different cities, because it's kind of fun to learn a city/newbie zone with a new character.<br />
Note that warriors and rogues are not at all very efficient soloists after a while. Wizards probably do a bit better, but you might consider making a class that you can use to solo for those times when you want a change of pace from grouping or need to efficiently farm something.</div></div><hr />

Like it was posted above, it isn't to hard to keep bash up. Play the race that you want, it is your enjoyment. I still get alot of crap in /gu abour my race. I also agree with another poster above, make alts of different races and explore, learn those newbie zones. I personally play a Dwarf Warrior and a Barbarian Shaman as my mains, but I have 12 alts of all different races and classes. That damn Shar Vhal is the sucketh of all newbie zones though, weel it is right there with Neriak.<br />

<br />
Qeynos owns. <br />
<br />
Good noob money from drops (like 1-2 gold for most drops, AND plague rat tails  :D ), Good all-around noob zones (Blackburrow, Qeynos Hills), and the Steel Warriors, what more could you want?</div></div><hr />
