My magelo profile is the link above. I'm happy with that gear for the most part, however I do have one problem that I can't see my way past: low dex. Right now, my unbuffed dex is only 145, and as a warrior I kind of *need* to proc to hold agro.<br />
<br />
I'm unguilded right now, racing to 62 to get nd3, area taunt and pe to raise my hp up to snuff, and then I'm hoping to join a decent raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Is there an easy way to upgrade my dex, with the gear I have right now? I'm looking for single group encounters really for the moment. When I do join a raiding guild, what dex upgrades would you suggest then?<br />
<br />
Also, if there's anything glaring that I could upgrade right now in the hp department, I'd love to hear suggestions. My budget isn't too big, I could probably raise around 20-30k but that'd the limit for me. Thanks!<br />

Focus is +70 DEX and Avatar is +100/140 depending on the flavor. If you are going to spend plats, go for more HP/STA/AC, forget everything else.</div></div><hr />

At about your level, and thinking the same thing you are, I blew 2 aa points on dex(doh).  Made zero noticable difference.  Dex and it's effect on proc rate are small, tho it is there, and worthwhile.  HoS/FoS + Boon of Garue(sp?) = max dex anyway.  AC/STA/HP's aregoing to make a much more noticable difference in your ability.  At higher end, your gear will have more dex(as a side affect of just more stats on better gear), and you will get the buffs needed at raid to get it maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You would need to add somewhere on the order of 100 dex points to even notice a difference in your proc rate.  You're not going to do that with your gear without completely gimping yourself.<br />
<br />
Be unconcerned with dex....it makes no difference in day to day life.</div></div><hr />
