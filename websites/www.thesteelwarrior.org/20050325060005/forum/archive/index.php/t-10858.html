Absolutely HRUGE patch coming up.  For the most part it sounds positive and they fixed a bunch of bugs.  <br />
<br />
Warrior highlights:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
*Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was slightly increased. <br />
*Battle Shout - Rage cost reduced. <br />
*Bloodrage - Health cost reduced. <br />
*Heroic Strike - Damage increased. <br />
*Parry - Moved to level 6. <br />
*Thunder Clap - Now causes Physical damage instead of Nature damage; damage increased; duration increased with each new rank. Improved Sunder Armor - Now decreases rage cost by 1/1/1. Improved Thunder Clap - Now decreases rage cost by 1/1/2. <br />
*Execute - Full rage is no longer consumed when the ability does not hit. <br />
*Overpower - Should now be usable when a special attack is dodged. <br />
*Fixed a bug where rage was not being generated when normal melee attacks were parried, dodged, and blocked. <br />
*Charge has been improved so it will work through doorways and won't path you through an entire dungeon. <br />
*Sweeping Strikes bug fixed. It will hit more reliably and show up in combat log correctly. <br />
*Added a visual to Sword Specialization &quot;proc&quot; that will now show up in the combat log as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
The non-warrior highlights are the new engineering robot (sweet!), the new instance, the level caps on BRS/Strat/Scholo, the raid bug fix, and the raid quest fix.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm disappointed that caps were put in place for some of the instances.  Yes, people should complete these the hard way as it was intended.  But because of the use of raids, some of the less-utilized classes were able to join in and now I'm thinking the entire thing will come down to optimal setting. *sigh*</div></div><hr />

I really like the change to Sunder Armor, completely solves the stacking issue while making the talent somewhat useful.  Will be interesting to see how TC is now too.<br />
