<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently my level 63 war has about 6800 hp buffed, this is without ND3.  I would post a magelo but I can't access it from work. Anyway, I know of slots that need upgrading and have items in mind. My question is am I heading in the right direction.  With just some quick calculations I figure I'll be around 8k at 65 with minimum AA's.  Is this suitable for exp groups in tier 3 planes or should I really bust ass to get the other gear, which might keep me from leveling for a while.  Opinoins welcome, A-holes not.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*shrug* I tanked  HoH &quot;safe hall&quot; at 55 with under 6k hit points, and seen a 6k warrior, pally, and SK do HoH basement just fine.   Level and AC are going to come into play here too, but I'd wager you'd be fine. <br />
<br />
Really no way to find out other than just going and doing, but you're about even with my now-64 warrior in terms of hps (also no AA's done yet) and I wouldn't blink an eye for tanking HoH with an appropriate group. I've also tanked some harder stuff in Drunder and didn't skip a beat.  I haven't done BoT yet, so can't speak for there. <br />
<br />
My guess is, with the info provided, you'd probably be just fine for xp'ing.  Is 8k hps better? Sure.  But you really only need consistant survivability for slows and CHeals to land, and near 7k is enough from my personal experience.</div></div><hr />
