<br />
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=14-121-513&amp;depa=1 <br />
<br />
Problem is x600 sounds made up to me because ATI does not sell an x600 or an x400 card from their site, I have also heard rumors that these chips can be flashed to open up the &quot;sleeping&quot; pipelines with great success.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I am a diehard ATI fan and I am spending 240$ at most, any thoughts on that card or any other on newegg? the card looks about right but I have never heard of the x600 card or x400 as an offical card so I am a bit reluctant... the advantage over the 9800 is that it takes less power, produces less heat and has a higher core speed... from what I could find on google anyhow.<br />
<br />
Also I am looking for a stable sound card my old creative labs, live! card is getting quite old and starting to show its age with slowing down the faster components of my computer.<br />
<br />
Anyhow thanks!</div></div><hr />

The &quot;X&quot; series of ATI cards are PCI Express.  You'll need to change motherboard to be able to use this card.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damnit....<br />
<br />
I thought the X was just because they did not wish to bump the product number so they went with X in place of 10<br />
<br />
I guess 9800 XT and some extra fans it is because I am really happy with my MB and CPU.<br />
<br />
I have the MB's box, what should I check for to see if I can use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bourbon</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't.  PCI Express is a new bus elminating both AGP and PCI.  If you have an AGP slot or your MB is older then about 3 months then you don't have PCI Express.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm, so to upgade to that type of motherboard I would also have to upgrade alot of my older cards (sound, USB 2, RAID, pretty much a whole new build?)<br />
<br />
Well I did plan to build a super PC in the future once I start working more hours... I guess I have something to shoot for *grins* but for now I will just get a graphics card for my current rig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cronos</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually with the current boards you can still use pci cards since most of them have a few pci slots still apart from the x16 and x1 pci express slots<br />
another thing to consider is that amd's platform won't have pci express till nforce4 or equivalent come out, which atm is announced for Q1 2005<br />
so for pci express atm you'll have to go with intels brand new chipset (that's already been recalled twice)<br />
<br />
regarding the X600XT, don't get it<br />
it's terrible<br />
it's basically a little faster than a 9600XT for the price of a 9800Pro, which is a lot faster than an X600XT<br />
<br />
imo I'd prolly wait till the new platform has all the bugs worked out or if absolutely necessary get a new videocard (if your cpu is not too old)</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;PC Check pls. I have about 375$ to spend and want to know what upgrades to go after first.....&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You read me wrong, what I mean is PCI Express is the next evolution of the AGP/PCI slot.  Yes, like with ISA, PCI will remain on boards for some time for legacy devices but will eventually go the way of the doodoo and be completely replaced  by PCI Express which will be replaced by the next iteration of the technology.<br />
<br />
Which all boils down to the original point in that he isn't using an X series ATI card with his current motherboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have a 2.6 p4, decent cooling, 1 gig of ram 1 gig FSB, USB 1 and 2, creative labs live sound card, 9600 pro 128 and some other piddly crap that is not important heh.<br />
<br />
I've decided on http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=14-161-109&amp;depa=1<br />
<br />
It will suit my needs and it comes with a game I was going to buy anyhow (HL2.. a coupon for it anyhow)<br />
<br />
but that brings up a new problem, I do not think my power supply has the juice for it.... I know nothing about PS brands... coolmaster... cooler masters... thermal take (I think this is a good brand) and a bunch of others... I'd also like the power supply to move some air (and act as another fan) for my system if possible... I had seen a few models that say they do so<br />
<br />
Can I get a recommendation for that?<br />
<br />
( this is similer to my case if you need to know by the way http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=11-129-124&amp;depa=1 )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bourbon</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now I would go with the OCZ Powerstream line http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProduct.asp?submit=manufactory&amp;catalog=58&amp;manufactory=1550&amp;DEPA=0&amp;sortby=14&amp;order=1 they are the shit.  Gives you 3 power rail LED's on the power supply that tell you if the rails are within tolerance and allows you to adjust them if they aren't (Mainly for heavily loaded systems, but a very cool feature none the less).  These supplies are built like brick shit houses.  If you are lookin to save a few bucks, go with an Enermax.</div></div><hr />

They're  both products running on basically the same core. Personally I'd either wait for an AGP  6600GT or buy a whole new pcie system with a 6600gt right now  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There might be an improvement if OoW stresses the video card more than the older expansions.  Prior to OoW the frame rates were mostly CPU limited for video cards over a certain caliber (like a GeForce4 Ti4800+).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've looked into it, the 9800 pro is worth it and if I get the R360 I can flash it up to XT and open up 4 more pipelines...<br />
<br />
I think I will go with that power supply but how does the rail thing work? you mentioned adjusting it?<br />
<br />
(reason I know I need a new PS is because my fan RPM are dropping down to almost unacceptable levels when I added a tablet for photoshop work, but if I took off the laser mouse it went back up to acceptable levels... so I think I have pulled off as much power as I can with this thing )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krowbar</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you considered running FRAPS and overclocking? Check the frame rates in a test zone with the 9600 and try overclocking it and check the frame rates again. If you dont see an improvement, maybe the CPU could use an upgrade/overclock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While the 6600GT is a good card in pre-release testing it won't be in AGP format till late October - November at the earliest, plenty of time for ATI to come with a competative card, and as you'll notice from his earlier post Gerick is a die hard ATI fan.  Also, if you are puting down the money for a whole new system and building it around the graphics card, why build it around a mid-range card?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't OC the cpu, its running at 50 cel (122 F) so doing so might put it in danger... I could also be seeing poor preformance because I am running on borderline power failure.<br />
<br />
As for the build, this one is going to last me for 4 or 5 months while I build up the cash for a dream computer, my plan is to use this one as well after I build the new one... can always two box right? heheh<br />
<br />
( the &quot;dream computer&quot; will be everything from total imersion cooling to the newest componenets )<br />
<br />
(thanks for all the suggestions by the way, that powersupply looks really good)<br />
<br />
Reason I hate Nvidia is the last 2 cards I got from them had the fans go out, and they were from differnt stores... not to mention their drivers have always given me grief on all four of the boxes I have ever made, and I tend to keep around my older mechines and continue to use em (so do not worry about me wasting parts heh, I also have a family that loves everquest that would love the spare parts)<br />
<br />
Also with that monster of a fan I can OC the card using rage3d adjustments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah I noticed he's an ATI fan, but I prefer nvidia if for no other reason than the fact they have better linux drivers. In addition, they seem to be in bed with SOE for whatever reason. For the last year they've been getting spanked, but they're new line seems pretty competitive finally, and it's at a reasonable price point. I don't buy 500 dollar video cards or CPU's, I just don't see the RvR in it. First round mid-range introductions are where it's at.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you're deadset on upgrading now, and only doing your video card, the 9800pro has been and continues to be the AGP sweet spot I think so you're doing well there. <br />
<br />
I'm one to talk though, the last video card I bought was a gf3-ti200.</div></div><hr />
