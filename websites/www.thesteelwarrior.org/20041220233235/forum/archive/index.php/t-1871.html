Anyone got RF3 parsed to see if its worth it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its worth it, also make sure that your dex is at what ever your're caped at.  That'll help your flurry along.  Also having ferocity and PB both increase your chance to flurry because they increase your chance to get a double atk thus increasing your chance for triple ect.  All the skills build off each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
normally i flurry 1-2 times per xp mob. ocassionally you will get lucky and double flurry within an attack round, think most ive done on an xp mob is 4 flurries.<br />
<br />
fun stuff, only shame is you have to make a hotkey so everyone else knows you are flurrying, everyone should do this !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please prove how your dexterity influences your set chance to triple attack and your set chance to flurry on a successful triple.<br />
<br />
Proc rate?  Maybe.  Flurry rate?  I'm not seeing how.</div></div><hr />

Too many things in EQ have been myths for far too long because people blindly believed that stats influenced X or Y.  I won't accept that anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NPC flurry is a proc.  That doesn't prove that PC flurry is the same, but I wouldn't be suprised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously it's a proc, it's a random effect that goes off X% of the time on successful triple attacks.  Here's what i'm saying.<br />
<br />
Level 1 of Flurry grants you X% chance to flurry off a triple attack.<br />
Level 2 of Flurry grants you Y% chance to flurry off a triple attack.<br />
Level 3 of Flurry grants you Z% chance to flurry off a triple attack<br />
<br />
How does dex increase X, Y, and Z?  I'm willing to bet that it's not a parsable difference, if there is any at all.  Dex improves proc rates on weapons by less than 1% per 100 points...I wouldn't call that &quot;affecting&quot; proc rates.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for slight thread derail but I have a quick question:<br />
<br />
Is this what the AAS do:<br />
<br />
Ferocity = extra +% on double attack<br />
Punishing Blade = extra +% on triple attack<br />
Flurry: = % chance of extra 2 attacks <br />
Amidexterity = extra +% on dual wield<br />
<br />
If so for dual wield is this right?:<br />
<br />
Attack Main (check to hit) if yes 1x<br />
2. &lt;then&gt; Check double attack main (yes = 2x) if yes<br />
3. &lt;then&gt; Check triple attack main (yes = 3x) if yes<br />
4. &lt;then&gt; Check flurry (yes = 5x) <br />
<br />
Check Dual Wield (if main succesful)<br />
1. &lt;then&gt; Check double attack (yes = 2x off hand)<br />
No triple on off hand <br />
No flurry on off hand<br />
<br />
Sorry for obvious question but if this is the relationship isnt ferocity the best AA first?  Seems to be the core that gets you down the logic tree more often.<br />
<br />
Anyway like I said a slight derail and I apologize in advance if this has been covered before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes Dini covered above I believe.</div></div><hr />

where are ppl coming up with the idea PB is more triple attack? its just free swing as far as i can tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use to think flurry was just off triple attacks as well, but it would be impossible to double flurry in a single combat round and ive seen myself do it. so either the description is wrong or luclin flurry can go off any hit and pop flurry can just proc off a triple attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten quads with a 2 hander so punishing blade is in addition to triple attack.  It could result in what looks like a triple attack if you get a double attack and triple attack fails but PB fires off.  If you have flurry you can get 6 attacks with a 2 hander if all of them fire off.  2 for double attack, 1 for triple attack, 1 for punishing blade, 2 more for flurry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can flurry off your off hand it would result in the same situation.  I know that when useing two weapons my flurries go through the roof opposed to 2h, 4x to 5x more.  Possible that they check on offhand and have main hand flurry if successful?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksar_Overlord</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When using a BoC in primary and a HG in offhand, i've never seen more than 2 blunt attacks on a succesful flurry. That suggests me there is no flurry from the offhand, the description is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like Brutal, my experiences have shown much more commonality with Flurry while dual wielding as well rather than when using a 2-Hander, but after trying two different type of weapons, I was able to confirm no attacks during Flurry were happening from my offhand.<br />
<br />
I think it's simply a matter of most 1-Handers using in primary are going to be a much lower delay than a 2-Hander, thus you'll just have more attack rounds and more chances for a Triple and Flurry saving throw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flurry affects main hand only, with full offensive aa I am able to flurry and connect for up to 6 hits with my Blade of War, it's rare but it does happen, PB is an extra hit, Flurry is an extra two hits.  I do not beleive they stack however, IE PB cannot help trigger flurry, only a successful triple can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It'd seem most logical flurry only goes off on triples.  Otherwise if PB goes off on a triple do you say that's not really a triple attack because you attacked four times?</div></div><hr />
