Anyone have any idea what the point behind this is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, yeah, I forgot about that one. I've been meaning to ask here myself. i can't think of any use for. The range makes it useless for puling/tagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, if thats self targettable that will Help in breaking Mez.  Like fighting the ireblind Imp in fear for example.  Even if its not you can have a few warriors group close and target each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its the Tome from the tutorial, the first tome you get as a baby melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll have to pick it up just to have it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm attempting to picture a bunch of warriors throwing rocks at each others' heads in an effort to break mez.<br />
Lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i recall someone saying it had a stun effect so u can use it to interrupt. not sure as not tried it out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure the range is 50 feet, much like those shattering hammers your predecessors used to try and use to &quot;pull&quot; with, or those crappy shurikens monks had to use waaaay back in the day.<br />
<br />
Meaning, yes, it's supposed to be a FREE newbie melee pulling tool.<br />
<br />
Who knows if that's how it works, but that's how it was intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's possible that the range on this thing is 50 feet.  You have to be very close to the target, much closer than Incite.<br />
 <br />
Also, unless you are on a PVP server you won't be able to break someone else's mez with this thing.  Can you use tomes while mezzed? I haven't been mezzed in a very long time and didn't have any useful discs last time I was, so I don't know.<br />
 <br />
If this has a stun component it's the most stupid way of distracting a caster I've heard of.  Hey, don't cast that spell on me Mr. level 70 caster mob, I'm gonna throw a rock at you!!<br />
 <br />
In summary, this is useless, you could use it to break mez to make sure you break it instead of waiting for a hit, but who cares about that?<br />
 <br />
Oh, and we aren't the only ones to get this, all pure melee's get this tome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite is 100 just like CH...<br />
<br />
Put a 150 range on that, and i would use it all the time.<br />
With incite i stopped using bows 100 range is enough for most pulls.<br />
I'd LOVE a 150 agro tool for &quot;medium distance pulling&quot;.<br />
<br />
Inciting a Red Kyv in Qvic can sometimes be ... Funky</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said, I'd &quot;heard&quot; that it was supposed to be. And that it was supposed to be basically a free pulling tool for newbies. If it isn't then obviously I either heard wrong, OR, SoE screwed something up.<br />
<br />
Now it's likely I heard wrong. But, what's funny about this is, it's also JUST AS LIKELY they screwed up! Hahahahahahaha.<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it has a stun component that stops mobs from casting, I'd use it even if it is stupid, as long as it's not linked to more valuable discs. I'm going to have to get this and try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does not have a stun component, imagine the crying on PoN if warriors would get a instant stun with a re-use time of 10 seconds at an endurance cost of 10...<br />
It's on the same timer as incite btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No stun? Dang it. Thought I was going to be Uber.<br />
I hate it when the possibility of Uberness slips through my fingers like that.</div></div><hr />

lol, i felt from my chair on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh is there a graphic associated with it?  Would dig seeing 10 warrs throwing stones at a boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">guesss this is our endless quiver. it is usable at melee range though.<br />
<br />
although kiteing firebeteles for a hour or so at lvl one is fun.<br />
<br />
looks like the old magic nuke, and you make a kick motion like animation.<br />
<br />
iirc it worked around corners unlike incite or bow. will have to re check that though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fannon</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the point was to have a reasonable ability for a level 1 to have (oh look! a rock!) to familiarize them with Combat Abilities/Endurance Cost.<br />
<br />
Kinda like the spell hybrids get.... a whopping 5 point heal for 10mana.... my level 1 pally I made had a whopping 40 mana with the twink gear I gave her and over 200hps.  DO the math. :)<br />
<br />
As far as finding it in PoK....  1 - 2 free points of damage every 10 secs is actually a good deal for a low level character that isn't PLing.  Now, imagine if you were level 6 and unable to get into tutorial zone to get it.   <br />
<br />
They should provide a way to get the charm, too.... 5 to your major stats, 10hp/mana/end.  First charms you can get are the 1-5 to 1 stat only in LDoN dungeons.... and you have to be at least 20 to get them....  My level 1 monk got a 5Str/5Sta/5Agi/5Dex/10HP/10END charm for free in tutorial.  I would put that on some of my mid level alts too as I lack the motivation to camp LoY with my alts.  The charm slot just sits empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried out the tutorial a week or two ago and it is really great.  I wish that had existed when I started, although the old tutorial wasn't bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fannon</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just tested this against Aten Ha Ra and PoFire minis.  Lands 9/10 times.  Hilarious.  Can't wait to kill shot Fennin Ro with it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The range is way too short to use on Fennin.   It's about half the range of incite, it greay out incite/bellow.   It's mostly worthless, except for good screenshots (I got a killshot in Uqua last night with it).   The myth that it interrupts casting is just that.... it can be shelved along with all the other great EQ myths, like a 1250AC &quot;softcap' or &quot;hardcap&quot; in Velious, like stun aggro nerfs, fungi nerfs, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone done any agro tests?  I mean, does it generate any agro at all?  At least any that can be measured?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">none</div></div><hr />
