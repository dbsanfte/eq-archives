<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyway besides doing the ring quests over again and killing the guards around and tmax himself to get my Dain upped? and what is the minimum faction level to start ring 9...<br />
<br />
knew i never should have gone on that raid =(<br />
<br />
Zaos Planar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roehm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shawl quests give +Dain hits too.<br />
<br />
Beyond that not much else will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's also a pick-sharpening quest in Thurgadin that gives +dain faction, but it's a tiny hit.  A guy on my server got his dain faction up by doing it something like 1400 times once :p  Takes a small piece of velium to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">easiest is to kill tmax. also some of tmax's guards give dain faction.<br />
<br />
the quests take too long but if you have the time and dont have access to tmax you can do them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tag along on a KT raid or 2, thats huge faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bounx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I completed the Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring quest (9th Ring) on Monday. Dain Frostreaver IV /CONned apprehensive to me when I did it. All I did was the ring quests to my knowledge that resulted in faction adjustments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only need dubious to turn in 9th ring (thats what I had)<br />
Armor turn ins also give faction, so you can farm arena, do turn ins for any armor, it's an expensive way to do it though.<br />
Rings, shawls best way other than tmax and surrounding guards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Do the pick sharpening quest over and over. I was at max scowl and did a bunch of rings/shawls and even had a couple KT guard faction hits and was still scowl. After 500 sharpenings I hit dubious. It's not a horrible quest and the exp was visible at 62 :)</div></div><hr />
