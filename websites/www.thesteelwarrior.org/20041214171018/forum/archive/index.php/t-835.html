For tanking, of course i use 2hs for some uber mobs. But for most mobs, dual wielding is enough to tank stuff. Hope they balance the melee difference btwn 2hs and 1handers soon..</div></div><hr />

It's hard to imagine why you need so much aggro but sometimes it's easier to have more aggro than you possibly need than not quite enough.  There are always some overenthuastic wizards out there, after all...</div></div><hr />

If i need agro on raids I still use bloodfrenzy/boc over a 2hander (dont have a BoC yet) up into Tier 3 PoP (Tactics) toward Vallon/Tallon Zek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CompDorf</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in PoP, it's all about awsome 2 handers, for normal grinding in PoV it's not big deal on either, but when mobs are hitting for 1600 and up, riposites hold alot more value and 2hs gets you less riposites from the mob. It honestly depends on the situation and the mob you're fighting</div></div><hr />

Umm...yes, if one is a Bloodfrenzy. Bloodfrenzy main hand, BoC offhand is more aggro than a blade of war.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following have been my experience(rough estimates):<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy 3 procs/min (in primary)<br />
BoC 2 procs/min (in primary)<br />
BoW 2 procs/min (in primary)<br />
<br />
As an example, on our last Xegony fight MT had 93 EB procs in 50 mins wielding BoW.<br />
<br />
On some other tests on a dummy mob with bloodfrenzy primary and non-proccer offhand, we got 45 EB procs in 15 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a tougher time stealing aggro( rogue) from a warrior using blade of war than one wielding 2 eb items or 1 eb item and a ivory hilted cleaver or any random PoP weapon.  On mold dropping mobs or gods, I'm around 2175 attack with the usual attack buffs and if I'm always getting aggro and dieing from the duel wielders whereas the blade of war tanks are keeping their aggro.  EB + dps &gt; 2 eb imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well assuming you're using Taunt, when it is successful you basically steal all the other warrior's Enraging Blow procs as well.  Since clearly BoW will outaggro any 2 EBs on just ratio and taunt will steal whatever extra EBs the other has got, it's easier to steal it that way.  The reverse is not true (2EB cannot outaggro a BoW unless you get more procs than the BoW).  You're not exactly procing every 5 seconds even with 2 EBs so it takes a while for EB weapons to reestablish aggro once you steal the EB edge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume you're talking about aggro on raids Phantron.  I'm not sure what you're getting at though.  Why would multiple warriors be using taunt on a boss mob unless you're talking about tank switching when defensive runs out or the MT dies.  That's pretty much been trivial since AE Taunt.  MT dies, you swap in your highest aggro weapons and taunt.  If you get aggro you go happily on your way, if you don't you AE taunt and then go happily on your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From all the previous post i think we all can agree that BoW and its insane dps (considered you have the right aa's as well) are enough to outweigh the added EB procs from dual wielding EB weapons.<br />
<br />
But back to the original posters question I'd say<br />
<br />
2h EB &gt; dual wielding EB &gt; one EB &gt; no EB weapon for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me MTing with BoW .... <br />
Sometimes the BF/BoC war outagroes me and goes splat.<br />
<br />
Him MTing with BF/BoC....<br />
Sometimes i with BoW do outagro him and go splat.<br />
<br />
BoW agro is INSANE since it barely relies on procs (hail godly DPS)<br />
BF/BoC are probably great, but rely a lot on procs.<br />
<br />
I'd say BoW &gt; ALL ,  unless BF/HG proc rate are insane (only had a BoC)<br />
And its proc rate was CRAPPASTIC at best. <br />
BoW proc rate is very random, but i dont need it as bad as BoC/SoD.<br />
<br />
DPS &gt; ALL  . Thats why we loose agro. We got no DPS.<br />
BoW changes that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not talking about bosses.  There are any number of reasons why you need to taunt even on trash mobs.  Someone might've gone low HP and you, not knowing that's what happened, try to taunt to get the aggro back.  Some wizard might decide to drop 2 SoS in a row.  Sometimes you simply can't be sure who the mob is hitting and it's better to try to taunt it and get its attention and find out another warrior had it already then watching a cleric go splat (yes you can assist, but if a cleric's name shows up, then he's probably going to die before you reacquire the target and taunt it off him).  BoW is much better at holding aggro after a successful taunt than 2 EBs since BoW does not rely on procs to get aggro.  Yes 2 EBs will eventually overtake the BoW but over the long run both weapons should have no problem holding aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recent post found that if you have a dex of 180ish you get the same proc rate with BF/primal as you do with BF/BoC. Of course, alot of us have 305 dex anyway.<br />
<br />
And BF is still an awesome weapon - I did take aggro from someone with a BoW and I wasn't even trying. I had a SoD in the offhand.<br />
<br />
But like someone pointed out, BF/BoC combo depends on procs. BF procs a hell of a lot - its nothing for me to get 3-5 in 15 seconds and in that case - its a good day.<br />
<br />
But then again, I have gone as long a a minute without a proc.<br />
<br />
BF/BoC is also fast and hits often - so you lose less in &quot;aggro decay&quot; - and their ratios do produce a good DPS.<br />
<br />
BoW on the other hand creats alot of aggro just with DPS alone. The proc is gravy. Certainly you can lose aggro to 3 BF procs in a row - but from my observations its better overall for reliable aggro since DPS&gt;BF/BoC and has a nice proc rate to fall back on.<br />
<br />
Finally, If you have a BF then your doing well. If you have a BoW then you are doing well. If you have both then you are pretty lucky.<br />
<br />
For me - if I get a BoW I'm bagging my BF and saving it for when I need a bane in one hand. BF is too much of an aggro stealer to use when not MTing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speed is pretty much a nonfactor when dealing with high end weapons.  Anything that's at least 40 delay or faster can hold aggro just fine unless someone wants to drop a big nuke in between your first swing (but in that case even the fastest weapons would not have helped).  It's not like there are 200/100 weapons out there to use anyway.<br />
<br />
On the high end, all that matters is the weapon's ratio and what procs it has for aggro.</div></div><hr />
