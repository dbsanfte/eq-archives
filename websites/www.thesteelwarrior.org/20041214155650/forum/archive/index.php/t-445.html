<br />
Yeah you guessed it correctly....here comes that silly half elf warrior newbie with yet another question.<br />
<br />
Well the day has finnaly come where I am using my Sarnak Battle Shield to bash'um reeaall goodz. Today in my travels I noticed that 30-45% I bashed a mob (Orc Centurions) as the intial first attack they were stunned. <br />
<br />
I said &quot;SELF...I wonder if this happens in the higher level mob encounters?&quot; Soon I wil be approaching the time when I can weild two weapons. Here comes the question.<br />
<br />
At duel weild time should I just put the shield in the pack and let it get dusty and just forget about bash? <br />
<br />
Or should I use it (bash anda shield) pending specific situations?<br />
<br />
Does the bash skill continue to stun the mobs at a nice rate  in higher encouters 25+ mobs or does it over time decrease effectiveness as the mobs get harder?<br />
<br />
Should I just duel wield as well as continuing to interchange out various weapon styles to keep up all weapons skills (1HS, 1HB, 2HS, 2HB)?<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never parsed it to see if there's a noticable DPS change, but the stun component is very handy, and doing it whenever I'm MT means I'm never surprised by a caster.  To answer your question, the stun part does seem to get fewer and farther between in face-on melee from what I've seen, but I can generally stop a running critter in its tracks for a second or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bash(slam) is wicked good.  one of the most useful things I have found for it isnt interrupting casters(though thats its best feature) but stunning runners while i kill them.<br />
<br />
I dont have a wep that procs a snare, so slamming em is good for when the cleric I am duoing with forgets to root :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarix</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usefull for when you are MA at raids and are breking mezz fast to keep the kill rate up. The stun give u some extra aggro or maybe extra time to get aggro after mez break, not sure which.<br />
<br />
On mezzed mobs i hit taunt, bash then attack on. I've noticed if i skip the bash mob will often ping away to the enchanter/shaman etc. However if i do bash 95% of the tiem the mobs will stick to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to be 55+ to kickstun though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you started a large charater then you could use slam instead of kick/shield bash.  Yep, shield bash will be your friend until higher levels and I guess that shield bash is still better at higher levels but I dont see many shorties using shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Ghetto-bashing&quot; has always been a mark of exceptional small-race warriors.  I wish I could find the website with the tutorial that Ruatha put together way back when.  Kailyn had it up on a website but she hasn't posted anywhere in a long time that I have seen.<br />
<br />
Bash is great, I use it constantly for pulling, breaking mez, interrupting spells, and stopping runners.  My favorite is pulling though, something about running up and bonking the mob on the head and watching him stand there going duuuuuuuh for a few seconds while I run back to camp just cracks me up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never bothered with the ghetto bashing thing. To this day my bash skill is still 0, and I doubt it'll ever go higher. From the experiences of others on this board it still sounds like shields are useless aside from maybe improving your magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've saved many groups with a well timed ghetto bash to stop a gater.  Some places it will work, and some it won't, but to completely ignore the skill is worse than ignorance.  There are uses for everything we can do, even if a few of the skills are somewhat limited in scope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever heard of kick? Who's ignorant now? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you're 55+ your kick automatically stuns anyway.   Pre-55, most of the mobs you're fighting at those levels won't gate and it's probably better that you have a real plan (stun or whatever) then relying on the warrior stunning them anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Certainly I use kick.  But pre-55 many mobs *do* gate, and if a stun is resisted, it's nice to know that I've done my part as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash(slam) has a higher skill cap than kick, and you don't have to wait until you get to 55 for it to start stunning stuff either.  In this age of easily attainable gear to compensate for starting stat deficiencies, this is one of the few real advantages large races have.  We don't need a shield to do this.  If I started over as a small race, you can bet your ass I'd swap a shield in and bash to keep skill up. (There are some uses for shields in the high end game too)<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only real use for a shield on a small race is to controll the decent from a good punt. it's not called a kyte shield for nothing.<br />
<br />
yep keep the bash skill up we you move from orcs to dervs (if you do) hey have some nasty casters. bash turns them into low hp easy xp. the only mobs tha you cant stun with bash the game considers large ogre and bigger and smoe smaller ones. or ones you cant sun at all spell or bash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krakrak</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to those saying shields are useless, I see a lot of high end warriors now using 1 hander + Focus effect : furious bash 3 shield. Granted, this is top guild warriors still but you may come to getting that sort of shield and then EB 1hander + FB3 shield &gt; dual wield/EB 2 hander especially on pop content / aow</div></div><hr />
