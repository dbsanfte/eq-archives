<br />
Compare that to ANY of the WoW trailers out there.  If they think that a game is gonna be worth anything just because all their character models animate like boxers on the way to the ring, they're sadly mistaken.  I don't see ANYTHING in that trailer that makes me want to buy that game except more models that look like crap and probably lag the game all to shit.<br />
<br />
I like the blatant rip off of the Tauren tho..that was pretty classy.  The ogre monk was fuckin ridiculous.  I can see now where my money is going for my next MMORPG, and it's not with EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ogre monk.....you GOTTA be kidding. hahahhahahaaaa. i might actually have to download that piece of krap movie just to see that.<br />
<br />
&quot;meez doon flyun keek. meez yewz opun fisst n punch yoo..heee yaawww..meez likes jakkie chaaan but meez fattr&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WoW graphics look like really detailed and colorful backgrounds with warcraft toons running around.  I like cartoons so I'm gonna give that a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Graphical realism is overrated imho can make the game less absorbing - closer you get to reality the more the 'faults' stand out ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That clip didn't impress me at all. Lots of Ogres cracking their necks and repetitive music. /yawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guess I'm the only one who thinks that EQ2 will r0x0r.<br />
<br />
That video was sweet, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i dont know, vah shir looked alot better, i dont have the urge to throw a rubber ball past it anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, no offense, but Vah Shir couldn't possibly look worse :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Vah Shir look more like cats than Kerrans.<br />
<br />
But I&quot;m digging the new Ogre look. Very bad ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i would hate if they looked like karrans, if you read the lore books the evolved differntly, as the ones on that island and in stonebrunt had a hard time getting food so they devloped lighter frames (besides, what greeves could i use on a karran warrior? the whole tail thing was hard enough to modfy armor for, just try reselling it some time, that and how the hell would you stay standing up on reverse knee's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Iksar look kinda cool though; more like their old counterparts...but they better have that sweet ass swimming animation :D</div></div><hr />

You could use the hole in the armor for a poop shoot. Because really, you're in the middle of Nro, and you gotta go, you going to look for the nearest bush?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">lmao, i only think ogres would like it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I dunno, I don't like WoW graphics at all.  I don't want run around as a dwarf that looks like Yosemite Sam.  I don't really plan on playing EQ2, but I think the graphics look great and I would play it long before I even thought about WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">funny how all about EQ2 so far is the visuals, the looks, the graphisms.....<br />
yet it all looks ugly as hell.<br />
<br />
So once you tune down your parameters completely to be able to decently play EQ2, and that you can hardly see any ugly &quot;stunning visuals&quot; anymore... what will EQ2 have left to look forward to? SOE quality service? SOE competence? .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">imho the WoW trailers are awsome, after watching them I was literally drooling...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here's to hoping SGO's game is as good as it sounds like it's gonna be. They're doing a great job so far (ACTUAL public relations!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Baadan-SGO? what game are they working on.</div></div><hr />
