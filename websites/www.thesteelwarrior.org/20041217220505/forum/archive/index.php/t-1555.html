I was delighted to find that I was accepted (not kos) in Kael, as well as being liked in Thurgadin. <br />
<br />
My question is, and I think I know the answer to this, is there any good way to preserve these two factions, and raise each of them? Or can you say which one you think is better? I'm only level 42, and I don't know that I'll ever be in TOV, or that high level. <br />
<br />
Just curious as to what you think. I'd also like to be able to do some of the velious armor quests, but I think my best bet would be dwarf quests, and I'd have to kill giants for that. <br />
<br />
Just wondering what most of the others out there did with their velious faction.</div></div><hr />

It may get a little expensive but hey. I do know for sure doing Coldain head turn-ins do not give neg. coldain faction. I am unsure of the Helms.</div></div><hr />

Velious Progression :<br />
* Guild went on Giant Faction<br />
* Dain belt Farming<br />
* Dain/Dorf = KOS<br />
* Guild Farmed West Wing ToV<br />
* CoV = KOS<br />
* Guild entered NToV<br />
* CoV = KOS <br />
* No need for Kael armor anymore<br />
* Vindicator / Statue / Tormax   Farming<br />
* Giant = KOS<br />
* Ended up KOS in all of velious<br />
* Started Doing First Brood Dragons<br />
* CoV = KOS  (maxed x10000 actually)<br />
* Cleared ST (more CoV negative hits)<br />
* Started Farming AoW<br />
* CoV = Ally<br />
* MQed Skyshrine Gloves<br />
* Farmed Kael for twink armor<br />
* Dorf = Ally<br />
<br />
The CoV/Dorf/Giant goes up and down very very fast.<br />
The problem is with Dain/Tormax/Yelinak (a PAIN TO CHANGE).<br />
<br />
As long as you dont expect to do  Yelinak/Dain/Tormax quests<br />
The 3 velious factions can be changed in under a weeks work.<br />
<br />
Pick the one that suits you at most atm, and stick with it.<br />
When it no longer helps you, trash it<br />
Velious roleplay wise, is mercenary land :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The usual progression for a guild is to start dorf and get dragon for free--then do the HoT for a while, then finally move on to west and eventaullay north. The Dwarf quest armor is the eastiest to get, Giant the hardest. Also the arena and some of the other areas in kael can make nice lower level raid areas. To lock yourself out of that is probably a mistake.</div></div><hr />
