<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Think doing parts one and two of the shawl quest over and over raises dain faction.  Just need to farm lots and lots and lots of toes and heads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rather tag along on KT kills, since the primary faction raise for 1 and 2 shawl is with Coldain it could take forever to even get to threatingly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">u have to kill KT quest faction adjustments are minimal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dlammaz and some of the guards around KT are also on the same faction, so you can kill them when KT isn't up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">KT and some surrounding giants are the only way that doesn't take much too long.  Shawl quests, ring quests, armor turn ins all do help, but it takes a long long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kinathin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">alright thanks, will prolly just find out from some friends when KT is supposed to spawn next and try to tag along :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i had max kos with dain and i decided i wanted to do coldain rings.. after doing ring 1-8 twice (MQed one for friend $), turning in a bunch of extra rygorr invasion plans (cheap to buy a ton in bazaar then turn em in 4 at a time to lookout for a dain hit), doing shawl 1-2 a bunch of times, and  clearing tormax's room (5 or 6 mobs that give hit i think) 3 times, i'm still scowling to dain..  so i *definately* suggest just waiting for tormax to pop and tagging along, everything else is really slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">King Tormax is a massive faction hit.  At least from a Kromzek perspective, I went from Ally to Scowling in one kill.  Kinda sucked 'cause I was going to MQ a Kael BP for my cleric too.  :)</div></div><hr />
