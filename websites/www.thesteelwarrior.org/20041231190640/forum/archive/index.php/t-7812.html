<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beaumont72</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if anyone has gotten the second and third level of Delegate MA, from the Raid Abilities. I was wondering what exactly do the second and third levels do? Does it allow you to give your SA, and TA their own, unique targeting ring, that the whole raid can see? Any info on this would be great before I spend the points on it.<br />
<br />
I did a search, but did not find any info on this. Thanks for the help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It allows you to designate 3 different MAs for their targetting.  /assist raid only works on the first MA, though, I believe (I never use /assist raid because the radius is so small I never really get it to work)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beaumont72</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply Daabu. I'm guessing that the targeting rings are exactly the same? <br />
<br />
Would be nice if they were different, but I guess I'll just have to rely on my people to use their assist keys correctly and figure out which one they are supposed to be on. I can see how having this would help the Enchanters mezz the extra mobs that the MA/SA are not on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im still interested if there is a way to use mark NPC for targeting. Anyone know? Like if you mark 3 mobs, someone could type something like /target mark1 and theyd be able to target it easily. If there was something like this it'd be worth it to me, otherwise that skill and the MA crap can wait till more are done.</div></div><hr />
