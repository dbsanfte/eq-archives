<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On the first day God created the cow. God said, &quot;You must go to the field <br />
<br />
 with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give <br />
 milk to support the farmer.  I will give you a life span of sixty  years.&quot; <br />
   <br />
 The cow said, &quot;That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty <br />
 years.  Let me have twenty and I'll give back the other forty.&quot; <br />
 <br />
 And God agreed. <br />
 <br />
 The second day God created the dog. God said, &quot;Sit all day by the door of <br />
 your house! and  bark at anyone who comes in or walks past.  I will give you a <br />
 life span of twenty years.&quot; <br />
 <br />
 The dog said, &quot;That's too long to be barking.  Give me ten years and I'll <br />
 give you back the other ten.&quot; <br />
 <br />
 So God agreed (sigh). <br />
   <br />
 On the third day God created the monkey. God said, &quot;Entertain people, do <br />
 monkey tricks, make them laugh. I'll give you a twenty year life span.&quot; <br />
 <br />
 The monkey said, &quot;How boring, monkey tricks for twenty years?  I don't think <br />
 so. Dog gave you back ten, so that's what I'll do too, okay?&quot; <br />
 <br />
 And God agreed again. <br />
   <br />
 On the fourth day God created man. God said, &quot;Eat, sleep, play, have sex, <br />
 enjoy.  Do nothing, just enjoy, enjoy. I'll give you twenty years.&quot; <br />
 <br />
 Man said, &quot;What? Only twenty years&quot; No way man.  Tell you what, I'll take my <br />
 twenty, and the forty the cow gave back, and the ten the dog gave back and <br />
 the ten the monkey gave back, that makes eighty, okay?&quot; <br />
 <br />
 &quot;Okay,&quot; said God. &quot;You've got a deal.&quot; <br />
 <br />
 So that is why the first twenty years we eat, sleep, play, have sex, enjoy, <br />
 and do nothing; for the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our <br />
 family; for the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the <br />
 grandchildren; and for the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at <br />
 everyone. <br />
 <br />
 Life has now been explained</div></div><hr />
