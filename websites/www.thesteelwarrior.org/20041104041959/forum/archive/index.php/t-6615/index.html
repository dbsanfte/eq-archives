<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>psmoses</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild has just finished alr ring/cursed ring/xtc/hp last week.<br />
Last night we first down Seru Lord after two wipes.<br />
Now we have about forty to fifty emp keys and want to get into the Emp Chamber.<br />
<br />
Any advice for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well before the new collusion engine came to live servers, my guild and pretty much any of the warriors that have had their guilds kill Emperor in the past  have cornerd the emperor, now with the new engine its pretty much impossible so i would suggest you have your warrior and emp near where he spawns.. have a ranger take the first 1500dd that he has with Spell Shield, (wizards should have this memed) allso the Warrior should have Spell Shield up for the procs that are comeing soon.<br />
<br />
I hope you are allrdy done getting all of your Rogues ( x2 banes) and you monks (x2 Banes) couse thats where all the dps will be comeing, all others should only need 1.. pallys = no banes, and bards = no banes.<br />
<br />
Your Warrior should be getting spamed with RGC at all times, and should be hit with Spell Shields.. should asinged a Wizard and Shaman/Druid  to do this. Thats all I will tell ya the rest is up to you check out what emperor can do.. and see how your CC gose.. the CC is the key to this fight good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AC on ssra mobs, especially emp, would dictate that casters should blow away melee for dps in the emp fight. and rogue with 2 bane would be kinda useless i think. id think the offhand would be more useful with a BS mod or haste rather than a weapon which wont give you much more dps and would be better used giving the ore to someone else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also try dmg procing weapons. Just an FYI has magic resist is way up there. Either that or he is compelte resistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i was under the impression that you no longer needed bane dmg to hurt ssra.</div></div><hr />

Did him 2 weekends ago to finish off keys for some new members, and you still needed bane to hit him.<br />
<br />
On a side note, we couldn't corner him.  Tried and lost a tank through the wall.  We ended up wedging him into the portal he spawns in front of and I tanked him there.  <br />
<br />
Beware though, the 1500 proc throws you backwards quite a distance.  (which is one of the reasons people corner tanked him.)  It's not really a problem if you've got solid agro, because he'll throw you, then summon you back, but if you've got wizards that like to toe the line, it can cause some problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any advice for it?<br />
<br />
This is how our guild does Emp, others can elaborate or offer better:<br />
<br />
1) Someone invis'd goes in and targets the 8 mobs not including Blood or Emp.  Four are mezzed and Enchanters get those targets for mezzing when the fun starts; they hold that mezz the entire fight (roughly 30 minutes for us).  Four are slowed, these require four offtanks to hold them the entire fight.  You don't kill these mobs as they will respawn instantly, so they must just be tanked and not killed.  No one else but invis'd person should be in the room or even in LoS yet of Emp.<br />
<br />
2) Chanters and Lockdown group go in.  (LD group is the four offtanks and two &quot;insurance&quot; backups.)  Offtanks grab their mobs and drag them to one of the cubby holes on the sides of the room to keep them out of the way as best as possible, while the mezzed mobs stay where they are.<br />
<br />
3) Once Lockdown is solid, everyone goes in and kills Blood.  This is usually not a long fight.  Once he's dead, you have about 5 1/2 minutes I believe until the Emp is even targetable.  The mezzes and lockdown mobs must be maintained all through here.<br />
<br />
4) Emp becomes targetable, kill the King Snake!  Bane weapons are still a must as far as I know, but proc's still work so if your melee has no bane, have them whoop out the proc'ing weapons.<br />
<br />
5) Once Emp is dead, you still maintain the mezzes and tanks, and Shissar Wraiths will spawn.  These are what drop the rifts needed for your Vex Thal keys.  You'll get a total of 40 rifts off all the wraiths.<br />
<br />
6) Award loot, do a mass TL out, and you are done.  Make sure offtanks know to hit Yes fast or it'll be summon corpse time for them.<br />
<br />
Note: someone else would know better, I don't remember, but the names of the 8 mobs determine which ones are mezzable and which ones are slowable, making them easy to find and get the targets back to who needs them.<br />
<br />
We wiped our first two times trying him; first time LD group got broken, LD mobs went rampant on casters, and second time our MT died because of slow heals.  Once we got the pattern down and people started to actually keep attention on the fight, it wasn't hard.</div></div><hr />

We took Emp down again last night.  There were several times I thought for sure we had wiped; lockdown mobs got freed two seperate times, RT went down twice, and MT and RT went both once.  It's hard when we have as few bane weapons as we do right now, that dang ore just won't drop for us.<br />
<br />
But we finally got it, me and the last few that needed looted our rifts, so tonight is our first Vex Thal raid.  Should be lots of fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Question about bane weapons: can you hit the emperor for very little or not at all with a non-bane weapon?<br />
<br />
When I see a bane weapon like dmg 6 bane: +7 ssra does that mean it's a 13 dmg weapon against ssra or a 7 dmg weapon against ssra and 6 dmg against normal mobs?<br />
<br />
Sorry if that's confusing, but I'm confused as well.</div></div><hr />

To hit the Emperor with weapons instead of nukes and dots for us melee, you need one of two things:<br />
<br />
1) A Corrupted weapon, which is made by combining a Shissar weapon dropped off one of the elite Shissars and Strange Green Metal dropped off named skeletons in the mines, in any forge.<br />
2) Without #1, you are stuck relying on your only damage being from a Proc.  Get a weapon that has a high-level Proc spell on it, or do what I did last night; nothing!  I had the Black Acrylia Halberd which has a 45dmg Proc.  It got resisted every single time, I did not one single point of damage to the Emperor.<br />
<br />
A low number of bane weapons is part of why we have a hard time taking him down.  We have camped the mines to try for it and have spent hours there without a single drop, it's hard to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cool, I have a shissar claidmore in the bank, I gotta get around to killing some skellies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When I see a bane weapon like dmg 6 bane: +7 ssra does that mean it's a 13 dmg weapon against ssra or a 7 dmg weapon against ssra and 6 dmg against normal mob <br />
<br />
Anytime you see +bane damage, you add it to the base damage of the weapon.  In this instance, Shissar bane are 6 damage, 7 shissar bane, and 20 delay.  Against any non-shissar, this is a 6/20 weapon.  Against a shissar (and Emperor), however, it is a 13/20 weapon and performs exactly the same against a shissar as, for instance a primal (another 13/20 weapon), would against any regular mob.<br />
<br />
Secondly, any time you add +bane to a weapon, the entire value of the base damage + the bane damage is calculated per hit.  So, for instance, say you had a 16 damage, 1 shissar bane, 19 delay weapon, that would work as a 17/19 weapon against Emperor (even despite the fact that 16 of that damage is &quot;none bane&quot;, which Emperor is normally immune to).  All it takes is +1 bane to make the entire weapon effective against that particular mob.</div></div><hr />
