<br />
I need to know what to upgrade now. Im guildless atm (may change in a little while), with about 11k in the bank. I don't really have a solid group of people to farm plat/gear with so thats out of the option...<br />
<br />
I know I need a new haste item, but they are pretty expensive here (Cof 60k for example)<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what Prices are at on your Server, but some Items you can Look for are<br />
<br />
Valorium Ring of Galantry is a Nice Upgrade to the 6/65 Rings<br />
<br />
Earring of the Solistice<br />
<br />
Stud of Ominous Power (Not bad Earring, if you can get someone to camp guy with you in Hates Fury)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first suggestion would be to upgrade at least one of your earings.  Buying all the components for PoTC Earing should be &lt;5k these days.  <br />
<br />
At your level you should be able to farm OS for RBG with 1 or 2 other people.   I was able to do it at 59 with a Druid and Paladin.<br />
<br />
You could replace one of the rings with Valorium.  They seem to be relatively cheap these days, around 8k on Torvo which is the server of greed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can quest the items for Pernicity Cloak in Innovation and try and score a boar horn and/or shard of pure energy cheap-ish in bazaar and that'd be an upgrade to your classic HBC (I love the hooded black cloak btw, and was actually sad to replace it recently. Good times in Mistmoore, heh).<br />
<br />
You get good at doing this you may even be able to turn some profit, or strike some deals, just doing the cloak quest a bunch.<br />
<br />
Which could lead you to better haste if you seek it.<br />
<br />
Also, at your level, if you've got absolutely NADA to do, you can camp Stormfeather. Get that out of the way and I bet you can get the eyepatch really easily even unguilded (Lodi's really easy these days and some people may just let you loot the map piece for spotting him for them).<br />
<br />
Just some altnernative ideas that don't involve your earrings. ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tips guys, I think I'm going after the solstice earring, valorium rings are 7k on my server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Should I go out and buy a bracelet of fortitude? 4-5k and an earring of solstice?<br />
This is like the most plat I have ever had, don't want to waste it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Molane</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go with the Solstice Earring for sure but I'd probably get a Cloak of the Maelstrom before I'd get the Bracer of Fortitude.  Just my oppinion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bought a maelstrom cloak for 2300... got about 8k left. am going to try and find a solstice earring, then I'll be around 3k. thanks for the help guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have free time and a healer friend, ie cleric or druid with Cheal, I would consider the Coldain ring quests.  Through 9 can be done 2 people with the exception of 2 fights for the 9th ring.  The first is the icehouse in Kael and you just need the dwarf head from there and most peeps doing the cycle let it rot.  I got mine this way so I didn't have to bother friends to do this for me and many small guilds doing the cycle would love a 62 warrior to help that doesn't want armor.  The second is the fight in Icewell and if you have a cleric or healer, all you need is a few others for damage which usually isn't hard to find a couple of friends.</div></div><hr />
