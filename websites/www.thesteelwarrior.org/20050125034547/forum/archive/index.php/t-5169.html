<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crayno</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently using BF and GBOS for hard adventures and it's great for keeping aggro.<br />
But I also have a Gaudralek with wich I take considerable less damage but it just doesn't cut it aggro wise,on hard you need to get aggro back fast on a resisted slow or so.<br />
Now I'm considering putting an anger proc on my Gaudralek but I'm wondering if this will be enough to keep the mobs attention.<br />
Anyone have any experience with an augmented Gaudralek or comparable 2hander with LDON hard adventures?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byork</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recieved a random tell to join a LDoN hard group the other day.  I usually use my Bloodfrenzy augged with Anger III.  The cleric asked me if I had a 2hander.  He explained that he felt himself a competant cleric, but he didn't know if his gear was up to snuff to deal with riposte damage the entire fight.<br />
<br />
I immediately walked over and put an Anger II aug on my Norge'tal (This was a few days before I picked up an Anathema, I hate Rallos Zek and his inability to drop any more BoW's).<br />
<br />
To shorten this up the Norge'tal/Anger II aug set up worked fine in that group.  Anger II is a small hate proc, but it seemed to fire off plenty of times.  Agro was never much of a problem.  I will say that with the exception of the cleric (who was quite competant), the group was a mix of Elemental/time guilded players.  Group skill will play as much a part in your success as any weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a Greatstaff of the Four Winds which seems comparable to your Gaudralek.  I have it augmented with 125dd Ykesha.  I manage well with it in many Hard missions and do much better with it than with GBoS and CHoS both auged with Anger III as the 1h give too many ripostes and don't put out enough DPS for my usually low DPS groups.<br />
<br />
I do wish the innate proc on the GSo4W was more agro though and look forward to the day when I can replace it.<br />
<br />
I'm considering getting a GSoT auged with 100dd ykesha just for Hard missions, as the extra agro would be nice.  Just dunno how much dps and dps-related agro I'll lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL hoi Cray ! :P<br />
<br />
I use a GofW /w Anger3 and it works like a charm, procs like crazy and sthuff...<br />
(Ask Draydon ! )<br />
Now the DPS output of a GofW is higher then a gauldarek, but the inniate proc of a gauldarek is more aggro, so I\d say you're golden /w Anger3 on the Gauldarek.<br />
<br />
I have not encountered any aggro problems whatsoever in high risk missions yet... Only recently started doing them regulary though. I do know that once I placed the anger3 augment on the staff, I started to relax a lot more in combats, as a proc+incite on an incoming mob basicly means I only have to press autoattack, and the rest of the group can go crazy without the mob turning once. (This includeds fairly high DPS rogues &amp; monks /w that damn speed-disc )</div></div><hr />

I have a GSot4W augged with Anger 3 as well and it works better then I ever could have imagined on keeping aggro.  One of our tanks has a HG auged with Anger 3 and a BoC and still prefers to use his augged Greatstaff as it is superior aggro.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine that you will find the same to be true of the Gauldralek when you augment it...and you'll probably be surprised on how well it actually works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw...the proc rate on Anger 3 is pretty high, so you'll probably be well off on whatever you put it on.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion, if both are unauged, these two weapons are equal. Therefore, I'd have to agree... whether you aug Gaudralek with anger2 or anger3, it would be awesome for agro heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nomryh</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about Norge'Tal? Would that do well w/ Anger III?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heya Crayno :)<br />
<br />
I use BBB + Anger 3 and that seems to do well for tanking just about anywhere, including LDoN hards.  I know you guys have killed Seru before, maybe you could try for one of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to tank hards with an un-aug'd BBB over BoC/SEM DW combo before I got a 2hs with an agro proc.<br />
<br />
Admittedly was playing with guildies and I didnt have to fight for agro, but I found it to be great agro, less damage taken from riposte than DW and the small amount of damage removed by the rune was just extra icing.  40 AC on the BBB is nice too..</div></div><hr />
