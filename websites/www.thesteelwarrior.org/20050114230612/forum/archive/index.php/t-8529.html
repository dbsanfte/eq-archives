<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodbeast</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, I'm new here and new to the Warrior class. Been playing EQ for a few years, but almost exclusively a Cleric that I recently retired. And I have twinked my Warrior to what I think will hold me over for a while. It seems like most of the good Warrior gear is 46+.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was wondering if I should have purchased anything different. When buying I looked mainly at AC, then STA and HP. Buying for a Cleric is simple, Warriors seem much more complicated. Money isn't really an object, I can always cast in POK to make quick cash. I just want to make sure my warrior is as prepaired as possible to tank. Learning a new class is easier when you are equiped well. :) Thanks for the help.<br />

Oh, and here is my Magelo:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would keep the SBoZ for the stats for now until you get over level 50 where you need a better agro weapon.  I would try to sell the SoD and buy a BoC (assuming it can be equiped at your level--I think it  used to be but not sure now) though since that weapon will give you better stats and it will be a good agro weapon all the way to high levels.<br />
<br />
Your neck peice and earrings could be cheaply upgraded to player crafted black saphire stuff and you would probably gain about 100 hit points too.  If you do sell the SoD, consider trying to get a fungi tunic with what is left after buying the BoC and you should be set for getting to 50 and by then you will have better stuff to choose from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would ditch the SoD also.  However, instead of buying a BoC, I would get a CHoS, SotBS, and a Helmet of Rallos Zek.  At your level, the helmet will do much more for you than the BoC.  While you can argue that the BoC is more useful at later levels, I think that more people replace the BoC before the Helmet of Rallos Zek.  Weapons are not hard to come by, while decent helmets are very difficult.<br />

<br />
Wrist: Replace the junk bracelet of quickness with something like Silver Chitin bracer, just anything with ac and hp.<br />
Cloak: Pick up a crinoose cape of the werewolf for cheap. 12ac 80hp, but the rec level won't give you full stats until 50+<br />
Rings: velium fire wedding rings are better for tanks than the bands you have, but look into a valorium ring of gallantry or two once you level up towards 50.<br />
Shoulders: Tattered mantle, 12ac 20hp, is an upgrade for under 500pp, and should last you until you can get some decent nodrop ones, or raid some. Or if you can find the Chokidai Hide ones, they are like 5ac 15sta 55hp or something. Strength of the Elements is a quest you should do eventually.<br />
Face: Grimling Contraption... AC, hp, and regen1, with no rec level! <br />
Neck: Amulet of mummy wrappings or whatever it is... another cheap LDoN drop, with great stats but a rec level<br />
Ears: Worker's Earring of Efficiency is a great great twink ear, even if you have better haste. 5ac 55hp is hard to beat, and it should be less than 4k<br />
<br />
Total cost of these items is like 12-15k, which you could make most of by selling off the items you are replacing</div></div><hr />
