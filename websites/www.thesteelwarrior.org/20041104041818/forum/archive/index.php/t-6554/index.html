<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I need a little help with this setup, I just acquired a hand me down BoC last night, and need some advice. First off I need to decide what to bank, I have a Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled and Cord Hilted Spiked Driver both with anger 2 augs. I'm guessing that the BBoE would be superior aggro to the CHSD because of the increased proc rate. Assuming I go with the BBoE would it be better in my main hand til I augment the BoC with anger 3 or should I just stick BoC in my primary?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd do BoC mainhand and BBotE offhand once you get the BoC augmented. The BoC will seemed to be better aggro to me, though I'm not actually sure. Keep the BBotE mainhand until you get that BoC augmented though. The BBotE procs 65% more than the BoC, which doesn't really make up for the proc being about half the aggro of the BoC. You could definitely make a case for the chance for an earlier proc making it a worthwhile mainhand, and WA will increase the proc rate of the BBotE more than it would the BoC.<br />
<br />
 Anyhow, BBotE for now for sure. Bank the CHSD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">BBotE primary until you aug the BoC. Once you aug the BoC you will be quite happy though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In reference to this question: I know I saw the thread saying the Splitblade was crap due to no aggro proc, and if I am understanding correctly, It would be better to Anger 2 a SotBS and my BoC instead of anger 2'n the SBoD? That sound correct? <br />

<br />
Just a question : why do you want to augment BoC instead of BBotE ?<br />
Without augment, BBotE &gt; BoC, same goes with augments.<br />
<br />
1 thing is sure : bank the CHSD :)<br />
But I really suggest you to augment your BBotE.<br />
That's what I've done, I use BBotE+A3 primary, BoC without Aug 2ndary, and it works great.<br />
<br />
It would be better to Anger 2 a SotBS and my BoC instead of anger 2'n the SBoD? That sound correct? <br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
A weapon with innate proc aggro augmented will give more aggro than a weapon without innate proc augmented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BBotE already has anger 2 aug on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BBotE with Anger 3 will be better than BoC with Anger 3 if unaugmented BBotE is better than unaugmented BoC.  BBotE procs more so you have a higher chance of an agro proc going off early in a fight with it in main hand.  Early agro is the most important thing in a fight in most cases.  Get Anger 3 on both if you can, mainhand the BBotE and then you will not need to upgrade your agro weapons until plane of time.  With that combo and WA5 you will have a legendary proc rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a friend who uses BBOE mainhand instead of his Bloodfrenzy, so yea I would main hand BBOE and offhand the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am pretty sure that the innate proc modifier on BBoTE only applies to it's innate proc, not augs that are put into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is correct  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had been using BoC/anger2 in main hand and BBoTE/anger2 and decided to try swapping them around and noticed an increase in procs and overall hate on mobs.<br />
<br />
I got a much easier time keeping aggro now than I ever did before. Getting up to 16 procs per fight with WA2, averaging 10~.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I currently use BBotE main and BoC offhand, both augged with anger III. Have tried switching hands and prefer BBotE mainhand-no question about it as far as i'm concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the advice everyone, I went with BBotE mainhand and BoC offhand and it worked great, even stole aggro of MT a few times on some trash mobs with his freshly anger3 Auged BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">WOOT I got BoW last night so all this is pointless now, Anger 3 all the way. So far were 2/2 on BoW's from RZ guess were just lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Honestly, I think you'd be better off just throwing a yak aug onto the BoW.  I realize that anger 3 would cause more hate, but in my opinion, you can't use the BoW for anything else then.  Throw a yak aug onto it, and not only will you *slightly* increase your dps, but you can use your BoW for both MA duties and for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">anger 3 it .. the dps upgrade is minimal, and the aggro will be worth it.  assuming you dont start the fight at the same time as the MA, i wouldnt think aggro should be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>blizterkrieger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">when I had a BoC I would use that mainhand in raids (unauged cause I'm an ldon slacker) and use the BBotE in my offhand (auged with slimestone fragment of dread) I always noticed the BoC was far more reliable aggro, but the stun procs are just alot cooler imo  :D <br />
when I needed a little extra kick, I'd slip in the GBoS (auged with the slimestone fragment of shock) in main hand and the BBotE in off hand. It just always seems I had more sucess with the BBotE's exta proc rate in off hand, and the regular ole GBoS proc rate in main hand. On a good proc round I can snag aggro off most pallies with that combo, and keep it if that happens early in the fight.</div></div><hr />
