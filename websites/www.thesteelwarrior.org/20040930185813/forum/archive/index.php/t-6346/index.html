Hi, I just wanted to drop a note and mention a few things about the DirectX9 engine that - obviously - everyone has noticed. <br />
<br />
The collision system is still being tuned. It's what is largely responsible for the getting stuck, the arrows, the pathing stutters, horses moving more slowly, all that stuff. We're hoping to have these problems resolved soon and are working hard to correct the situation. The /rewind command was intended to be a short term fix, but sadly it turned out to be exploitable and we had to remove it at the last minute. We're going to try to restore it in an exploit-proof manner if it seems possible. <br />
<br />
The performance for older cards should be very similar to the DX8 performance for older systems; we don't use any DX9 specific stuff that causes DX9 emulation or anything that might slow the game down intentionally. It's possible that some performance issues squeaked by on the older cards that will need to be tuned. Please submit bugs to the official eq tech support channels if you are having performance problems. Most people with reasonably current hardware should be seeing a performance improvement (some systems see dramatic improvements). If things are much slower for your system, please let us know through the regular tech support channels so we can get whatever problems might be present identified and fixed. <br />
<br />
The sky showing the bizaare stars &amp; related problems has - to our knowledge - all been corrected by updating to current drivers. If this isn't fixing it for you, please make a bug and be sure to list your card model &amp; driver version. Our compatibility lab can reproduce the problem given enough information to replicate the hardware situation that causes it. <br />
<br />
Our goal by the time we are done is to have the game run better for everyone. For a lot of people this is the case, and unfortunately for some people it isn't. We're continuing to work on it and hope to have an update soon. <br />
<br />
cheers <br />
