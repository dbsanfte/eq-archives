<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which weapon would be better for a warrior?  They're both very close.  <br />
<br />
Windblade is 50/44, ac15 +12 dex/sta, +35hp.  <br />
<br />
War Marshall's Bladed Staff is 31/28, +9 dex/sta/agi, +50hp +5 svp/d<br />
<br />
Strictly by ratio, the windblade is 2.6% better.  However at L63, Windblade has a dmg bonus of 41 and the staff has a bonus of 31.  I noticed that the dmg bonus doesn't scale up as fast as the delay.  If you increased bladed staff delay from 28 to 44 and made the dmg bonus increase by the same percentage from 31, it would be almost 49.  So you're going to get a bit more dps from bonus dmg than you would with windblade.  Thus by my estimation they're almost dead even on damage output.  <br />
<br />
Other factors -- windblade yields just a few more hit points if your stamina isn't maxed, and mine isn't, but it's just a few.  Mainly it has 15 AC to the staff's zero.  I like AC.  I'm usually the guy taking the damage.  On the other hand, the bladed staff is faster delay, so I'm guessing it would taunt better.   So what would the preference of experienced warriors out there be?  Is the taunt significantly better with a 28 delay 2 hander over windblade?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevian</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried out both at one point and honestly didn't notice much of a difference.  Both are nice weapons.  I didn't parse it but i couldn't tell a big difference in either aggro or damage.  Either is a great 2hander.<br />
<br />
edit~repost damage in PoP has been tuned way down (stealth nerf?), extra damage from repost while DW now is close to the same as 2h.  duel wielded all night in inner pov and asked the cleric (RL friend) to watch my health and compare how much mana he was using.  said he noticed no difference from my normall 2h setup over 4 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greatstaff of Thunder &gt; both</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh... but I don't HAVE a greatstaff of thunder and have yet to see one for sale.  I have a windblade.  We got a war marshall's staff recently, and a ranger friend is going to get either the windblade or the staff depending on which one I use.  As I said, I think their dps is almost identical.  It's just a question of whether the faster speed on the staff helps with taunt much and is enough to give up the AC on the windblade.  My AC is pretty low as it is.  It's above the old pre PoP 1260 soft cap, but pretty low by PoP standards.<br />
<br />
Well, the ranger is a friend of mine so I'll probably just try the staff and trade back weapons if I don't notice much taunt difference.  We think dps is about the same, but I want aggro and the ranger doesn't. Point for windblade... 50 dmg means those crits and crips are more impressive looking! :)<br />
<br />
p.s. actually i think the staff is about 1% more dmg. heh... pretty insignificant, though in a game where you can spend 18 AA points to get a double riposte on half of your ripostes... i think that amounts to about a 2% dmg increase for 18 AA... /shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like quicker weapons for tanking below 45 range i dunno just a thing. so i'd choose staff but windblade is nice for pure dps and the big monster crits to brag about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My own thoughts are that the best indicator of which is best is the modal hit/delay. <br />
<br />
For me the modal hit on the Windblade is 145 and Marshall's would be 97.<br />
<br />
145/44 = 3.30<br />
97/28 = 3.46<br />
<br />
So the Staff should be better.<br />
<br />
I own a Greatstaff of Thunder too but sometimes that's just too much aggro for raids when not MT. Currently have a Windblade bagged for that, but there's a Marshall's staff on sale right now and I want it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">where the **** did those numbers come from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">their so close keep both. need dps go staff. need ac hp go WB use the wb on fellstike, furious, evade, and defence. staff on charge, mighty, and aggressive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to have a windblade, but I switched it out for the bladed staff.  I had both for a while, so I did test between the two and found I liked the staff better.<br />
<br />
Note, this was before the big hit aggro bug and fix, so I don't know if anything changed after they fixed it.<br />
<br />
If I know I'm going defensive, I usually use dw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the WMBS for when I'm tanking (i.e.: exp group), and the Windblade for when I'm one of many damage-dealers (i.e.: raids). For aggro purposes, the WMBS just grabs and holds aggro better than the windblade.<br />
<br />
It's possible that the Great Staff of Thunder will beat both for aggro (although the ratio isn't quite as good as the WMBS), but if I can get close without having to rely on a proc that pushes the mob around, all the better for my situation.<br />
<br />
YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple maths Badaan. The damage distribution of a specific weapon is formulaic and if you look at it in any detail you'll see that the modal damage, 2*base+bonus, is a most useful figure. Your various hits are a distribution around that number. The modal damage/delay gives you your dps &quot;comparison number&quot; for evaluating different 2h weapons. If you wanna do some maths and disprove that then go ahead...<br />
<br />
<br />
I have all three of those weapons now, Marshalls, Greatstaff and Windblade. Marshalls definately more reliable dps than Windblade but Greatstaff better for aggro on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh ok.. so that makes the GoT 98/30, which is 3.27.<br />
<br />
Even though the DPS is inferior, the proc I feel makes up for it. <br />
Just today I was getting aggro 50/50 from a 61 war with red epic and some claw that I can't recall the name of, but apparently it was good enough to offhand the epic for, he was in NToV gear if that helps anyone figure out what it was...<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, GoT rules! I got 2 more HP out of it (and 1 dmg) when I dinged 56 today so I'm happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newbbarsher</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it was Claw of Lightning (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5724) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think so, I'm pretty sure the claw was in mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">prolly the claw from until dak 11/18 with some stats if it had 4-5 short blades that was prolly it. cant rember the name though<br />
