ok for you and cloak of greater pernacity... one of the components is a gold tipped boar horn... thats a drop off pigs in the pit in PoTactics (can't think of elsewhere off the top of my head)  so that will need to be bought (5-6K plat on xev) assumeing you magello is up to date on flags and that you'r not going to PoStorms to kill for the key or on a behemoth raid soon...  haveing got that the parts of the cloak are easy enough to get and you should be able to complete it.<br />
<br />
if the necros are tactics enabled they can go and kite there for your horn... <br />
<br />
depending on how good the necros are there are a number of upgrades that could be obtained... for example they could help farm components for Valorium ring of galentry to replace your rings same with earings the items can  either be farmed for or else made (depending on JC)  however most of the upgrades I know are raided and I am hesitent to recomend anything  raiding without knowing more.</div></div><hr />

OK but they were thinking not of collecting items but just like camping a mob for an item like in Velks or something this is great idea would like some more info of those rings and those mysterious earrings u were talkning about :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jonnas Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probly better to have them farm some plat and give it to you  :D  But veksar would be a good place for them to go for you.  Do LDoNs, they can yield some good armor.  If you have the faction, might ask them to farm either HoT or kael for quest armor for you...kinda going blank here, but that's a place to start.</div></div><hr />
