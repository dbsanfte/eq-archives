<br />
I was wondering what the fewest people anyone has done him with, and what strategy you used.  I have been sort of leaning to doing him with 3 clerics, monk(for pulls), enchanter(adds and DC pet), bard(mana song for clerics), then through together a good DPS group for second, wizzies, our uber ranger, bst, any other DPS class, and then Me of course.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input, bp really needs an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen him done with 9 people before but I doubt on your first run you will pull that off unless you  have a stacked crew. So I would suggest for your first run you bring at least 4 clerics or some combo of Druids/clerics and have a few back up tanks as well. Overall 3-4groups should be able to do him np, start with that and adjust up or down as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvil</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, we usually do him with 3-4 groups in guild, but problem is that we only do him now when we are up for AoW, which is about once a month or so. Also, AoW raids are usually done when Im at work lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We took him down first time recently with 24. The key really is the clerics. For the first time i would say 4 as a minimum, but every one extra means a much large margin of safety. Also, make sure they are all the same level if possible or thereabouts - we had a some mid 50 clerics mixed in with 65 clerics and they went oom much earlier in the fight.<br />
<br />
We fought him in the corner by the ramp, either side is okay. For the first time, try and keep it to a single tank, even if you dont kill him within 3 minutes, its just easier. <br />
<br />
Make sure to assign a rampage tank to tag vindi on incoming so hes up on the rampage list. Give the rampage tank a full time cleric and if hes a warrior get him to go defensive.<br />
<br />
If your the MA, shrink urself as much as possible so you can get boxed into the corner by vindi - that way his back is nicely exposed to the melees and they can push him into the corner.<br />
<br />
Stack DS potions on yourself, a bard in your group helps as well. On our fight with him our MA parsed that vindi hit him 400 times.<br />
If you can stack 100 plus worth of DS points on you, do the math - thats almost 1/3 of his hps attributable to DS alone. <br />
<br />
As long as hes singled pulled, get the rampage tank to tag first before any heals go in to you. Druids shams etc spam short heals on you and get the CH chain up. 10-15 secs of solo time then calll in your melees. As long as hes locked on to you, clerics have mana, then it should go easy. With defensive, vindi really doesnt put out as much melee as you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvil</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried a run last night with 9. Had a 65 warrior, 65 cleric, 65 druid, 61 shaman, 65 chanter, Bard (was friends so not sure of lvl), 65monk, 62 druid and me, 61 warrior).   <br />
<br />
Killed everything in arena pretty quick, but failed when monk pulled the guardians and chanter tried to DC one.  We got vindi aggro :(  After rez bard had to log so we weren't about to try it without the bard DS/ manasong.   Would have liked to see the outcome if we would have been ready for Vindi lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 CH Cleric/Druids on your MA and 1 more for Rampage tanks.  Shrink MA and get vindi positioned in any corner, add DPS and you are done.  We did with 12-14 i believe.</div></div><hr />

Seriously tho Kuvil, I dont think you could do Vindi with less than 24 of our guildies. ( last time we tried him with 24 we wiped 3 times in a row to give you an idea )<br />
The DPS would be greatly reduced and I think you would find the Clerics running out of Mana.<br />
If you were to really sit down and think about it tho, How many people do you see being ahead of YOU in the Vindi BP lottery?<br />
Only one Warrior in the whole guild higher level than you doesnt have it yet and he rejected it when offered.<br />
Honestly I think you are most likely next in line.<br />
Also, Consider that we also do the Statue of rallos zek, and you could attempt to get that BP too, and that to do the Statue we have to clear Vindi. There are lots of chances upcoming bud.</div></div><hr />

I believe it was 1 enchanter, 3 ranger, 1 cleric, and 1 other class that I can't remember.  They used a DC pet to tank him and the 3 rangers just sat back and pelted arrows at him.<br />
<br />
Quite amazing to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">doubt u could pet tank him anymore with the nerf.<br />
<br />
3 clerics, a tank with good aas, puller, and rest dmg(more the better). can auction for buffs before you go.  realize ppl doing this with small numbers got some good eq though with max defensive aas and the dmg ppl arent slouches. clerics with deep mana pools, SCM3, and FT15. weve done it 2 clerics and druid too, but kinda pushing it hehe.<br />
<br />
otherwise 24ish ppl prob be good with xtra cleric or two and some more dmg.</div></div><hr />

Fought him and his pets all at once.  While healing myself with 1 cleric.  Was one fun fight.  <br />
<br />
For your average Joe, id recommend having enough extra healing for a warrior tanking with no disc.  If you have a good dps crew you can probably skate by with less healing.  If you got a low DPS crew, i wouldnt go with less then 3-4 clerics depending on manapools.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dachunker</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was 3 boxing my warrior main, a rogue, and cleric.  My other partner was 3 boxing his shaman, ranger, and chanter.  We also had a necro and pali tagging along.  The pali tanked both his pets while I OTed Vindi.  We burned the pets down and then killed Vindi.  The cleric that I was using cast his last CH when Vindi was at 3 percent.  My warrior died and Vindi fell on top of her.  The statue fight was cake compared to the vindicator fight, some nice upgrades for the old alts..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gelding</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm sure we could do vindi with 12-18 people..<br />
<br />
we have a couple tanks close to 8k hp, and one that is like 8.3k?<br />
<br />
all we need is :<br />
<br />
warrior<br />
cleric x3 or maybe 2.. 3 is safe<br />
rampage tank (plate class)<br />
rampage healer (druid / cleric)<br />
bard (DS)<br />
mage (DS)<br />
shaman (buffs)<br />
enchanter (buffs)<br />
rampage healer (druid / cleric)<br />
monk<br />
paladin / beastlord (BSS or SV)<br />
<br />
<br />
if you get 3 good clerics ~lvl 65 you can do with just those... but of course more dps is safer :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you are asking what the min number of people to do a mob is, be sure to take a look at the Magelo of the people who are tossing out low numbers. We've done Vindi with as few as 6, but then the reason we did him with 6 was to get a BP for an alt. If you are going for him and the BP is an upgrade for everyone on the kill, chances are it is going to take more than 6 people.<br />
<br />
Vindi is still a big deal, he is the gateway mob for a lot of bigger kills and big raids still wipe to him daily. Grats on your new BP!</div></div><hr />
