<br />
The fix for that is simple.<br />
<br />
Remove their ability to train COMBAT AGILITY.<br />
<br />
It's a MELEE ARCHTYPE AA skill.<br />
<br />
No way in hell should anyone but MELEES be able to train it.<br />
<br />
Will fix your problem up just fine.</div></div><hr />

But when facing a raid monster, how long do you last?  If you think 5 seconds is a big bonus for mitigation then you guys have a funny definition of &quot;bonus&quot; since the Enchanter will probably last a whopping 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
Here is a hit for all of you: It doesn't matter what or the wheres.  If you survive long enough to the next heal then you successfully tanked it.  A 10K Paladin solos just like a 7K Paladin purely by the fact their HPS &gt; the monster's DPS.  The fact that one has 3K more HP is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
And so it goes...  No one here seems to believe that plate mitigation is broken.  When the efficiency of using plate is cut to a few seconds, where is the big bonus?  I eagerly await the news that a Beastlord tanks something substantial in Time.</div></div><hr />

that would screw us more than help us. <br />
<br />
If any class gets hit and dies before you can hit taunt then they gonna go with a class that has aggro lock over a war.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I am trying to point out is that there is something &quot;funny&quot; with the SOE designs encounters.  Monsters are high so hard and fast and use so much non-melee damage that AC is uselss.  Why bother giving us extra AC on our armor?<br />
<br />
If Enchanters die in 2 seconds, then someone wearing plate supposedly skilled in combat stays alive for 3 seconds more?!  WTG SOE for excellent monster design.<br />
<br />
I am not advocating Enchanters and such classes die any faster.  I am advocating that those in plate, those supposedly trained how to stand in front and fight actually stand in the fight longer.  Much longer.</div></div><hr />

You need to deal with the worst case round and heal for that.  So once you can live long enough to get healed, the amount you are being healed on average doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Compare a chanter vs tank on a much weaker mob and the tank takes considerably less damage.<br />
<br />
And yes, living 150% longer is excellent monster design.  Well, it's bad design, too big of a difference, but...<br />
<br />
CH chains fubar it.  You're going to heal 8250 or whatever anyway.  Until you reach a point where you rely upon the tank's hp to provide a buffer to balance bad rounds and good rounds, it doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

What do we get again by going 60-65 that casters dont? Exactly we get zilch, while casters/hybrids get extremley nice spells and now can use almost, if not all, high end gear pure mele can.<br />

If you ask me alot of gear should be made like PoP charm. Looks the same to everyone, but adjusted to whoever looted it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't care if an enchanter can tank a pussy phase 3 mob.  He is using a shit load more healing mana to do it, with a higher risk of death.  Knights mitigate as we do or better out of disc.  Hence there is no reason to nerf enchanters and reason to nerf knights.</div></div><hr />

Show me a parse where AotE did the same or less dps to the enchanter than it would to a non-defensive warrior and you might have a point (assuming it was slowed at the same time for both, yada yada yada).  Until then grats on fast heal spam...</div></div><hr />

Remove their ability to train COMBAT AGILITY. <br />
<br />
Removing CA from priest classes, without scaling back healing aggro, will seriously end up with a lot of dead clerics.<br />
<br />
I know for a zone like PoAir (I've never seen Time, going with what I know), when I'm landing CH/SL on a tank, just a few seconds after the mob reaches camp, usually doing around 5-7k points of healing, and the warrior has shit luck with procs, I'm getting summoned. Thanks to LR5, and a shaman guildleader with a healing trigger finger almost as fast as mine (:D), I usually survive the Recluse/Servitor/whatever. Remove CA/LR from the equation, and I'm hella dead nearly every time.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm a pretty active cleric, so if the warrior has bad luck with initial aggro on a raid it's usually my ass hamburgerized, but for me to lose CA, and get buried every single time the RNG says to the warrior 'Fuck you, you lose', I'll be dying a whole lot more. I'll take those deaths if I have to; having 1 cleric die to healing aggro is a lot better than losing the MT + a dozenish people as the mob crunches random people, but for me (or any cleric) to die nearly every single time I get aggro, just for doing my job well, because some chanter can tank AotE (with a full set of priests going full tilt to keep that chanter alive) sounds retarded.<br />
<br />
Lower healing aggro, and clerics might actually be ok without CA. With healing aggro as it is, CA is usually what keeps me from going low-health after the mob's first round. The 'Don't heal right away' argument is pointless; *someone* has to heal the tank when that mob hits camp, and whoever it is is going to get their shit ruined. I remember when my previous guild was learning RZtW, I used to literally expect death every single time I healed anyone tanking those splitting mobs before it split (heal landing right after split resulted in both mobs on cleric with healing aggro). That stopped once I learned to time heals better and manage their damage spikes, but losing CA could certainly bring that back since healing aggro = death.<br />
<br />
I shouldn't expect to die repeatedly because I'm doing a good job of keeping people alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a MOB can maximum bust damage for 4500 damage in one combat round, it can be tanked by ANY class in the game as long as they can keep aggro.<br />
<br />
Don't even need runes or anything fancy either, just Complete Heals once a second or so.<br />
<br />
The real point here is &quot;as long as you can keep aggro&quot;, because if you don't, the complete heal chain will get shredded to bits in a few combat rounds and it'll all be over - Because even the best tank cannot survive long enough for the Complete Heal Chain to stabilize again.<br />
<br />
And that's just sad.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for what class is the worst tank in the game, I'd say Magicians, since they do even less aggro than Warriors except for very short periods of time. Even a Wizard is better with his Area Snare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As opposed to a lot of dead melees?<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Combat Agility leads to Lightning Reflexes. And LR5 is FAR TOO POWERFUL for casters to be having.<br />
<br />
If you get early healing aggro in somewhere gimpy, like say, Mistmoore Catacombs, not having combat agility would be no big deal.<br />
<br />
Just because the GAME got away from logical and reasonable encounters in Planes of Power, is no justification to continue allowing casters to be as overpowered as they are.<br />
<br />
And it starts with MELEE ARCHTYPE AA ABILITIES.<br />
<br />
You are spellcasters. And yet, because some devs were complete and utter freakin MORONS, spellcasters can now train in not only all of their OWN archtype abilities ... but they can ALSO train in all of the USEFUL melee archtype abilities.<br />
<br />
The get it all.<br />
<br />
It makes no sense, and is hardly fair.<br />
<br />
As a priest class you survived 60 to 65 levels without combat agility.<br />
<br />
Somehow, your case is not strengthened by stating that you now NEED it to survive.<br />
<br />
You didn't need it before. You don't need it now.<br />
<br />
You'd find a way to survive.<br />
<br />
Hell, just use your OWN DAMN buff, Vie, and deal with the heat.</div></div><hr />

Come on have some sense of self preservation.  Calling nerf on knights is not smart (casue we gonna call nerf right back as soon as you 1% more powerful than us which given the new system is likely soon).  But calling for a nerf on clerics???????<br />
<br />
OMFG you are out of your mind lol.  Of all the classes warriors can't affort to piss off I think clerics are #1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not calling for a NERF on clerics as you so ridiculously put it.<br />
<br />
I'm calling for melee archtype abilities to be FIXED.<br />
<br />
It's a fix. Not a nerf.<br />
<br />
Spellcasters should not be able to train in over 90 percent of ALL archtype AA abilities that are offered, when melees can only train in about 6 of them.<br />
<br />
Combat Agility, Lightning Reflexes ... these have nothing to do with casting spells.<br />
<br />
You think Gandalf was out there doing gymnastics?<br />
<br />
Please.<br />
<br />
He's a spellcaster.<br />
<br />
The ROOT IDEA of magic users is that they are physically INFERIOR to melee classes.<br />
<br />
This stems from pen and paper RPGs. This is reinforced in fantasy literature (Raistlin was not very phyiscally stout, for instance). This USED to be the case in everquest.<br />
<br />
But now that spellcasters dodge hits better than Bruce Lee dodges punches, the whole IDEA of balance between a magic user being weak physically but powerful magically has been degraded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of all the classes warriors can't affort to piss off I think clerics are #1.&quot;<br />
<br />
READ THE SUBJECT MATTER.<br />
<br />
It starts off with ENCHANTERS.<br />
<br />
NOT CLERICS.<br />
<br />
And then READ WHAT I SAY.<br />
<br />
I'm not calling for a nerf.<br />
<br />
I'm asking for a FIX.<br />
<br />
SPELLCASTERS cast their spells JUST FINE before they could train in combat agility.<br />
<br />
They WILL FIND A WAY TO SURVIVE WITHOUT IT.<br />
<br />
It's a MELEE ABILITY.<br />
<br />
And as such, there's no way in hell magic users should be training in it. <br />
<br />
And melees don't get much support from the other classes anyway, Newtank. They all love to point out how they're sick and tired of whining. How all we do is whine.<br />
<br />
Like I give a shit?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will I choose a warrior to tank AoE next time we do him?<br />
<br />
I sure as hell will...<br />
<br />
Do I advocate nerfing mitgiation for casters?<br />
<br />
Fuck no, the last thing this game needs is for casters to get insta gibbed or killed in one two or 3 rounds by &quot;trash&quot; mobs (that hit for &gt; 1K)<br />
<br />
Sony did fuck repetivly increasing monster dmg so much that tanking is reduced to 1 rounds? yep, but at least for me most people atnk more then one round cause bad stff (TM) happens to CH chain, lag, bad reaction time etc etc, <br />
<br />
Do i really want them to go back and try to fix it? Not espcially, too much is built on the foundation, and changing the foundation would have too much of impact on game. and honsetly thats too easy to either fuck up game more - or make it not fun, which it is relativly, or if its not i hope people quit who arnt having fun.<br />
<br />
There is one &quot;Sorta solutotion&quot; to this problem which I think could be instituted, which would be give Time God's  a 1/100 or something chance to do an &quot;insta gib&quot; round - regardless the targets mitigation/hp/etc, but have either warriors, or wariors SK and paladins, be immune to it,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, there's one thing I'd like to clarify for some of you.  A few folks keep referring to this as &quot;nerfing the mitigation of casters&quot;.  Just so you know, CA doesnt improve mitigation, it improves avoidance.  Mitigation is how well you take a hit.  Avoidance is whether or not you get hit in the first place.  And Wu is right.  Giving the casters access to the melee disciplines ranks right up there with knightemization in the &quot;fucking moronic mistakes made by the devs&quot; category.  There never should have been design changes that made that level of avoidance for all classes a necessity.  PoP fucked up the game badly.  If you say that heal aggro is such that without CA you'd be dead after the first heal then guess what: Heal aggro needs to be adjusted so that you don't need a melee archtype AA to survive.  The same is true for slows, nukes and snares.  And before anyone starts saying &quot;but that would break the game and trivialize encounters&quot;, knight tankability + knight aggro lock is already doing that.  Again, casters should never have been given access to the most useful melee archetype abilities.  This does need to be fixed, and spell aggro adjusted accordingly.</div></div><hr />

Hell, just use your OWN DAMN buff, Vie, and deal with the heat.<br />
<br />
<br />
That'd be yet another buff clerics have to recast every ~5 minutes, that spell taking up a spell slot I certainly don't have. That's the absolute last thing clerics want right now. Hell, there are some clerics who already want Vie given to chanters and Kazad given to druids.<br />
<br />
The only way we'll &quot;find a way to survive&quot; after losing CA would be scaled back healing aggro, and giving clerics avoidance that actually makes us look like a plate class, because omg, we are one. That, combined with having chanters dedicated to Calming Visage, and having clerics keep themselves DI'd (at 2 emeralds a pop every 10 minutes, that moneysink is worse than peridots), clerics could stand a chance. We'd be the inverse of wizards; healing aggro causes instagib, but people have to be healed so there's no way clerics can avoid or shed aggro. All wizards have to do is stop nuking.<br />
<br />
I've raided elementals without any CA before; BoV won't do much to help, while still being another annoying buff that MUST be maintained. The mob, still unslowed, can be expected to get at least 2 rounds in on me every time. With CA/LR, 200 defense, 75 dodge, and 1300AC, I'm looking at about 6-8k damage from those 2 rounds; like I said, thanks to some very fast priests, that's usually a close call, but not enough damage to actually kill me. I'm at 6800hp raidbuffed; I don't survive every time. Before I had CA, that'd be closer to 10k damage in 4 seconds. With BoV, it becomes 9k; and still a very hamburgerized cleric.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this raid content that I have trouble standing toe-to-toe with, for four seconds, is 2 expansions old. I've never been to Time or LDoN Raids; I have no idea how brutal healing aggro is in those places. Sure, challenge is good; I was a cleric leader of an elemental guild for nearly a year. I love to raid, but a challenge such as perfecting my old BDA Shield strat or holy-shit-the-monk-pulled-3-chaosfiends, is a whole lot better than a challenge such as making sure I have every single hp/mitigation/deaggro buff I can possibly get just to survive a TRASH mob. I'll reiterate, just for you Superchum:<br />

I don't want you to die for doing your job.<br />

Why not just complete the package and give necros the melee archtype regen ability ... and give clerics Physical Enhancement and Planar Durability.<br />

Why not just keep marginalizing and marginalizing melees right out of existence.<br />

The chanter version (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4076&amp;source=Live) mitigates spell damage, not melee. It mitigates 20%, still only lasts for 12800 damage, and costs a peridot.<br />

<br />
Superchum, you keep saying this over and over, and being a front-line healer I keep telling you it's not going to work. If you're going to rant for days on end for changes that will break patch healing, at least come up with a solution for priests so that your proposed changes won't break raids! I've already explained to you how BoV doesn't work for this.<br />
<br />
Giving clerics defensive AA wasn't the most logical way to do it, you're right (the Gandalf comparison is a little off, Everquest clerics aren't like D&amp;D or traditional fantasy clerics at all), but something had to be done. During Luclin, top-end raid trash mobs hit for quad 550. They didn't have long-duration proc spinstuns, or wide damage spikes either (though they did have AE blind for a while :rolleyes: ). Now, I'm not even top-end PoP, and trash mobs hit for up to quad 1800-2000, with a full array of procs/AE's that stun, dot, mana drain, kill superimportant buffs, lower resists, etc.<br />
<br />
Mobs are hitting over 3 times harder now. Simple, over the counter trash mobs. My HP didn't triple, so, something has to back me up when I get aggro keeping the tank alive.<br />
<br />
I've suggested a few solutions already, despite the fact that you haven't. Lower healing aggro (which would trivialize a lot more than some chanter with a fuckton of healing tanking AotE), bring clerics a little more in-line with plate-class avoidance (which would only help clerics; the other priests, especially shaman, would get torn a new ass), etc. Even if those changes were to go through, you'd probably see chanters start getting relegated to Calming Visage for certain clerics/shaman, clerics would certainly start costing raids more gem cash due to keeping DI on themselves, etc., simply because aggro = death.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I've raided elementals without defensive AA's before. I've seen first-hand how bad trash mob damage spikes can be without them.<br />
<br />
And besides, even if CA were to be removed from casters, casters could still tank raid mobs if they have an assload of healing. With something like a 10-cleric CH rotation and a 4-necro twitch rotation (because cleric snap aggro is prohibitively mana intensive), I myself could tank Tier 1 Gods, even if the mob hit for full damage every swing. No misses, dodges, defensive AA's, anything, and I could still tank with that kind of healing. No ripostes either, since my hammer's 30DPS (with a proc rate higher than pre-nerf Hammer of Judgement, that threatened paladins everywhere to the point they virtually had a crusade until it was nerfed, oh n0s) isn't worth turning attack on.<br />
<br />
So your &quot;fix&quot; would frustrate the shit out of priest classes everywhere. I know from experience as a cleric leader that when a tank goes down fighting trash mobs and I ask why, anything that encourages clerics to answer &quot;I didn't wanna die instead&quot; is a lot more illogical than &quot;Gandalf doing gymnastics&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Then why are you complaining about the removal of them? After all, I rarely see raids without metric fucktons of healers. And as for XP groups, well, you shouldn't be tanking them anyways. :D <br />
<br />
 Those defensive AA's you got are the caster equivalent of manaburn nowadays - great idea, woeful execution, and unbalancing in their final form. Add up your defensive AA's avoidance totals and I'll wager you're better at avoidance than a 60 Warrior with no AA's. Improbable, Illogical, and Nonsensical. QED.</div></div><hr />

Keeping a tank with aggro-lock alive on elemental trash isn't that difficult; it's just the first few rounds that can get healers summoned on an unslowed mob, since the tank needs substantial healing during the first few seconds of the fight.<br />
<br />
Then why are you complaining about the removal of them? After all, I rarely see raids without metric fucktons of healers <br />
<br />
Tier 1 Gods can't one-round me. Even with avoidance AA, elemental trash mobs can; and even if they don't, the damage from the first round is often enough to push a healer down into low-health aggro, meaning the tank can't secure aggro to save the healer, so the mob's second round hamburgerizes the healer if other healers aren't fast enough to patch. An unslowed mob can get 2 rounds off in 3-4 seconds; SL's cast time is 3.75, meaning there is almost zero margin for reaction or /assist time. DvA is great for this, as it allows an overaggro cleric to heal themself extremely fast (assuming the mob doesn't interrupt it, with its fast cast time it channels horribly, almost any hit interrupts it just like Yaulp), but a stunning bash or a spinstun proc leaves the cleric helpless. Removing CA for priests would mean the mob spikes for at or near its maximum damage just about every round; CA isn't there to provide a straight miss every so often, so healers would be getting one-rounded and low-health aggro much, much more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see any reason to nerf casters mitigation/avoidance abilities at all, but there really is a simple solution to all this with the new expansion coming in a couple months. The fact remains today, that any class that can survive 1 round of damage for a set period of time(including dps spikes) on a raid mob is able to successfully tank it. So the solution is simple, raise the dps of mobs to a point only a fool would think of using a non plate class as a tank. There are several ways to do this: <br />
<br />
*First increase war/pal/sk hp considerably, to distinguish warriors more give them a innate 10-15% bonus(or use aa) over sk/pal classes, the greater hp your main tank has the less effective the complete heal spell from clerics can heal, thus allowing a the creation of a larger ch(maybe uncapped) but more mana intensive heal, maybe making the 1 sec CH rotations impossible, which also would benefit tank classes. <br />
<br />
*Another set of defensive skills available only to plate classes, say Improved Innate Defense/Improved Lightning Reflexs, which effectively add another 25% mitigation/avoidance on a round<br />
<br />
*Increase the effectiveness of ac yet again.<br />
<br />
*Another way to go would be to phase in more shielding/spell shield effects on equipment for plate classes, effectively reducing the damage plate classes(and only plate classes).<br />
<br />
<br />
So for example, a mob that quads for 5-6k each hit, a war might have 15k hp, with a ac of 3000, say a 15% reduction, with your 25% reduced damage from max Improved Innate Defense -Improved Lightning Reflexs, and another say 5-10% from shielding your looking at a max possible round of 24k cut by 50% down to 12k a round. So there you go, no caster would live a round on something  like that, but then again with the way Sony works, you will end up with 10-12k casters/healers by the end of the next expansion with shielding effects of there own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The aa's are a bit silly as well. Here is the reason why, from a balance standpoint: <br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with clerics and enchanters getting CA3 and LR5. <br />
<br />
But....warriors don't get anything ELSE in addition to CA3 and LR5. <br />
<br />
Clerics can get CA3 and LR5, which are melee skills....but is a warrior going to be training SCM? no? how about HG? Maybe Innate Enlightenment, for our Stamine? No again? <br />

If clerics get CA and LR, then warriors should get additional defense improving AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is it possibly balanced Gallerus?<br />
<br />
Here is your archtype AA skill tree:<br />
<br />
Combat Agility<br />
Combat Fury<br />
Combat Stability<br />
Fear Resistance<br />
Finishing Blow<br />
Improved Natural Durability<br />
Improved Natural Healing<br />
<br />
That's 7 skills you can train. Just 7. And of those 7, Fear Resistance, and Finishing Blow have extremely limited uses and are pretty much not trained until long after most people run out of stuff to put their points in (though I'm sure I've insulted some rabid fan of Finishing Blow who will be quick to defend their beloved AA). So you're looking at barely 5 AAs with any palpable use. And of those 5, the best three are Combat Agility, Combat Stability, and Natural Durability.<br />
<br />
Here is an enchanter's:<br />
<br />
Channeling Focus<br />
Mental Clarity<br />
Spell Casting Deftness<br />
Spell Casting Expertise<br />
Spell Casting Fury<br />
Spell Casting Mastery<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety<br />
<br />
AS WELL AS<br />
<br />
Combat Agility<br />
Combat Stability<br />
Natural Durability<br />
<br />
That's 10. Enchanters can train 3 more archtype AAs than you.<br />
<br />
I have no idea which of those archtype AAs are favored among enchanters, outside of Spell Casting Mastery, but I do know that the three they inherited from YOU, the MELEE, are very popular because they're extremely useful to them.<br />
<br />
Priests, like clerics, they are in the same boat. Getting 10 archtype AAs in which to train. And getting the three BEST melee AAs as the extra three.<br />
<br />
Hybrids?<br />
<br />
Well Hybrids don't even bother with a tradeoff or a limitation.<br />
<br />
They can train them ALL.<br />
<br />
So what exactly about the archtype level of AAs is balanced?<br />
<br />
Where exactly are the melees gaining anything even remotely unique to the melee archtype?<br />
<br />
The best melee arcthype skills have been co-opted to the rest of the game.</div></div><hr />

I am continually frustrated by the &quot;tanking = HP&quot; idea that SOE has grilled into EQ.  Anyone can get HP.  Not everone has access to AC.  So why in the world is EQ solely basing durability off of HP?<br />
<br />
Tanking should have been an AC thing.  If one reaches an AC level realtive to their target then they should be able to tank with a noticable amount of effeciency.  If you are below it, you incur extra costs and drag the group down.<br />
<br />
All of this is just a giant indicator that tanking is nearly useless.  It doesn't kill the monster any faster.  It doesn't offer any real level of safety that can be accomplished just as well by other tactics (mainly CC).  Just tanking, which is what Warriors have now, is nearly meangingless.  Heck what Paladins do now is barely worthwhile.<br />
<br />
These days I am pushing to get Paladins away from being known as only a class that can only tank.  Unless monster behavior and skills change, I do not want to be stuck with this.  My greatest fear is that one day I will turn around and see myself stuck where Warriors are now.</div></div><hr />

Lack of foresight, for the most part. They didn't leave enough wiggle room in the game when they created it.<br />

Like back when we were all level 5 noobs, the thought of having ALL your stats over 100 was godly. Now people are running around with 305s across the board.<br />
<br />
AC got gimped because the game mudflated out of control. Leaving the only controlled melee CHECKPOINT as hit points. 1 round of combat versus one person's hit points. The most basic way they design their encounters.<br />
<br />
I wish monster behavior and skills WOULD change, as you state.<br />
<br />
I worry about learning the game over again, BUT, eh, it'd certainly infuse some new strategies and tactics into the game for a change.<br />

I am continually frustrated by the &quot;tanking = HP&quot; idea that SOE has grilled into EQ. Anyone can get HP. Not everone has access to AC. So why in the world is EQ solely basing durability off of HP? <br />
<br />
We long since established that AC is no longer capped.  AC IS the primary tanking stat now.  Has been since PoP came out.  People just like to use HP for dick measuring.<br />
<br />
All of this is just a giant indicator that tanking is nearly useless. It doesn't kill the monster any faster. It doesn't offer any real level of safety that can be accomplished just as well by other tactics (mainly CC). Just tanking, which is what Warriors have now, is nearly meangingless. <br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
How can you say that now that the best experience comes from the higher level mobs and solo exp was nerfed to hell?  Even if you could kill the harder mobs with a non-tank tanking, you would pay for it with increased downtime.  Especialy if said tank couldn't reliably live long enough to use CH to heal him.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a high risk LDoN mission done faster &quot;with other tactics mainly CC&quot; instead of using a tank.<br />
<br />
You guys are also totaly neglecting class skills such as dodge, parry, etc.  Tanking is more than HP.  Casters need the HP and defensive AAs to survive.  Their AC (which I've been told IS still capped for them) hasn't changed much since luclin.  Meanwhile tank ac almost doubled.  Non-uber casters totaly gib on PoP exp mobs.<br />
<br />
Warriors already struggle to aggro off people.  The last thing they need are casters who frenzy in one round when they aggro off them.  High-end caster gear may have a bit too much hp, but who cares?  They are still healing mana sponges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would make a difference if an Item with 150 HP equipped by a warrior would stay at 150 HP but equipped by a Paladin would loose 10 to 15 % so it would be remaining at 135 to 128 hP.<br />
<br />
When now the buffs ( virtue ) give around 15 % more HP to the warrior a 9 k hp Tank would get around 1350 hp and a 7 k warrior only 1050 HP. <br />
<br />
So the Paladin would wear the same equippment but stays around 15 % less hp than the warrior and also gets the same percentage but less absolute out of the buffs.<br />
<br />
Change then the CH from fix 7.500 to a 85 % of the HP Heal and it would benefit all the same but the paladin less absolute.<br />
<br />
When they made this they can bring out all Items as all/ all and nowbody would rant cause the difference would be the class specific changes of that item.<br />
<br />
Thats one of the major wrong parts in itemisation, buffing and healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AC is meaningless facing monsters really hard monsters like raid targets.  Its all about HP especially if you aren't tanking but the monster is throwing around AE damage.  AC is only a minor bonus outside of the raid.  Given sufficient HP levels, you don't need AC.<br />
<br />
Once again it is SOE decision to make HP mean everything.  I wouldn't care if Shamans can get 8K HP if I could last noticable amount of time longer because I'm supposed to be sporting much higher damage mitigation.  ARG!</div></div><hr />

The problem is mobs that take 70+ people to kill.  Sure, there's tons of strategy in working with that many people, but when you boil it right down, it's a zerg fest. With enough healers, and enough high hp items, agro is all that matters.  chanters have good agro.  Nuff said.<br />
<br />
The game changes once you need so many people.  Mobs that hit for such rediculous numbers isn't even the same game anymore.  Rotting trash items in Time have such rediculous hps that hps are a non-factor.  Buffs are soo rediculously overpowered that hps are a non-factor.  <br />
<br />
The only thing left is whether you are having fun.  If you are having fun, none of the rest of that stuff matters.  That guild had fun tanking with a chanter.  It was something fun to do.  And they did it.  Fun = teh win.<br />
<br />
Hunt well,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to add my 2cp...<br />
<br />
Why should chanters be nerfed because one tanked a mob in Po Time?  Would you like the one that you group with to die faster than he/she already does?<br />
<br />
Getting hit with the nerf bat makes playing the game less fun for almost everyone, especially the nerfee.  It's very disappointing to work on a character for months/years only to have abilities permanently deleted, it's taking enjoyment out of playing.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem with your class where you can't do what you think you're supposed to do, petition for it.  Ask for more hit points or better AC instead of ranting about others having too much.<br />

They'll get their AA points refunded. No harm, no foul.<br />
<br />
Just like Bards did. Just mages did.<br />
<br />
There really is no adequate reason for spell casters to be masters of lightning reflexes in any sense of the RPG or class divisions in Everquest. Gandalf, Raistlin, Merlin ... these are not people who studied the fine arts of combat and war and mastered them.<br />
<br />
Warriors, monks, rogues ... THESE are the people who should be avoiding, mitigating, and soaking up melee damage. And thus these are the people who should have access to melee centric abilities.<br />
<br />
I mean hell, at this point why not give Warriors Divine Resurrection, Monks Lifeburn and Rogues Exodus?<br />
<br />
Class descriptions mean that little to the people who made the AA decisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a multitude of problems, but let's try to confine ourselves to an enchanter tanking a mob that hits a Warrior for 1kHPs.<br />
<br />
A cloth wearer should not be able to survive being hit by a non-trivial mob.<br />
<br />
Cloth should not provide any significant protection against melee damage. No robe should have high AC. AC, AA Abilities, and innate mitigation would moderate damage.<br />
<br />
Cloth Wearers should not have AA abilities that increase their mitigation.<br />
<br />
Cloth Wearers should not have 7kHP's.<br />
<br />
Cloth wearers should be able to achieve high resists. Avoidance is probably appropriate. Runes are ok.<br />
<br />
IF SoE fixed things (doubtful at this point) aggro counter measures like Concussion Pants or pets would be used to insure a Caster wasn't physically hit. Resists would mitigate damage from non-melee.<br />
<br />
The same principles can be applied to leather, chain, plate, and heavy plate wearers.<br />
<br />
The problem is SoE can't really do this.<br />
<br />
Paladins would argue that a well-equipped Paladin should be able to MT just as well as an above average Warrior. Since above average Warriors MT new content mobs mobs, then from a role standpoint a well-equipped Paladin = a Warrior.<br />
<br />
But chain wearers shouldn't be left out. Shouldn't a well-equipped Ranger MT as well as an above average Paladin?<br />
<br />
And how about Monks? ad infinitum.<br />
<br />
Warriors had on the order of a 400HP - 1kHP advantage over Paladins after buffs. They and other classes were tanking PoTime endgame mobs. We all know how anemic SoE's Warrior mitigation fix was.<br />
