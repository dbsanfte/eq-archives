This is from the Paladin boards and it is about melee balancing. I think it shows that many people realize how messed up warriors are. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carwenst</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point was that even those hated paladins recognize that warriors need a ton of work done to them. When they are saying that there needs to be major revamp done to warriors and that it would be better for the development team to fix those issues than to do anything with palis I would think someone would notice that. /shrug. I guess it is not as cool when you realize that they have some of the same goals as warriors do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have a problem holding aggro. Sure anyone can pull aggro off me if they wanted to. Not many people want to. Heck, just about any caster or hybrid can pull aggro off any tank, knights included. <br />
<br />
Rooted mobs are an issue, but they are an issue for everyone, not just warriors. If there wasn't a side effect to rooting a mob, we'd be begging for root proccing weapons, or keep a mob permanently rooted.</div></div><hr />

Them I hate, well dislike strongly is probably closer to the truth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Sardaan.... play your warrior more ;)... you'll notice that there really IS a problem.<br />
And you'll also notice maybe that Root isnt a problem at all, but actually a extremely helpfull way of getting aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate a lot of paladins, most in fact.  I'll give ones I've never met before the benefit of the doubt, but the majority I've met have large egos, and that doesn't mix well with me at all.<br />
<br />
On my cleric one time, I needed to recoup my losses in groups (used a whole stack before, 210pp gone), but the paladin wanted to loot also, saying that everyone else needed money too.  He used his LoH next round because I waited a tad later than normal (still would have got him...in fact he used it after my CH landed...I got the message &quot;You have healed Soandso for ~3100 points of healing.&quot;), then started complaining to me asking where my heals were.  /boggle.  Was kinda glad to see him die on the times he did.  He eventually left on his own and we got another paladin, this one with a better attitude (and about 900 more hp despite being lower level).:D <br />
<br />
Also there's the fact that Paladins whined about the cleric hammers when clerics NEEDED something to give them a boost.  Whether or not those whinings were responsible, (cleric hammers were nerfed very soon after), the fact remains they screamed to high heaven because clerics could actually do a small bit of damage other than nuking.  They didn't even wait for parsings, just linked the fact that a maxed level cleric with much better gear than almost 99% of all clerics will get could solo in the old Hate.<br />
<br />
I'm not even going into the Slay Undead and how they want all the benefits without any downsides.  I respect their abilities...paladins are incredibly powerful.  They have more boosts (read: advantages) to their class than almost any other class.  I certainly don't mind having a paladin around in raids or groups...just kill the dang ego and understand everyone else is not here to help paladins &quot;solo&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyone not understand now why I have the message below as my sig?</div></div><hr />

Its as simple as that.  Although one can argue a sociological angle to it, there is no hard or fast rule that says no Warrior are immaculate and Paladins are scum.</div></div><hr />
