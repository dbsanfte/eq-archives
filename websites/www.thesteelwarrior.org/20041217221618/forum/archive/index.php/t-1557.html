<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking today, how well would it work if warriors could train in different abilities sort of like the Call of Fire effect, yet they would be innate instead of taking a buff slot?<br />
<br />
Something like a different DD for each element, maybe a lifetap one, one with just pure hate (low amount, 150 or so)...Some innate proc that would happen regardless of the weapons we wielded? The possibilities are really endless as to what the proc could do. They shoudl be varied though.<br />
<br />
Just brainstorming at lunch, and I can't find anything too imbalancing about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raychael</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wouldn't this stop us from being pure melee though??? Personally if I wanted to shoot fireballs out of my arse I would have been a dress wearing finger wiggler...... I just want my taunt to work more then 40-50% of the time...... just a thought though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really, since we already have procs on weapons, and like I said we wouldnt &quot;cast&quot; them or they wouldnt be buffs. It would be more like...The innate procs that come with werewolf illusion.<br />
<br />
Good point though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be so cool. It wouldn't be a spell, we wouldn't be wiggleing fingers, it would be kinda like instead of going into beserker mode, just every now and again something strange happens when we fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea personally, innate hate procs could open up numerous weapons to warriors, which are useless to us now.  One thing about it, we would have to be able to turn it off and on... don't want to be stealing aggro with it when not MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes hussar what I had in mind was something like a rogues sneak or something..where once activated it would stay active until we wanted to turn it off.<br />
<br />
It could be implemented as an AA skill tree actually (I know, aa's arent the answer) where at level 1 of say, Elemental Proc: Ice, its a 50dd..at level 3 its 150+stun...then you could train in the other ones as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do think there should be some use for the satmina bar...<br />
<br />
Going Beserk at will would be a nice start....<br />
Channelling an Enraging blow...<br />
Crushing an openent and Knocking him down...<br />
 <br />
so many different combat moves and techniques that could be created and use stamina.</div></div><hr />

I am sure you would have them lined up to watch that display...</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL Land :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say give warriors a innate ability to create cheese.<br />
<br />
Nuff said!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just like the fact that something like that would be innate, and not gear dependent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">could have like thow linburger cheese at your oponent. That should give lots of hate :p<br />
<br />
or cover your oponent in cheddar cheese and then call out to the rats would work like a dot with a hate modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, every weapon should have an added 'hate' stat. this stat would be the amout of pure hate that it causes when it connects. It would be a stat usable only by warriors, much like the damage bonus is only usable by melee. <br />
<br />
This stats would vary depending upon the weapon. ex. getting cut by a katana, nice smooth clean  slashing cut vs getting hit by a jagged blade with gouging and bleeding wounds that hurts like hell would have more innate hate... <br />
<br />
IMO.. innate hate is the way we need to look, fixxing broken taunt would help, but we need some way to generate hate besides just procs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raychael</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you hungry Apothes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a good idea, but that would just be more unreliability... it's all based on luck, and luck is by its very nature unreliable.  Idon't like the fact that we're the most one sided tank, we pay for being the supposed &quot;best&quot; tank by being completely one sided and specialized, yet we're the only one whos aggro generation has nothing to do with skill and everything to do with luck.... that's what got us into this mess to begin with.<br />
<br />
I'd be much happier with an ability that is able to be activated, to give aggro generation on demand as opposed to by pure chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">eatin now hehe mainly was boored so was my poor attempt at humor hehe but would be cool to see rats commin out to naw on your advasary you coated in cheese :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it would be an agro fix, but it would be something to look forward to at least. Have it not be tied to AA's though and have it be warrior only.<br />
<br />
It would just be something more to think about than hit auto attack, kick, disarm, taunt,defensive, position, rinse, repeat.</div></div><hr />

LOL thats about accurate Aveen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would be great to add a few bits of 'spice' to our contribution, certainly wouldn't go down bad. Not sure we could expect any  type of EB hate ability in relation to this though other effects though sure...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would be sweet if we could choose between a few ranges of different procs.<br />
Having to choose between that fast procing low dmg cold based proc,<br />
or the slow, medium dmg lifetap one etc... :p<br />
<br />
could be implemented sort of like /disc<br />
<br />
where you do /artofwar , or something :D, then get a list of all the ones available, and you get new ones every certain levels, a la disc.<br />
<br />
a couple of problems though :(<br />
<br />
1) soe might see the adding of Hate to current hate weapons as overpowering.<br />
<br />
2) they're still procs, and we'll still have the same problem about depending on the RNG, although we'de have more chances of procing now.<br />
<br />
<br />
but would be sweetsweet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Real simple solution to adding hate to current hate weapons being overpowering. Give us the innate ability to imbue any weapon we touch with a hate proc that scales up with level, and change every EB weapon in the game to proc ykesha or some nice DD/Dot or something.  Everyone who plays a warrior and everyone at SOE who's willing to look at this game realistically knows that EB is just a crutch and that it's not a solution to our problems, but at least if it was innate and not based on itemisation, ALL warriors would be better off, instead of just the ones who have the time/resources to get the best drops or to save up a ridiculous amount of plat to buy a droppable EB weapon.  And let's not forget that Paladins and Rangers can imbue their weapons with procs, and IIRC, they can stack their imbue proc onto a weapon that already has a proc of it's own.  But then, that can't be called overpowered, 'cause they're hybrids and they gave up so much to get a spellbook.  :D</div></div><hr />
