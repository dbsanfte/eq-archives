<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is too small to do this alone so we are working with friends on learning the script.<br />
We seem to have TZ OK now.  We put a knight on him to avoid having to deal with RGC removal of the snare/slow curse.  This works great.  I spoke with some people who advocate using a warrior - makes no sense to me.  But we have this part in the bag and win it reliably.  I need advice on other parts.<br />
<br />
We are starting to work on VZ but failing. <br />
I'd like to know if its possible to get VZ single or do we just need to pre-target the adds and mez them as they rush.<br />
<br />
If its possible to single VZ, please advise how in detail.<br />
<br />
If its not possible to single VZ, what do your group compositions look like?  I'm guessing each group who is targeting an add should  have a Malo type (Shaman, Mage, Bard OOS) and a Mezzer (Enchanter, Bard).  The Malo'er malos and the mezzer mezzes ASAP as they all run down the hall after pulling.<br />
<br />
Then the MA assigned for VZ gets to work.  A further question:  Should we put a Knight on VZ also?  I seem to recall getting the same snare/slow curse on me from VZ as TZ gives.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your assistance.<br />
We are having fun learning on our own but its quite tiring and a little help from those who have beat their heads against it already would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

My guild was working on this event both before and after GoD.  We believe the VZ portion of the event was modified at GoD's release to make the adds harder to deal with.  However, that said, our pullers still managed to get VZ singly last time.<br />
<br />
GoD also brought about a change to the pit portion of the event (RZTW).  The spoilers you will receive from most people are outdated, and the event is slightly harder now than it was last month.  Just a heads up.</div></div><hr />

Why bother with all that? Send one monk to pull VZ and friends till leash snaps him back. Have other monk pull the newly warped VZ back to raid. Kill. Hope first monk lives to tell the tale. If not, drag him/her back and get ready for RZ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any Diaku Elite that is not in RZ room when he dies will add to the pit.  This has been that way since day 1.   What this means is that if your enchanters mez Elites before they enter the doors to the room they WILL come to the pit.   If you fight RZ outside the room you will ALWAYS get Elite adds on pop.</div></div><hr />

We made 0 changes to the way we do RZ and in the two times we've been since GoD came out, we've had 3 elites spawn with him in the pit.<br />
<br />
They're mezzable so it's not a HUGE deal, but it sure feels like a change to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well we've killed RZ outside his room everytime, and never got Daiku elites with real RZ until GoD patch or near then (we hadn't killed RZ for 2 weeks prior to GoD)...<br />

So that's confusing.</div></div><hr />

It is no big deal, Monk just pull them and we kill it first.<br />

We have had pretty good luck on BoWar drop rate, 8 out of 37 raids on him.  Waiting for his next though cause it is mine.<br />

<br />
We got a stouter crew and were working our way in to Berik or Grun and they were not up.  However VZ was on track.  This was a good hour after our downing of TZ.  I'm not sure if VZ had agro on someone that was FD or what kind of buggy crud was at play, but it was pretty cool.  We just marched into TZ hallway and pulled VZ, downed him and his splits and then killed fake RZ.  We still ended up dying on RZtW but I thought it was quite interesting that VZ was up WAY after the 20 min after TZ had been killed.<br />
<br />
Fun and games in Drunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this for the first time last night.  We got VZ single pull, no idea how.  Did fake RZ in his room and had about 4 ogres drop in to say hi.  They nearly wiped us.  Dunno where they came from but it was brutal.  So, those of us who were alive AE TL'd out and we started summoning the dead.  There was a raid bug so we all had to leave and reform.  Almost exactly 20 minutes after RZtW spawned, he poofed as we were in the pit and about to engage.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to shed insight as to whether the poof was because of time running out or because the raid that killed the fake RZ no longer existed?  Considering that there are 5 American guilds trying to get RZtW on our server (and who knows how many Europeans), it would be nice to know what we did wrong so we can not have him poof again since it could be a long time before we see him again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to awaken a dying thread. :)<br />
<br />
Ok, we did the RZ script last night and noted a few changes, though nothing seemed to be drastic.<br />
<br />
Enter the ring, clear to the spot, and kill the two named Decorins per usual to start the script.  Tallon Zek spawns immedietly and we Knight tank him as usually.  Noted change:<br />
<br />
-TZ seemed to have A LOT more HP now, but I noticed the tank's health wasn't plummeting like crazy as usual.  Also, we had the Knights in the tank lineup meleeing him in the rear and they weren't getting hit by Tallon's AEs.<br />
<br />
Tallon Zek dead and raid moves to his corpse to ready for Vallon.<br />
<br />
Normally, we alway always ALWAYS got Vallon Zek single.  We've done the script quite a few times, both wins and losses, but needless to say Vallon has died to our fingertips more times than I can even count and we've never experienced what happened.  Noted change:<br />
<br />
-Four of the splitting ogres, forgot what their names are, seemed agro linked to Vallon.  We simply coudn't get them split.  We wiped the first time because we weren't expecting it, but the next round up we were prepared and our enchanter team mezzed them.  <br />
<br />
Ok, so Vallon is dead, only now we have four extra splitting mobs to clear before we get to Rallos Zek.   Geezuz, I hope we don't run out of time!<br />
<br />
We cleared Rallos's room and set the tank in position.  At 50-60%, he poofed with the normal charge of ogres storming us as we AE-TL out.<br />
<br />
Moved down to the pit for Rallos Zek the Warlord.  We didn't hesistate to find out whether it is 15 or 20 minutes for him to dissapear, but we pulled him about 14 minutes after the first Rallos Zek.  Other than that, I didn't notice anything different.  The adds came as usual, but they seemed to be the same amount.  We had 6 enchanters present to the raid, so Rallos Zek the Warlord went down SO freaking fast.  I think only 3 waves of adds came before the mighty God of War fell at our feet.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, 2 Blades of War baby!  :)<br />
<br />
Conclusion:  TZ seems to have a lot more hp, but does less dps.  Four ogres seem agro linked to VZ.  That's about all I noticed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was the third time we've killed Rallos actually.  The first time we got double Blades of War.  The second time was a bit of a dissapointment, but his other loots are still quite exceptional.  This time, as mentioned above, dual Blades of War again.  :D  So that's 4 in 3 kills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've done RZtW event a total of 4 times now in the past week, 3 in one night, due to 2 wipes on VZ, and another just now, with a wipe on VZ. Guild giving it another try i believe, but I'm done for the night.<br />
<br />
Every wipe to VZ has been for one reason and one reason only- the 4 or 5 splitting adds that we've gotten. This hasn't ever happened before, and as a previous poster mentioned, they seem linked to VZ. The first time we wiped, VZ aggroed while we were all still outside map room, and he brought the Gindan adds as well. I think this might have been because our puller got one of VZ's new guards single, and the rest aggroed us once we engaged. Same thing happened again the 2nd time that night, but the 3rd time we were ready. And then just now, we killed VZ and his splits, with only several deaths, but then killed one of the mezzed gindans just as 2 mezzes were broken, and we wiped.<br />
<br />
Based on our first wipe to VZ, I don't think he has a tether. We were well outside map room, all the way in the corner, but he still stayed there and killed us. I also think the 4 or 5 Gindan guards are aggro-linked to VZ, because tonight we had 2 of the gindans in the map room corner, for several seconds, before VZ and the remaining guards came running in as well, even though the raidleader/puller pulled the two cleanly.<br />
<br />
So does anyone have any ideas on how to take VZ or his guards separately?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So that's 4 in 3 kills.<br />
<br />
I hate you.<br />
<br />
5 kills.  1 BoW.<br />
<br />
Of course, our luck with aggro weapons has been bad since the guild was created.  We averaged one BoC for every 4 AoW kills back when we were trying to get them.  And don't even get me started on Ssra...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VZ is tethered, but it's a long tether.  There is a short set of stairs at the far west end of the TZ hallway; the top step is the end of VZ's tether.  If you position your raid at the southwest corner, you can pull all of the Gindans+VZ together, and VZ will warp home before he reaches the raid.<br />
<br />
But there is so little time available on this stage of the event timer, that you really don't want to kill those 5 x 2.5 = 12.5 Gindans if you can help it.  Better for your monks to spend 5-10 minutes working on getting VZ singly.  I have seen it done, even after this change to the event, but I have no idea how my guild's monks did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually, the tether is slightly longer than that.  My guild pulls all the guards first, then VZ and we just fight him at the bottom of the stairs in the same place we fight TZ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we ended up getting a raid force on last night, to find that the TWers on the nameless also wiped to RZ, so we gave it another go. Had about 70 people on the raid, as opposed to 90ish on our try 2 days ago. We had some trouble on TZ, as he got turned from his corner and killed a bunch of people, but he still went down pretty easily. To pull VZ, we had a pally use DA, and train VZs room away from us, with another pally following the mobs to drag them even farther away. When VZ popped back due to tether, monk pulled him and we still got 3 adds somehow. Some members of the raid had heard that VZs gindan guards have the same tether range as VZ himself, so that might be why we got the adds. Still, we beat VZ relatively cleanly, with only 3 or 4 deaths. RZ went down even easier, and we TLed out to get FoE and head to the pit. Then our problems began.<br />
<br />
Our raid assembled above the pit, in the SW corner. We levitated down, and everyone was supposed to stay as close to the SW corner as possible. One botted cleric wasn't paying attention or something, so we ended up getting premature aggro while only 3/4 of the raid was in position, and 2 clerics went down right off the bat. Still, we recovered and seemed to be doing okay. Than we realized that in our haste, PoSeasons was never given out, so RZs AE dot was eating our melee and clerics both. Our kiting team was a little small, due to everyone trying to maximise DPS on RZtW. As a result, several things ended up happening at once. Pallies/rangers/shamans/druid who weren't kiting were busy trying to heal themselves because of the DOT, rather than spot heal the tank and do dps. Clerics started getting really low on both hp and mana, and our tank went down because heals were getting slower. One kiter died at exactly the same instant, and he had at least 15 mobs on him, which then trained towards RZtW. The second and third tanks were only at 40% health because of the DOT, so they didnt grab aggro, and RZ started raping us. A pally had healed me, so i went defensive and AE Taunted as many of the adds as i could, and tried kiting them. They managed to outrun FoE somehow though, and RZ summoned me and killed me. We wiped.<br />
<br />
Oh well. If we had been better prepared, had a few more people on, especially CC (only had 1 bard and 3 chanters on) we would have possibly won. This event is much harder than it used to be prior to GoD though. We were 1 for 1 pre-GoD, now we are 0 for 6 since then. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The day after GoD release, I had VZ poof on his tether at the top of the steps.  So the limit is somewhere right around the steps.  Don't let him near the steps if you are trying to actually kill him.  The gindans had no trouble walking down the steps and being killed in the SW corner, so if they have a tether, I haven't seen it.</div></div><hr />

Either our monks have figured out the Vallon pull, or its back to normal.  He came single.  We went on to beat RZ and I'm now the newest BoW wielder on Veeshan ;)<br />

Thanks to my great guildmates and some friends from Azure Guard.</div></div><hr />

Hi SoE, VZ is the 'God of Tactics', not Georgi fucking Zhukov.</div></div><hr />

We've done him 8 times before and never got adds with VZ.  Wiped first time, went down like buttah second time cause chanters and OTs were ready.</div></div><hr />

VZ can be annoying sometimes when u fu*k up, We even had VZ + 11 Adds from the room once , was pretty crazy that we won.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">VZ has larger aggro radius and a bunch of guards who spawn on top of him. This has been the case since the script was changed when GoD was released. Use a DA'ed pal/shad/bard with sow/shrew to pull VZ and every mob in the map room out the opposite side and away from your raid. If the DA'ed person gets VZ and all adds far enough away, VZ reaches his tether and warps back to map room, alone, where he can then be pulled singly.<br />
<br />
Yes, the first few times my guild encountered this change, we got premature aggro with 6-8 adds, and only won once in 5 attempts. Now we have this portion of the event covered pretty easily, but respawns in the hall while we kill vz/rz and all of RZtWs adds still give us trouble.</div></div><hr />
