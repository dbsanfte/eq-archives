<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time. Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons<br />
<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate. The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
<br />
6) Shields and blocking<br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like a bunch of crap that isn't gonna happen or wont benifit us in any way.<br />
<br />
I should just put Fuck you Verant in my sig.</div></div><hr />

(Large race warriors should get this anyway since halflings and gnomes can use our 2handers)  :p<br />
And yes Aveen, it sounds like crap to me too.  Go ahead and update that sig. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ever since i bought Diablo2 I figured you should be able to ( as warriors ) equip a 2Her in the role of a 1H weapon...i swear that alone would make things interesting. I know it's a different game but still in a RP and true_gameplay enviroment there should be no limits whatsoever on what a Warrior; a PURE MELEE DAMAGE ABSORBTION CLASS; should be excluded from.<br />
<br />
Especially when using a shield in secondary as mentioned. It could work right across the board for warriors from 1 to 65; on all grades of weapons from wherever; and who knows.<br />
<br />
Even if they took the weapons and made the stat/ratio's a 1H/2H version ( kinda along the lines of &quot;recommended level&quot; stat +/- ) it would bring to warriors the encroachment onto hybrids insane DPS numbers they have now ( counting their magical abilities ) et not taking anyhting away from the hybrids in return. It's a longshot; but imagine the DW combo of a TSBS/FB4 shield or the DW combo of Galdaurek and the JBoW; or even down to using a mith 2Her/exe axe :D <br />
<br />
bad part of this is...it'll go to pal/sk's too ( since their first gripe would be &quot;we're like warirors too!!  we NEED this ! ) and expect to use 2Hers with a shield that has the insane effects/stats they have now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will only make a difference if they:<br />
<br />
1. Unhook disciplines and make it so using one disc doesn't lock out the rest until it re-cycles.<br />
2. Make them re-cycle faster.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
3. Change them completely.<br />
<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons<br />
<br />
Bah, more &quot;balancing by item&quot;. Otherwise known as... the top 20% of melee getting better while the remainder stay the same. Of course SOE might surprise me... :eek:</div></div><hr />

... fat chance of that ...</div></div><hr />

They don't care if we never get groups, and they still won't let us solo after that. switch games is the answer, let it sink in deep.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I almost just posted this thread in the outhouse...<br />
<br />
I was basically going to ask if I was missing something of if these changes were basically not going to help warriors are all?<br />
<br />
a /disc or item fix as a CLASS fix just seems stupid...<br />
<br />
Who will be able to get the new items?<br />
- probably just the high end warriors who have said that they are already fine<br />
<br />
Can I use the new disc or do i still need to save for defensive / evasive for boss tanking, or furious for &quot;oh shit&quot; XP group situations?<br />
- probably still need to save, unless they unhook them, or make the durations / reuses on offensive ones similar to defensive / evasive<br />
<br />
Will taking hits even better using 1-hand and shield help the warrior?<br />
- no, we will then have even more trouble holding agro / obtaining agro while knight classes will get the AC/HP/stat boost of a shield (and blocking or whatever they add) to narrow the tanking gap... and still use spells to hold agro.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something obvious?  or am I pretty much right on target here with this line of thinking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dokor</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main problem here is that obviously SOE don't give a damn about what we are saying here.<br />
<br />
We've been asking for an upgrade of taunt for almost a year (corect me if i'm wrong on that :p) and all that we saw was nothing..well almost they did throw us a bone to let us play with it at a fan fair.<br />
<br />
I used to be pissed of when they gived what made us THE tank in almost every situation to knights but i don't care anymore as long as i can tank mob like the avatar of war (i love being spam with 1k+ hits :p) and group with my guildmates i'll be fine</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple fix, make it so Warriors get dmg bonus to off hand, and make our main hand dmg bonus 50% bigger then other classes.<br />
<br />
On another note, Sony shot themselve in the foot with the damn dmg bonus, and how people always go for the fastest posible weapon because of it.</div></div><hr />
