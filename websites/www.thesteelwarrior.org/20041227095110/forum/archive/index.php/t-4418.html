<br />
I surpassed 20 a few days ago while in Paludal Caverns.  I actually camped there with an awesome group and hit 24 in 4 hours.<br />
<br />
During that time, I noticed my damage cap came off for 2HS at 20, but from 20-24, I noticed no increase in dmg.  In fact, the most I ever hit for, with the exception of a couple 100+ crits, was 60.  I know I only surpassed 20 by 4 lvls, but shouldn't my 2HS dmg be increasing as my skill increases?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatanka7th</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I remember reading way back when that's there's another (higher) cap until level 30, in this case, 60.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 30 (or 31?) then the last cap is removed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah! We're all guessing, and I am too lazy to really look it up as well. My warrior was level 20 a long time ago, so my recollection is sketchy, but here goes my remembrance/guess... :p <br />
<br />
Your damage is capped until level 20. If your weapon is a 6 damage 1-hander you'll never notice that there was a damage cap; but you would with a 14 damage 1-hander. Likewise for 2-handers. I recall that the best weapon to get your skill up was an Axe of the Iron Back (16/37) because before level 20 it always let you hit your cap of 33 damage, if I recall correctly. Problem was, if you stuck it out with the 16 damage 2-hander at level 21+ you'd still not really notice a damage increase, because your modal damage was still around that same 33 damage mark. You'd notice the increase with a 21 damage 2-hander, though.<br />
<br />
Now...level 30...if I recall correctly (and I'm real fuzzy on this one) before level 30 you could only get three attacks maximum per round, even if both dual wield and double attack fired off at the same time. At level 30+, you could get 4 attacks off in one round. Of course, this meant nothing if you didn't *both* dual wield and double attack.<br />
<br />
Then, later on, they added the primary hand damage bonus, which starts at level 28 and works its way up from there (+1 at level 28, up to +13 or +14 at level 65). This has nothing to do with the original game's damage caps, it's just an added bonus for being a melee class.<br />
<br />
Feel free to correct or expand on my comments since, like I said, I'm kinda fuzzy on this myself.</div></div><hr />

I think till 20 its around 100 dmg per hit a lil more with high strength. Then, I think it then goes up to 150 at 30. At 65 dmg cap is around 450 I think for regular hit. (although on 65 cap dont quote me since I just dont have acess to insane dmg weapons to have any proof)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it should also be mentioned the uncaped means you can hit for the old standard of 2x weapon damage +1. 1h wepons never receved this cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm I always believed that basically:<br />
<br />
MaximumDamage = WeaponDamage * ((Strength + WeaponSkill) / 100) + DamageBonus<br />
<br />
Str over 255 doesnt seem to count.  Also 2h weapons skew this a bit....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beldain</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From 1-9 dmg cap is 21 from 9-20 dmg cap is 29 and after that i <br />
<br />
didnt notice a dmg cap at all, with my wurmy (ino ino  :mad: ) i hit <br />
<br />
in or around 60+, also dmg bonus starts with 1 at lvl 30 not 28, <br />
<br />
or at least it was 30 on my bst, i beleive it was 30 on war also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lirelle</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here it is from my experience and the way that I understand it.<br />
<br />
Lvls 1-9 = 16 Cap (I believe)<br />
Lvls 9-20 = 29 Cap<br />
Lvls 21+ = No Cap<br />
<br />
Also, the damage bonus does in fact start at level 28.  All one handers have the exact same damage bonus (based upon your level) but two handers damage bonus varies based upon your level and the weapons delay.<br />
<br />
There is a very good chart at Lucy which was put together by the Paladins of Norath.  <br />

Hope this helps out.</div></div><hr />
