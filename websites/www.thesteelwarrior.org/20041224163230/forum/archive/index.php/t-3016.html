<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the really interesting thing that's happening right now is the weapons augmentations.<br />
<br />
I'm really not sure how the procs work so I'll stay away from the details. It looks like you can add Y'Kesha to your BoC and get a 125 DD 0 stun proc in addition to the regular EB for example. Anger III which is 300 Hate can give your CHoS or GBoS (or even Honed Yak) a much needed aggro boost (I wish it was 500, it would be on my Ornate Greatblade in a flash).<br />
<br />
I'm very happy about this. Not only is it useful to Warriors with very high quality weapons, but it ought to make a lot of mid-level Warriors estatic.<br />
<br />
We still have two issues: ranged aggro and dealing with a string of lucky hits from a big mob that would kill anybody.<br />
<br />
But this should help us all to hold taunt.<br />
<br />
Wheee!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could it be of benefit?  Certainly.  But if procs were really the answer, would there be a question?  We have procs.  We have procs up the wazoo.  Factoring in more procs means we're still dependent on the random number generator.  And you know what a stone cold bitch lady luck can be.<br />
<br />
I'm divided.  On the one hand I see that this could reduce the problem.  But I also see it as something that people perceive as the solution to the problem, which I'm pretty sure it won't be.  And if we let SoE off the hook, this is the best we're likely to see.  Are we sure it's enough?  Also it comes after a mountain load of effort.  Your common mid-level Warrior is going to be at it for a while to get even one of these better augmentations, let alone more than one.  Is itemization the correct way to address an inherant class imbalance?  It hasn't really worked so far, has it?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also consider this.  While we're spending weeks or months gathering enough points to purchase proc aguments just to generate enough aggro control to be somewhat effective, where are the Knights going to be spending their points?  I'd think AC/HP/STA/and so forth.  So while we end up with clunky randomized aggro generation, which is still better than the current situation, they narrow the gap between us in every other way just that much more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with this is, it's not exactly easy to obtain the ammount of points needed for these aggro proc weapons. Also, hybrids may not take the Anger procs, but a 150dd stun? I could see a ranger or beastlord addign that to a weapon for more dps. So... it's not exactly the godsend fix for the warrior class that some people think it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, despite my enthusiasm (it's a bone, but at least they remember where our cage is!) there is two points I'll absolutely agree with:<br />
<br />
SoE's attitude seems to be &quot;It wasn't broke. This is way to upgrade your weapons.&quot; Well aggro weapons + taunt held aggro so so if everyone practiced aggro discipline. But as we know Knights hold it a lot better. It was broken, we didn't break it, and they are making us earn a fix.<br />
<br />
And we don't even know if this is a fix. All we know is that this is another rat race that promices cheese someday.<br />

Since everyone can get procs, it does not help us more than anyone else. <br />

<br />
I haven't heard of that.  Perhaps you are thinking of the Vie line of spells.  These are castable by Clerics and Enchanters.  They act as a 'partial rune', absorbing %10 and %20 of incoming damage until they are used up.  These spells can be cast on any class, but would be very helpful to a Knight tanking a mob that is a bit tougher than normal.<br />
<br />
All Paladins got in LDoN is the Remove Minor Curse spell (for low levels) and some warmed over, reduced quality hand-me-down Cleric buffs. <br />

<br />
The ENC (20%) version looks like it is actually a Spell Rune (20% reduction in spell damage over 8k) and that CLR are the only ones able to grant this 'defensive' ability (10% reduction in melee damage over 16k).<br />
<br />
Still speculation ATM though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We don’t particularly like when abilities are obsoleted by items. Enraging Blow items were a temporary fix for a systems problem that has unfortunately stuck around too long.  <br />
<br />
It would appear that they have come full circle on the concept and have decided to run with it rather than rework it from the ground up.</div></div><hr />

or, if i absofickenlootly need to get agro i can us 2 weapons with 2 procs each.<br />

now my only beef with augments is that my fricken ToV/thrug gear has the SAME GODDAMN MOD SLOTS CLOTH DOES!!! *cough* erm ya hehe, <br />

<br />
The Problem with tieing aggro to weapon procs is that warriors become too reliant on gear to perform their primary job.  We have already seen through mudflation that this cures nothing.<br />
<br />
I got the first BoC ever dropped (the preUpgrade 15/23 no EB kind from first LoS/SoS AoW kill).  It was a great bonus to have when EB got upgraded onto it.  But is it effective today?  Did it cure anything?  Even when I use BoC/Hategiver combo, does that cure the aggro problem?  Rarely.<br />
<br />
To cure aggro, there will have to be balancing done.  Fix warrior taunt.  Nerf Pally/SK spells hate values.  Adjust DPS or something, anything to bring it back into line so that warriors are NOT PURELY tied to 2 or 3 weapons.  Otherwise, you will continue to see the slow migration away from the base tank class being the best tank class. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I see it, on the positive side having a 2nd proc on my BoC should in theory mean twice as many procs.<br />
<br />
Considering that spells fizzle and spells can be interrupted its fair to say that Knights are also at the mercy of the random number generator - they fizzle as the mob is inc and then fail to channel while fighting and there isnt going to be any of the snap agro us warriors are so envious of.<br />
<br />
The issue is not so much never having to depend on the RNG, but more of what are acceptable odds.<br />
<br />
If the odds of a knight fizzling or failing to channel are small enough that the knight can have acceptable agro from this, at what point do the odds of getting a weapon proc within the first 10 seconds, combined with the odds of you having a successful taunt after slow lands become acceptable.<br />
<br />
If for example a BoC procs on average 2x per minute and adding a 2nd proc gives you 4 procs per minute would 1 proc every 15 seconds be acceptable odds against the RNG?  How about your droga combo with a 2nd proc on each, assuming 2 procs per minute from each proc with 4 procs you now have 8 procs per minute.  Pretty decent odds to get some sort of hate proc every 10 seconds, is that acceptable odds ?<br />
<br />
My only concern to counter this is that knights not needing to augment their weapons with hate procs to hold agro will either augment with DD procs to close the DPS gap or guard procs to close the tanking gap, but then consider dual wielders can now have 4 procs vs a knight having 2, and also isnt it fair that if we close the gap on thier agro advantage they get to close the gap on our mitigation / DPS advantage?<br />
<br />
Hope some of that makes sense~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if we close the gap on thier agro advantage they get to close the gap on our mitigation / DPS advantage?<br />
<br />
Haven't they been closing it for the last four expansions?  How much closer should it get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From an XP group perspective if it is already trivial for knights to tank XP mobs, and this is what we have been argueing for months - that our mitigation / avoidance advantage over knights is not enough to make us desireable for an XP group tanking spot when compared when their agro control advantage - how much difference is adding a single guard proc going to make?<br />
<br />
I think effectively doubling your odds of getting a hate proc early in a fight by adding 2 anger to your weapons will be far more significant in closing the agro gap than a knight adding either a single DD proc will make to the DPS gap or a single guard proc will make to the mitigation advantage.<br />
<br />
Having said that I am fortunate enough to have weapons which allow me to manage my agro fairly well and personally I am looking to get an anger proc to add to my BoC and a guard proc to add to my SEM which should gain me a small improvement in hate generation and a small improvement in mitigation.  Can't really say that either of these has me excited enough to grind LDoN every waking moment though, getting some FT for my enc twink has me much more excited at this stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we're agreed, correct me if I'm wrong, that for experience group purposes Knights are close enough currrently to Warrior tank functionality that the difference is small enough to not be a particularly significant factor in determining who should tank for a group.<br />
<br />
How will allowing them to close that gap even further, if not even begin to exceed it help us?  If our aggro generation is improved by 50% (just a hypothetical figure) and yet is still as random as ever and not good enough to match Knight aggro on command, how is this going to help us if in the process Knights are allowed to get tougher and have more HP?  Their aggro continues to be enough better to be decisive while we've continued to lose even more ground in tanking.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that it will end up being like this, but there are indications that it will.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
I think its fairly clear that knights have passed warriors in exp group tank functionality.  I think the gap is fairly wide.  And I think PoP mudflated the point home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maelissa</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would argue that the problem with PoP isn't so much mudflation (although that is fairly bad) as poor content design.  Massively hitting mobs which require slow to be fought effectively inflate the value of Knights' agro advantages.  Knights could agro lock before PoP, it just wasn't that big of an advantage.  <br />
<br />
LDoN's gift for Warriors isn't Weapon Proc Augments so much as it is better content design for exp groups.  Agro lock is no longer critical and multiple tanks can even be desirable to a group with no other effective means of crowd control.  <br />
<br />
Now we just need to wait for all those people who got powerleveled to 50 and have spent every minute since in PoP to get fed up with LDoN and go back to the planes.  Will make finding a decent pickup group a lot easier. :)</div></div><hr />

 If people use some  common sense and apply the augmentations that work better for thier class , then it should help close the aggro gap between knights and warriors.<br />

I can't see any scenario in which LDoN is not ultimately going to hurt warriors.</div></div><hr />

Where do the nicest DD augs drop? MM amonung other places? Undead MM? What's their side effect? Stun??<br />
<br />
Guess what aug Paladins are putting on weapons for more DPS. That's right. Every Paladin that can is making an aggro weapon. Sorry all you midlevel Warrior. That CHoS and SotB you just got.... Well that thing is going to put out no more aggro that what everybody is going to be using. :( <br />
<br />
Y'all should probably buy LDoN and get procs for those hammers and swords. Oh wait... that augment is from MM - undead MM - undead MM where you are at even a greater disagvantage tanking.<br />
