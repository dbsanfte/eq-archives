Just do quest with a non kos char, loot ash with ur iksar warrior, paci or harmo quest npc and 2 closest npc, initiate trade with both chars, invis iksar warrior, click trade with NON KOS char then with ur iksar warrior.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any tips for getting Heratius to spawn?  I've spent over 20+ hours trying to find this guy.<br />
<br />
I've spent 4+ hours straight killing everything in the castle (and some outside) keeping it cleared with no luck.  I've also spent 8+ hours just sitting in zone on alt tracker (with see invis).  I've also dragged friends over several times to spend 2 - 3 hours wiping out half the zone.   I've never seen him spawn.  I've started to wonder if Oomadago might be his ph, since I've only seen him a few times (drops a garbage/twink belt).<br />
<br />
I really want the shield, but I've only got 18 AA after hitting level 65, and I'm really starting to think the time spent on the shield is wasted considering I could've had 4+ AAs (being stingy on xp rate) and perhaps finished enough North Ro's for a Tak BP.<br />
<br />
btw...I did this quest from the start and am just missing the ashes to finish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The effort put into this quest is NOT wasted.  You will get AAs over time.  Trust me, they'll come.  However, you cannot simply pick up a 50ac 75hp backslot item any day of the week without putting any effort into it.  Getting your AAs may pay off now, but later on down the road you'll kick yourself for not getting the shield earlier.<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;trick&quot; to spawning Heratius Grolden.  It is a completley seperate spawn time with his own completely seperate spawn point, which is located just in front of the right coterie if you're looking at the balcony from the hill (or left coterie if you're looking at the balcony from inside the castle).  Once he spawns and you kill him, Valdanov Zefveer will spawn right smack in the middle of the balcony.  You'll have about 45 minutes to engage him before he depops.  <br />
<br />
Believe me, I've done it.  It's tedious as all hell, but once you acquire the ashes, you'll feel a sense of relief greater than you ever have been.  The shield is just *that* awesome and I don't even plan to replace it until Time.  Stick with it.  The effort involved will pay off.<br />
<br />
(And the storyline to the quest is very good too.  Enjoy it for what it is.)</div></div><hr />

Now I won't be doing this for a while but I asked now just because this quest piqued my interest. However, what exactly will the non-kos char be handing in, which part specifically? I read the quest on allakhazam, but it was tricky to fully determine what you are referring to insofar as the non-kos char hand in.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information already : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was under the impression most quests where a KoS person turns in any piece it is eaten.  I don't see why this quest would be any different unless you might have sufficient faction for the one npc required for final turn in.  <br />
<br />
  Assuming that to be true, the MQ would work something like this...the non-KoS would do the whole quest up until the ashes (at least looting and turnins, killing can be done by anyone).  The KoS would kill the named Vamp and then both would visit the final NPC, there the non-KoS would turn in his two pieces (medal &amp; medallion, I believe) and the KoS would turn in the Ashes.<br />
<br />
  Whereas if you were to do a twink MQ, twink would just need to hand in the Ashes (which I hear are tradable) after the main handed in the first pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Or you can not be lazy and simply build your faction up by killing in one of the houses (I forgot which, but I believe is the first house on the right in the &quot;Arx Circle&quot;) that raises your faction rather quickly.

Build your faction properly.  I won't take long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eriatha, that's what I was originally wondering. Is there a place that you can build faction with the Katta questgivers as well as the guards? I know that killing Seru Guards will bump faction with Katta guards, but I was under the impression that the quest givers had a different faction that prevented evil characters from gaining the proper faction. Trust me, I'd rather do the actual turn in rather than MQ it. It's not even about the availability of the items, it's just something I'd rather do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is there a place that you can build faction with the Katta questgivers as well as the guards?<br />
Yes, in Sanctus Seru.   For every faction that exists in Katta, there are mobs you can kill in Seru to raise it.  The quest-givers for the Loyalist Shield of Honor, if I remember right, were Concillium Universus... to raise that, kill NPCs in the &quot;Heart&quot; building.   I don't remember which building on the arx circle that is, but it's the one with the heart icon above the entrance doors.  Shouldn't be hard to figure out.<br />
<br />
Third floor has a lot of level 60 mobs on the appropriate faction, so you can even get some exp while working on this (assuming you're level 60+ yourself).   Mobs are easily duoed/trioed, just avoid Praesertum Matpa.  He's in the inner room at the center of the third floor.<br />
<br />
And yes, it is possible for a cazic-worshipping iksar to be non-kos.  I know the shaman who helped me when I was working on my earring quest is.  I'm not sure how good is faction is, but I know he's not kos... so kill until it says &quot;Your faction standing with Concillium Universus cannot possibly get any better.&quot; then get a good-raced illusion to be safe.  You'll be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say you're fine for using a druid or cleric bot up until you fight the last mob or two...then, I'm not sure, since I haven't fought him yet.  I'd expect you should at least find a slower and a dps person or two.<br />
<br />
Bane weapons, there is a quest for them in TM.  Can't remember the name atm, but there is an npc near Katta ent that stands next to one of the guards, talk to him and triggers a quick little rescue quest for decent bane weapon, repeat again w/o turning it in to get second bane weapon.</div></div><hr />

You give the Magus Conlegium Token and the Katta Castellum Badge of Service with non kos char and the Ashes of Valdanov Zevfeer with kos char.<br />

I did the entire quest with a 65 war/dru/shm 3 boxed.  This includes factioning in the Heart tower in Seru which can be done solo if you have patience.  I had a friend help me kill Valdanov so that part was four toons, the rest was just 3 boxed.<br />
<br />
Coming in from zone in and heading into the zone there are four towers.  The Heart tower was the one on the rear left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's a fun little quest and the reward is very nice. getting H to spawn is the hardest part, killing vlad isn't even a big deal. 65 war (me), 63 mage, 60 necro killed him with a 55 ranger offtanking the other named on the third floor and a 65 druid healing both of us...and i'm not the beefiest of tanks.</div></div><hr />

Also, learn from my stupid mistakes (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=102365&amp;postcount=7) and avoid having to start over on this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow, I had no idea an item like this existed.<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to complete the entire quest with a 64 Warrior, 61 Shaman, 64 Druid, and a 65 beastlord? I can probably call upon my guild if I need more, but that setup would be available to help me at any time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Quetazl Coatl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, that group could easily complete this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yeah, that's a solid group for the quest renix. the druid's good for the gating around to different area's to do turn ins/text cues, and its strong enough to not have much trouble at all killing everything that needs to be killed. for the sake of time saving, just print out a good walkthrough, and know what's around the next corner. good luck!</div></div><hr />

The ashes are pure random, I  have heard of it taking people couple weeks. I killed a total of 3 mobs and had ashes. Just depends on your luck.<br />

I gave up.  The rest of the quest was easy, but I would suggest to anyone interested in this quest that they first attempt to get the ashes.  If you are one of the unlucky ones like me you may be wasting your time completing the other parts of the quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I did 14 hours of factoining in Seru to go from Kos to the one above indiff.  I think you just have to go to indiff.<br />
I camped the vampire tower in TM for 7 hours and i got Valdanov spawned twice.<br />
I did Valdanov first.  Then i did the faction so i was all ready to go.<br />
Then it took me ~3 hours from hailing Phenic to start the quest, do all the crud, and receive the item.<br />
I already had 220+ in pottery so that part took no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Took me 6 hours to do the quest up until camping the ashes (I wasn't getting ported, I was running).  I camped the castle for several days for a total of ~50 hours of my own time plus about another 35 hours of my friend's time who was helping me.<br />
<br />
Time invested for the reward, however?  Priceless.<br />
<br />
Also, you don't even need pottery to do the quest, really.  You only need pottery skill to make the mold, which isn't no-drop, so you can pay someone to do it for you.  Once the person makes the mold for you, he gives it back and you put it in the stove to burn it.  The firing process is no-fail.<br />
<br />
I had (and still have) 0 pottery skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tanise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Can't comment directly on this quest. But I know 2 DE that worship Inny that were able to do seru's earring. They were actually ally before a tunare wood elf friend that had killed Lcea a few time.<br />
<br />
We killed in the seru houses for reports, then the house bosses, and then seru himself. I'd suggest asking some people if you can join them just for facion killing house bosses or for reports. House boss hits are huge.<br />
<br />
In doing this you'll get faction with all the factions in Katta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I did everything from start to just needing the ashes last night in about 4 hours. I was able to do the turn ins and hails at dubious/apprehensive so that's the faction you need. After all of the turn ins I was upto indifferent.<br />
<br />
I was able to solo everything, but will definitely be bringing friends for Valdanov.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Just a note - all of the encounters up until the main vamp are EASY. Its trivial to duo the entire quest up until the main vampyre mob in the coterie castle with ANY healer, preferably a druid so you can get ports back and forth.<br />
<br />
I did the entire quest up until the main vamp guy and tomorrow I plan to do the vamp part and do the final turnin to get my shield. VERY easy quest, you don't even have to be a master potter - the unfired shade idol thingy is DROPPABLE, so you can get someone to do that for you, just make sure that YOU are the one that fires it, since the result is a no-fail no-drop item. I've only put 4-5 hours at most into the quest and I only expect it to take another 5, at most. Worth the time as a 50 AC/75 HP backslot item would be hard to replace for quite some time, and IIRC you can put a 10 AC aug thats trivial to save points for and make it that much better. If you get the shield, you won't regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Do NOT worry about pottery skill.  If you fail on combine, you get quest piece back every time.  I had a skill of maybe 6 to begin with and it did go up to near 20 before I succeeded, but it's very cheap to get the pieces and they are all sold in Katta (and there is a wheel there also).<br />
<br />
If you're gonna worry about anything, it should be the named vamp.  In hindsight, I'm starting to agree with others who suggested to get the named ashes first, then start the rest of the quest...but really, whatever way is more fun for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yep, my pottery skill was 58 and it took about 40 attempts to make the figurine and I got 2 skill ups in that time as well.</div></div><hr />
