     My ogre warrior is currently lvl 15, and unbuffed his Sta is at 220, Str 200. I was wondering if I should concentrate on more stamina/Hp with his gear till it's maxed, or should I worry about building up his str and dex more. I believe his dex is around 140.<br />
<br />
     I would appreciate any advice that you could offer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i really would not worry about dex. when your looking to upgrade, just look at AC/HP/Sta and the rest will take care of themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Those stats at 15? Sheesh.... (insert back in the day story)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, if those are your stats at lvl 15, then your AC and hps are probably very high as well. Level until you can't hold aggro, then get better weapons and level some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are powerleveling drop your stats in favor of dex.  You'll want to keep all your combat skills up and you get skillups based on dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Venox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your level 15. Don't worry about stats. But if this is a twink... I would go HP/AC and resists. Rawr!</div></div><hr />

<br />
well i remember back in the day before we HAD lvl 15  :rolleyes:  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">dont sell your gear but ... get some dex until your offensive stats catch up. i suspect they are way behind if you are not powerleveling and much more so if you are. when your weapon skills catch up put your sta gear back on.</div></div><hr />
