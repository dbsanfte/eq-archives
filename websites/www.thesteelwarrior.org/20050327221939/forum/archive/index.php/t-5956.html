<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Elementals are the Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. They were (until GoD was released) the next to last tiers in the game. Getting there requires either membership in or access to high level guild raids and multiple flaggings.<br />
<br />
 Yes, the loot is that good. The number of people flagged for Elementals? Maybe ~20% of a given server, I'd guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, the &quot;elementals&quot; are the Planes of Fire (Doomfire, the Burning Lands), the Plane of Water (Reed of Coirnav), the Plane of Air (Eryslai, the Kingdom of Wind), and The Plane of Earth (Vegarlson, the Earthen Badlands).<br />
<br />
The Plane of Fire is an awesome zone.  The exp is insane with LOTS of mobs to pull, plenty of one-groupable minis to kill with fast respawns and awesome loot, and LOTS of raid targets.  The problem is, because Fire is so easy to move through due to the fact that almost nothing sees through invis, almost all of those raid targets are annihilated within hours of pop, lol.  <br />
<br />
The Plane of Earth is also widely used as an exp zone, but has raid targets aplenty through rings.  The problem is, you NEVER know when the rings are up.  My guild is 0 for 2 for spawning the correct final boss mob on these rings.  We've gotten PHs every time.  It's seriously one of the dumbest things ever.<br />
<br />
The Plane of Water is a lot like Fire with great exp, lots of minis, and lots of raid targets.  However, being entirely underwater, it's generally the least populated as far as exp is concerned cause fighting in water sucks. :)  The only time you'll really find people here is if they're with their guild raiding.  PoWater is freaking awesome though.  I honestly thought I'd freaking HATE it, but it's a beautiful zone and you barely have to clear anything to get to your raid target that you want.<br />
<br />
The Plane of Air is entirely different.  This is not an exp zone, but if you're the masochistic type, you can.  The entire point of the zone is to kill the four air avatars - Dust, Wind, Mist, and Smoke.  Each of these avatars drop the required pieces to create the key that ports you to Xegony's island.  To spawn the avatars, you must successfuly complete a small &quot;ring&quot; on a different island.  For Wind, Mist, and Smoke, this really isn't all that difficult...<br />
<br />
//\/o0\/\\<br />
<br />
The script to spawn The Avatar of Dust is absolutely, insanely, unquestionably the more RETARDED bullshit I have ever seen in EQ.  First off, let's have fun and clear an island with hard to see sow-running spiders that quad for 1k a piece and proc spinstun every other fucking hit.  Oh yeah, there are like 30 of these motherfuckers.  So you clear it with everyone's freaking exp bar DESTROYED from dying so many times, only to kill more spiders.  Like 25 mini summoning spiders come charging your raid.  You can't kill them.  You have to AE stun them using your enchanter team for the entire duration of the NEXT part of the event.  Archwalkers!  Yah!  Not hard by themselves until they split into three sow running, quad 1400+ hitting, proc spinstun red con spiders.  And not only that, you get to do this THREE TIMES IN A ROW.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously Sony, if you want us to stick an unlubed plunger up our ass instead of playing this game and having fun, just tell us.<br />
<br />
Anyways, sorry to turn this into my venting session.  The elementals rock though.  Lots of upgrades, LOTS to raid, and just think, you'll never go back to BoT ever again!  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess since the raid leader was Time-flagged, he just knows how to explain it well.<br />

/shrug.</div></div><hr />

Another great thing about PoWater is that most of the minis have PH's.  You can move to a spot and just start clearing and eventually (if you have the time and patience) you'll get at least 1 to spawn.  The exp is really nice, but as Eriatha said most people avoid it like that plauge casue they hate fighting underwater.</div></div><hr />
