I am just wondering what type of force you need to take this guy down? My guild is no Time guild.. nor Elemental.. We're a more Family guild that raids. Our latest accomplishment was taking down Vindi.. Which for us was a big step and we're raring for more :D <br />
<br />
I hope this is the place to post this.. did know if it went here or the questing forum? If so plz move it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiras</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can kill The Vindicator don't go to Severilous expecting a challenge.  He's almost a let down.  He can easily be done with less than a group now.<br />
<br />
AEs<br />
Ceticious Cloud (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=844&amp;source=Live) Poison Resist<br />
Dragon Roar (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=981&amp;source=Live) Magic Resist<br />
<br />
32k HP -- Melee's for crap.<br />
<br />
The hard thing is finding him up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of it depends on the levels.  Kunark dragons have one thing that kills many people and that is the AE fear.  If the MT and the healers resist, you should be golden.  His hps are low, melee damage compared to Vindi is pathetic, BUT, if you clerics are trying to cast CHeal, 10 seconds = eternity to resist fear.  Shorter casting heals are useful as is resist gear if your peeps are sub 60.<br />
<br />
The hardest part to Sev, is getting peeps there and buffed fast enough before another guild.  He really doesn't take many 60+ peeps to kill him.  Our guild did him with 5 lvl 65's recently for a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dephrog</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we have about 15 lvl 65's.. and a good 50-60 mains 60+, so from what you guys are saying this should be plenty =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seveirn</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i do this fight very easily with 3 lvl 65s<br />
<br />
we Use 65 war , around 9200 hp fully buffed (i know a big diff ,but anyone could tank it really)<br />
<br />
Shaman for DR PR resists, dots, pet, etc etc<br />
<br />
<br />
and a Druid for Heals, Dots, Snares, pulling, DSing, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
we use this team to kill sev, talendor, kelorek`dar, woushi, gore etc.. works well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qaladar</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Geez... with 15 level 65's this fight should last a total of 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
Don't forget... Kunark mob... original kunark mobs (I mean mobs that weren't added after Velious) were code limited to 32,000 hitpoints. Barely more than your average exp mob in PoP tier2.<br />
<br />
A single average group of 65's shouldn't even break a sweat whacking a Kunark dragon. (well except Trak as he banishes... you need a mage).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're about to try this guy next time we can catch him with the following.<br />
<br />
65 Cleric<br />
63 Magician<br />
63 Enchanter<br />
61 Shadow Knight<br />
60 Paladin<br />
60 Necromancer<br />
56 Warrior  5600ish HP's buffed ME  (more than the rest of tanks)<br />
54 Beastlord<br />
<br />
We have decided fight will begin with me getting agro with a stun totem engaging/defensive dualwielding a bloodsworn and a journeyman's stick.  I am hoping for a proc of tash and stun on of each to then call Engage.  I will be buffed with MR Disease and poison... Poison should be around 180ish MR around 150ish.  Hoping not to have to use a bark potion.. then at engage malo/tash/slow if he's slowable.. then all engage.. hoping 1 cleric and druid/pally are good enough to keep me alive while /defensive.<br />
<br />
My concerns are the following.  How to pull him.  Don't really wanna use DA's on any of the dudes in the group because then they're sort of out for the rest of it me thinks.  and second is 1 cleric good enough?  How do we do tank switches if the other 2 don't have AoE taunt... neither do I..... I keep thinking we'll succeed perhaps not on first try but we can own his ass.  Opinions?  Oh yeah after engage don't know if to use copper hammer/bloodsworn or Greatstaff of Thunder.. inclined to use GSoT since it keeps me better agro most of the time I use that instead of the dual wielding option (just my opinion no flames pelase)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my kills we just gang rushed him. No need for having your monk run back to camp feared and pull Sev away from the raid. And make sure everyone is WALKING, maybe have everyone duel a druid or necro and have them snare you. That way you won't run far, should you be feared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gunrack,<br />
<br />
1. You need to be  lot more concerned about Fear at level 56 than anything else.   At 56 you WILL be feared several times, regardless of your MR.<br />
<br />
2. You won't really benefit from the JStick aggro, since it's been nerfed since Velious.   GSoT is better for you all the way around.<br />
<br />
3. Invest in some bark potions<br />
<br />
4. The whole &quot;turn run off&quot; thing is a myth, you auto-run when feared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess I'll take your word for it on the run off thing.<br />
<br />
Been so long since I've been feared. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks much for the advice so far.  GSoT it is!  Figured as much.  Will invest in those potions.. figured I'd use it as soon as it wore off.. so bark potion... bark potion.. bark potion fight taunt etc... the having someone snare me sounds good... can probably snare everyone in duels.. camp to kill the duels and stun/pull sev.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aratus</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thaak mentioned rushing him, which works just as well as pulling. But if you're interested in dragging him to the camp, it's pretty simple... get a Spirit of Eagle, or any speed buff, the faster the better. As soon as Sev's in visual range, (If your clip plane is at maximum) he'll make beeline straight to you, the trick is to not do hard turns at all on the way back to your camp. Do not do dramatic turns, do not stop. He'll catch up to you pretty quick if you do and since he's a dragon, his melee range is extreme.<br />
<br />
Anyways, everyone has given you the info you need, just thought I'd add my 2 cents on pulling him instead of rushing him. Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again I thank this great community for their help.  One more question tho.  Lets say we rush him.  Fight begins I Barkpotion/Defensive  It says that bark potion effect lasts 1 minute.   Questions are.  Does it stack with other regens or am I gonna get a message &quot;you're shit out of luck since you have another regen on you ATM&quot;  Second if he casts fear on me which he will and it sticks, does that automatically undo the bark potion... meaning.. do I stay rooted but next time he casts I'm screwed and bark potion didn't last the whole minute as per duration?  Or can I count on simply Bark potioning myself every 60 seconds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalorn Iceblade</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to say that at 56 you gonna spend a lot of the fight either stunned from the PR based AE or feared unless you have very very very good resists, ok you play on RZ so you know the worth of resists, but realistically I'd say the SK or paladin would be better tanks for this - they at least have a much better chance to resist the ae and fear (unless they are in totally subpar kit). I hate telling a warrior to let a knight tank for them - but in this case you might be better off doing so - hell it might just end up with them tanking anyhow.<br />
<br />
GL tho - and of course the fun part is finding him up anyway :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalorn Iceblade</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just read your resists - at 56 with 180 PR and 150 MR expect to be feared and stunned a lot :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are making it sound like the Bark potions aren't going to make a difference on fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashem</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">having tanked and fought the guy on a lark, it'll be cake. You're now OVERworrying, which in my opinion is a lot worse than just slapping on reg buffs and having at him. Yeah, he's a dragon so he dispells. He's not really quick on melee, and he doesn't do a load of dmg.<br />
<br />
Slap some buffs on for posterity and then just engage. Waste time worrying about buff order and some such then you'll get hosed.<br />
<br />
Yes ppl will get feared. Dragon fear is much harder to resist than anything else. fight should be over in approximately 1 minute 34 seconds with the force you outlined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnarian</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol sever was actually up on mt server last night so I decided to play for a bit.  Was 3 boxing a 65 ranger, cleric, and my war and had a 65 bard run over with me.  We just ran in and rushed him before the raid in the zone of 20+ tried to kill him (sent a tell to leader saying they could have all the loot ahead of time was just for the challenge), well it went ok till he got to 60% health and all 3 of my bots got feared in sperate directions, and I lost where all of em were lol.  We died, but only because I lost the cleric and ranger on 2nd fear and could figure out where the cleric was.  But everyone is right he is easy, just dont try to bot alot of chars at once:)</div></div><hr />
