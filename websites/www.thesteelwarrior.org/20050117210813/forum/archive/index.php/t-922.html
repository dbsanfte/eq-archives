<br />
Considering your Cleric main ill give you the benefit of the doubt.  Always put your best aggro weap in mainhand when Tanking.  In your case the Taunting Blow will be much better aggro then your Frostbringer.  Mainhand the CHSD.  Offhand the Frostbringer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kodi</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You mis read my question, or I misstated the question.  I was asking of the two weapons I have left to choose from, which should go in the off hand. I new that the CHSD was the mainhand weapon because of the delay and the tauting blow effect and how the damage bonus works on the primary hand.  Get me a little credit here please but thank you for your advice on using the Frosty in off hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, wavecrasher is primary only anyway so yeah chsd/fb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cozlo</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bul beat me to it concerning primary only on the WC ...<br />
<br />
I'll make a suggestion though, maybe switch in a dps-concentrated weapon after frosty procs.<br />
<br />
Xanamech has been stingy thusfar in coughing up my CHSD, but when he does, I'll offhand the frosty til it procs then switch in the 'ole fleshgrinder for max dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cozlo</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xanamech finally coughed up my CHSD last night, along with the 41% haste neck (much needed upgrade for guild MT).<br />
<br />
Have a question for epic-wielding warriors.  Would you ditch the blue blade in favor of offhanding the CHSD?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking the answer may be situational.  On raid level mobs I suspect you'd want the 500/450 hate procs going off, but in exp groups I imagine keeping the CHSD bagged in favor of the stats from the blue blade.<br />
<br />
I'm not planning on acquiring the epic.  Was just curious as the other two warriors in my guild have their epics, and it seems they want the CHSD too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">epic is 24 delay so shouldnt be in main hand if you can avoid it.<br />
A good agro combo would be chsd main and red blade offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikkorak</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My combo is CHSD pri.  Red Blade Secondary, for tanking, on raids, or in xp groups.  I think I bagged the blue blade about 5 months after i got epic last year in favour of the CHSD.  Btw the combo adds a SIGNIFICANT amt of hp. to me.<br />
If I am not MT I use the CHSD with Claw of Lightning(sec, only), which does increase the dps.<br />
Hoping to get the Thulian Eviscerator to further the wolvie look :)</div></div><hr />

This is the defining feature, unresistable hate.</div></div><hr />
