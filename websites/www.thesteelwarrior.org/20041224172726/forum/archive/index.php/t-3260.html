Any screenshots would be fun, looking for something interesting to do with it other than one rounding a bunch of 10hp spiders in the ferrot. Is there a practical use for it, like a good way to farm plat with it? Best I've done is 50+ goblin trains in sola netting about 200 plat every time. <br />
<br />
Prefer stories about doing it solo. I know you could add a bunch of wizzies and do some sick crap with it, but then that wouldn't be any fun :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been PL'ing a mage in guk with it actually.  As soon as we got him to 43 so he could group with Haass, I set him up near safehall, took a little jog up to BR, rounded up everything from BR to SR, to Sage, Exe, Cav and then brought it all into safe hall, hit rampage with the 'shaker and everything dies.  <br />
<br />
It may not be real efficient since I take such a huge chunk of the XP, but it's pretty damned fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarean</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HAH! Good idea. <br />
<br />
How much of a powerlevel was it? How much exp did your mage get per pull?</div></div><hr />

Pull all of lower area of old Droga anyway, used to use a Dathor/Rampage until i could get my hands on Earthshaker/Rampage, maybe Furious or Mighty Strike to make it fun. Helps to have a healer~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kind of a nifty tool to have although it should be on a lesser refresh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some reason every single proc that went off on this rampage+earthshaker was a critical blast.<br />
<br />
This was during an LDoN raid, in Miraguls btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varf</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so would Rampage + Earthshaker + Mightystrike work? dont see why not... gona have to head to maybe rivervale or guk later ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it would. rampage + earthshaker + berserk fellstrike may work better though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first trained Rampage I tried it on Tizmaks, but I couldn't get a good train goin in the caves....3/4 of my train seemed to get lost and go home about the time I had a decent number built up.  I bet it would work a lot better in old world dungeons where there is less &quot;lazy aggro&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can easily get a good 50 or 60 frogs stacked on top of each other standing at the same loc in guk.  Works out much better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gathering buncha mobs in any lower zone(MM my favorite) and getting berzerk for a fell + Ramp with yer biggest hitter. My best is I think 4 max crips in one rampage. For 1853 or whatever it is with TSBS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-27-2003, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember seeing a log of a warrior in an AE group in the Gray (before the first nerf) with rampage, furious and earthshaker. They pulled something like 70 skeletons and he proc'd a bunch of times and hit everything in sight. Skeletons were falling over, though of course his groupmates were blasting too. Still, the log was pretty sick.</div></div><hr />

Now if I could just lay my hands on a hammer...</div></div><hr />

Would wack about 100 of the wolves or bears in a single stroke. Took about 7 minutes to loot them all but made farming smithing crap fun.<br />
<br />
Done tons of AE groups as well, but never got as many as i did in hollowshade moor.<br />
<br />
Rampage is a good way to piss off enchanters in raids too :)<br />

<br />
procs every 2nd or 3rd swing. spell crits about every 5th.<br />
<br />
only weapon i know of that you do more dps with the proc then the melee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Used to use rampage + shaker in AC for AE pulls; best pull I actually had logging on for was about 65 mobs, with 13 procs.  Did in excess of 220,000pts of damage in one &quot;round&quot;, KSed the wizzie/chanter/cleric group I was &quot;helping&quot; and LDed one of em from the spam. ;)  MUCH fun.  For maximum effect, make sure to remove any haste items/spells, and get turgored before hitting the button... procs are based on effective weapon delay at the time it's checked, so the slower you are the better chance to proc per &quot;attack&quot;... and more mobs = more attacks, and more damage when the PBAOE goes off.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I had better rounds that the one above, but that was the best one I had logging on for...<br />
<br />
Rampage = fun.  I'm thinking LoY might have some good places to AE in actually.<br />

I found it useful in Droga, but not really so good in groups and raids cause it breaks mez and doesnt really do too much for agro because it is only one swing.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: Just noticed Lucy says 45 under &quot;level&quot;, so I assume that means it procs at level 45?</div></div><hr />

as Sshaithis noted that's where I first found the pure ecstacy of the earthshaker. Ssra mines.<br />
<br />
god that was so much fun. I think it was 7 or 8 of us in the guild has them too; the Warr Ghetto AE group was cleaning up the experience :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">best part is you can pick it up dirt cheep from someone who dosen't know the secets. because it looks like a total suck weapon.</div></div><hr />

OK OK i shouldnt talk, as i was playin with my shaker in guk, but does it matter =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will take longer to loot them all :p and will give you a stack of substances for smithing. <br />
<br />
I once had one unique mob surviving this and decided to zone cos I think after resisting that he desered to live :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As the title says...<br />
<br />
When you rampage is it a single attack (ie you slash/crush/pierce once) on everything in the area of effect, or can you get multiple attacks such as:<br />
<br />
Can you double/triple attack?<br />
<br />
Can you get the extra attack from punishing blade?<br />
<br />
Can you flurry?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can double/triple I know. And I'm fairly positive I did Flurry once.<br />
<br />
 And my new favorite thing to do with it is grab every mob in S Ro or whatever Wayfarer zone I'm in and rampage them while I wait for group leader to get a good adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have rampage yet but one place I think it could actually be really fun is in CoD on the carpin/high priest cycle where all those skeletons spawn when someone dies.  Every death generates like 4 skeletons that hit hard but don't have a lot of hit points.   My first attempt at doing that raid went incredibly wrong and we ended up with like 80 skeletons and we wiped.  If like 10 warriors were to sequentially use AETaunt then Earthshaker + rampage, followed by disc furious, the damage could be easily into the millions.</div></div><hr />
