<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello folks,<br />
<br />
I was wondering if I might get your opinion on a good duo class for a warrior.<br />
<br />
I have not played EQ since December of '01, and have decided to come back with this new non-split server that is opening up. I will be playing two characters and I am firm on one of them being a warrior.<br />
<br />
My first choice for a duo was a cleric, is this a good idea? If not, why?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman vs Cleric is argued there.  Really, either one will work great, druids do also.  Just depends on your preferance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was thinking the same thing. I have two accounts, and I know one of my characters will be a warrior. ATM I am unsure of my choice of partner. I am thinking shaman, but there is still the thought of the easy-to-bot cleric.<br />
<br />
I guess if you plan on getting to the higher levels ASAP, then shaman is probably the way to go. Once they are higher up, healing is alot easier. A shaman can eventually heal and slow. A cleric can heal but never slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">cleric=good insurance policy+semi-godlike buffs<br />
<br />
shaman=semi-insurance policy + godlike buffs<br />
<br />
i'd go with a shaman tho iffn i were you. clerics are greatest utilized on boss-type encounters and when it comes to PL and boxing you're better off with a shaman who is more of a swiss army knife class ( if you picka fatty one they can even tank a bit too )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh I have duo hunted a lot with both. I would choose a cleric because of more reliable heals along with more hunt time. The down side is with a Shammy you get great buffs so less heals are needed. I am just an old reliable guy and would choose the cleric myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IMO, it depends on how good you are at two boxing.  If you are good at it, I would use shammy.  If you are like me (not good at it) I would go cleric.  Clerics can sit and Cheal (after 39) and are fairly easy to two box.  Shammies on the other hand require canni, slow, more constant buffing, etc.<br />
<br />
Also, Pacify works well for breaking camps which is a point in favor of a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garrison</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman is a better PLer, but like everyone says it depends on your preference.  If your in a guild see what you guild needs more!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cleric bots are definitley popular in guilds hehe, but do look at the thread Hussar linked for a knock-down drag out discussion of cleric vs shaman.  Druid/warrior combo will suck from about 34 to 58.  I am a big fan of 65 druids with a full spellbook though, they are awesome.<br />
<br />
Also a factor in 2-boxing is even if you are capable of botting a shaman, do you want to work that hard all the time.  In an active group where I am playing both warrior and cleric and having to heal a lot of different people with different heals I start to get tired after a couple hours and my efficiency goes down, people start to die, etc.  Where duoing I can just pull and kill all night long and all the cleric has to do is CH once a fight, root/snare runners, or nuke if he has the mana.  With a shaman you're gonna be punchin buttons all night long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love my melee cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">cleric : +ez to box and pacify no dps- almost no utility<br />
shamen :+ good utility haste&amp;slow&amp;sow&amp;invis+dots - shit heals till 60+<br />
druid : + ton of utility evacs/snare/harmony/sow/dots -  shit heals till 58</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think your argument is totally biased Cas,<br />
<br />
<br />
Cleric has ok dps imho, hammer of damnation is pretty good, with yaulp it makes it not bad at all to melee and it remains pretty easy. <br />
Rez goes under utility for sure along side the best ac/hp buffs and cheaper/faster heals (not including topor), DA/DB are nice, and nobody gets an enchanter to join faster than a cleric.<br />
<br />
I still use root/atone to split mobs...<br />
<br />
Cleric and shaman are head to head imho, but I have never been able to accomplish half of what I can with those two when I use my druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">what I meant to say and is a fact :<br />
<br />
cleric provide close to no utility(comparing with other classes)<br />
cleric = close to no dps(comparing with other classes)<br />
warrior - no utility without clicky items/procs<br />
war/cleric duo can kills mobs just fine there are other options and sacrafices however just have to pick for yourself whats important<br />
<br />
My xp : I've 2 boxed cleric(to 49)  I am 2 boxing druid. I've duod with shamen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, but with druid unlike shaman, you are dipping into your mana pool for dd, cleric you get free dps.<br />
<br />
Its choice really, I use my druid a ton when I am not tanking anything huge, utility is great, but when it comes to tier 2 mobs, druid don't work for me :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">right on Strikingone!<br />
glad to have ppl like u on the board who dont flame right away when someone has a different oppinion :)<br />
<br />
I am able to do potactics with druid so far, but that pushing it, but I love a chalenge. PoV is ez and boring so is Factory for me heh</div></div><hr />
