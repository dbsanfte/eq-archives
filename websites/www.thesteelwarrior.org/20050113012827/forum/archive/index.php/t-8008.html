After fake tz died, we had a monk go pull fake vz but there were about 4 gindan flayers with him. This isn't the first time its happened and its a huge pain in the ass because for each of those mobs, all being splitters waste more time when you have to kill more mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
This has happened to us twice now. We've beaten the script about 5 times and gotten one Blade of War, but this isn't the issue - anyone know wtf is causing these 4 flayers to spawn with fake vz?<br />

We had to develop strategies to split them fast to save time, I think we used rogues, bards and monks. I don't know if there has been some change in their aggro, but I do know that we always had mobs with VZ to worry about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
vz with guards is easier imo, almost never rushes<br />
<br />
I love when VZ and his 4 Gindans rush your camp for no reason though. That's an AWESOME fight.<br />
<br />
All you need is a bard, or a levitate and a cleric with the right AA's. Easy to split ;)</div></div><hr />

Dont recall this in the past though He'd either rush us with 2-5 friends (repops we guessed. Or he'd be single pulled to our raid with ease and no adds. (me pulling)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hes had these every time ive done him</div></div><hr />

<br />
VZ's been spawning with Gindans, and RZTW's been spawning with Elites, since about the 1st of February.</div></div><hr />

ON tz side just before the steps before the corner where you fight him is the tether are.  FYI adds are not tethered, only vz is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not having guards seems like a bug not the other way around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Debbin</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">or maybe someone tried and failed on him, and his guards didnt respawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the guards not being up must've been a bug or something, he had guards last year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">he always has guards up, unless its a bug, its just probably that your pull team deals with them so you never notice them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a bard DA and tarin through his room and rnu down the other hall, when VZ ports back to bind because he passes his tether, have someone tag. Or just use this basic concept and do it however you want. Or just have competant monk or bard single pull him and save the hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duskin</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over last 2 months we done this event about 10ish times.<br />
<br />
I would say about 50% chance that he have the 4 guards, appears to be completely random.  Monks always happy when they are not up.  Not like it is difficult to get him single even with his guards.  <br />
<br />
Most frustrating part is when the 4 guards spawn when you fight fake rallos.</div></div><hr />
