As it stands, it's a stop sign for the retarded guilds to struggle on, while most will swiftly move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cotred</div><div class="date">02-05-2005, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well..  that i agreed... but remember some blizzard words once said that onyxia isnt intended to be a major difficulty raid boss.<br />
more than prolly i think should be something more big... the game´s history says that onyxia is just a sister (or daughter.. dunno) of one of the major  black dragons that once existed (some still if im not wrong)...<br />
<br />
Surelly they will think in something more close to sargeras (u know who is right ?) if not sargeras itself, however that would ruin the game history. We are playing a mmorpg based in warcraft history... not dragon ball series to fight and kill gods (sargeras was a titan.. kinda like it).<br />
<br />
But what IF they just got unlucky at the drops ? only 1 drop record yet right ?</div></div><hr />

You should have learned that by now if you've any EQ experience.  At some point you need more powerful entities just because you ran out of previous ones.<br />
<br />
I don't know how Sargeas was defeated, but if you look at WC lore, whatever they did to defeat Sargeas would have owned Archimonde in about 5 seconds consider Archimonde was just like a lieutenant of Sargeas.</div></div><hr />

Dude, Archimonde was killed by WISPS.<br />
<br />
How sad is that? =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 Shamans used to be able to kill a Doomguard with Purge (4 Purge will kill an Infernal too) and that used to be part of the game too!<br />
<br />
So I really don't expect WoW to have any integrity in lore in terms of uber strength consider the Warcraft universe already has no integrity to begin with. <br />
<br />
But then, having no integrity makes it a lot easier to explain how expansions come out really, so it's not a bad thing.  If you've a consistent world, it'd actually really suck to explain why the next expansion's uber is always uberer than the most uberest thing in the universe that you just defeated last expansion.</div></div><hr />
