Not true; I've managed 52, and am well on my way to 53.  It's doable, just not very quick.  Doubt you could get higher than 55, though I've not tried Veksar yet, so I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Good higher-end spots include: Icefang (and others in vicinity) in EW, bandits/grimlings in GF, and the front of Velk's Lab.</div></div><hr />

Complete lies.<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud I've heard is excellent into the mid-high 50's, and after that greens out i'm sure you can start doing Velks spiders or Fungus grove (can't remember when you can pull singles in FG, but whenever it is, I guarantee you can solo a shroom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">59 to single shrooms iirc.  I got a lil exp in mid-high 50s soloing in DSP.  I was working on bind wound at the time.  Exp wasn't great but I wasn't trying for exp either, only BW raises.</div></div><hr />

Can sometimes get an XP bonus and the mobs have less HPs than the equivilent you'd get from say an outdoor Kunark zone like OT or DL.<br />
<br />
Apparently theres some good XP spots in Sol A for the high 20's but I couldn't tell you where to go for those.  For low 30's to low 40's I'd do lower guk, then move to Sol B (take a snare proc weapon).  You can do Dogs to high 40s then do bats till 52, then LDC's from there (and all the way to 60 if you feel like it)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are thousands of places to solo pre 50...pick your zone, if you've got a fungi and can pull singles or weak doubles, then take your pick.<br />
<br />
The real challenge lies in post 50</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Echo caverns from 25-30 something.  You may be able to go up to around 55 in there moving to different spawns.<br />
<br />
Between 30 and 35 the fungus side starts to green out while the deep side is still a bit tough.  Over 50, most of the deep is going to be turning green, but you can kill the taskmaster.<br />
<br />
Velks or PoJ can probably get you to 62, although 61 is going to be endless pain.  At 62, PoJ zone out greens out.<br />
<br />
If you're evil, OT works in the 30s - mid 40s.  Nurga in the mid 40s, at least until the zone gets updated in a week or two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Much agreed.  It's not even really that CHALLENGING to solo pre-50, unless you're trying to maximize exp-over-time, once you get a feel for what you're doing.  Trust me, I've been soloing since I started... :)  A lot of the pre-50 soloing spots have been charted long ago, since the grand majority of the good ones are in old-world zones.<br />
<br />
Post-50 is the hard stuff, where you have to start being really careful about what and where you fight.  Also, there's greater limits on what you can handle, since the power-disparity gets kinda steep.</div></div><hr />
