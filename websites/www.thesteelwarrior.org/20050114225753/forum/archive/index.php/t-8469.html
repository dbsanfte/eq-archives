<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before the servers came down I took a peek at some of the new stuff which seems to be themeless (aka you can get it at any camp). <br />
<br />
Some of the stuff could be described as VT quality whereas some is more of a bastard VT/ornate hybrid. Most of it gave me a mixed feeling . Some of it actually seems too good :<br />
<br />
-25 ac 125 hp AHR like earring, Gem of Deception for 1900 pts (too close to a Signet of might or other EP earrings considering the effort imho)<br />
<br />
-22 ac 115 hp mask for 1900 pts, Mask of Deception. (The mask that drops off Rallos Zek is worse than this)<br />
<br />
On the other side, some of the expensive stuff really is rather gimp, expecially for warriors:<br />
<br />
-52 ac, 125 hp bp with V4 and FT2 for 1900 pts, Breastplate of Guile<br />
-69 ac, 105 hp bp for 1500 pts, nothing new here, Breastplate of Rage<br />
<br />
On the other side however, there is now so much FT in gear that any caster can easily be capped with LDONs.<br />
<br />
None of this equipment is directly relevant to me anymore, but it all does kind of leave me with mixed feelings. I would have applauded the possibility of gaining a BoC-like weapon for example, but a lot of the stuff here is rather poorly matched (good or bad) to the amount of effort needed.<br />
<br />
What really did irk me tho, is that there will now be far more people wanting to do LDON's, which holds absolutely nothing new for raiders. It was never great exp, but als no new hp augs, not even the ability to use tupe 7 in type 8 slots so you still need to get type 8 s when you upgrade. I spend most of my time on EQ raiding, it would have been nice to throw us a bone and cut down on our time needed for LDoN's but I digress.<br />
<br />
For sure, this is a big middle finger to any guild trying for VT right now; while shard camping and VT clearings are hardly a high point in EQ, it really does make most of Luclin obselete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just bought the non theme Burning Affliction 4 aug and regular 760 point leather Helm on my Druid. And 10 point 20dd aug for my warrior.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the patch was to take it all out?</div></div><hr />

Sorry but that was not the case.  These are actually items intended for purchase with the new PVP point system.  Not Omens items.  <br />

What a waste, this stuff looked like exactly what casual players needed to have added to LDoN vendors. Some of it was a tad underpriced from what I saw but I think this level of gear is what will help casuals progress through the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry but a bunch of us are tired of you adding items to the LDoN tables and then yanking them out.  Quality control Benlo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oarokx</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should have left them in. What makes it even worse is that the few that had points and were lucky to get it, now they get to keep it! Nothing like taunting us with some nice gear. <br />
<br />
SOE has gotten better at taunting causal gamers (250)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That BP of Rage was on the merchants on the previous patch goof.<br />
<br />
And, if one were to compare the Rage items, they were similar in stats to the Royal Attendant gear, just that the cost was not theme restricted.<br />
<br />
Or, at least, this was the case the last time, when i was able to compare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the rage stuff is close to the same as Royal Attendant but there was some stuff on there today that was VT level or better for 1900 points (should be higher though). There were also some GoD type augments I think around 1200-1550 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, lots of augs. Lots of slot 8 and regen. I saw Anger of Druzzil and bought Burning Affliction 4 (got to test it on seru a few hours ago too, hehe). Many random lower non theme gear also. Destroyer, Executioner, something starting with a C, etc. Bunch of 10 to one stat augs. Also saw quite a few random low level weapons while running my warrior over in the last 7 minutes. Everything was just a copy of something else just worse/better and more expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did people really get to keep the stuff they bought before it was removed from the merchants?  Anyone here get to keep stuff that isn't available now? or did they roll it back?</div></div><hr />
