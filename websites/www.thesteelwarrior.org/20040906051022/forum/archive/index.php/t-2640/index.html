<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a warrior on Xev (level 65 preferred) to assist with some tests on heal aggro hypotheses.  Details of the hypotheses and proposed tests are posted below.<br />
<br />
Please post here or email shadowfrost@eqcleric.com if you're interested in helping out, thanks.<br />
<br />
___________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Hypothesis:  Heal spells are always n amount of hate, regardless of the actual amount healed.  In other words, a Complete Healing spell that heals 1hp is the same aggro as a Complete Healing spell that heals 17,500hp.<br />
<br />
Test:<br />
<br />
Tank selects a non-proccing weapon combination.<br />
<br />
(1) Choose a test mob like a Fungus Grove shroom, tank pulls it with a taunt but does not attack.  Cleric casts Complete Healing on the tank immediately the mob is pulled.  Number of hp healed are logged.  Tank attacks, but does not taunt.  It is checked how much damage inflicted is required to switch the critter back to the tank.  Repeat test five times.<br />
<br />
(2) As test one, but the cleric uses Word of Replenishment (group heal generally considered to have high aggro).<br />
<br />
(3) As test one, but cleric allows tank to drop to low health totals before healing.<br />
<br />
(4) As test two, but cleric allows tank to drop to low health totals before healing.<br />
<br />
I'll consider the hypothesis disproven if the tank needs to inflict significantly more damage on the critter in order to regain aggro; otherwise the hypothesis is supported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My only suggestion is that it might be better to use an SK that can use the Terror spells to generate hate in known, fixed increments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not on Xev unfortunately or I would come test with you.  If you're in beta I could help you out on the beta server hehe.  Will be interested to see the results either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whoops, I've accidentally bumped the thread, sorry about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Telantaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am very interested in hearing what you find out, Shadow.<br />
<br />
However, I'd be very surprised if your hypothesis turns out to be true. A long time ago, I think around three years ago, aggro on healing was changed. What they said was something in the lines of:<br />
<br />
Healing will generate an amount of hate points equal to two thirds of the hit points healed.<br />
<br />
Prior to this, you got same amount of hate points as you healed for.<br />
<br />
Complete healing - as far as I can &quot;feel&quot; when playing - has even less aggro than this. I am not exactly sure how much less, since I have never tested it, but I would guess it to be around 50% of healing value. <br />
<br />
Good luck on your testing !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Complete healing - as far as I can &quot;feel&quot; when playing - has even less aggro than this.<br />
<br />
I have a theory that I haven't tested at all, it's just based on secondary evidence.  The fact that if all you do is cast CH heal on a target will sometimes gain you a faction hit and sometimes won't gain you a faction hit leads me to suspect that the hate associated with CH may not always be generated.  What I mean to say is in those cases where you CH someone (note I've never seen this happen with something like a heal over time) and don't receive a faction hit, you also didn't end up on the mob's hate list, thereby indicating you received no aggro.<br />
<br />
Might be completely wrong, but the faction hit issue seems like there ought to be a connection somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kiztent recently mentioned something similar in the taunt thread in The Arena</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I read that post at the same time that you read it, Telantaa, but I take Sony's descriptions of their own game with a pinch of salt.  And it's entirely possible that heal hate values have been stealth patched since then anyway; the only way to check is to test.<br />
<br />
Many times I've CH'ed a tank for 7k as a critter was incoming.  I'm telling you without doubt there's no way that I could generated 3500 hate by doing that; one stun still taunts the critter off me.<br />
<br />
Glatius, good thought but I'm afraid you're on the wrong track.  It's not just CH, most heals have a good chance not to produce negative faction hits.  What that depends on has a lot to do with what your starting faction was and which zone or expansion you're in, and I'll bet that you're basing your assertion on your experiences in Velious.  In fact, I'll stick my neck out and say you probably noticed it in Kael Drakkal.  ;)<br />
<br />
No... good faction with critters screws up heal aggro some, and creates complications I'm not interested in examining for the moment.  Right now, I'm talking about hate generated from critters that are already KOS.<br />
<br />
Still looking for help with this test, by the way.  Zero responses so far...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay, one last and final bump, hoping that there's somebody out there who wants to know the numbers...<br />
<br />
Alternatively, perhaps I could persuade someone who doesn't play on Xev but has access to a warrior and a cleric to run the test?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have acess to the beta server. Maybe someone else on the beta server would want to run the test?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dexie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This may be mob-specific. General V'ghera in Kithicor has always been quick to gobble up the first CH'ing cleric.</div></div><hr />
