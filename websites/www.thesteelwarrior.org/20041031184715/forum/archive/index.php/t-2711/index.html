<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright my guess is this is unanswerable given all of the arguments over proc rates in another thread but I thought I'd ask anyway and see if there is a general consensus of opinion..<br />
<br />
What is the DPS value of procs?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is I have two good sets of weapons. One DPS, one aggro.<br />
<br />
This includes a Copper Hammer of Striking which, at level 35, is low DPS but procs a 179 point DD fairly frequently and a Venemous Axe of the Velium Brood which procs an 85 point DD.<br />
<br />
If aggro is not a problem but DPS is, am I better off fighting with these two proc'ing weapons or my Crescent Blades of Luclin and my Frostbringer (doesn't proc for me for 5 more levels)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 35 dps is aggro so use dps but keep ALL skills up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh. That doesn't answer my question though. ;)<br />
<br />
Aggro isn't the problem at all. DPS is.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is will a 10/18 with no proc do more total DPS or will an 8/20 with 179 point DD (the copper hammer is 8/20 at level 35)</div></div><hr />

The best way to tell would be to parse your weapon logs.  <br />
<br />
I also like the Luthair damage calculator.  It estimates your DPS given weapon stats and skills.  It seems pretty accurate, but it doesn't take into account high level AAs and such.  I also don't know if it has accurate damage tables for levels 61-65.  But for people level 1-60, it looks pretty good.  For proc weapons, just assume you'll proc 2 or 3 times per minute with your main hand, and about 1 or 2 times with your off-hand, and you should be good.<br />
<br />
The URL for Luthair's site is http://www.geocities.com/luthairsite/weaponCalc.html .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked out that site and it looks like the proc'ing weapons are both higher DPS at 35 assuming a 2.5 proc per minute rate with the primary and 1.5 proc per minute rate with the secondary.<br />
<br />
Approximate Primary / 2ndary DPS of these weapons with 231 STR and max skill:<br />
<br />
At 35...<br />
CHoS 16 / 8<br />
VAoVB 13 / 6<br />
CBoL 11 / 5<br />
Frostbringer 11 / 5<br />
JBoM 10 / 5<br />
<br />
At 40 there are some changes..<br />
CHoS 18 / 9<br />
Frostbringer 15 / 8<br />
VAoVB 14 / 7<br />
CBoL 13 / 6<br />
JBoM 11 / 6</div></div><hr />
