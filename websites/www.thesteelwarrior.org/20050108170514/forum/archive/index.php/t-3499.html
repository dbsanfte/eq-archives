I've got a 63 Shammy I can duo for slows and heals.  I tried Bloodmaw in GD, but he's only good for about 15 minutes, doesn't regenerate, and has a long respawn time.<br />
<br />
Something reasonably tough with a short respawn time would also be acceptable.</div></div><hr />

Did not summon.  Green to a lvl 50.</div></div><hr />

Im not sure what you are looking for.  If you are looking for something to parse on, i use the Katta Bankers.  They create alot of spam but wont hit back. You wont be able to kill them no matter how long you beat on them. If you wanna try a mob that will fight back. Go to the PoFear portal but dont zone in. There is a mob to the right of that, a little gnome, she has like 2 million Hp and good regen.</div></div><hr />

Ive used him for hours at a time to raise weapon skills and to parse, and have never even come close to killing him. <br />
<br />
Pull him up the waterfall to the little hall, and you can whack away at him without fear of adds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When tried couldnt even hit the Neriak Exterminator, guessing they made them like Soul Binders that you can dmg</div></div><hr />

<br />
Took about an hour for me and a druid to kill'em, with the druid keeping 4 dots on him at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varf</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Executioner in Rivervale... i killed him the other day, i would say he has about the HP of Arch Lich... took me about 15 hours to kill, yes 15 hours... i have wep off Kuro in CharB and got a blood point for there lifetap procs... then was afk about 14 hours :p <br />
<br />
hes green, no xp, drop rivervale guard normal drops, but its an accomplishment in my book<br />
<br />
anyway, if you need to beat on somthing hes a good target, can tank him for prolly a good hour w/o heals of buffs</div></div><hr />
