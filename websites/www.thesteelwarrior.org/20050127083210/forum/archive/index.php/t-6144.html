<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, just got the health of target's target leader AA(it owns!), but with sars UI the health bar doesn't move, and is  covering up the health % in the window. So, any ideas on how i could make it work properly? perhaps get the window from a different UI?<br />
I'm no good with any coding n such so don't go there :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh i found a different target window and just put the XML file in sars ui folder and it works.  Found it here http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3141<br />
This will work til Sars makes one hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zhakran</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also having some trouble with this, using SARS4. <br />
<br />
I downloaded and used the window you suggest GSW, and it works, but it still has the problem of the actual healthbar only representing 20% of the target's life...It will skyrocket back and forth as they go from 61 to 59%.....very irritating. Does anyone have a solution to this that lets me see a normal life bar there? <br />
<br />
I tried replacing the default xml file, but it doesnt work....the one GSW provided does, but still has that issue...<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any help :D</div></div><hr />

I'll try to find time to look at it tonight and see if I can fix it the same way.<br />
<br />
Leadership window fix is on the Sars forums for those that may want it.</div></div><hr />
