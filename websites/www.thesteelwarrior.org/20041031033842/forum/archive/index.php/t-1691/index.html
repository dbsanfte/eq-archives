<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beeffy Jeerky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Enrage blow is 700 hate i think, and that anger is 650, but with the 100 point stun, it migt be prety damn nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That would be one killer offhand.</div></div><hr />

Resist Adjust -400<br />
<br />
Near unresitable DD+stun+hate proc with amazing stats and a killer ratio. Plus its even slow enough to minimize riposte damage when used in combo with a FB shield. Someone at SOE might actually be listening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BoodTheDorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did anyone think this might be a viable option to go in primary with Sword of Primordial Power in the offhand? Each is slow enough to avoid a lot of ripostes, and it would probably be excellent aggro.<br />

<br />
Mainhand that?<br />
<br />
Come on now! That would hurt peoples' brains.<br />
<br />
You're thinking way too logically.<br />
<br />
Why would you EVER mainhand a 34/31 with a good aggro proc, when you could be mainhanding a 15/20 or a 16/19 or something amazing like that!<br />
<br />
And don't even think about MAINHAND DAMAGE BONUS applying to a 34 damage weapon. Good gravy, that might actually be viable DPS!<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
I'm used to MONKS forgetting that Ratio counts for a hecuva lot when considering dual wielding combos.<br />
<br />
But for warriors to also fail that test?<br />
<br />
Don't let me down people.<br />
<br />
Don't be that guy!<br />
<br />
A greater than 1.0 ratio in the mainhand is only IMRPOVED by having a damage bonus. Tacking an aggro PROC onto means ... mainhand is definitely a good spot for it.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Project DARC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I cant imagine how anyone could come up with a feasible reason to offhand this.<br />

<br />
if im gonna use a slow ass weapon, i better be holding it with 2 hands, not some cheezy ass 1 hander with a delay greater than the population of India.<br />
<br />
if it were offhandable, yeah, it would be a killer weapon, but not as a primary only weapon.<br />
<br />
31 delay, come on, what are we stupid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Weapon speed aint really an issue. This is not a DPS weapon.<br />
<br />
This is &quot;THE TANKING&quot; weapon. And last time i checked &quot;Tanks'R us&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah its slow, but it will probably swing as often as a BoW.<br />
Yeah its got a &quot;special ratio&quot; but it should dish some decent dps.<br />
<br />
Its all about agro &amp; surviving, and i believe this is the BoW killer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Youre forgetting also, your mainhand is your Flurry hand and you will be landing a shitload more hits vs your offhand. This coupled with Rathe 1hs in offhand would be a killer combo with low riposte worries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maybe this is SoE's attempt at making sword &amp; board a viable option for warriors.  Combine this w/ the furious bash VII shield and you might have a nice aggro combo.  I don't know enough about furious bash and the aggro that it generates, thou.  Of course, what do I know, I'm only 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you'll wield a high delay 2h and still get good aggro, then why not a high delay 1h that has the best aggro proc in the game?  You're defeating your own arguments.  Like someone said, this is the kind of weapon that shows SOE may actually have a few people without their heads firmly entrenched in their own asses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please tell me that you honestly dont beleive that weapon speed has anything to do with aggro anymore.<br />
<br />
Weapon speed used to generate more DPS like in the case of the moss covered twig (3/10) and thats where the aggro came from, not the actual swing speed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have a question in regards to this weapon, maybe someone can answer it.<br />
<br />

Slot Description <br />
1: Stun(0.00 sec/65) <br />
2: Decrease Hitpoints by 100 <br />
3: Increase Hate by 650 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does this mean if the stun is resisted, the 650 hate part of the effect will not transfer through?<br />
<br />
We'll be killing the mob that drops this very soon, and before I loot this item, I'd like to know if this is the case.<br />
<br />
I remember certain spells with multiple effects (Barb of Tallon's snare/slow, for example) having their &quot;slots&quot; swapped around on Lucy, so that the whole effect would take place even if you &quot;blocked&quot; part of the effect.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I have no idea how Lucy works, etc.<br />
<br />
If anyone could answer this, it'd be great!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;Does this mean if the stun is resisted, the 650 hate part of the effect will not transfer through?&quot;<br />
<br />
The 0 second stun is a spell interrupt, like the ykesha proc.<br />
<br />
Do they get resisted a lot? I know up through tier 1 and 2 they still interrupt a lot and draw a ton of aggro.<br />
<br />
This isn't your standard Stunning Blow proc on sometehing like Baton of Royal Stature or Battlefists.<br />
<br />
This is more akin to a Ykesha or a ranger imbue weapon spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I recognize that, but look at the slot order of your example, Ykesha:<br />
<br />
Ykesha<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 75 <br />
2:  Stun(0.00 sec) <br />
<br />
<br />
Notice the DD component is first?<br />
<br />
I own Gloves of the Crimson Sigil, purely for agro (They imbue my weapons with Call of Fire effect,) and that effect, too, has the DD component before the stun.<br />
<br />
What I am saying is this: <br />
Since the Stun component is first on the slot list, if it is resisted (Which it will be, on anything &gt;65,) will the effect even proccess the hate component, and DD componenet, which are farther down the slot list?<br />
<br />
The example I was using, was Tallons old Slow/Stun effect, which had slots removed and switched around, to prevent people exploiting the effect by snaring themself prior, and thus the whole effect &quot;not taking hold&quot; on the person it landed on. There was rumour a guild was using this stacking exploit, to trivliaze the kill, so the slot change had to be made.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Date change <br />
06-11 11:12 Added Slot 4: Decrease Movement by 40% <br />
06-11 11:12 Removed Slot 2: Decrease Movement by 40% <br />
<br />
 Barb of Tallon <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease HP when cast by 1250 to 2750 (random) <br />
3:  Decrease Attack Speed by 40% <br />
4:  Decrease Movement by 40%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hmmmm.<br />
<br />
Looks like someone's going to have to try it and find out.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The stun doesn't get &quot;resisted&quot;.  Mobs are just immune to it.  In addition to the stun immunity the whole spell can be &quot;resisted&quot; based on the target's magic resist.  I don't think it matters which slot the effects are in, the hate and DD will stick if it passes  the mob's MR check, and the stun will stick if the spell is not resisted and the mob is level 65 or lower.  <br />
<br />
Stun immunity has nothing to do with resists.  Of course the only person that could tell us for sure is the guy that owns it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I know what you are trying to say Ainian, but you are thinking about stacking issues and how spell effects overwrite other effects. In this case there is no stacking issue since the stun does not leave an icon or overwrite any effects. When they changed stuns, they made it so that spells with a stun + an effect where treated as 2 seperate items. Before the change, if the stun was resisted, then the whole spell was automatically resisted. This is no longer the case. Now if the stun portion of the spell is resisted, the other components get their own resist check so they are unaffected. It works the same with stun immunity. The effects each have their own resist check so you will still be landing the DD and the Hate portions of the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well i got a little question : Anarchy <br />
<br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 273 (L34) to 288 (L39) <br />
2:  Stun(0.00 sec) <br />
<br />
We all remember the SoD, We all had/used one ages ago.<br />
I clearly remember 5 scenario with the SoD.<br />
* Immune to Stun /  Full DD<br />
* Immune to Stun / Partial DD<br />
* Immune to Stun / No DD<br />
* Stun Lands / Full DD<br />
* Stun Lands / Partial DD<br />
<br />
Does anyone actually remember :<br />
* Stun Lands / No DD<br />
<br />
I (tend) to believe both effects are checked separatly.<br />
<br />
<br />
However i do have a comment in my mind.<br />
- 400 is a better resist check than most lures.<br />
(Agreed this proc is supposed to be unresistable)<br />
<br />
Most Lures will land on non immune mobs no ? (Wandor)<br />
I mean u cant expect to land Fire lure on Fire immune mobs.<br />
<br />
That leads to another question...  Are there magic immune mobs ?<br />
Sorry but my knowledge of mobs resist is low, and i'm too lazy<br />
to start looking for the 6/6/6 resist chart at Graffe's (Wandor)<br />
<br />
If there arent any &quot;Magic Immune&quot; mobs exept a few old world<br />
exeption, where no one will ever go anyway, then the -400RM<br />
check (i do instist this should be unresistable) shouldnt be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">emp and seru are 2 immune mobs but i cant think of any pop mobs that are immune <br />
<br />
what does the sword look like? BoW graphic?<br />
<br />
-kriegar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Like Kriegar said, the only magic immune mobs I can think of are Seru and Emp. Spite golems in Hated used to be, but magic sorta lands since revamp. Other than those, magic lands very well on most PoP mobs, it's pretty much what you cast if you are not sure what lands. Toss in a Tash and a -400 resist check and for all intents and purposed, it's unresistable.<br />
<br />
That is unless mobs can have higher than 500 to a resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Don't know if this is relevant, but with enchanter nukes where you have a DD and a stun component if you nuke a mob which is immune to the stun component both parts are treated seperately in that if the DD lands it will be followed by a message to say that your target was immune to the stun portion of the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The question is how is the DPS coupled with say something like the Rathe 1HS compared to a Blade of War. Unless it's more, then there's little reason to upgrade unless you are just wanting the extra HP. Weapon upgrades for warriors should be a step forward in agro AND DPS. Although some people may say that agro is of course more important (and it is), why should you have to decrease your DPS (which in essence helps your agro)?</div></div><hr />
