<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok everyone knows that using 2 handed weapons in the higher end game (PoP, GoD, Hard LDoN) lessens the riposte damage taken, but my question is this. <br />
Is it better to use a faster or slower 2 handed weapon? Do you take even less riposte damage using one over the other? Or does it not matter?<br />
I've heard people talking about this in-game but never have gotten a difinitave answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">refering JUST to riptose damage, yes, teh SLOWER weapon will pull less riptoses, they can only riptose a hit, and if you are hitting them slower, odds are there are less chances for a riptose in a given fight (90 hits in a fight compared to only 60 with a slower weapon). <br />
<br />
another thing to consider is that slower 2hander have a higher delay, with makes or brakes a 2hander... i have a greater poleaxe of sorrow, freak'n awesome looking weapon, but it doesn't preform NEAR at the level you would think it would due to its fast delay killing off its damage bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The reason im asking is because i have a Grest Staff of the Four Winds that i love tanking with and im considering Anger auging it. In the right group i have no problem holding agro with it unauged, using incite on incomming naturally.<br />
<br />
In a poorly set up group or where people dont know what there doing it can be a nitemare holding agro with it....IE nukers and dotters going nuts on incomming, slowers that cant land a slow.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use the GSot4W almost exclusively now with the anger 3 aug.  I have some nuke happy friends that have to really work at pulling mobs off me now and once I get aggro, even the palys have issues.  My hubby is a 65 paly and has tried a number of times with no success....weee.  My guild just did MM for the first time and I used the 4w for tanking him.  It worked great.  If you have WA it helps as well.  Bottom line is what works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The more swings you take, the more riposte you can get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats something you can really do nothing against, only swear the crap out of them and smack some sense on their heads... if all fails, they will have to deal with the consequences.<br />
<br />
Its true that you gotta try your best to hold agro because its your job, but if they are making it harder on purpose and they know it, Im not gonna sweat over avoiding their death. Its true that is frustrating because you wanna feel having the control of the mob, but those asses are just playing &quot;How many times can I nuke in 10 secs&quot;, and you cant avoid it, it goes far beyond your possibilities, taunt only refreshes every 6 seconds and incite wont snap the mob back if the nuker keeps nuking even when the mob is pounding on him. <br />
<br />
Just do the best you can :)</div></div><hr />
