Now here is the question....<br />
<br />
Which spells do you use in an Experience group? Why do you use that spell? Where do you get Experience at, that this spell is so effective? How many times a 'Mob' do you cast this spell? And Finally WHY should that spell be as effective as it is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavr</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Force of akilea and Akera<br />
<br />
Exp in Bot, HoH, PoV, LDoN and then alot of odd places two boxinb my baby chanter.<br />
<br />
Akilea I use to stun the mob while slow lands or to stun on pull to seperate the pull up some to make it easier to CC.  Akera is used to stun the mob if it gets free or to build added agro if someone is taking agro.<br />
<br />
Yes, I DO lose agro even when stunning.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't like BoT cause alot of the stuff is immune to akera and not having the added melee mitigation means someone takes a pounding if slow misses or agro moves.<br />
<br />
Average casts is one akilea, one akera per fight if no one take agro.  If agro jumps then I chain till mob is dead or till I notice it hurting my mana.<br />
<br />
Both of those spells should remain as they are because without them I couldn't tank or offtank.  They are the only thing allowing me a long enough lifespan for heals/slows to land.  I take a huge amount of damage compared to the warriors I have grouped with or that are in the same level of the game as me.  Maybe if my AA's were maxed and I had time level gear that wouldn't be the case, but we just killed emp a few weeks ago and I dont' have the gear needed to be an effective tank in PoP.  I do fine in LDoN, but so do the rangers and monks that I've grouped with.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't loaded any of the other stuns in months.  FoA and FoA are all I use because they have low enough mana I can use them when needed and because they allow me to tank mobs that would own me otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dunno it depends on adventure, sometimes if i'm lazy i just use group heals and divine stun for aggro, with an occastioanl FoA if things go bad, but normal adventures are really easy with high end gear, and homos wont do hard much, =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Force of Akilae + Force of Akera<br />
<br />
Use FoAkilae due to cast time + the fact it will actually stun mobs in Elementals + Ldon.  Akera cause it can stun mobs in &quot;normal&quot; ldon.  For raids where i meztank, its cease + desist (rathe) or akilae/akira (time) as in time, i can actually stun a large number of the mobs with akilae, and i just dont swap out akira.<br />
<br />
I exp in Valor (duo), Fire (duo) or ldon.  In valor + fire, Akilae is the only stun that will actually stun mobs (i never use the word line, a the kb + damage aspect never has appealed to me, the only place i used them was in VT for pushing mobs into the corner).<br />
<br />
I cast them roughly 4 times each a fight (duo) before the mob even gets to me (i duo with a shaman, box actually, so its root, malos, slow, dot, sot, sot + stuns over and over + engage).  In ldon, its 2-3 times to get aggro, and then a variance depending on who im grouped with. Mages, i dont need to stun anymore, most melee i dont either, wizards i need to stun a ton, if they are buffed right.<br />
<br />
That question would already take into consideration me thinking its broken in some form or another.  Stuns are the methods SoE is giving us now for aggro generation. BSS + group heals are our raid contribution. Stuns are our aggro control.  <br />
<br />
Its not &quot;effective&quot; to cast a 90 mana spell and not do anything to the mob besides making it not like you all that much. I never likes akira, as its useless for what i would want it for. LDoN has helped it a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrast</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My used stuns have changed as of recently.  Bear in mind, I ALWAYS have an enchanter (read: Tranquility) available, due to being married to one.<br />
<br />
Generally I have 2 stuns up, Cease and Akilae.  However, since hitting 65 and doing some BoT groups, I tend to use Akilae and Serenity more.  Being a VERY undergeared paladin (I can post my magelo if need be, but I've used my epic for 3 years or so, if that gives you any idea), the mitigation I get from these higher level stuns is well worth the mana cost, I just have to space it out so I don't fall below 60% mana or so, in case I need to shell out some heals (only about 2.8k mana).  Cease will always be a good pull option, but it's getting to the point where actually stunning the mob is worth more than the bare aggro it gets, which is why I'm using our more costly stuns these days.<br />
<br />
I notice Elemental+ geared warriors not having aggro problems, I have to wonder if this whole problem isn't just another branch off of the issues that casual players have when compared to powergamers.  As a casual player, I know how it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use FoA to stop mobs from <br />
<br />
1: running<br />
2: hitting a caster<br />
3: when a CH is going to be late on someone<br />
4: gating<br />
5: CHing<br />
<br />
* this is the ONLY stun I mem.  I xp in HoH (undeads), BoT, and LDoN normal missions.  However ive succeeded in 5+ hards so far... i have only been MT once and needed 2 healers (havent had a single healer able to keep me up yet without requiring downtime :( ).  Most of the time the warriors MT in hard adventures, and I use the &quot;piggyback&quot; agro thing when / if they need it.  I use FoA as it has a decent cast time, doesnt require much mana like QWoT does, and it doesnt have a knockback effect.  I would say I use this spell once per fight, usually at engagement of mobs where they ping pong on incs and I stun so warrior locks agro on them... however I use it more on casting mobs as they gate/CH or whatever if bash doesnt interrupt.  <br />
<br />
I also have Divine Stun up for use if FoA is not ready to cast... but I would say I use that once out of an entire adventure... ie people are very careful not to pull agro off tanks that hit / quad 988s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main reason elemental+ geared warriors don't have as many problems is:<br />
<br />
1. Access to all-around better equipment, including better agro weapons.<br />
<br />
And mostly:<br />
<br />
2. A much larger percentage of elemental people that they'll be fighting with do not have as big of an issue controlling their own agro.<br />
<br />
Since agro is the groups problem with a warrior instead of just the tank's problem with a knight that means the warrior doesn't have as many problems when grouped with people who can manage their own agro.  There are still dumbasses who rode their guild's train getting flagged for elementals, but there's a smaller percentage than in the lower tiers where people can just walk in after a certain level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrast</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I meant by that was, casual players tend to suffer in ways that powergamers do not.  For warriors, it's lack of good aggro weapons/gear.  For paladins (such as myself), it's lack of good tanking gear (and to a lesser extent, weapons).  Thankfully, spells are usually readilly available, with certain exceptions, so long as one is willing to spend the time farming cash, one way or another, to pay for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is Torrast...<br />
<br />
98% of the droppable 'Tank' Gear is just as usable by Knights as it is by warriors... <br />
<br />
So Not only do warriors need aggro weapons, they need this same gear you need. That is where the essence of the inequality lies. A full spellbook, makes up For ALOT, and many knights discount and minimize the power of their spellbook, to maintain the unfair advantage that they now carry in the exp game MT slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrast</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  But on another note, while paladins and warriors can generally use the same gear, many us casual players have no access to it reguardless of our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a casual 60, and the number of items I wear that are WAR only is 1 - my Thurg BP. The number of weapons I have that are WAR only is 1 - My Bloodguard Wand. Everything else is either All/All or Allplate/All. So a Paladin could easily get tanking gear at least as good as mine, even casual ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carwenst</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which spells do you use in an Experience group? Why do you use that spell? Where do you get Experience at, that this spell is so effective? How many times a 'Mob' do you cast this spell? And Finally WHY should that spell be as effective as it is?<br />
<br />
All of these questions depend on the level of the group I am in and where I am exping. If I am doing LDoN with players below 60, I use Cease to pull and then Stun and Holy Might (they still stun the mobs I am fighting). If the mob is melee only and I am in a group that isn't testing my hold on aggro (i.e. they swapped out aggro weapons and the hefty DoTs aren't being cast on the pull), I only cast each one once and with taunt and procs from my weapon and divine might/instrument of nife I can hold aggro. If it is a caster mob, I will cast one each time I see it start to cast to interrupt.<br />
<br />
If I am in a tier 2 exp session with my friends, then I use Holy Might for aggro if we have a rogue in the group so I don't knockback the mob and Akera to stun the mob and help reduce the beating I take before slow lands. Again, if they are testing my aggro I would cast more often, but usually a cast of each and then procs and taunt works wonderfully.<br />
<br />
As far as why a stun should generate aggro like it does, why shouldn't it? Shadowknight, beastlord, and ranger spells generate a ton of aggro as well and I have seen all of those tank effectively - even in tier 2 planes (ranger not so well sometimes). Melee from a rogue or a monk generates a ton of aggro too, as do spells from pure casters. If you want to &quot;fix&quot; warriors, look at the warrior class. Provide them with a faster refreshing taunt that works more often. Have their weapons generate more damage. Give them a natural jump on hate just for being warriors.<br />
<br />
***Bonus material***<br />
<br />
I started playing just before PoP came out and I leveled my warrior to level 58 before I gave his gear away and deleted him because I was going to quit EQ so I wasn't tempted to waste all my time on the puter. I took a little break and came back to EQ. That is when I decided to follow the path I had in D&amp;D and make a paladin. I have him at 57 now and I have found that both of the classes has their advantages and disadvantages. <br />
<br />
I love having warriors tank in groups. They take hits better than I do and it allows me to help out with root parking, tank mezzing,  and spot healing. If I am fortunate to meet up with a good warrior, then I have no problem locking aggro from the puller while slow lands and then having them take over. It has been a very effective method because it maximizes our group's efficiency. When I played my warrior we used to do something similar where an SK would tank till he was OOM and then I would tank while he built back up and so on. It worked exceptionally well.<br />
<br />
However, I will tell you that there is nothing worse than picking up a warrior and then having them bitch about how broken warriors are all night or complain that I have better equipment, HPs, or AC. I worked my ass off for my equipment by spending weeks farming plat and camping drops, if I am better equiped than a warrior then that is the way it goes. It has nothing to do with paladins being provided too much in the way of loot, it just has to do with who wants to spend the time to get their upgrades.<br />
<br />
Aggro management is a bitch with a warrior, I know, but unless things got a hell of a lot worse in the past two months since I deleted mine, it wasn't that bad if your group had a freakin clue.</div></div><hr />

I would use the quellious in some cases for the push back as well and might load cease or desist if I'm on off tanking duty, but my FT was always low so mana is more of an issue to me than most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Runtiss</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Exp groups I normally will have Force of Akilae + Force of Akera+QwoT up, in BoT, PoV or Tactics.  Force of Akera will be resisted alot, which I have found that a resisted stun will build aggro faster than one that is not resisted /boggle.  <br />
<br />
Force of Akilae I use to get initial aggro when a caster is slowing a mob that is incoming to prevent the caster from getting squashed and I can establish solid aggro and also to prevent runners.<br />
<br />
Force of Akera I have used in conjunction with Force of Akilae to keep a mob stunned for 8 of 12 seconds, and I would only take 4 seconds of damage. ( both spells have a 8 sec refresh... Cast..count to 4, Cast... count to 4.... repeat. )<br />
<br />
QWoT I use primarily to position mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep Supernal Cleansing, Yalup IV, Healing Wave of Prexus, Touch of Nife, Shackles of Tunare, Cease, Force of Akilae, and Quellious Words of Serenity loaded 90% of the time.  I get experience in LDoN Normal, BoT, Tactics, and the like.<br />
<br />
Supernal Cleansing is used to heal someone who has taken damage but is not in real trouble.  It is well balanced with it's relatively high mana cost, and long recast time.  My healing rate is really dependent on who else is in the group and the mana regen situation.   In a group with a Druid healer and a BL and KEI I can heal a lot, while more commonly I might drop a heal every other fight or so.<br />
<br />
Yalup IV:  This is a STR/ATK buff.  It lasts 18 seconds, so must be reapplied a lot.  The moderate benefit is balanced by stacking issues and the constant attention needed to keep it active.<br />
<br />
Healing Wave of Prexus is a group heal for 600 HP.  I prefer it to Wave of Marr (a larger group heal) because of the lower mana cost, and the fact I like to cast it before a LOT of damage is done.  The spell still has a high mana cost to balance its use.<br />
<br />
Touch of Nife:  This is a classis oh @#$#@ spell.  It heals 850 HP for 400 mana, but it casts in 1 second.  I use it when someone needs healing NOW.  This is a great example of a well balanced spell.  It has enough HP to make a difference for most non tanks and is fast enough to use in an emergency but costs a LOT of mana for the effect.  I might not cast this for a long time, then cast three in a row in a trouble spot.  Certainly the mana cost is too high for sustained use.<br />
<br />
Shackles of Tunare is a fast casting root.  It is very good for ghetto crowd control.  I use it mostly when there is no mezzer in a group.<br />
<br />
Cease:  I frequently pull with Cease.  The fact that it doesn't actually stop the mob is a benefit in some pulling situations.  I also use it to build hate on mezzed mobs without breaking mezz.  I will not argue with those who feel the aggro of this spell is a problem on mobs that it cannot actually stun.<br />
<br />
Force of Akilae:  I cast Akilae as soon as the mob actually hits camp to stun the mob before slow lands and to cement aggro.  I will also use it to add hate to a mezzed mob on occasion, as well as to interrupt casting.  This spell is level appropriate, and has an appropriate mana cost.  It was designed to be one of a high level Paladin's main tools and it is.<br />
<br />
Quellious Words of Serenity:  I use this at the start of a fight against a tough mob (Kriger, named, etc) to mitigate damage.  I also use to to position mobs and to interrupt casting.  The spell has a large mana cost and long casting time to balance it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carnican</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will have Akera (75%) and Akilae (100%) loaded most of the time.<br />
<br />
Akilae is hot-keyed for two reasons: 1) the guild pallys will stun rotation a mob, and the hot-key communicates that cast, and 2)  is that Akilae is very fizzy, so I have three /cast lines in that hotkey.<br />
<br />
Akera for added aggro in an exp group, or if I need to tank-mez, stun/taunt mez until an SA or chanter can take over the CC duties.<br />
<br />
In an exp-only group, where I am tanking, I add Holy Might in for the DD component (on top of the resisted Stun aggro).  Lately, I exp in PoE in the left-most corner area on the ledge.  I will pull with Akilae, stack Akera on the mob while its motionless, and head to camp, and try to drop a Holy Might on the mob before it reaches camp.<br />
<br />
In an exp group where I have a warrior, and no FD class, I will still pull with Akilae and Akera.  This is generally enough hate generated for the debuffers to have thier way, while passing aggro to the warrior.<br />
<br />
I exp with differing levels of guild warriors.  Some are equipped with BoW's aug-ed with Anger, some are red-epic'd/BoC users.<br />
<br />
As for number of casts during the fight?  Depends again on who I am grouped with.  As MA, Akilae and Akera is chain cast.  As an /assist-man, only as needed.  The &quot;as needed&quot; is already mentioned as &quot;to stop a cast, the stall an attack for CH to land, and to park an add till CC can get it handled&quot;.<br />
<br />
If I have a Bard or Chanter in group, NO DD component stuns will be loaded for obvious reasons.  If a Shammy is our only means of CC, then sure, a DD component stun might see my spell line.<br />
<br />
The least of my priority is the knock-back stuns.  Mob position is an art-form and rarely do I see a tank (any class) take positioning seriously.  If the position is so grossly out of hand, I will back out, pray I don't get summonsed, and load a knockback to do what the MA can't do, or the what pets are interfering with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romidar</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Akilae and Akera are the two stuns I use.<br />
<br />
Our pushback stuns have a cast time that is too long to be useful except in situations where the pushback is NEEDED (e.g., gaters).<br />
<br />
I want the stun to actually stop the mob for a few seconds. Further, I spend most of my play time in LDoN now where I need to be able to interrupt casters.<br />
<br />
I don't have enough spell gems to load more than 2 stuns; however, I do have Divine Stun which I use to pull. Divine Stun has almost no aggro, however, so I hit the mob with Akilae once it is in camp.<br />
<br />
Even with KEI, I cannot chain stun Akilae and Akera. Typically I'll cast Akilae almost every time it refreshes (we don't slow LDoN mobs). Akera gets used fairly frequently, though, when we have a caster OR multiple mobs at once. If we have 2 mobs in camp, I'll end up using 20% or more of my mana for maintaining aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mightion</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what I generally use in groups since reaching 62:<br />
<br />
1. Force of Akera - This one is used to tag the mob of the puller, or to pull.  Used especially for tags if the mob is immune/over its level if I don't want the mobs standing still where it can attract adds.  I usually have time to cast Akilae to cement aggro.<br />
<br />
2. Celestial Cleansing - Good for topping off HP, not much use in Tier 2 and higher during fights where mobs hit for 544 (Golems in Valor, for instance)<br />
<br />
3. Healing Wave of Prexus - For when there are more than two people taking damage, like when CC isn't established, or it's hit the fan.  That one level of Healing Gift has saved more than a few people when it crits for 1320. :)<br />
<br />
4. Greater Immobilize - When the mob isn't snared, we have no bard, and we MUST stop it from running away.<br />
<br />
5. Force of Akilae - A stun spell I love very, very much.  Nothing like stopping a mob up to 65 from pounding on someone for 4 seconds.  Works good for pulling mobs off casters.<br />
<br />
6. Touch of Nife - Well, for when something needs 1125/2250 hp five seconds from now.  Used for touchup heals mostly - I use HWoP when stuff hits the fan.<br />
<br />
7.  If I don't have Pacify here, there is where I'll put whatever spell is needed - be it a self buff, Nullify Magic, etc...<br />
<br />
8.  Yaulp IV.  Love the stamina regen when I'm two handing.<br />
<br />
Last time I used QWoT was in HoT for positioning.  Haven't really needed it since, mainly due to the cast time, and the stun is more important than any damage the way I play.</div></div><hr />

What you got was good, honest anwers as to how the pallys use thier stuns.  You even got answers as to how a pally may normally run their loaded spells.<br />

What have you detirmined?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jynn Tlespirit</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason I feel like I am handing someone a signed confession that will send me to the chair, but I will answer anyway.<br />
<br />
Here is my spell line up that I normally use.  I may change it around depending on situation and mob we are handling.  I belong to a family guild so on many raid encounters anyone who can heal is pressed into service to spam heal the mt, a warrior, until slows land and then paladins go to melee later.<br />
<br />
Touch of Nife--1125 healing 450 mana 5 second cast time.  My main heal spell, but at that mana cost it isn't cast extensively unless we are healer short.<br />
<br />
Light of Nife  850 healing  400 mana 1 second cast time.  My emergency heal.  <br />
<br />
Healing Wave of Prexus.  660 healing 650 mana 3 second cast.  My group heal.    I cast this mainly when the group takes an ae hit.<br />
<br />
Cease I use it if I am OT mainly or if caster is getting pounded to distract it until MT can get aggro back.  Normally once per encounter is all I use it unless things are going badly.  I may also use it when breaking mez for taunt.<br />
<br />
Force of Akilae  My main stun.  In OT situation if puller is coming with two or three mobs I will use this to get aggro and let others know which mob I am on.  If three are coming I try to root the last one and stun the second one.  Either another OT can tag the rooted one or someone else can try to keep it root parked until we can handle it or handle it another way.  It's just a stalling technique to get the situation in hand.  While mob is stunned I will tag it with arrows.<br />
<br />
QWoT  I seldom use.  I do keep it up for emergency situations where we have mob in wall, getting ready to go off the side to spin stun and repostion mob or to interrupt a gate.  It is strictly used for the knock back effect.<br />
<br />
Next slot is my wild card where I load whatever is most useful in present encounter.  Normally pacify, divine aura,  heal over time spell  or root if we are having problems with cc.<br />
<br />
Last slot greater immobilize.  It may be my imagination, but it seems this is very ineffective much of the time so I will load a second root if I am having problems getting it to stick or last very.<br />
<br />
I belong to a family guild that has one high end warrior who works 4 nights a week and another whose time is very limited atm.  We also have a few others who are lower, but leveling.  Other classes that can tank are expected to whether it be paladin, sk, ranger, beast, bard whatever.  Classes that can heal are often group healers if our clerics are mia.  I noticed in more than one post people have mentioned we can replace clerics.  I guess I was very poorly created or am poorly equipped because the only healing I can do is on the emergency level or to augment the group/raid healer with either group heals or a fast cast so I am very seldom put in the role of a group healer unless another healer is covering two groups and I am filling the gap.<br />
<br />
As to why my spells should be as effective as they are?  Most of my healing spells are hand me downs from clerics that I get several levels after they do.  That is the way they should be.  We aren't clerics.  If the opinion is that they should be made less effective, then will they also be less effective for clerics?<br />
<br />
Why should  stuns be so effective?  If the solution is to nerf stuns at what point do you stop?  I love cease.  I can get snap aggro in an emergency to distract a mob until the MT can get aggro back.  Or I can distract it and root it so caster can scoot out of the way.  It helps getting aggro before I break mez.  I can use other spells, but people are usually wanting to keep the kill fest goint so taking longer to safely break mez is more of an inconvenience to others.  If the answer is to nerf stuns so they would be completely worthless unless they are of the level of the mob, that would throw nearly all the stuns out the window since many also carry a knock back effect which should only be used for specific cases in my opinion.  If you delete stuns what happens to the stun proc on weapons that corresponds with the stun spells?  Does it also get deleted?<br />
<br />
We all need to keep in mind that not all guilds are in the elite upper layer.  There are many family guilds who have to make use of their members in several roles.  Pullers might be monks, rangers, sk, paladins warriors, bards depending on who is available.  In our case, our warriors are preferred tanks simply because we don't have an abundance of clerics and they are the best at taking a beating, plus they just flat know their jobs and do it very well.  Paladins, beasts and sk are OT and most of the time, it is very easy to transfer aggro to the warrior when they are ready for the mob.  Most smaller guilds are like this, I think.  Versatility is vital to them.  <br />
<br />
I've had many discussion with friends of mine who are warriors and even some in high end guilds.  I know there is a problem. I've known it for some time and I know it's frustrating.  Monks and rogues are also frustrated.  Something needs to be done.  I spent 40 levels of frustration, not just a month as one person stated, and it's just now getting to be a lot of fun so I do empathize with the situation.  <br />
<br />
You have support from many, many people and not just other warriors.  Please keep this in mind.  There are many knights who are in your corner and willing to stand with you to get your message out, but at this point they are beginning to wonder if showing up at the stand down is wise.  I would rather not spend the day trying to support pure melee and get a generous dose of abuse for doing so.  <br />
<br />
On our last mech raid a lower 50's warrior who was a guest was in my group.  We were assigned to keep and eye on the gnome and take out anything that aggroed him.  The group leader told the others to set assist on me since I would be mt for the group.  The warrior said, &quot;Oh, the paladin is the mt?  I forgot I am just a lowly warrior,&quot; and then asked for an x-loc out.  Excuse me, dear, you are ten levels lower than I am and you are a guest who we are unfamiliar with, what did you expect.  It's just an example of how ridiculous some of this is getting.  The hot heads on both sides are not furthering the cause, they are just stirring up crap and most likely doing it just to get a little attention.  I'm sure the cooler heads must realize there is a reasonable middle ground to meet on and the spiteful rhetoric by either side is serving no useful purpose.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, I have spoken to many warriors about this to get their views on it.  I have a warrior but at her level she is not experiencing the problems stated yet.  Friends who are warriors and some others who are more tempered, offer straight out information about the problems and some logical, viable solutions.  Many others just take it as an opportunity to vent every vile thing they can think of directed at paladins and I have to wonder how on earth paladins managed to single-handedly ruin the warrior class, rape and pillage every warrior village, kill every warrior dog, sell into slavery every warrior sister and push every warrior land into the sea.  I missed out on a lot of action evidently.  Ok, I am being facetious, but let's get realistic.  Paladins really aren't the root of every single problem a warrior has.  Let's look beyond the easy solutions, kill all paladins, and look for something that will really do you some good.  If you don't, you will simply have to move on to the next class to exterminate.<br />
<br />
Warriors are supposed to be the strongest, the most feared, the most deadly in direct combat.  The mobs should hate you the most because you are in the front lines taking the damage. <br />
<br />
It seems to me like the biggest problem  really is the aggro issue and the fact that much of the armor that is multi class has double the use for knights ie wis, int + mana and the ac, hp.  If the warriors have additional aggro abilites and they receive more good from the armor/weapons will that aleviate the problem?<br />
<br />
Give me some reasonable input about this.</div></div><hr />

What was this thread going to show/prove/answer?<br />
<br />
What you got was good, honest anwers as to how the pallys use thier stuns.  You even got answers as to how a pally may normally run their loaded spells.<br />
<br />
What have you detirmined?  <br />
<br />
Now here is the question....<br />
<br />
Q.) Which spells do you use in an Experience group?  <br />
A.) The answer seems to be 2 different stuns... At 65 Paladins have 9 different stuns they can use, so why do they have this many stuns? Seems to me that hard capping stuns so that only 2 are usable at a time on a mob does not seem unreasonable.. one with DD/KB one no DD/no KB... But when this was suggested. paladins screamed they would be worthless..<br />
<br />
Q.) Why do you use that spell?  <br />
A.) I only saw maybe 1 or 2 even mention anything about interupting casters..  all I saw was aggro aggro aggro... <br />
<br />
Q.) Where do you get Experience at, that this spell is so effective? <br />
A.) Tier 2-3 on average...Same as above, aggro,aggro,aggro...<br />
<br />
Q.) How many times a 'Mob' do you cast this spell? <br />
A.) This seems to be, if true.. 2 stuns per mob on average?<br />
<br />
Q.) And Finally WHY should that spell be as effective as it is?<br />
A.) No one seemed to have an answer for this one...<br />
<br />
Now why did I do this? Because when I analyzed the paladin spells in another thread.. It was said by paladins that this woul &quot;CRIPPLE&quot; them... make them, 'gasp' not any better than a warrior taunting.<br />
<br />
That thread is here... http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3850 <br />
<br />
The purpose was to remove any of these ideas from the conversation and see how Knights responded.. If the answers here were honest.. seems to me, that NONE- of my suggestions would seriously affect the current situation.. <br />
<br />
But of course that would be a fair and balanced look at the subject...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jynn Tlespirit</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few problems with your perspective.<br />
<br />
At 65 we have 9 different stuns.  We don't have 9 different stuns at 9, 20, 30, 40 and 50.  Just as with any caster, most spell lines are updated and they use the improved versions or they use the lower level spells for specific situations.  Clerics use lower level heals as well as their latest ones depending on the need.  I don't play a strict caster, but I would imagine they have lower level spells that they use for some things and don't automatically delete a spell when they get a more powerful version of it.  Snare and root are lower level spells but still useful at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Most paladins don't use stuns much when not the mt because they don't want to grab aggro.  When fighting a caster I switch out to 1h and shield so I can bash and load an extra stun that actually is capable of stunning at higher levels or another knockback.  Just because the spell is there doesn't mean it is used non-stop in every encounter.  To me, it is like a weapon or a tool or a specialty piece of armor or jewelry.  I switch out weapons to suit the mob and I switch out spells to suit the mob.  Do you carry just one weapon?  Do you get rid of one weapon as soon as you get another?  I have 4 shields.  I switch them out depending on what gives me the greatest use for the encounter.  Surely one shield is sufficient.  I have 3 two-hand weapons, 3 one-hand weapons, 1 blunt and 1 piercing.  Surely I really only need one weapon since I can only use one at a time.<br />
<br />
How many responses did you have to your survey?  Not a lot.  Mostly because most paladins didn't feel like getting their throats cut.  I assure you most paladins use a stun to interrupt casters and most groups are greatful for any interruption of some deadly casts or particularly a gater.  Nearly every encounter I have been on that has a wicked caster or gater, people are reminded to use whatever they can to interrupt the gate.  I'm sorry but is the removal of this tool really going to help warriors?  It is something that is used in specific situations for specific purposes.  I know of no knowledgeable paladin who uses knockback stuns on a regular basis, but when they are needed they are invaluable.  Just because something isn't used all the time doesn't mean there is no use for it.  I don't use my resist gear all the time, but I have no intentions of throwing it out.<br />
<br />
Once again.  If you plan on getting rid of all but level 65 stuns, do you also think the same spell effect that weapons proc should be deleted?<br />
<br />
I didn't answer the experince portion of your survey.  I am usually in PoS, PoV or if I just have a short time to play I may park in Veks and solo a few mobs.  Experience isn't very good but it's some movement.  For me, it would be impossible to even solo that without stun because it is a ghetto slow and interrupts some of the casts.  <br />
<br />
Why should that spell be as effective as it is?  Does any class have a spell that is effective at higher levels than when it was first awarded?  If you are going with the argument that only stuns should not be effective then are you willing to delete all other spells that could get aggro?  Do you take away snare?  How about root?  Flash of light?  Tash?  Slow?  Heal?  <br />
<br />
I watched a monk continually grab aggro from a well equipped, knowledgeable, warrior who was a main tank for an upper end guild.  What spell are you going to take away from him that gives the advantage back to the warrior?<br />
<br />
In reality as it is now, just about anyone could take aggro from a warrior if they wanted to.    Most people who know what they are doing and have been around for a while have learned aggro management.  Our instant society we have been blessed with recently allows a knight to get instant aggro instead of waiting for the warrior to establish aggro and casters can unleash everything they have immediately instead of using a little common sense.<br />
<br />
Guilds can level a character to 65 with an epic in less than a week if they are trying to prove something.  I fully expect to see guilds &quot;tanking&quot; high end encounters with every single class there is just to prove they can do it and make a little news.  Just because it can be done doesn't mean that's the way the real world operates.<br />
<br />
I have seen many groups recently that are strictly pet classes.  Not a single cleric or tank of any kind except the pets in the bunch.  Does that mean that clerics are the next dinosaurs on their way to extinction?<br />
<br />
Any logical solution to the problem has to take the entire situation into account..  Not everyone levels to 65 in a few months.  There will still be casual players who take years to level so the lower end content cannot be gutted.  Not everyone belongs to the elite guilds so they may still have to use someone other than warriors when theirs aren't available.<br />
<br />
Improve the warrior.  Make him the main tank.  Improve his aggro control.  Lower hp on the knights if needed, but keep in mind some guilds depend on these people to tank out of necessity.  I don't mind being the OT or the back up tank since that was the idea to begin with, but neither do I want to spend every day in Veks solo.</div></div><hr />
