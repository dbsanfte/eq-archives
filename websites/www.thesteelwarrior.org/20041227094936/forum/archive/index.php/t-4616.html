<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krowbar</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty fast. I used furious + defensive which used up a little over a bubble and it was full before defensive recycled. (I even ran around provoking a few mobs in-between so I dont know when exactly it actually hit full.)<br />
<br />
Edit: My stats were real crappy too, something like 190 str, 150 sta, 108 agi and 81 dex so my endurance pool was probably really low as well.</div></div><hr />

I never thought I would ever see that happen.  Too cool.  Did you use both at same time or one then the other?</div></div><hr />

I don't have exact numbers though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
is it based on just sta?<br />
(ie caster mana pool being wis OR int)<br />
<br />
or is it all &quot;fighting&quot; stats?<br />
<br />
(if this has been answered elsewhere, please point me there, did not see anything...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I haven't had a chance to get in to combat yet, but I did screw around a bit in the Freeport newbie yard.  I popped Incite on the yard trash and then timed my Endurance regen.<br />
<br />
It took about 9 ticks to regen the 250 cost of Incite when standing and 7 ticks when sitting.  So sitting does seem to help some.  Provided that I'm doing a mob per minute and never use a disc, I can keep using Incite indefinitely, which is great.<br />
<br />
Still haven't seen any +Endurance on my items though (Velious/pre-Ele PoP gear mix).  Dunno if it is there and not marked or if SoE just hasn't gotten around to that yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A single use of Incite (250) seemed to use up 1/2 of one bubble of endurance, which would seem to indicate that I had 2500 endurance maximum in my pool.  Whether or not that just happens to be because of some mix of gear, a set number, or the status of a 65 warrior with 305 Stamina...is a whole other question I don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was able to Incite, Furious, and Stonewall  for the full duration of each.  I might have even gotten off Mighty Strike, I don't quite recall... I think I popped a 4th in there...<br />
<br />
Anyways, 65 Warrior, 280 STA unbuffed, I got the majors off and was OOE at the end.</div></div><hr />

Off all the stats I could expect of it being based on, Dex was the least expected one. What facts do you have to say that its solely based on Dex? And not STA or a combination of STR,AGI,STA,DEX?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavhok</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's based on all four melee stats:  strength, dexterity, agility, and stamina.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With Str 305, Sta 305, Agi 254 and Dex 254 I did a little rough testing and found:<br />
<br />
1. My total Endurance bar is approximately 825 pts.<br />
<br />
2. I regen endurance at a hair less than 10% per minute, standing with attack off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the END regen also affected by these stats or is that just set at some standard rate by class/level?  My END regen seems to be god-awfully slow, maybe 1% per tick at best, but I think I have a large END pool (305 to all melee stats with avatar proc up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. My total Endurance bar is approximately 825 pts. <br />
<br />
Something wrong with your math there.  A single use of Incite is 250 points according to the window in game, and it uses between 7 and 9% of my bar.  This would seem to put my endurance pool around 3125.  Unless one Incite drops you a bubble and a half, that can't possibly be correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carlelius</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah after using incite a few times I believe my END pool is about 2750 to 3k, I am still trying to figure out what is the biggest contributer to my END pool though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I made two mistakes here.  My calculation came from Healing Will having a maintenance cost of 33.  I assumed that this cost was per tick, when it is pretty clearly per second.  I also messed up on the percentage of my bar that it consumed, which was 60%, rather than 40%.  <br />
<br />
Given all that, my total endurance should actually be 3300.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really thinking that Upkeep costs are bugged. I can understand Defensive as a per second cost becaue you run out, it stops. But healing will is a per-Tick action, so why does it cost per second?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they're not going to have two different systems of upkeep cost for one discipline system. That would be bad programming (shoosh). Also, I imagine that the hp that healing will gives you is probably stacked on top of the regen system which is per tick.</div></div><hr />
