<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was there for most of it.  I did not see one question answered about melee classes, class balance, or anything pertaining to warriors in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Lots of cool stuff for casters, like being able to get rare spells like GRC from adventure points... buying all their spells from adventure points and not needing difficult drops...<br />
<br />
They said 'most' items, including epics, will be agumentable... and melee can buy loot with points... they said you can add focus effects, procs, stats, and just about anything to items...<br />
<br />
Maybe all wars can just add EB to all their weapons, course I hate EB... wonder if we can add a 750 DD + Stun to our weapons ;)<br />
<br />
5 new spells for hybrids, 8 new spells for everyone else... didn't hear about anything new for melee... melee mods, new discs... new abilities... new skills... nothing mentioned... that I saw....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wouldnt accept questions reguarding melee balance, as its not part of LDoN... go figure:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You know whats fucked up, Absor posts a message on PoN about the chat but does not bother to invite people here at the steel warrior....I mean wtf is that all about?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:edit: hehe maybe it's my sig =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">check the Tavern dorf :D <br />
<br />
( btw I wonder if the warr epic is considered a &quot;summoned&quot; item; since we can theoretically make our epic in a scabbard and destroy the sword at will and make another )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That was supposed to be an 'issue' when augmenting  epics was mentioned - be typical if they decided not to allow warr epic augments but to allow others :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i believe the swords are tagged summoned. if so they will not be augmentable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Of course the warrior epic will get screwed up.  This should surprise absolutely no one.</div></div><hr />
