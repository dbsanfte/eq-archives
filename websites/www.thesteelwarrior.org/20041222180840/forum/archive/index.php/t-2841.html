<br />
Test:<br />
<br />
65Monk 1600 ATK dual wield 15/20 Barefists with Vallon.<br />
+20 Strike Thru in total<br />
<br />
http://www.kefen.btinternet.co.uk/Strikethru.html<br />
<br />
Synopsis<br />
<br />
16m 25sec Parse<br />
1900 Attacks<br />
52 Strike Thru's (not show in above parse)<br />
2.75% of total Attacks<br />
<br />
61x52 = 3172/985 = 3.2 DPS increase<br />
<br />
61 is the Average hit times the amount Strike Thru fired, divided by the total number of seconds fighting, gives you a rough idea of the DPS increase gained from +20 Strike Through.<br />
<br />
I would also note that it became apparent that whilst you could strike through a riposte, it didn't stop you eating the riposte.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think thats a fairly decent size.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity....<br />
<br />
When was the last time you tanked a mob for more then 16 mins?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How good can it be given the above example , regardless of a larger sample?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trmonk</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">+20 Strike through is not easy to get.<br />
<br />
Thats 3 items from the Plane of Time, all from Stage 3 and above.<br />
<br />
Not like its candy dropping in Elemental Planes with +15 a pop.<br />
<br />
Gloves +5<br />
Bracer +5<br />
Ring +10<br />
<br />
Thats a lot of time and effort put in to get for such a measly return. Including atleast one Quarm item.<br />
<br />
For what it gives in return, you might as well cross strike through off the item and just look at the stats and other effects.<br />
<br />
I did some parsing for Accuracy as well.<br />
<br />
+25 Accuracy gives 3% to hit rate on 2hb weapons.<br />
<br />
But those were even smaller sample sizes. But over three seperate tests with three seperate weapons, they all showed the same 3% (ish) to hit rate. So I am inclined to give them merit for the time being until someone does even more parsing to show they are incorrect.<br />
<br />
Again another worthless melee addition.<br />
<br />
Avoidance is next on my list to test but it is not something I can do alone as a monk.<br />
<br />
But with +50 Avoidance, I am expecting to see a HUGE return on time invested to gain that amount.<br />
<br />
I will post the parses here if you are at all interested in knowing.</div></div><hr />

I would like to bring up a small point,  when you &quot;strikethrough&quot; you can still miss so your dps formula is incorrect.  It should look like this<br />
<br />
53.2 percent accuracy<br />
(52x.532)*61 = 1688/985 = 1.7 DPS increase<br />
<br />
this doesn't take into consideration the number of ripostes that were &quot;strikethroughed&quot;(&lt;wtf) which has value in and of itself.  If it doesn't stop you from eating a riposte then it is buged and needs to be /buged and done often.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if it doesn't stop you from eatting a riposte, then it's simply Tactical Mastery on an item, yes? If so, I'm pretty sure it's not considered bugged, regardless of how it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trmonk</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did an error.<br />
<br />
I had to cut this fight out of my parse, and in doing so I cut off the first half or so whilst counting Strike Thru.<br />
<br />
The data has changed slightly.<br />
<br />
16mins 25secs<br />
1900 attacks<br />
99 Strike Throughs<br />
5.2% of Total Attacks.<br />
<br />
(99x.532)*61=3212/985=3.2 DPS<br />
<br />
For an additional<br />
<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:42:10 2003] Ruwakka punches YOU for 154 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:42:10 2003] You try to punch Ruwakka, but Ruwakka ripostes!<br />
<br />
To show that the riposte message comes after the hit.<br />
<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:42:08 2003] Ruwakka tries to punch YOU, but YOU block!<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:42:08 2003] You try to punch Ruwakka, but Ruwakka ripostes!<br />
<br />
To show that I have others misses on.<br />
<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:29:36 2003] You try to punch Ruwakka, but miss!<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:29:36 2003] You try to punch Ruwakka, but miss!<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:29:37 2003] Ruwakka tries to punch YOU, but YOU dodge!<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:29:37 2003] You strike through your opponent's defenses!<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:29:37 2003] You punch Ruwakka for 38 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:29:37 2003] You punch Ruwakka for 10 points of damage.<br />
<br />
To show that when you Strioke Through an opponents defense, they no longer record a Riposte in the parse, though they do riposte.<br />
<br />
I should point out the mob I am fighting doesn't fight back, he did no damage to me OTHER then ripostes. Though he still has a normal mobs defenses.<br />
<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:30:12 2003] You punch Ruwakka for 104 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:30:13 2003] Ruwakka punches YOU for 550 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:30:13 2003] You strike through your opponent's defenses!<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:30:13 2003] You punch Ruwakka for 52 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Sep 02 05:30:13 2003] You try to punch Ruwakka, but Ruwakka dodges!<br />
<br />
And again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sscaley</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I missed some basic info on Strikethrough, so bear with me if the information has already been posted.<br />
<br />
Does Strikethrough work only on ripostes like TM, or does it include parry/dodge/block as well?<br />
<br />
The % of times that ST fires as a figure of your own swings is kinda misleading since not all mobs will have the same defensive attributes. For a more comparable figure you would have to express it as a % of times in relation to defensive skills of the mob firing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trmonk</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very good points Sscaley glad you brought them up, because they also made me realise I made another mistake.<br />
<br />
1900 atks...this is not correct, this is 1900 HITS and it was only 1701 too.<br />
<br />
So using the above formula.<br />
<br />
16mins 25secs<br />
3197 attacks<br />
99 Strike Throughs<br />
3% of Total Attacks.<br />
<br />
But Sscaley brings up some very good points, Strike Through is only supposed to work against the opponents defenses.<br />
<br />
So....<br />
<br />
3197 Attacks.<br />
1701 Were Hits<br />
1124 Were Misses<br />
126 Were Dodges<br />
144 Were Parries<br />
192 Were Ripostes<br />
<br />
But now we have a problem.<br />
<br />
We must also count the 99 Strike Thru's in this number.<br />
<br />
372 + 99 = 471<br />
<br />
Because each time there was a strike thru, it took out the Riposte message, I must assume it was the same for dodge and parry, and having had a look at the parse, I think it is, although I am not 100% certain because its very confusing.<br />
<br />
Now considering that when I do that,  I come to the figure of 21%.<br />
<br />
I am going to go out on a limb and say my maths or parse readings are not perfect and that it is infact 20%.<br />
<br />
+20 Strike Through breaks through the mobs ACTIVE defenses 20% of the time.<br />
<br />
Meaning I would think that +1 Strike Through would mean breaking through the mobs active defenses 1% of the time.<br />
<br />
That isn't actually too shabby.<br />
<br />
Of course compare that with the fact that the mobs active defense only equate to 16.5% of the reasons you fail to hit the mob and its a little less impressive.<br />
<br />
Still not nearly as bad as my original parse made it out to be.<br />
<br />
