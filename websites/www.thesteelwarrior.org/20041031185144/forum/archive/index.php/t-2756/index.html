Sell the Wind-Worn in the bazaar to a Cleric/Pali/SHD/Bard and make them happy, keep the Vindi for yourself.   <br />
<br />
This is just my suggestion and does not necessarily represent the opinions of others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Vindi Definetly. Like someone said earlier, sell the wind worn crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">vindi is probabally replacable with somehting out of VT ( great shadow platemail ) or the equivelant.<br />
<br />
Vindi is just too damn good all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Vindi is a little light on AC, but with awesome resists good hps and AoB the only BPs I would consider upgrades are the AHR/Seru BPs or Raex.<br />
<br />
Definitely go Vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Vindi BP without a doubt.<br />
<br />
However if you have the option the Seru BP, AHR BP or Cursed BP would be upgrades.</div></div><hr />

but if he is max sta, isnt 7ac &gt; 55hp ? since 1ac=10hp ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lets switch this around a bit<br />
<br />
IMHO<br />
BPs &gt; Vindi (in no particular order)<br />
Seru<br />
Speed<br />
Cursed<br />
AHR<br />
Rathe<br />
Time<br />
<br />
Ornate BP, POWater crafted BP are situational upgrades/honorable mention<br />
<br />
Vindi is by far the most readily farmable, 8hrs spawn if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i would say ornate and even statue bp are better too. more ac is the win, aob and resists justs dont matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you'll get to the point where the extra stats on the statue BP dont matter anymore.<br />
<br />
Vindi vs Statue is about 7save vs all, 2hp/tick regen, 10attack vs 10ac.<br />
<br />
Ornate is a bigger gain of AC so maybe its big enough there, but as someone not at the top of the tank list I get more use from AoB and saves than I would from 10 AC anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Between vindi and statue I think it's a toss up based on what you will be doing.  I agree that Ornate, Cursed, Inny, Seru, Speed, AHR, Rathe, and Raex are the only ones really better than vindi.  Farwater is a bit better, but not huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, Ornate BP is not only better, but easier to get than a Vindi BP. Vindi is on an 8hr repop and can only drop 1 BP at a time. You also have to deal with his guards and clearing the arena out.<br />
<br />
Eindride Icestorm on the other hand has a 6hr repop. You can lull your way all the way to him, you only have to kill 5-6 giants to clear enough room to fight him. He also can drop as many as 2 BP molds at a time.<br />
<br />
If you are looking to upgrade a Vindi BP, I would go for ornate, Cursed, Seru, Speed, AHR, Rathe, Time - in that order considering difficulty (not rarirty) to get. I don't include Farwater, which I would put as slightly better than Ornate, because you will spend days farming the ingredients to make one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">AoB is not a big deal to a tank, and on raids with a bard neither is 7 sv all.  I wouldn't loot a Statue bp to upgrade a Vindicator one, but given the choice of the two I would take the Statue BP over Vindi.  Even if you like to figure 1 ac = 5 hp Statue is the clear winner.  Even more so if 1 ac = 10 hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldn't take a statue BP to replace my vindi.  I would however use an ornate mold and make a Kizraks BP and put the vindi in the bank (man, I been wearing that BP a long time...).<br />
<br />
And as for the original question... like everyone else has said, Vindi &gt; wind worn.</div></div><hr />
