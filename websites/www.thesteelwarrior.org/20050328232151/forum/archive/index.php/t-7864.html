He is on Kael faction so have been killing coldains for heads  in Eastern Wastes.  The only times I  find myself able to get a group is for Dulak harbor since I dont have LDoN on this account.  Really getting tired of Dulak so was hopeing for a change.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on some places where mobs dont hit too hard or have few  hp? I'm sitting around 3050hp unbuffed at lvl 43  if that helps with any ideas. Here is the magelo.  Figured someone may have a good  idea since people are so knoledgeable in these forums.  Thank you.<br />

The giants, I built up faction and got started on collecting some heads and toes. Just have a snare weapon, and carry some heal pots.</div></div><hr />
