<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razzo</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed this Agnarr toy has become a popular weapon for many tanks on Mith Marr. 17/20 ratio (18/20 when a cold check fails) and 125 are no joking matter -- however, the proc seems rather lackluster to me. 150DD? Doesn't seem like much aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyone here that uses one and could give input as to why I've seen tons of tanks choosing this over GBoS/CHSD?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use the rotting fist with an anger 2, it's glorious.  So an even better ratio + a better proc would be godly.<br />
<br />
Hope that answered your question.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was never impressed with its aggro drawing ability(but then again, im more into using 2 handers for less ripostes).  Perhaps with anger 3 it might be a much more useful weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">anything with anger 3 is a better weap =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's nice weapon to have. Actually quite good for where it drops since agnarr is a pushover. BTW I'm the only warrior who has this weapon in my guild. This weapon suits ranger better IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use agnarr's blade in offhand with BF in main.  I basically got it because 1) no one wanted it and the way our bidding system works I was able to pick it up for cheap, 2) BF + anger 3 is enough aggro for most situations, I like agnarr's blade as a nice dps addition to my setup specifically for xp groups(ldon and such)<br />
<br />
Yeah it's hardly any aggro though really, other than the decent damage you'll put out with it and maybe a few dd procs on inc will turn a mob.  I use it mainly for the dps/stats(could use some AC though) and plan on augging it with the 510 strike of ykesha or anger 2, which will make it a pretty nice offhander I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up taking it out last night to tank the avatar of dust with my boc main hand.  People had trouble controling their aggro and my anger 3 augments sword of ssra wasn't cutting it.  I will admit with BoC mainhand and the agnarr sword offhand, i had 0 problems with aggro.  That might be a good reason to put anger 3 on it and mainhand that with the boc on the offhand.  What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am useing the Stormblade with Anger3 mainhand and GBoS offhand. I have few agro problems with it, and I think I would keep the auged Stormblade in mainhand even with a BoC. (Bloodfrenzy would go into mainhand though)<br />
<br />
I have been waiting for a BoW to drop another 1150 points, hope to go to 2H sometime in the near future. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Without an anger aug its not something I would consider using as an &quot;agro weapon&quot; but then people need to remember that when you are raiding with 7 warriors in your guild only one of those warriors will be tanking and the rest will be doing DPS, and this is a fantastic DPS weapon.<br />
<br />
I have always found that with hard hitting 2 handers I pull agro off the MT far to often, so for non taunt weapons I have found 1 handers with straight DD procs to be the best DPS / least agro.</div></div><hr />
