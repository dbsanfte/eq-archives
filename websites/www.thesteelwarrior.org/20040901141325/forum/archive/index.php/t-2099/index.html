<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Evyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was trying to do some research on the marsinger quests, and i was having some trouble about finding out which mobs i need to kill in plane of hate to get the 2 and 3 gem......for the second gem i am missing an &quot;Etched Soldier's Crest&quot; and for the third gem i am missing a &quot;Dissertation of Dark War&quot;, does anyone know where/what mobs drop these in plane of hate? so far i am just seeing those, and for the rewards these seems to be a very fast and easy quest...... we spent about 3 hours in PoH and got about 3 ppl past the first gem, and i am halfway through the second....<br />
<br />
all the information i found has come off of allakhazam (Marsinger Melee Quest 2 (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2449) ), if anyone could help me out it would be greatly appreciated.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The named wars drop the Dissertation od dark war the easiest to kill is grandmaster ratal the old war min. he is north of maestro hall and to the right if looking north from hall not the building with the big doors but right of that his PH is alwayys the monk zombi mob. the crest comes off the higher DE war mobs 60 to 64 ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Evyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmmm can anyone give me a little better description? was kinda confused by the previous post........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok let me make this real simple.<br />
<br />
1. Only named melee class mobs drop dissertation of dark war.<br />
<br />
2. the easiest named is Grandmaster ratal near maestro area if looking north on steps of maestros house he spawns in the building to the right of the building with the big double doors (the one to the right of the house that spawns the rogue book)<br />
<br />
2.a to explain it a little better if looking north from maestro house the building directly in front of you is the house that spawns rogue book to the right of that is a building with big double doors and to the right of that one is a small building behind that one (north) of it) is a fairly big building that has the ph for grandmaster ratal his PH is always a zombie monk in that house.<br />
Logged in at work real quick and got you the loc since we all know warriors are a bit slow :) His loc is pos 214.01 neg 538.49 4.75 the dissertation is a rare drop so will have to kill him a few times.<br />
<br />
3. only 60+ melee mobs notably warrior mobs they have warrior in the title will drop the etched soldiers crest. Assassins also drop it as well.<br />
<br />
I have a few of them on RN and can MQ one for you if you play on RN.<br />
<br />
and how the above post confused you I do not know *shrug*. if you want more info I doubt you will find much more so your best bet is to go up there and kill mobs till you find what you seek. Until I posted it most believed the dissertation of dark war dropped only off inny or mestro but I proved that to be wrong. oh the mob that drops the vile runed belt will also drop the dissertation of dark way.<br />
<br />
That is as much info that I will give out publicly :) Prolly more then I should but I like warriors so helping where I can :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok found this map it's actually really good some of thier named are a bit wrong IE they have some listed as tier 4 that are tier 3.<br />
