<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, did Rondo, High priest acknowledges this, talks about doing more things in the mountain passes.  <br />
<br />
Did Tipt, hailed mob at end, got text, zoned out.  Saw Scribe, HP, hailed, talked about issues, did both twice to be sure.  Still talking about needing stuff done in mountains.<br />
<br />
Did Vxed, had a truly craptacular time of it (including wiping within sight of the hailing npc because the druid couldn't remember to snare) and finally wound up doing a suicide run for the flag after we got the 15 minute warning.  Hailed him, got text, didnt do further dialogue, died.  Saw HP and Scribe afterward, same story, still talking about tasks in mountains.  Tried to zone to Kod`Taz, no joy.<br />
<br />
I am mightily hosed somewhere here, but can't figure out where.  My guild mates maintain that not completing the dialogue with the Vxed npc doesn't matter, all that was needed was to hail him.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any insight on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty sure you need to hail and say &quot;tend&quot; to the vxed spirit, to get the final flag for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">did you hail the NPC near the tipt / vxed zonein on the west wall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pahtoonya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definitely do need to say &quot;Tend&quot; to the final NPC in Vxed.  I didn't realize that and trained in and hailed/died... no flag.  Ended up redoing the whole dang show to finish, and this time hailed and said 'tend', and the flag sticks!<br />

Dunno, but i got Kod'Taz access and i did vxed/tipt before we killed the Weapon Master but got my backflags no problem afterwards.</div></div><hr />

You're thinking of a different trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yup, you forgot &quot;tend&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Malaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you had Rondo flag prior to doing Vxed you will indeed have to say &quot;tend&quot; to the npc, else you'll get the temporary flag immediately upon hailing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you had Rondo flag prior to doing Vxed you will indeed have to say &quot;tend&quot; to the npc, else you'll get the temporary flag immediately upon hailing. <br />
<br />
if this is true, then that is why i do not remember saying &quot;tend&quot; since i did these 2 trials before we killed Rondo. So my previous post stands :P</div></div><hr />

Read carefully :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">umm, i don't get your point. I did vxed and tipt BEFORE i killed rondo and that is why i NEVER had to say anything. I got a temporary flag, and just had to hail the scribe after i got rondo and my vxed/tipt flags became permanate and now i can zone into Kod'Taz no problem. <br />
<br />
So i don't get why you quoted me and the previous poster because what he said, confirms what i said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did Vxed again tonight, hailed and said &quot;tend,&quot; got yellow text after saying tend.  Went back to HP and scribe, when I said &quot;issues&quot; to scribe, he said something about seeing that I had completed task in Tipt.<br />
<br />
Then I went and zoned into Kod`Taz.  Yay me.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Do these 'temporary' flags mean you have to do all the flagging in one session ? Or are they just something you collect untill you do the final one and get a permanent flag, i.e is temporary actually a temporary flag (fades when you log) or more like a 'partial' flag ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You dont have to do all of the trials in one session (god that would be horrible, considering how long some take =p ); when you finish a trial and get a temporary flag, you have to go back to Barindu and hail the Scribe (near High Priest) and say &quot;issues&quot;, and it becomes a permanent flag. <br />
<br />
Think of temporary flags as something like checklist flags from PoP, you wont lose it, and you can do the trials out of order.<br />
<br />
You will need to complete the previous trials to get a permanent flag for whichever trial you complete though; for example, if you finish Trial 3, you wont get a permanent flag for it until you finish 1 and 2 also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hailed the NPC at the end of Vxed and got the character flag text. Said &quot;tend&quot; to him after that and nothing happened. Tried again, nothing.<br />
<br />
Hadn't done Tipt or Weaponmaster previously, though. Is that why I didn't need to say &quot;tend?&quot;  This thread's confusing me=p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Is there a way to start a 'loot' session in tipt instead of a flagging session ? Perhaps the tipt or vxed you completed wasn't a flagging run?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Basically the way I see it is as follows:<br />
<br />
1. If you have done Smith flag, you will need to say 'what tend' to the npc in Vxed to get your flag. Hailing Scribe will then get you the perma-flag.<br />
<br />
2. If you have not done Smith yet, Hail NPC will suffice, but you will not be able to convert it to a perma flag until you have completed Smith flag.<br />
<br />
3. If you did Vxed and Tipt, but do not have Smith, then you will have 2 temp-flags, and Hailing the Scribe and High Priest will do nothing, until you have done the Smith flag.<br />
<br />
In a way, Smith = Saryn, Vxed = MM, Tipt = RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>nosfentor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can tell you I'm flagged for Kod'taz - I did the following in this order. I completed trials 2 and 3 and of course only got a temp flag that the scribe basically ignored since I hadn't done trial one. Later I did Vxed, only hailing the final mob and clicking out. Then I did Tip't, again hailing and clicking out.  At this point, we did a Rondo raid and I hailed the end mob. There was no yellow text, just a generic message. I ran to the scribe in Barindu and said &quot;what issues&quot; twice - both times he converted a temp flag into a permanent flag. I then ran to Kod'taz and zoned in.<br />
<br />
I never ever said anything other than &quot;what issues&quot; to the scribe, and hailed all other mobs. I've zoned into Kod'taz a few times now.<br />
<br />
I have to say the temporary flag conversion to permanent flag bit is somewhat confusing. I wish anytime you received ANY flag they'd use yellow text to note such. Even better, if it wasn't roleplayish - a simple, &quot;You have received a character flag.&quot; would be great.</div></div><hr />
