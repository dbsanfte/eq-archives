<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious as per the recommended set up for one handers. <br />
<br />
For example.<br />
<br />
The proc rate of the offhand is as if you have 75 dex?<br />
The offhand is all about ratio? <br />
What determines the proper use of main vs offhand?<br />
-fastest delay in main hand...<br />
-most important proc in main hand...<br />
Also, whats the correct use of new melee anger discs?<br />
-ive heard not on inc, but to &quot;spike&quot; aggro mid fight<br />
-on inc to build inital aggro for slow<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks yet again folks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well sir here is a quick run of what I try to practice:<br />
<br />
-Best proc in mainhand (for me boc &gt; chsd), more swings more possible proc<br />
-(if no procs) Fastest in mainhand, per swing hate or per damage, the damage bonus in the mainhand helps take care of both arguements.<br />
-Personally I always bow on inc to intercept, and incite at the first round of melee, however running boc/chsd I have very nice hate potential, and rarely loose aggro on tash or slow.  With Teir 3 mobs incite does not run more endurance then I regen if used once per mob.<br />
-Offhand should check for proc the same as main, however it does not swing as often due to the DW check, so it will inherantly proc less.  (meaning linear with dex, but constant over time)<br />
-In my early days I went for ratio off and speed main.  so that when the offhand did work, it hit for its best umph possible; this was all overshadowed as procs &gt; dps-hate<br />
<br />
Hope this little bit helps, Till Victory er Death sir.<br />
