<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Was just comparing our offensive AA's to those of monks and rogues recently when choosing what to to train in next. Seeing as Tactical Mastery (and SE, kind of) specifically is geared towards damaging from the front and we also get flurry over monks, isn t it likely that a warrior with maxxed offensive AA's does more DPS than a monk when fighting from the front? <br />
<br />
Why is it exactly that most think monks do more damage than warriors in similar gear? Is it the weapons they have available to them, an inherent attack bonus or the fact we are allways fighting from the front when tanking? Maybe it is a combination of these things.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done any parses recently comparing monks and wars, both with maxxed offensive AA's? <br />
<br />
Would just like to hear some views and experiences, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Anyone outdmgs a rogue from the front. A warrior and monk both with maxed aa and same weapon, warrior can and will outdmg from both front and back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks have a different damage table than warriors.  Even with TM3 and Flurry etc, I don't think you'll be able to consistantly outdamage a monk from the front.  <br />
<br />
2h: Specially considering you might have a 60/38 (1.58), 45/30 (1.5), 35/23 (1.52), or 48/32 (1.5) weapon.  But the Monk will be using something like 42/28 (1.5), 54/30 (1.8), 35/20 (1.75), 60/38 (1.58), etc.<br />
<br />
1h: You might have a 20/20 (1), 29/30 (.97), 38/35 (1.09).  The monk will have a 26/24 (1.08), 23/20 (1.15), 20/19 (1.05), etc.<br />
<br />
So you'd need both a DBotW and EoE (or a Hammer of Timeweavers) to come close to a monk w/ a Shinai and Hammer of Timeweavers.<br />
<br />
And the 2h story is even worse, as we share the VDD w/ Pal/SK (and I can't imagine, but some guild might give one to even a monk).  Still the VDD is far behind the Firey Staff of Zha and Staff of Transcendence.<br />
<br />
That's not including the fact that the monk DD procs are generally higher than warriors (by 50+ damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it's mainly due to monks being on a different damage table.  Frankly, after getting a BoW (48/32) I'm kindof surprised that warriors can approach monk dps so closely.  I still have a few offensive AA's to go too (fury of ages, double riposte).<br />
<br />
By the way, I don't think that Zha staff is all that great. . .do super-high attack values really totally negate the lack of decent damage bonus?  Seems like VDD would kick it's ass *grin*.</div></div><hr />

 had two rot last night =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it makes a big difference. Zha's is really useful at that level of the game, with those levels of ATK.<br />
<br />
But for monks not at that level of the game, Caen's or Rune Etched Bamboo Bo still have a slight edge over the Zha.<br />
<br />
In any event, monks get Return Kick and Double Riposte so IF monks could stand in front of mobs again (which in LDoN they can), AND those monks bother to train those AAs (a really big if, since most monks rate them VERY low on the list), then their DPS from the front gets AA boosts too. Just not flurry and Tactical Mastery. But the damage table difference is still there.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and while monks don't have flurry, they DO get an AA that offers extra attacks. At level 5 of Wu's EVERY flying kick fires off a second attack 100 percent of the time.</div></div><hr />
