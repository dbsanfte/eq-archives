<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, just made up stuff.  If you want a good estimation of what the warrior 1.5 epic will be like it will be about 200hps, 3% shielding, and type 4/8 slots would be my guess just from looking at the sk 1.5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides, isnt our 2HS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Besides, isnt our 2HS?<br />
<br />
Think it will be 1h most likely or a combo maybe?  No clue really but that would follow the trend with OoW(dual wield&gt;2h)<br />
<br />
Edit- Meant to say comparing to the monk epic not sk since there's is a 2hander, the warrior epic if it's a 1hander should probably have 220hp on it for the 1.5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not even close to what 2.0 will be. For instance it will have the upgraded vie + spell block as a clicky (same as our 1.5 will have them, yay 10 min reuse). As well it will have the focus for the incite line cooldown, again going by other epics.<br />
<br />
Monk epic and sk are both melee, both have a clicky effect an ability focus (lifetap vs inner flame)<br />
<br />
As to hazard a guess at the war epic 1.5's stats, something along the line of <br />
<br />
Sword of Uberness 1.5<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY<br />
Skill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 24<br />
DMG: 25 Dmg Bonus: 13 AC: 35<br />
STR: +25 DEX: +25 STA: +30 AGI: +25 HP: +230 END: +210<br />
SV FIRE: +20 SV COLD: +20 SV MAGIC: +30 SV POISON: +15<br />
Shielding: +3% <br />
Required level of 65.<br />
Effect: Krekk's Presence (Must Equip, Casting Time: 0.8)<br />
Recast Delay: 600 seconds, Recast Type: 6<br />
Focus: Vengeful Scorn <br />
WT: 2.5 Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: WAR<br />
Race: BAR HUM ELF HEF HLF DEF DWF TRL OGR GNM IKS VAH<br />
Slot 1, Type 4<br />
Slot 2, Type 8<br />
<br />
Again, just my guess</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really can't imagine epics to be better than the endgame OoW items, since I recall devs saying we're not supposed to be chained to our epic forever which is why they've those clickies (so you can swap them).  Now I have no idea what endgame OoW items are by assuming they're better than Tacvi and we're not going to get ridiculous inflation (i.e. 400 hp items), I'm going to guess 45/30, 70 AC, low 300s HP, 120 resist total, 5% shielding (+stats are irrelevant to anyone who can obtain it), and the expected clicky/focus.</div></div><hr />
