<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone else think the CBQ has been retuned up again recently?  We've been killing her for the past three months or so.  In the past 6 weeks, we've been farming the hell our of Qvic.  This has made us a lot tougher in general and in particular against tough AE fights - we waltzed through Ikkinz 4 the other day, a raid that used to give us fits.<br />
<br />
So why has the CBQ gone from being doable with 45 to 50, to being a squeaker with 65?  We had two failed attempts recently, which I chalked up to things like bad starts and sloppy tank transitions.  But last night we finished Time early, and had a lot of folks online.  We basically took the raid that we had just spanked Quarm with (and easily, I might add), and barely, just barely killed old Crag-puffs.  I can't speak to what all was going on - I was the MT and died around 80% - but I do know that she punted several folks out into the ocean, something I don't recall happening previously.  But in addition, it just seemed like she was a LOT tougher to kill than she used to be.<br />

<br />
she's always punted, i know that for sure.  we'd had a few runs where we had 40-45 people and had virtually no problems killing her, but the two times we killed her with 60+, she was quite a pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />

He's your problem. We still do her regularly with 40ish people with absolutely no problem at all.<br />

Ooc : hey aono, what's up, havent see you online lately ! &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zuko</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tested CBQ again for 2nd time. Sorry, but he's undoable with 40ish or 50ish for that matter. Best we got em down to is 90%. He's mostly blocking all spells and procs from the get go. They need to ban steroids in EQ for mobs :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it with like 40ish today, no real problems with her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">regjen</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive noticed she seems to be much harder on Dro. Not sure if its us not moving her right or just a stealth upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throag</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did her again with around 33 full members and like 5 applicants (with shitty gear) she is still really easy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zuko</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More than likely some server got a ninja upgrade .. so Karana got spared hehe. It may be easy on some servers but I'm pretty sure that on most of the ones that drop down constantly, might have gotten jacked somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minet</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">could be there are a couple incantations of this mob<br />
<br />
unless theres that mutch disparity between 40 of one guild and 60 of anouther</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keldo</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Piercing dps has quite an effect on this fight.  40 people with 6 rogues and people with piercing weapons would have no problem, but 65 with 2 rogues and people not unbanking them would, I believe that may be the issue here.<br />
<br />
I could see the regen rate changing depending on how many people are there, but I have not noticed max hit, ramage damage, or area effects change based on # engaging.  Engaged with low 40s up to 60s, seems to be the same every time.</div></div><hr />
