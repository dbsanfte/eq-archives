Does anybody know which area the Triloun Seer (drops Plankon Laced Greatsword of course:)) spawns on this map? I numbered possible locations where he'd logically spawn :cool:.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'd like to try and aquire one with a group (65 warrior, cleric, enchanter, druid, and probably 2 other 65s). How difficult is he to kill? Any information would be very appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've only gotten a few of these swords, and I personally have only seen one drop, but when it did it came from the #5 area you have marked on the map. We got the Seer on the way to Groihin the Wise. I dont think he has a set spawn point and can pop up in a few different spots.<br />
<br />
Hes about as difficult as any single group mini named in the ele's, the group you describe shouldnt have alot of difficulty with him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use this map (http://onlinecenter.nu/?622330300)<br />
<br />
 Here's a post stolen from the SK board.<br />
<br />
First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who posted information in this thread, it helped me a great deal.<br />
<br />
I figured I would write down the information I have gathered from fighting in Plane of Water for the past few weeks in search of a Opalescent Two-Handed Sword, along with some information posted in this thread. This will hopefully save you guys some time searching for the right camps/mobs, as this thread did me.<br />
<br />
All named can see through invis, as do Triloun Champions and the small frogs who sometime spawn when you trigger a trap.<br />
<br />
The numbers below correspond to the numbers I added to the map I found on eqatlas.com. Let me know if the spawn locations are incorrect, and I'll change it.<br />
<br />
Click the underlined links to see the stats.<br />
<br />
1) Zone in/out.<br />
<br />
2) Monstrous Sea Turtle. Only killed this named once, and he dropped a Coral Shard. From what is said in this thread, his second drop seem to be the bard swarm-pet weapon called Coral Hilted Shortsword. The place holder is usually a sea turtle, but sometimes spawns as a greater sea turtle, which is the only greater sea turtle that can spawn in the room. Hits for around 1000+, didn't flurry the time we killed him, but like most of the named we've killed it seems random. All about luck I guess.<br />
<br />
3) Razorfin. Killed this named a handfull of times. Heard of several people who got their opalescent sword from this mob, but all we ever got was a couple of Coral Headed Maces and Shields of Coral. The place holder is usually a large piranha, but sometimes spawns as a greater piranha, which is the only greater piranha that can spawn in the room. Hits for around 1000+ and often flurries.<br />
<br />
4) Hammertooth. Never seen this named shark up, but supposedly has the same loot table as Gigadon, which is the Sharkspine Club, and the Opalescent Two-Handed Sword. The place holder is usually a reef hammerhead, but can also spawn as any other shark. Probably about as hard as Gigadon.<br />
<br />
5) Gigadon. The mob that finally dropped the sword for me. The place holder is usually a reef shark, but can spawn as any other shark. Assumably shares loot table with Hammertooth. Hits for around 1250.<br />
<br />
6) Triloun Seer. Killed twice, dropped a Plankton Laced Greatsword once, and a Perlescent Gemstone once. The placeholder seem to be the only Triloun Diviner that can spawn in the room. My guess is that the Seer share loot table with the Triloun Egg Keeper. Shaman type mob, hits for 1000+ and will cast the usual shaman spells (pet, malo, slow etc).<br />
<br />
7) Triloun Egg Keeper. Killed twice, dropped the Plankton Laced Greatsword on both occasions. No idea about place holder. Hit me for 850 max when I pulled him, but I wasn't tanking so expect him to hit for around 1000 like the other named. He probably has the same loot table as the Triloun Seer (should be able to drop the perlescent gemstone).<br />
<br />
8) Swordfang. Never seen this named myself, only heard this is where it spawns, and people claim to have gotten the opalescent sword from him, as well as the sharkspine club. It's a named swordfish, and the placeholder is a greater swordfish. Normal swordfishes are rogues, and will backstab, so expect him to do the same. Expect him to hit for 1000+. Someone mentioned earlier in this thread that this room also holds a named barracuda, which apparently share loot table with the Monstrous Sea Turtle.<br />
<br />
<br />
I cut off the map where it leads towards the inner parts, as I have only been in there looking around with a rogue, or in a raid situation. Several named spawn in here (Savage/Furious Deepwater Kraken, Frenzied/Toughened Anglerfish, Hraquis Chieftain/Arch Mage and Regrua Overlord/Protector). None of these mobs can drop anything that's interesting for a shadowknight, except for the Regrua Overlord, that sometimes drop the Coral Hilted Tulwar, but except to anger enchanters, this weapon is of little or no interest (350 point cold pbae with 200 range).<br />
<br />
I realise this list/map probably has a few errors, and more will show with time, but I hope it will help anyway.</div></div><hr />
