<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been looking to upgrade some of my gear recently and I've been considering these four items:<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace, Earring of Solstice, Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide, and a Helm of Raldukan.  I did some math and calculated how much my stats would change with each replacement (in the order listed above):<br />
<br />
1. AC: +8 Str: +6 Sta: +6 HP: -35<br />
2. AC: +3 Sta: +5 Wis: +8 Int: +8 Magic Resist: +5 Fire Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5 HP: +20 <br />
3. AC: +3 Agi: +5 Dex: +5 Disease Resist: +10 HP: +25<br />
4. AC: +9 Str: +2 Sta: +4 Cold Resist: +4 Disease Resist: +7 HP: +35<br />
<br />
I have about 10k to spend but I can always sell the items I'm currently using in those slots, (magelo on sig), and make a little more cash, so which of these upgrades should I focus on getting first?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a lot better helms out there to be had. Don't bother with the helm of Raldukan, I have found that HP wise the Champions Crown is better. <br />
<br />
The putrid belt is nice, go for that if you can afford it from the sale of your current earing, and after buying the solstice earing parts.<br />
<br />
The clattering bone necklace... I dunno about that, I can't see your magelo right now (Damn firewall at work) and I have never used one. (right now I use a ribon choker for HP, Necklace of Cured Cacti for resists)<br />

It usually sells for about 2-3k on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, your sta is over 100 so any additional sta just adds hps.  Now, how do you value stats?  Personally I am only worried about AC and HP's (sta = hps).<br />
<br />
I would figure out how much you value the stats that are affected and see how much you get for your money.  To do this I would assign a value to each stat affected in terms of hps.<br />
<br />
Say you come to the following numbers (yours may differ)<br />
<br />
1AC = 10hps<br />
1HP = 1hp<br />
1STA = 4.5hps<br />
<br />
After deciding on these relative values, determine the value of the options in terms of hps.  Then divide by the cost of the item (after selling your current)<br />
<br />
For example, the helm in this case would be<br />
<br />
9*10+35*1+4*4.5 = 143hp<br />
<br />
and say it cost 5000pp more than your current helm sells for.<br />
<br />
143/5000 = 28.6hps/1000pp (easier to do per 1000pp imo)<br />
<br />
Now you can see which 1000pp gets you the most of what you value.<br />
<br />
If you value str or other stats you can come up with how many hps each point of a stat is worth to you.  There are no right or wrong values, just how you value each.</div></div><hr />

Plus there is AC and str on it as well.<br />
<br />
As for the solstice earring...yeah, do it :)<br />
<br />
The belt is a good one, I purchased mine for 3k....and never regretted it.<br />
<br />
I also use the helm - until some no-drop stuff comes my way, it is about the best buyable (non-MQ) helm I have seen. <br />
<br />
So, I would go - <br />
Neck<br />
Ears<br />
Helm<br />
Belt</div></div><hr />
