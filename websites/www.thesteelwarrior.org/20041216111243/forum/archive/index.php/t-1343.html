<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a couple of things that I'd like to see implemented in-game which shouldn't be too hard, and there's no reason for them not to be implemented:<br />
<br />
1. A buff ignore list:<br />
<br />
I want nothing to do with certain buffs, and don't want them MGB'd on me screwing my life up, and generally irritating me.   I'd like an ignore list for certain buffs that I never want on.<br />
<br />
1A.   This should also hold true for MGB cursor items such as modrods, food and water.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Saved Equipment Setup:<br />
<br />
If casters have saved favorite spell lineup, I see nothing wrong with a saved favorite gear lineup for reasonably timed switching of weapons/armor setups.<br />
<br />
3. Consent list <br />
<br />
I have a hotkey to consent people to drag my corpse every time I die. It's always the same people, I don't see why I can't just have a consent list of people who are perma-consented.  There's no roleplay justification for making me consent someone post-death as opposed to in advance.<br />
<br />
Thank you for listening, have a nice day</div></div><hr />

<br />
on point #2 .. yeah...again, poor example here but with Diablo2:LoD you have 2 banks set up with your weapons; a simple keystroke (W) and BOOM, you got your big 2Her.. hit (W) again and you're back in business with your dual wielders..would help a lot too with how warriors are the true kings of ghetto swapping.<br />
<br />
on point #3 though frodlin; i had a page set up in the back of my hotkeys with 10 of my guild's corpse draggers ..  thought i was pretty l33t about that ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 , 2 ....more?<br />
<br />
The equipment list seems a lil much, but a quick swap weapons list would be nice, especially for those WAR only FB IV shields...<br />
<br />
as to consent, the way i understand consent is that there is a toggle on each individual corpse for consent. It is independant of weather the character is only or even exists. for example... you can consent joes_chmukatelli , log off your character, create a character named joe_schmukatelli  and go drag your own corpse.</div></div><hr />

LOL, I actually like KEI, i make sure i say out loud may i get crap buffs... kei preferred... <br />
<br />
MOD-RODS however need to be flagged as unusable by pure melee...</div></div><hr />

<br />
OR we could have a command to move the buff slots, so you can put KEI in first position and Virtue in 15th  when you need a fake :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe would also be nice for those instaclicks that get overwritten by other buffs...<br />
<br />
dont know how many times i have set up instaclicks only to have pal/rng etc cast spells and then find virtue in first buff slot....<br />
<br />
ARRRGGGG!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I to have a hot box of Guild FDers Rogues etc and as soon as I die I click it ,but more often than not I die in the first half of a long fight and end up having to consent some cleric or whatever not on my list anyhow..</div></div><hr />

&quot;Seaeaeiaeadornaeaeiaen tells you 'consent'&quot;</div></div><hr />

Maybe you shouldn't suck so much! :D :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
And /consent group, /consent raid, /consent guild would be wonderful!<br />
<br />
As for things like kei, I try to get them in my first buff slot for mobs that dispell so I can keep the good stuff around.</div></div><hr />

Ahahahaha.  I always used to say that we shouldn't let a monk into the guild if they had more than 3 vowels in their name for just this reason.  I hate it when people string 32 vowels in a row together and call it a name or repeat a letter 3 times to get it through the name filter.  Not only is Llelggolless hard to remember how to spell, it looks retarded too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so it of course looks like:<br />

lastixenoflorim<br />
<br />
It sucks because I hate &quot;i&quot; as the first letter, the spelling sucks and on top of all that it is long!</div></div><hr />

/agree brutul lleggogllalas :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about when you're dual-wielding two weapons and switch to a 2hander, you only need to put the 2hander into the Primary slot and it'll put the 2 1handers both onto your cursor, instead of forcing warriors (and other dualwielders) to remove the secondary first then switch the primary with the 2hander?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a decent idea Kae... but I think a diablo 2 sort of thing would rock. *W* hey I'm weilding Greatstaff of assbeating now! *W* Hey look  BoC and Primal, yay!<br />
<br />
Just makes things easier heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about this idea?<br />
<br />
Disciplines especially and other abilities such as AE taunt and shield which can be selected and activeable from the 'spell gems' window via Alt+ 1 etc....</div></div><hr />

Definately should be a rule that any character with more then 2 repeated letters or 5 vowels in their name be unable to use the word Consent in any chat forum including tells!</div></div><hr />

Ala' DAoC, tho it was a while ago and I'm not sure if range / 2h shared same slot but..<br />
<br />
Give us ability to hot-swap between the primary / secondary slots and 2h reserved slot. Of course make it so the stats don't take effect on all 3 at once, just whichever &quot;set&quot; is in use. They've already shown that coding in another inventory slot can be done, I'd glady mod my ui to have a fulltime 2h slot avaliable instead of having to bag &amp; swap junk in. It worked quite well.</div></div><hr />
