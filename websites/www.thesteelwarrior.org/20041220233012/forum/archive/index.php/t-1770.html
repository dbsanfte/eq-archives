<br />
 Picture if you will a time capable guild raiding in PoT when they come across a nice drop :<br />
<br />
Armguards of the Brute<br />
59ac  20str 15dex 25sta 10cha 20wis 20int 180hps 165mana svD35 svM35  spellsheild<br />
usable by WAR PAL SHD BRD CLR<br />
<br />
Looks like a good upgrade for anyone right? Lets break it down.One Asterix show if it helps a bit 2 if it helps alot.<br />
<br />
STAT               WAR     PAL/SK<br />
59ac                 *            *<br />
20str                *            *<br />
15dex               *            *<br />
25sta                *            **<br />
10cha               -             -<br />
20wis/int           -            *<br />
180hps              *           *<br />
165 mana          -            *<br />
svD35                *           *<br />
svM35                *           **<br />
<br />
So as far as pure melee , the hybrids get every bit the upgrade warriors do , not some 75/25 split as hybrids were designed. Then the hybrids also seriously upgrade their caster side also . I placed 2 asterix's on STA and svM because these are where warriors are naturally high and for many warriors it will be a case of not needed it as much as the hybrid does (ie as a warrior i easily cap sta at 305 so it means nothing , and my MR is by far my best resist stat already and with bard was already capping 500)<br />
<br />
 So in my opinion the addition of each of these items to a hybrid further increases the discrepency's between warriors and pal/sk's . And well im on a rant , what the heck is with barbarian leggings at 60ac and 100hps , warriors need to get to plane of time to beat that.<br />
<br />
Just my 2c (please excuse my spelling)<br />

Making the best gear in the game the same for all plate classes just screws balance even more than it already is.  It's freaking ridiculous.  I thought they had figured this out with the class armor in the elemental planes but now they're screwing it up in time just like NToV and Vex Thall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
guess what....<br />
<br />
NOBODY WANTED THEM<br />
<br />
thats right... they went to an invite.<br />
(a cleric)<br />
<br />
why?<br />
<br />
No vengeance, and no caster focus.<br />
(clerics get the focus elsewhere)<br />
They quite frankly will rot next time they drop for us...  they quite frankly are terrible for where they drop.<br />
<br />
they were +6ac and +30HP/Mana...  that does not even TOUCH Extended/Burning Affliction and Vengeance V.<br />
<br />
You might take a look at elemental plate arms for the knights.<br />
Perhaps you will understand then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet another example of warriors who simply do not understand hybrid equipment choices.<br />

Itemization has systematically favored hybrids since ntov. Whether or not hybrids choose to take advantage of the difference offered by this piece, that difference exists, and in fact is illustrated by this piece.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry turg, the hybrids would disagree with you.<br />
<br />
Favored since NTOV?<br />
Not a single warrior has been able to prove that...<br />
<br />
Except by counting SK-only weapons for Paladins, and Pal-only weapons for SK.<br />
<br />
this particular item is NOT better than what the SK/Pal are already using...  and you might notice even the WARRIORS did not want that item as their current arms were better...<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'd trust a Time-enabled WAR or Knight over the typical &quot;I am currently raiding in NTOV at level 65&quot; mini-warriors who tend to post these comments about a level of the game they have no experience with.<br />
<br />
Tell me Turg.. do YOU think 35hp/mana and stats (that are worthless at this point of the game) are more important than Vengeance V and a spell focus?  Even our warriors laughed at that piece of loot and how it needs a serious upgrade... at LEAST vengeance of some kind or another...<br />
<br />
take advantage of a downgrade?  oh come on...  the hybrid who spends DKP on that when they have elemental armor in that slot has GOT to be smoking something.<br />
<br />
ATK is that which the knight is very weak at...  just a little clue Turg... for a hybrid, <br />
Vengeance V and spell focusIV &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4ac and 35hp/mana<br />
<br />
grats you on getting better at high-end equipment choices! (4)<br />

Sometimes you wonder if paladins blind themselves or what...<br />
<br />
This wasnt a discussion about that item particulary, it was an example.<br />
<br />
99% of the loot Warriors can use is also usable by knights.<br />
<br />
All these items only improve warrior's HP as much as it would improve a knight's <br />
BUT<br />
knights also get mana out of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can you find it balancing, that out of every upgrade, knights get the same as warrior AND EVEN MORE!</div></div><hr />

The point was that, like itemisation in general since NTOV, this is a piece usable by both hybrids and warriors that improves the hybrids more. I couldn't care less if it's a downgrade or what. It's an *example*. You might have played since beta and you may be in Time -- but you're still retarded.<br />
<br />
And if you're going to stupidly flame me, at least get my name right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point is that the highest AC/hp item for a given slot for a warrior is also wearable by a Paladin/SK.  Therefore warrior's tanking advantage becomes non-existent when defensive is not up.  Whether you would rather have 30ish atk (assuming you aren't over the worn atk cap without them) than 5 ac, 35 hps, 25 mana and +25 spellshield is not the point.  The point is that warriors have no significant tanking advantage over knights anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrikBludgaard</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No significant advantage eh?<br />
<br />
700-1000Hp not enough?<br />
<br />
100ac is not enough?<br />
<br />
EQ is a RELATIONAL game.<br />
Hybrids also do not gain as much as you might think from those stats... there is a loss due to not being able to do both things at once.  Which I would actually know about because i play both a Knight AND a warrior...<br />
<br />
and as i mentioned before landrain, +1mana =/= +1HP.<br />
I would take 120Hp over 50hp 100mana any day of the week... so would most hybrids.<br />
<br />
I repeat... most of the warriors here have absolutely NO clue about this level of the game... they have no experience...<br />
<br />
Remember, at this level of the game, warriors have no problem keeping aggro...  warriors have 700-1000Hp more than the knights..  warriors are the best at the only thing that this level of character does.  Warriors in my guild are quite powerful... and dish something fierce to boot.  Not to say hybrids aren't powerful... but both classes SHOULD be....  and they are.   <br />
<br />
Warriors close the gap and get proc stuns, major aggro boosts, and procs that deal more damage than RNG/SK nukes...  God forbid hybrids get some durability.<br />
<br />
Stop applying lowbie issues to the high end game where they do not exist or are reduced to such a level where they don't matter.<br />
<br />
You are applying all your &quot;I can't&quot; problems to people who are eligible for that loot.  You are applying YOUR problems to those characters with only Magelo as your guide.  you are missing a VERY large part of the story.<br />
<br />
God forbid I attempt to raise you from your ignorance... God forbid you don't just get a big circle-jerk like you are used to.  God forbid you actually might have to use logic and carefully argued points instead of baseless and childish namecalling.<br />

Maybe you feel that stupid condescension and trumpet blowing about your EQ l33tness pass for argumentation, but most people don't. Whenever I encounter a jackass like Brick who thinks that his magelo profile doubles as a critical thinking ability, I reflect back on the fact that it was Joimster, a 49 paladin in crap gear, who broke open the code for EQ melee and laid the base for what we know about &quot;ubermob&quot; tanking. Hell, I specifically remember that at the time he posted his request for logs, a few wannabes like Brick wrote patronizing messages about how what he was trying to do wouldn't work. It's a good thing he recognized their posturing for the crap that it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
700-1000Hp not enough?<br />
<br />
100ac is not enough?<br />
 <br />
<br />
No, that is obviously not enough.<br />
Because we need /Disc defensive to stay a utility in EverQuest.<br />
<br />
Without such a disc, those hp and acs more would be close to worthless.<br />
<br />
1000hp more, with mobs that hit at 500 easily now days?<br />
<br />
great, we traded a complete spell book,<br />
to be able to take 1 or 2 swings more off a mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100ac is not enough?<br />
<br />
<br />
actually...  NO<br />
700 hps is what, one swing in BoT.<br />
1000 hps is less than one swing from any boss mob,<br />
or less than half of most of the DD's that boss mobs have.<br />
<br />
100 AC is about a few percent mitigation... so intead of getting hit for 1000, i get hit for 980? but my max being hit is still the same as yours.<br />

So explain to me this great loss you are speaking of...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and as i mentioned before landrain, +1mana =/= +1HP.<br />
I would take 120Hp over 50hp 100mana any day of the week... so would most hybrids.<br />
<br />
<br />
But you dont have to make that choice... <br />
You can get 175 hp &amp; 175 mana...<br />
<br />
and actually.. if you want to get picky 1 mana == 2 hps, just ask a shaman who casts Canabalize...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
LOL... WoW someones uber-l33tness has gone to his head.<br />
<br />
So you never leave that plane of time? <br />
never do anything else except raid that one zone 24/7?<br />
lol...<br />
<br />
The example was made here that ESPECIALLY at the high end, the 'WARRIOR' advantage is a myth and is insignificant. If every piece of time gear is all plate classes usable, then the only difference in a war/sk/pal is the difference in our UNBUFFED?NAKED characters... but of course you are so uber, you probably dont ever die anymore so, you wouldnt know what that was...<br />
<br />
I believe I sit around 3090 or so hps, with level 65 and all HP AA's... <br />
A pal/ Sk is what 2000 or so? so a 1000hp advantage.. or here a 150% advantage...<br />
<br />
of course some of those are from sta, which when maxxed, will reduce the gap in hps. Since all buffs are identical for war/pal and all the equipment is identical, and a buffed warrior will be ~ 10k + and Knights a 9k+...<br />
that means that our hp advantage in PERCENTAGES is dramatically reduced full buffed... from 150% to 110% <br />
<br />
So not only do you get all your spells, all your mana, all your CASTER focus items, you also GAIN 40% in regards to hps....<br />
<br />
Now I dont really expect a reponse to this, because I am ignorant and uninformed, and know NOTHING of your uber-l33t skillz, and so should not complain about what i couldnt possibly comprehend...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selaradrid</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is something I posted on PoN in responce to a totally whacky idea a pally had that knights need to be the &quot;ultimate&quot; warriors because of the blessings from their gods, and that IF they group with a person that is opposite to them. ie: paladin groups with a dark elf.  that they &quot;lose&quot; their gods blessing for the duration of that group and will be lowered to a warrior until that group breaks up.<br />
<br />
anyway, this is my thought on why the balance is gone from the knights and warriors...<br />
 <br />
I dont think balancing the warrior and the knights is really what needs to be done. in Fact it is my belief that balancing these 3 classes is what has generated the problems in the first place.<br />
<br />
If you actually read the class descriptions in your handy dandy booklets or pop over to the SOE website you will see that paladins and shadowknights are listed as fighters with spells to A)help benefit the group with buffs or heals, or B) damage the mobs directly or inderectly. while the warrior is listed as being &quot;the point man&quot;<br />
<br />
I intepret this to mean, warriors were supposed to be the only tanks. while the knights were supposed to be fighters with spell utilities to help the group. with &quot;class balancing&quot; in the past we have seen the 2 knight classes narrow the gap in AC and Hp's that warriros had over them, therby making them effective tanks. it seems (IMO) that by doing it this way, they have relegated the warrior class to nothing more than &quot;the raid tank&quot; because we have defensive. <br />
<br />
Had SOE stayed the course with their original class descriptions and simply increase the DPS of the knights at that time to make them more desirable in groups as dmg dealers, you would see that class balancing was not needed. knights bring their utilities and DPS. warriors to tankand cleric to heal and so on. in fact groups with a warrior, paladin shadowknight cleric shaman and oh lets say a mage, would be a very good group in that sense. this however did not happen. instead knights were given boosts that while not matching, still made them viable tank options and we now have to compete with each other to find that single group spot for a tank. <br />
<br />
when we find groups we get the essential classes. healer, slower, tank. and take any other 3 classes sitting around that can do dmg. doesnt matter who they are. perhaps if they simply up the DPS on all 3 of our classes people will take more tanks in the group as dmg dealers and not just say 1 tank, lets wait for a rogue or soemthing.<br />
<br />
now by no means am i saying nerf the knights so the cant tank just give them more DPS. it is far too late for that, and the way we as players have chosen to play have made the knights into tanking classes. nerfing them now would be drastically unfair to the knigth classes. but if this is how the classes were designed to be in the first place.. it shows how and why the classes now seem unbalanced and broken. if they had simply increased DPS to knights as I beleive they should have when balancing became an issue, instead of reforming 2 classes so that we now have 3 classes to do the job of 1, we would not now be in this situation<br />
<br />
anyway thats just my thought on class balancing. as to what can be done to fix it. I have no idea.</div></div><hr />

If you look, he only has 2 items that are not paladin/shadowknight useable.  The Raex's Breastplate and the edge of eternity.  Both can be replaced with hybrid items that are within a few hitpoints.  That is not good itemization.</div></div><hr />

Do you really want one class loot in POT, did we not learn anything from zones that would drop single class only gear. How often did loot rot in the old days, because every war, or cleric already had that piece of equipment.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes they DID learn about the class only gear... It is called the velious/Tranquility armor quests...<br />
<br />
Problem is they still have no idea about itemization.<br />
<br />
Why add hp/mana to compare? <br />
<br />
BECAUSE there should be a BALANCE...<br />
<br />
if you are a hybrid, you should have to make CHOICES. You decide you want uber mana pool so you can cast all the time, or you decide you want uber hps so you can go toe-to-toe and only cast in sporadic times... <br />
<br />
Why is this idea so hard for people to grasp?<br />
<br />
No, they want to be able to tank, and still chain cast spells, well when you do that there is NO drawback to playing a hybrid. The same thing happened in D&amp;D RPG's when you take away all of the disadvantages of a hybrid class, they become over-powering. Where before the hybrids should be a rarer class, used to suplement and enhance a group's abilities, they have instead become the norm. When you give knights all the gear of warriors and all the gear of casters at the same time, then all the supposed disadvantages of the hybrid class are eliminated. <br />
<br />
Hell, all they need to do now is give paladins a Complete heal spell...<br />
<br />
(dont laugh, I am sure a lot of paladins ask for it...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That PALADIN is a knight... who was given credit for the work of many others.  A credit he would not take all for himself I think.  Your response seems to indicate that only saw the END RESULT of that very ancient discussion.  His work was instrumental, no doubt, but it HAD to be aided by those who actually experienced it.  You see, he actually listened to people who had actually been there.  Taking observations on something, then proposing an idea for how it works and testing it with real life is how we learn...  I just told you your theory doesn't hold water and why.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me repeat...  if you are not in TIME, then you don't really understand the equipment choices at that level.  If you are in near full elemental with an elemental weapon, (Warriors would get BoW period basically) but not quite in time yet (fighting Coirnav and Rathe for flags/shields) then you likely have an idea, but not the whole story...  You simply cannot understand everything about that level of the game by making up false Magelo profiles...  <br />
<br />
are you really trying to argue that my EXPERIENCE with time equipment and 4+ years of Knight/Warrior/lots of other classes is a lesser education than your lack of experience in time and your fiddling with magelo profiles?  Excuse me if I spare myself some laughter at your expense...<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors in my guild (30% attendence or greater) compared with knights in my guild (30% attendance or greater) have 700-1000 more HP than the knights.  The overall attendance % almost evens out.  This is assuming everyone has updated their Magelos of course...  note, we have been raiding elemental armor long enough so even newer members are wearing near complete elemental armor suits and some time gear.  You can't just take the best equipped knight you can make in magelo and the best warrior and call that a fair comparison...  loot does not drop as you want it to...  some of the loot is rare where some of them are common... and on top of it, due to their necessity in raids, warriors get preference on some items.  This is even with a DKP system in place...  You see, some of us are interested in what the GUILD can do, and not about being number one on a silly rankings site.<br />
<br />
My above comparison is the equivalent of parsing it...  its the REAL scoop for one group of people...  if you have better data than plugging rare drops in a magelo profile, I will listen...  until then, you have nothing to compare to my results.<br />
<br />
<br />
RELATIONAL<br />
The only way to explain this is the following:<br />
In plane of Time, if you dont have 10k+ HP AND defensive you can get one-rounded with a bad bunch of rolls.  Warriors are the ONLY main tanks in time period.  More Hp you have, the less likely you get insta-killed...  ALIVE for the next CH &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dead before anyone can do anything.  Every single HP/AC you can squeeze out means you have just that much more chance of actually looting the stuff we are talking about.  10% more HP and 5% more AC means EVERYTHING when being insta-killed is on the line.  Since the combat system is about comparing the mobs ATk and your AC and your ATK and the mobs AC, 100ac/atk could mean MUCH more favorable rolls either way...  even taking 1% less damage overall could mean you live to see the next round.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Landrain...  here are some examples of why hybrids spells and melee sometimes trip over each other.<br />
<br />
Hybrids pay more for every spell... 20% more mana for every single spell. +175 mana is more like +145mana.<br />
<br />
Now, imagine you start casting a spell...  you are no longer swinging your weapon until you finish that spell. (you will swing right after you finish)  This is now compounded due to the fact faster weapons = better, and the best weapons are now 20ish delay...  I want to see you cast a 2sec spell in between 100% hasted 20ish delay weapon swings without losing melee DPS.<br />
<br />
Casting is MUCH harder when you are getting whacked for 2-3k per mob swing... Warrior disciplines dont seem to have this problem.<br />
<br />
Due to being a hybrid, we fizzle more often than casters (you lose more mana)<br />
<br />
Due to being a hybrid we dont usually reach FT15 like all the other casters... you see reaching for the worn ATK cap is very useful for knights...  being that our weaponskill caps hurts our melee damage production...  do you collect melee items? (vengeance/+accuracy/shielding/etc) or caster effects? (FT/focus/etc)  each hybrid will make their choice and it will hurt either way.<br />
<br />
Shaman use mana more efficiently than hybrids... your comparison has absolutely no bearing period.<br />
also, having a HP before you get hit is much more important when you are being hit for 2-3k/swing....  remember what I said about trying to cast while being hit that hard?  Just for your information, dead hybrids don't cast very well.<br />
<br />
combine everything, AND the limited abilities of the spells hybrids get... and you get what most hybrids usually follow:<br />
<br />
For armor comparison I use the 1HP = 5mana rule.<br />
thus 175 175 = 200 50, or 210hp.<br />
<br />
<br />
yes, I leave time... after dying a bunch I need to get my XP back so I dont eventaully lose 65.  You see, when you don't have a cheatsheet/raid guide to go by, you actually die a bunch and figure out HOW to win the battle.<br />
<br />
our warriors also have to go XP in order to keep well into 65... but due to equipment and skill they dont seem to EVER lose aggro.<br />
<br />
hey, wait... did I say that their GEAR closes the gap?  hey... yes I did...  wait...  you were mentioning that knight equipment is closing the knight =&gt; warrior HP/AC gap??  gee...  since warriors can approach knight hate production using equipment, is it not fair that knights approach warrior HP?  Note, it takes HOW many TIME loots to close that distance?  How many hate items does it take to close the hate gap? (there are 2, one is the BoW, the other is a time loot)  Where is my BP that gives me defensive?  Truly, I'd be satisfied with one that gave me FURIOUS or even a auto-shield-block...  note, the furious given by the knight BP would have to last longer than the warrior one, seeing as how the warrior BP gives a better effect than the 65th level SK spell with no mana, no buff slot taken, no spell slot taken, and no spellcasting time...<br />
<br />
My 700-1000 numbers are BUFFED and equipped with the same buffs.  Warriors sit at 10kish and knights at 9kish give or take a few hundred...  as a Shadowknight I generally take Tunare instead of Brells...  thats 200 more due to needing the ATK...<br />
<br />
When the mobs hit for 2-3k, everyone dies sometimes...<br />
My shadowknight has 2700ish nakid with all the HP AA's.  Thats a 400point advantage even then.  Note, Im a troll with 114sta nakid.<br />
<br />
Again, your logic is flawed in that all my mana and all my spells still dont deliver the same utility in the high end as having that extra pile of HP...<br />
remember RELATIONAL?  A lot of good a 470pt lifetap is gonna do me when I am one-rounded!  okay, so the warrior is better in raids....  now we go to groups and I hold no real advantage anymore as the warrior is holding aggro fine...  wait a minute... now I am less than a warrior in raids, and about as useful in a group...  Those warriors are holding down aggro with 150+ AAXP rangers/rogue/wizards/etc going full blast in XP groups...  what was the problem again?<br />
<br />
<br />
Good ol' Gladius...<br />
Sure is easy to not read the post, claim that anyone not in your circle jerk is just bragging how good his l3wts are, and thus make excuses for why you are not addressing any real points isn't it?<br />
<br />
just once, I'd like to see someone argue a point...  it happens so VERY rarely here...  but its usually worth wading through the bull to get the one comment.<br />
<br />
I have posted time and time again that low-mid level warriors have a point about hate production...  High end ones have issues as well, but they are NOT THE SAME AS THEY ARE AT LOWER STAGES OF THE GAME.  If you cannot see why Knights gaining a few HP on the already gracious 10% Hp lead not counting defensive is not really an issue due to warriors at that stage of the game blowing the doors off the whole aggro issue, then you likely need to play some more instead of complaining how its &quot;not fair&quot; when you actually have no way to know anything about that stage of the game.<br />
<br />
Its like the virgins trying to tell an experienced adult about sex... its just plain laughable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Graal<br />
Well, thats one way to get the point across...  still doesn't really prove anything for actual situations, but its nice to know that even in their circle-jerk world doesn't work out how they say it does...<br />
I didnt see one warrior take their lies back yet.<br />
Think any one of the warriors want to actually be an adult and admit they were wrong?<br />
The one about the &quot;Hp gap being closed&quot; would be a good place to start...<br />
<br />
<br />
since warriors seem to be having trouble actually arguing anything here.. ill start you...<br />
<br />
in order to have a logical argument one of the following would have to happen:<br />
-you are in an at least elemental-geared guild with opposite results. (your warriors cannot hold aggro in XP groups with a BoW and elemental armor, and your knights have closed the HP gap so far in that you have them tank everything because defensive is simply not good enough)<br />
-you have actual data beyond making Magelo profiles of uber-rare loot. (you could be a level 1 newbie with insider game info...you could have years of experience and have another theory to shoot down or prove true)<br />
-you have an actual situation where a knight can collect two time loots (that the warrior gets as well) and catch the Warrior in HP as well as BoW/Raex BP closes the aggro gap.<br />
-You somehow can argue that experience is not better than looking up rare loot in a database and putting together dream character/loot sets.<br />
<br />
good luck...  thats a hard target.<br />

YAH that helps alot for a class that is unwanted except for a 4 hour raid and their ability to hit /disc at the end of that.<br />
<br />
it will be rare to find a knight that comes here and agrees because they are all so damn paranoid about getting nerfed.  <br />
<br />
and for the most part they all miss the point anyway. in lower lvls and tiers, aggro is a MAJOR problem. but they all rail that  in the high end, in the high end, in the high end.. yes WE GET IT ALREADY once every single warrior is TIME capapable, we should not have any aggro trouble... but we are NOT all in TIME yet are we?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brik, this is an absolute smokescreen and nonsense.   You are simply attempting to dismiss a large chunk of people from the argument who may or may not have valid points because you think you can justify it by saying &quot;unless you're in Time, you can't possibly know&quot;.    It's similar to myself going &quot;Unless you're an elemental warrior main, you can't possibly know what the issues are&quot; in a pathetic attempt to exclude you from the discussion.<br />
<br />
It's real simple to prove you wrong because of EQRankings.    REAL simple.    Go look at the top 50 knights and tell me how their gear deviates dramatically from the top 50 warriors, aside from class specific elemental armor.  The fact is, it doesn't.   Because YOU find Vengeance to be critically important, even though it's not, doesn't mean that others do.<br />
<br />
<br />
are you really trying to argue that my EXPERIENCE with time equipment and 4+ years of Knight/Warrior/lots of other classes is a lesser education than your lack of experience in time and your fiddling with magelo profiles?<br />
<br />
Actually, I find your experience in time to be absolutely irrelevant and am amused that you would try to cynically use it to exclude others from the discussion.    Your &quot;Experience&quot; with time equipment is no different from anyone else with access to links of gear.   You haven't been in time long enough to have equipped any significant amount of gear, so your only experience with the gear itself is the same as anyone else's, very limited.   You think hat getting links in raidsay makes you more qualified than say someone else getting a link from a serverwide channel?   Then, claiming this vast experience, you imply tha you have a wealth of experience playing a warrior as well, although your experience with your warrior twink is plenty limited, so based on your OWN criteria, you're less qualified to discuss this topic than anyone because you don't have any real experience as a WARRIOR in any challenging zone.<br />
<br />
Warriors in my guild (30% attendence or greater) compared with knights in my guild (30% attendance or greater) have 700-1000 more HP than the knights. The overall attendance % almost evens out.

This is even with a DKP system in place... You see, some of us are interested in what the GUILD can do, and not about being number one on a silly rankings site.<br />
<br />
We'll get back to the rarity of certain pieces of gear argument in a minute, but 700-1000 hitpoints of a 10khp tank is 7-10%.    I guarantee that your knights can ALL have an incomplete &quot;complete heal&quot; land on them.   How truly meaningful is a hitpoint pool advantage when both tanks can exceed the amount healed by CH?  <br />
<br />
My above comparison is the equivalent of parsing it... its the REAL scoop for one group of people... if you have better data than plugging rare drops in a magelo profile, I will listen... until then, you have nothing to compare to my results. <br />
<br />
What exactly did you &quot;parse&quot; there?   <br />
<br />
<br />
RELATIONAL<br />
The only way to explain this is the following:<br />
In plane of Time, if you dont have 10k+ HP AND defensive you can get one-rounded with a bad bunch of rolls. Warriors are the ONLY main tanks in time period. More Hp you have, the less likely you get insta-killed... ALIVE for the next CH &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dead before anyone can do anything. Every single HP/AC you can squeeze out means you have just that much more chance of actually looting the stuff we are talking about. 10% more HP and 5% more AC means EVERYTHING when being insta-killed is on the line. Since the combat system is about comparing the mobs ATk and your AC and your ATK and the mobs AC, 100ac/atk could mean MUCH more favorable rolls either way... even taking 1% less damage overall could mean you live to see the next round.<br />
<br />
Are you SERIOUSLY suggesting that warriors are &quot;balanced&quot; because they're necessary to tank mobs in PoTime and Fennin, Xegony, Raparm, Blazzax, Hydrotha, Offoassa, Kriziik, AM Yozanni, and a silence mob or two in air?    EVERY OTHER MOB IN EQ has been tanked by a knight and in some cases regularly is due to the aggro imbalance.   So, aside from 9 elemental mobs and PoTime, the only diference between warrior and knight in terms of tanking EVEN BOSSES is the interval of the CH rotation, although everyone knows that knights allow mobs to be killed faster than warriors do.  <br />
<br />
Landrain... here are some examples of why hybrids spells and melee sometimes trip over each other.<br />
<br />
Hybrids pay more for every spell... 20% more mana for every single spell. +175 mana is more like +145mana.<br />
<br />
Now, imagine you start casting a spell... you are no longer swinging your weapon until you finish that spell. (you will swing right after you finish) This is now compounded due to the fact faster weapons = better, and the best weapons are now 20ish delay... I want to see you cast a 2sec spell in between 100% hasted 20ish delay weapon swings without losing melee DPS.<br />
<br />
Casting is MUCH harder when you are getting whacked for 2-3k per mob swing... Warrior disciplines dont seem to have this problem.<br />
<br />
This is what we call &quot;dodging the issue&quot;.   It matters not that hybrids cast worse than casters, they cast INFINITELY better than warriors.   You dont' cast spells while tanking to replace defensive so it's a false dichotomy, you cast to keep aggro, and you would be less than honest if you claim it's not possible to do while being beaten.    The amount yo're being hit for is wholly inconseuential to your channelling skill, so why even bring it up?<br />
<br />
Due to being a hybrid we dont usually reach FT15 like all the other casters... you see reaching for the worn ATK cap is very useful for knights... being that our weaponskill caps hurts our melee damage production... do you collect melee items? (vengeance/+accuracy/shielding/etc) or caster effects? (FT/focus/etc) each hybrid will make their choice and it will hurt either way.<br />
<br />
Not attaining god mode isn't &quot;Hurting&quot;, the ONLY thing hybrids don't get a whole lot of is focus effects.   Fact is, you dont' HAVE to be casting through an endless fount of mana, you're not totally reliant on it, but your POOL has grown exponentially in the last two expansions without sacrificing melee defense at all because of the propogation of 100+hp/mana on most 100+Hp gear.<br />
<br />
    <br />
Shaman use mana more efficiently than hybrids... your comparison has absolutely no bearing period.<br />
<br />
Shamans use mana more efficiently than ANYONE, therefore no other caster can be compared?<br />
<br />
also, having a HP before you get hit is much more important when you are being hit for 2-3k/swing.... remember what I said about trying to cast while being hit that hard?<br />
<br />
Yes, and how hard you get hit has NO bearing on your channelling skill.   You will get interrupted more by RZTW than Raparm, even though Raparm hits WAY harder.<br />
<br />
<br />
yes, I leave time... after dying a bunch I need to get my XP back so I dont eventaully lose 65. You see, when you don't have a cheatsheet/raid guide to go by, you actually die a bunch and figure out HOW to win the battle.<br />
<br />
Grats on throwing in irrelevant insults at people, hope it makes you feel better.<br />
<br />
our warriors also have to go XP in order to keep well into 65... but due to equipment and skill they dont seem to EVER lose aggro.<br />
<br />
hey, wait... did I say that their GEAR closes the gap? hey... yes I did... wait... you were mentioning that knight equipment is closing the knight =&gt; warrior HP/AC gap?? gee... since warriors can approach knight hate production using equipment, is it not fair that knights approach warrior HP? Note, it takes HOW many TIME loots to close that distance? How many hate items does it take to close the hate gap? (there are 2, one is the BoW, the other is a time loot) Where is my BP that gives me defensive? Truly, I'd be satisfied with one that gave me FURIOUS or even a auto-shield-block... note, the furious given by the knight BP would have to last longer than the warrior one, seeing as how the warrior BP gives a better effect than the 65th level SK spell with no mana, no buff slot taken, no spell slot taken, and no spellcasting time... <br />
<br />
I'll ignore the obvious &quot;Gee, all I have to do to tank in PoP is beat it and get a time BP&quot; comment.   Oh yeah, you forgot to mention that it also STACKS with VoThule being a worn effect.<br />
<br />
My 700-1000 numbers are BUFFED and equipped with the same buffs. Warriors sit at 10kish and knights at 9kish give or take a few hundred... as a Shadowknight I generally take Tunare instead of Brells... thats 200 more due to needing the ATK...<br />
<br />
That's only if you're not tanking.   You don't need Atk to tank, you WANT the atk, you don't need it.<br />
<br />
When the mobs hit for 2-3k, everyone dies sometimes...<br />
My shadowknight has 2700ish nakid with all the HP AA's. Thats a 400point advantage even then. Note, Im a troll with 114sta nakid.<br />
<br />
Again, your logic is flawed in that all my mana and all my spells still dont deliver the same utility in the high end as having that extra pile of HP...<br />
<br />
That's simply put... an idiotic statement.   The &quot;extra Pile of HP&quot; exceeds the maximum healed by CH, so it's merely a &quot;just in case&quot; reserve.  Don't get me wrong, I like and want the extra just in case reserve, and it allows me to survive where you wouldn't if you weren't able to cast, but don't overvalue it either, once the threshhold of CH has been crossed, the value of additional HP is dramatically lower.<br />
<br />
remember RELATIONAL? A lot of good a 470pt lifetap is gonna do me when I am one-rounded! okay, so the warrior is better in raids.... now we go to groups and I hold no real advantage anymore as the warrior is holding aggro fine... wait a minute... now I am less than a warrior in raids, and about as useful in a group... Those warriors are holding down aggro with 150+ AAXP rangers/rogue/wizards/etc going full blast in XP groups... what was the problem again?<br />
<br />
The problem is this:    You're totally full of it.  You claim to be &quot;less than a warrior in raids&quot;, which is absolutely preposterous.   You're less efficient at tanking than a warrior on raids, but SK's have constantly parsed out much greater DPS than non-tanking warriors on raids as well, and if you're seriously telling me that you are &quot;worthless&quot; without tanking on raids, you're lying.   Your warriors who &quot;have no problem with aggro&quot; is also hyped up, they dont' have problems because they're playing with skilled players who allow them to have no problem with aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have posted time and time again that low-mid level warriors have a point about hate production... High end ones have issues as well, but they are NOT THE SAME AS THEY ARE AT LOWER STAGES OF THE GAME. If you cannot see why Knights gaining a few HP on the already gracious 10% Hp lead not counting defensive is not really an issue due to warriors at that stage of the game blowing the doors off the whole aggro issue, then you likely need to play some more instead of complaining how its &quot;not fair&quot; when you actually have no way to know anything about that stage of the game.<br />
<br />
A 10% hitpoint difference is GRACIOUS?   What exactly have you been smoking?  Incidentally, it's not even 10% any more.   <br />
<br />
Its like the virgins trying to tell an experienced adult about sex... its just plain laughable.<br />
<br />
Or it's like sluts trying to pass themselves off as urinary tract experts because they've been there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Graal<br />
Well, thats one way to get the point across... still doesn't really prove anything for actual situations, but its nice to know that even in their circle-jerk world doesn't work out how they say it does...<br />
I didnt see one warrior take their lies back yet.<br />
Think any one of the warriors want to actually be an adult and admit they were wrong?<br />
The one about the &quot;Hp gap being closed&quot; would be a good place to start...<br />
<br />
<br />
It's one thing to say someone is wrong, it's another to call people liars.   You my friend, aren't a liar, just a jerk who happens to be dead wrong on this issue.   What was the hitpoint difference between warrior and knight at SoL release, and what is it now in terms of a percentage?   If the percentage difference was larger at SoL release than it is now, then guess what... there' a &quot;closing gap&quot;.    Guess what... there's a closing gap.   Call me a liar all you want, but you better prove me wrong and not just call me a liar, otherwise you look the fool.   <br />
<br />
since warriors seem to be having trouble actually arguing anything here.. ill start you...<br />
<br />
in order to have a logical argument one of the following would have to happen:<br />
-you are in an at least elemental-geared guild with opposite results. (your warriors cannot hold aggro in XP groups with a BoW and elemental armor, and your knights have closed the HP gap so far in that you have them tank everything because defensive is simply not good enough)<br />
<br />
Hey brik, I'm in an elemental guild, don't have a BoW, because as you said earlier in the message (Yes, it's going to come back to haunt you).. you said..<br />
<br />
loot does not drop as you want it to... some of the loot is rare where some of them are common <br />
<br />
The BoW is not a guarantee, it's rare, and the mob who drops it is indeed on many servers pretty contested.   A BoW isn't something a warrior automatically gets, none of my guild's warriors has one yet after multiple RZTW kills, and there's several guild warriors.   You're setting up a false criteria by insisting that warriors just plain have BoW's.  <br />
<br />
I happen to be &quot;ok&quot; with aggro on elemental exp mobs, but hen again, if I'm grouped with a knight, I simply let them tank, because it frustrates the shit out of me to tank.   I shouldn't be frustrated trying to keep aggro unless you're equally frostrated trying to stay alive.    <br />
<br />
<br />
-you have actual data beyond making Magelo profiles of uber-rare loot. (you could be a level 1 newbie with insider game info...you could have years of experience and have another theory to shoot down or prove true)<br />
<br />
Since you give no hint at what &quot;data&quot; you'd find to be worthwhile, I'll ignore this as being silly.<br />
<br />
-you have an actual situation where a knight can collect two time loots (that the warrior gets as well) and catch the Warrior in HP as well as BoW/Raex BP closes the aggro gap.<br />
<br />
The aggro &quot;gap&quot; even with BoW/Raex BP is still WAY WAY WAY larger than the HP gap and setting up straw men about &quot;2 time loots&quot; doesn't help your argument any.<br />
<br />
-You somehow can argue that experience is not better than looking up rare loot in a database and putting together dream character/loot sets.<br />
<br />
I'll make the argument, I did above.   There's no substantive difference between you looking at loot and anyone else looking at loot, and claiming &quot;experience&quot; is a silly criteria unless you've put on those pieces of gear.</div></div><hr />

Note, burried in Briks egotistical rant is this one little gem, which tells us one important thing:  yes, in fact on gear with both hp's and mana, knights get an innate advantage.  Knights value that mana, and it is worth something to them.  I think in fact that was the point of the orginal post in this thread.  Brik insults, glorifies himself, and displays an ego the size of the universe, but buried in all that is a small line that proves the original point.  It does not matter that the one piece of gear mentioned originally is not one that a guild capable of getting it will use, but that it is one of many pieces of gear that have that same basic layout, namely + hp's, + mana, and +int/wis, and usable both by warriors and knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, the name is T-U-G, not Turg. I doubt Brick will grasp this, since it took him a calendar year to figure out quotes in EZBoard, but hope springs eternal and all.<br />
<br />
Anyway,<br />
<br />
Brick took a moment away from jacking off to his magelo to scratch out the following: <br />
<br />
That PALADIN is a knight... who was given credit for the work of many others.  A credit he would not take all for himself I think.  Your response seems to indicate that only saw the END RESULT of that very ancient discussion.  His work was instrumental, no doubt, but it HAD to be aided by those who actually experienced it.  You see, he actually listened to people who had actually been there.  Taking observations on something, then proposing an idea for how it works and testing it with real life is how we learn... .<br />
<br />
<br />
Joimster was not given credit for ANYONE'S work -- he did it ALL on his own. Sure discussion of some sort had been ongoing since EQ started, to relatively little effect on the whole. Joimster's solution was unique, elegant, and precise -- and utterly original.  <br />
<br />
As I remember it, Joimster observed the pattern while running around EC killing spiders, skellies and griffins with his wurmslayer. He wondered if ubermobs would be different, and asked for logs to check. He was told by several &quot;experienced&quot; players that he wouldn't be able to do what he was trying to do. But he checked the logs to see if the uber mobs were different. They weren't. So he reported his results.  <br />
<br />
&quot;He actually listened to people who'd actually been there&quot;? -- Been where? North Ro? At least we know he can't be talking about the Plane of Time, since even Brick wasn't there back then. There is absolutely NOTHING about Joimster's insight that couldn't have been gotten from what he'd done tanking lions in East Commons. The pattern was there to be seen by anyone at any time -- and no one did until Joimster.<br />
<br />
But the way Brick talks about it, it's like there was some council of elders (presumably including himself) who actually had all the information, and then that young upstart Joimster came in and put it all together (&quot;very ancient discussion&quot;? lol!). That's just not the case. Joimster's contribution was completely original -- and to suggest otherwise is an insult to the man's work. Christ, it almost sounds like Brick is willing to take credit for Joimster's ideas, by projecting himself into the role of the &quot;experienced player&quot; who led Joimster to the truth.<br />
<br />
I have to say, I really don't think you want to argue about the origin of the &quot;ubermob tanking&quot; thread with me. I did write it, after all. The bottom line is that, despite Brick's efforts to give the credit for Joimster's insights to the &quot;experienced&quot; players, it was a 49 paladin in crap gear tanking mobs in East Commons who figured out how EQ melee works. Experience only carries you so far; at some point it helps to have a little talent.<br />
<br />
A final point -- gimp warriors here at Steelwarrior aren't the only people playing around with magelos these days. Brick really should wander by the Fires of Heaven boards and check out this thread (http://fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=7864). I seem to recall most of those guys have zoned into Time also. Oh well -- give 'em heck, Brick!<br />
<br />
I'm going to ignore all the rest of it; Frodlin's rebuttal works for me.</div></div><hr />

Hey, I was thinking maybe we could get brik and aeka together and they could both downplay their classes, then we REALLY could get to the bottom of who is the most gimped, pallies or SKs.  <br />
<br />

<br />
First, I am a SK, but I agree that warriors need to be fixed.  Warriors at all levels of the game should not be worse xp tanks than knights.  They should be at least equal.<br />
<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
Warrior DPS is 100% melee.<br />
SK DPS can be 50%-80% melee, depending on the fight.<br />
<br />
So let's say we can both equip the same theoretical Vengance item that gives a 10% increase in melee DPS.<br />
<br />
Warriors get a 1.00 * .1 increase (10%) in their overall DPS.<br />
SKs get a (.5 - .8) * .1 increase (5%-8%) in their overall DPS.<br />
<br />
So by wearing the exact same item, knights get LESS of an improvement.  For the item to be equally effective for both classes, it requires something extra that only knights can take advantage of (focus effect, FT, or +mana.)<br />
<br />
Do you understand now why your comparison is flawed?<br />
<br />
Warriors have real issues that need to be addressed.  This isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we both have access to the same item that is 60ac, 190hp, and 190mana on it, do you take advantage of the 60ac and 190hp any less than we do?<br />
<br />
And yet you also gain the mana and sometimes a focus effect for the same item on many god loots in time.</div></div><hr />

But we maintain the same percentage margin over you EVEN THOUGH you get less net benefit from it.  That argument of &quot;less of an upgrade&quot; is flawed and was when SOE tried to use it to justify not giving warriors PE.</div></div><hr />

QUOTE<br />
Brik, this is an absolute smokescreen and nonsense. You are simply attempting to dismiss a large chunk of people from the argument who may or may not have valid points because you think you can justify it by saying &quot;unless you're in Time, you can't possibly know&quot;. It's similar to myself going &quot;Unless you're an elemental warrior main, you can't possibly know what the issues are&quot; in a pathetic attempt to exclude you from the discussion.<br />
<br />
It's real simple to prove you wrong because of EQRankings. REAL simple. Go look at the top 50 knights and tell me how their gear deviates dramatically from the top 50 warriors, aside from class specific elemental armor. The fact is, it doesn't. Because YOU find Vengeance to be critically important, even though it's not, doesn't mean that others do.<br />
END QUOTE<br />
<br />
<br />
No, I am dismissing something that is false and showing WHY it is false.  The only argument you seem able to use is &quot;I can make uber magelos and quote braggart sites...   the worst part is that you actually think thats better information.  You cannot dismiss my experience, because it actually applies.  I can actually GET this equipment... I am a hybrid, and wouldn't be caught using those arms over elemental arms even if those arms cost ZERO DKP.  I already explained that this item is going to rot...  in order to actually GET that equipment, you must be in a time-enabled guild.  In order to actually <br />
get to that stuff, you will have killed RZTW many times to get all your eligible warriors BoWs, and equipped everyone you can with elemental armor.  And its actually quite funny that you mention the &quot;you aren't a warrior-main&quot; part.  Think about it for a second...  I am less informed about hybrid equipment choices than someone who plays a warrior main?  Thats not logical.<br />
<br />
Yet again, nevermind the rankings and magelo-theoretical-perfect-setups.  You are missing a HUGE part of the story.  Have the &quot;top 50 knights&quot; put in more raid time than the &quot;top 50 warriors&quot;??  we dont know...  without having apples to compare to apples and oranges to compare to oranges we simply dont know.  EQ rankings is a terrible place to get data...  this is a braggart's site...  you actually believe its results?  You have all sorts of very silly configurations just to get one rank higher...  If you insist on using a probably false source for your data, I will not at ALL feel bad about dismissing you entriely.  Please find a real source, its really more fun that way.  I am not fond of winning this easily.<br />
<br />
DO tell...  you do not like items with vengeance on them?  You don't choose those items?  You keep separate uber-armor sets for different purposes? (tanking/damagedealing/pulling/etc) wow... you must be uber...  I don't have the DKP to soak up two or three sets of armor.  I wear the same set of armor for everything with a few slot replacements...  we both know you do as well.  My role in raids is an AT and damage dealer...  I need ATK more than I do HP most of the time.  Will you know claim to know a knight's role in Time raids better than a knight who is actually there?<br />
<br />
<br />
QUOTE<br />
Actually, I find your experience in time to be absolutely irrelevant and am amused that you would try to cynically use it to exclude others from the discussion. Your &quot;Experience&quot; with time equipment is no different from anyone else with access to links of gear. You haven't been in time long enough to have equipped any significant amount of gear, so your only experience with the gear itself is the same as anyone else's, very limited. You think hat getting links in raidsay makes you more qualified than say someone else getting a link from a serverwide channel? Then, claiming this vast experience, you imply tha you have a wealth of experience playing a warrior as well, although your experience with your warrior twink is plenty limited, so based on your OWN criteria, you're less qualified to discuss this topic than anyone because you don't have any real experience as a WARRIOR in any challenging zone.<br />
END QUOTE<br />
<br />
<br />
Ooh fun.. lets start with no different than someone with magelo profiles...  so you think picking rare loot drops of some site description is better than being there.  I don't need to touch this one.  Your logic is flawed and you know where already.  Its similar to insisting that someone who watches football is better at playing football than someone who has played all their life.<br />
<br />
Not enough time loots?  I question how you think you know this?  Where did you get this info from?  The same place you get the rest of your information?<br />
I am wearing a reasonable amount of time loot myself...  and even if I wasn't would have had access to guild-only parsings and have actually tanked and dealt damage and pulled time mobs.  I actually WEAR some of this stuff...  in four slots actually.  I could have had those arms as well.  I told you they went to an invite.  I turned them down to keep my elemental arms like the rest of the knights in my guild.  Someday you will make the same decisions.. and when you do, you will be better informed.  Having made real decisions and facing the consequences of those decisions makes nearly anyone better at making those decisions.  I am seriously hoping you already knew this.<br />
<br />
This topic is about HYBRID equipment... in comparison to warrior equipment.  Are you lost?  The only type of player who could accurately claim to have better experience would be someone who has played and equipped both a warrior and a knight in time.  These would be little rare as of yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUOTE<br />
We'll get back to the rarity of certain pieces of gear argument in a minute, but 700-1000 hitpoints of a 10khp tank is 7-10%. I guarantee that your knights can ALL have an incomplete &quot;complete heal&quot; land on them. How truly meaningful is a hitpoint pool advantage when both tanks can exceed the amount healed by CH?<br />
END QUOTE<br />
<br />
Dead characters don't get healed.  Having 10% more Hp and defensive means the CH has a greater chance of landing.  The mobs that these items drop off deal insane amounts of damage per second.  Are you not reading these posts?  These mobs deal 2-3k per hit...  and hit pretty dang often.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUOTE<br />
What exactly did you &quot;parse&quot; there?<br />
END QUOTE<br />
<br />
I took the actual results of a guild's equipment.  A guild that has access to this stuff, a source that is infinitely more reliable than eqrankings or magelo as they actually HAVE this equipment.  I listen  and parse side by side with these people and have access to guild-only info about these time-loots.  I wear many of them myself and compare with the people side by side who have the same type of equipment.  I know how often said people attend raids so I can compare knights and warriors with the same attendance percentage.  I can actually compare a knight and a warrior with similar time investment.  The warriors in my guild are NOT hurting in the usefulness department...  While my guild DOES take qualified knights...  we actively seek out qualified warriors.  The difference cannot be ignored.  This is the equivalent of a parse as its real information.  You still have nothing to compare to this.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUOTE<br />
Are you SERIOUSLY suggesting that warriors are &quot;balanced&quot; because they're necessary to tank mobs in PoTime and Fennin, Xegony, Raparm, Blazzax, Hydrotha, Offoassa, Kriziik, AM Yozanni, and a silence mob or two in air? EVERY OTHER MOB IN EQ has been tanked by a knight and in some cases regularly is due to the aggro imbalance. So, aside from 9 elemental mobs and PoTime, the only diference between warrior and knight in terms of tanking EVEN BOSSES is the interval of the CH rotation, although everyone knows that knights allow mobs to be killed faster than warriors do.<br />
END QUOTE<br />
<br />
I assure you, knights do not currently MT in time.  Knights generally tank those creatures that the warriors have already tanked.. and those that have been found to be weak enough to tank without defensive.  This usually happens after the guild's equipment level has exceeded the mob.  Our warriors have no issues holding aggro...  aggro is not the limiting factor for us... in time, its staying alive that is the challenge.  In time, as in ALL other places, the Warriors tank it until the mob is outgrown.  At the stage of the game that you have to be at to get those arms...  warrior taunt is not an issue, as the mobs that we are talking about can ONLY be tanked by a warrior.  When WARRIORS without defensive are being insta-killed every so often, then the knights will not stand long.  In this case, a knight's aggro is not a replacement for the warrior's durability.  At this stage of the game, we technically could tank Xegony with a knight now...  but it won't happen as we have no desire to have a small mistake screw up a raid that we shouldn't have any problem with.  The Xegony raid is a long one... currently, the risk of having to do the raid over GREATLY outweighs the benefit of using a knight's aggro abilities.  We do not seem to kill raid targets faster with a knight than with a warrior. When you risk setting back your raid HOURS of clearing, people aren't usually willing to push aggro to the limit in order to kill seconds faster!  Once again, you are comparing a lower level of the game to the absolute high end of the game.  When we are talking about tanking in TIME (where you get those arms) warriors are the only real tanks.  Knights become utility and damage dealing... which are secondary roles...  I have never seen a raiding guild held up as they don't have enough knights.  I cannot count the number of times we needed to raid something lesser as we didn't have enough warriors on.  Seeign as how I spend a great deal of my EQ time raiding, this becomes a larger issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUOTE<br />
This is what we call &quot;dodging the issue&quot;. It matters not that hybrids cast worse than casters, they cast INFINITELY better than warriors. You dont' cast spells while tanking to replace defensive so it's a false dichotomy, you cast to keep aggro, and you would be less than honest if you claim it's not possible to do while being beaten. The amount yo're being hit for is wholly inconseuential to your channelling skill, so why even bring it up?<br />

This is where that whole experience thing pays off.<br />
We cast to do a job...  Warriors &quot;cast&quot; disciplines that always work...  Hybrids &quot;activate&quot; spells... the idea is to use these abilities to accomplish something.  They are trade-offs.  Knights do not cast to keep aggro in time.  We cast hoping to NOT get aggro.  If we are MT, we don't get to cast often, as even 1+ second spells are meaningless as the funky RNG is not your friend usually...  and even when it is, it isn't your friend for long.  Insta-dead knights are not really useful tanks frankly...  even if I steal aggro like a champ, it does me little good if I am dead.  Let me repeat.  The amount you are being hit for IS consequential... when the amount you are being hit for exceeds the amount of HP you have, you are dead, and cannot cast.  Very interesting listening to a warrior claim to know more about a skill he does not have than a hybrid who DOES have the skill.  Even so, its irrelevant...  being dead means channeling is pointless... and that 470pt lifetap, or that +600hate isn't really going to help me much from my bind point.<br />
<br />
Also, not gonna quote the next two issues...  just pointing out that the particular hp/man comparison using a shaman as an example was useless..  hybrids cannot use that scale...  don't think we actually disagree here.. that was a pointless comparison that has been dismissed as false.<br />
<br />
Now, the amount each hit for IS irrelevant... but the amount you are hit for while casting overall is not.  The more damage done to you while casting a spell, the less likely you complete the spell.  Try it once...  load up a 65th hybrid and fight a mob that has low DPS... you will channel very often (except when stunned/knockback, you need to discount those.  Now go tank something that hits for a lot of damage...  provided you don't die, you will channel less well, and will find casing much harder.  Note that higher end mobs tend to stun/knockback more often as well.  Are you just picking at stupid little things or are you actually trying to insist that casting while tanking a high-end mob isn't interrupted often?  You would be just plain wrong.<br />

Don't have to win, just beat the appropriate mob in time...  you might notice that the arms we are talking about are actually in time as well...  Someone eligible for the arms of the brute will soon be eligible for the Time BP...  and would have already killed Rallos in Tactics.. and likely could do it again very easily to equip their warriors with a BoW.  A knight eligible for those arms would be in a guild capable of getting the BP, and would have long since been capable of getting a BoW.  You cannot use the &quot;not everyone is uber enough to get that&quot; arguement here... as the comparisons are being made about items that are not attainable except if a guild is capable of getting the hate adding warrior items.<br />
<br />
and btw, i NEED the ATK.  Dead mobs do not hit back...  Knights do NOT MT in time.  You will understand that every DPS counts (yes even knight melee) when you get a mob to 0% in time and then wipe. (that whole experience thing again)<br />

Don't get me wrong, I like and want the extra just in case reserve, and it allows me to survive where you wouldn't if you weren't able to cast, but don't overvalue it either, once the threshhold of CH has been crossed, the value of additional HP is dramatically lower.<br />

I was going to leave this out, but it was so entertaining... and shows your skills at comparing apples to oranges.<br />
I compared someone who actually experienced something and someone who used false knowledge when book knowledge about something isn't going to cut it.<br />
You compared someone who doesn't use a specific group of knowledge to someone who is book-smart.<br />

I was comparing the same field... and since I am eligible to loot said arms above...  I actually have lived and experienced hybrid loot decisions (sex) of this nature.  Most of the posters here have not. (virgins)  My comparison works...  yours is apples an oranges... similar to your whole argument.<br />

It's one thing to say someone is wrong, it's another to call people liars. You my friend, aren't a liar, just a jerk who happens to be dead wrong on this issue. What was the hitpoint difference between warrior and knight at SoL release, and what is it now in terms of a percentage? If the percentage difference was larger at SoL release than it is now, then guess what... there' a &quot;closing gap&quot;. Guess what... there's a closing gap. Call me a liar all you want, but you better prove me wrong and not just call me a liar, otherwise you look the fool.<br />

A liar is one who intentionally spreads information they know is not true.  Usually with a specific motive in mind.  A lie can be indirect or partially true; but it is still a lie.  Here you either misunderstand or intentionally warp the truth in order to &quot;prove your point&quot;.  I actually think at this moment that you fail to understand.<br />
<br />
The warriors who claimed that Hybrids were going to close the Hp gap between equipped warriors and equipped Knights are false.  Another poster posted the proof that defeats the evidence presented by the warriors who claimed that already. (you did actually read the thread this time right?)  The warrior STILL has more HP...  and by a similar amount as well.  Those who claimed that Knights were about the close the HP gap (meaning catch up) are liars.  They know this isn't true and they are spreading said lies in the hopes to get the upgrades they think they need.  Thats a lie, even if its a partial truth. (warriors need a looksee in the aggro department in the pre-BoW stages)<br />
<br />
If a warrior and a Knight wear the same gear, the HP gap is narrowed...  but the same happens for the aggro generation if the warrior wear similar gear.  The warrior really only needs the BoW to gain a very large boost in their hate generation abilities.  The knight needs nearly every slot filled with Time loot.  The result is that warriors taunt MUCH better, and that the knights live ever so slightly longer in raids.  It would be actually VERY unbalanced to the warriors' favor if not for the issues warriors have pre-BoW.<br />
<br />
The Hp gap between Knights and Warriors is &quot;closed&quot; = lie<br />
Its even a lie to say that its close enough so that knights &gt; warriors for tanking.  Tanking at that level of the game (time) is nearly ALL warriors.<br />
The false statements come mostly from those presenting mobs that are trivial that are tanked by knights as evidence that knights are gaining on them.  Nevermind that due to how the game system works, we sometimes use druids to tank trivial encounters.  Druids are terrible tanks in comparison to a warrior... and indeed to a knight as well.  Kights and Warriors do not need to be infinitely better tanks oin trivial mobs than druids.  Who really cares is a druid tanks an orc pawn as well as a warrior?<br />
<br />
The Hp gap between knights and warriors is &quot;narrowing&quot; (at this level of the game) = I will not count this as false, as buffs give both casters and hybrids additional HP in constant amounts, the % difference has dropped.  This is not nearly as dramatic for Hybrids as it is for casters.  Of course you were complaining about the knights who can actually wear those arms of the brute.  As I mentioned above though...  hybrids apparently didn't get enough to compete with warriors in the high end even for a brief tanking stint.<br />
<br />
The aggro generation gap between knights and warriors is narrowing (at this level of the game) = true enough as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the changes to warrior hate generation in PoP are FAR greater than the changes to hybrid HP in PoP.  It wasn't too long ago that most warriors were complaining about aggro generation being infinitely more important than HP.  Perhaps I misunderstood.  Please explain whether you think a few percentage points of HP comparatively or the addition of hate generation equipment is of more impact.  Be prepared to defend it.  Don't think it would be too hard to find warrior-written posts I could quote that say they value hate generation much more than a few HP.<br />
<br />
Note, that the HP difference does stop mattering for pickup groups...  both the knight and the warrior have more than enough HP and overall damage absorption to tank in pickup groups.  Adding a few HP matters very little here.  The changes to warrior aggro generation change that situation dramatically.  A warrior with a BoW owns aggro very well.  While a knight is better, they are not noticeably better.  An time-enabled warrior who takes his time loot and does an XP group will be just as good of a tank as a knight is... and will deal considerably more damage while tanking than a knight does.  A knight cannot touch a warrior in raids at that level.<br />
<br />
I favor changes to warrior hate generation in pre-BoW era.  I favor changes to knight's ability to tank for raids... if only for 10-15 seconds.<br />
The knights gaining a few HP is no threat at that stage of the game.  Warriors who think it is need to play the game some more.<br />

Hey brik, I'm in an elemental guild, don't have a BoW, because as you said earlier in the message (Yes, it's going to come back to haunt you).. you said..<br />
<br />
The BoW is not a guarantee, it's rare, and the mob who drops it is indeed on many servers pretty contested. A BoW isn't something a warrior automatically gets, none of my guild's warriors has one yet after multiple RZTW kills, and there's several guild warriors. You're setting up a false criteria by insisting that warriors just plain have BoW's.<br />
<br />
I happen to be &quot;ok&quot; with aggro on elemental exp mobs, but hen again, if I'm grouped with a knight, I simply let them tank, because it frustrates the shit out of me to tank. I shouldn't be frustrated trying to keep aggro unless you're equally frostrated trying to stay alive.<br />
END QUOTE<br />

<br />
Well, you are also not in the Plane of Time are you?  You and you guild's knights are not eligible for the Arm of the Brute.  They cannot attain that loot, and neither can you.  You CAN attain a BoW... you just haven't yet.  Likely your guild will make a greater effort to get you a BoW than my guild will to get me those arms.  I don't even want those arms as they are a downgrade...  you want a BoW I wager.  For the people at the level of the game capable of getting the arms we are talking about, RZTW in PoTactics is a pushover.  Our guild killed RZTW until all eligible warriors had BoW...  I advise the same before advancing to Time.  You can bet that equipping knights with Arm of the Brute is not exactly a guild priority.  Apples and oranges... of course, you are still thinking at YOUR level of the game, instead of thinking forward.  Remember that whole experience issue?<br />
<br />
For XP groups, you should be comparing HP/AC and general equipment with the knight.  I generally list my HP/AC and let the cleric choose.  If I am not tank, I would slather you with Voice and then go pull... provided you could muster more skill than the newbie warriors you find in pickup groups, (I give you more credit than that) you would not lose aggro easily, and the group would XP faster with you tanking than with me tanking as I lined up the pulls with massive amounts of hate on me that would be tranferred to you in one TAUNT.  Shadowknights are VERY good at making someone else the center of the mob's attention in XP groups.  The mob when slowed hates ME more than the shaman...  then they would hate YOU more than me.  I can take a few hits and heal in combat while you tank. (lifetaps)  The group has one mob lined up the whole time and we clear the area with ease.  I cannot emphasize enough how powerful Knights and Warriors are if paired together.  You must learn how this works in order to teach it...  even paladins can use a modified version of this. (they take more hits, but the hate thing still works... and they heal themselves.)  Stop rolling over and playing possum.  At this stage of the game you DO have valid issues that I actually wholeheartedly agree with, (Warriors hate generation should NOT be tied to one weapon.. it should be innate) but you will not grow in your playskills if you keep playing possum. (note that was not meant as an insult, as I know you would take it as such...  I continue to hone my playskills.. I assume the same of any player who plays with any seriousness) There is a time to step aside and a time to step up.  Learning the difference is the most important lesson a tank class will ever learn.  Never stepping up is guaranteed to be the wrong decision in the long run.<br />

The aggro &quot;gap&quot; even with BoW/Raex BP is still WAY WAY WAY larger than the HP gap and setting up straw men about &quot;2 time loots&quot; doesn't help your argument any.<br />
END QUOTE<br />
<br />
Hmm..  and how would you quantify this?  I really do want to know, especially considering you don't even have a BoW yet.  I quantify this by how fast groups kill when a warrior with BoW is tanking as compared to me tanking.  I don't notice much of a difference except he has less close calls than I do.  We don't kill any faster, and the group XP/hour does not increase as we are clearing the area anyways.  I know the warriors last considerably longer in tanking time mobs than I do.  Note, that there isn't much information on the Raex effect yet, as its discovery is relatively new...  I DO know what effect Voice of Thule has, and that every warrior I know takes it willingly in XP groups.  The effect on the BP is greater than that of Voice of Thule, and due to it being an innate effect, it likely will STACK as well.  The effect beoms even MORE powerful then.<br />
<br />
May I remind you that the Arms of the Brute are also a time loot...  we are talking about time loots.. we are talking about a Knight who must get MANY more loots than the warrior to achieve a result that will not help them nearly as much as the warrior stuff helps warriors.  Even if knights DID close the HP gap.. we'd still insta-die like the warriors who's defenisve has not recycled...  once over 7500HP, (ie any plate class in elemental armor) extra HP are of lesser value to an XP group.  Gaining hate generation for warriors in HUGE.  The BoW is so poweful as to make a whole new breed of warriors...  those with a BoW and those without. (this is wrong I agree)  BoW-enabled warriors hold aggro very well in XP groups...  You cannot tell me this isn't powerful and useful.  I gain so very little from those armguards... so much that I won't take them ever.  Warriors gain so much from the BoW...  and stand to gain more from the Raex BP.  Again... the whole experience thing hits you upside the head.<br />

And, like I said you would, you failed horribly.  Looking at gear in a magelo profile is woprthless compared to fighting at that level of the game, and seeing how often and where they drop, and comparing/parsing guildies with such items, and having time loot equipped as well in said comparisons.  You fail to understand game mechanics and teamwork mechanics at this level of the game where those arms drop.  You cant seem to understand even the basics of a hybrid being splatted in moments.. and even a non-defensive warrior being spatted in less than 5 seconds.  You seemt o have no concept of raid roles or even frankly group roles at YOUR level of the game let alone a time-enabled guilds roles.  You are lackign experience and claiming to be more knowledgeable.<br />

The whole &quot;owned&quot; picture is SO sad...  while its impied meaning is entertaining for me due to its utter rediculousness, isnt anyone else saddened by the fact the guy holding the gun is actually powerless?  First of all he proves his stupidity in such an act, AND if he pulls the trigger, hes guilty of murder in front of many witnesses.  He will spend the rest of miserable life in jail being someone's toy. (he's obviously powerless without the gun because he seems to think he needs it in a bowling alley, even the ineptness of the police will catch such a easy target!)  The guy wants to win SO bad, that he has to pull a gun instead of winning with skill and tact.  The fact this guy pulled a gun in a bowling alley only proves that guys ineptness and stupidity.

<br />
Rather than quote you completely and make a post even longer, I'll simply answer you one point at a time.<br />
<br />
1. You don't have the arms, apparently by choice.    Therefore you don't have any experience that others don't have.    Your claims of experience are silly and unfounded.<br />
<br />
2. Your analogies are so wonderful because they are so silly.<br />
<br />
Your logic is flawed and you know where already. Its similar to insisting that someone who watches football is better at playing football than someone who has played all their life.<br />
<br />
More accurately, it's like someone who sits on the bench during the super bowl claiming to know more than someone who played first string up to the NFC championship.    <br />
<br />
3. I already conceded that warriors must tank nameds in PoTime, so stop trying to make the argument, it only makes you look like less bright.<br />
<br />
4. Warrior aggro issues exist in PoTime as well, but guilds have a motivation to limit their DPS to allow the warrior to tank.  Warriors' #1 gripe is that it's limited to a VERY select and SHRINKING number of mobs, and it's completely eliminated in experience groups.<br />
<br />
5. Backtracking on the &quot;channelling through mobs that hit for XXX&quot; issue is amusing.  Let me repeat, I have a caster and know this VERY well, and you either WILL concede on this or will be portrayed the fool.   The amount a mob hits you for has *no* bearing on your ability to channel a spell, zip, zilch nada.  <br />
<br />
6.   Another quote: <br />
<br />
stop thinking in &quot;MT'ing trash mobs in PoValor&quot; and start thinking &quot;MT'ing a mob that instakills 10k warriors that aren't using defenisve&quot;.<br />
Nevermind CH... its being chaincycle on you anyways... if that second heal doesn't push you to more than the mob is dishing, you are dead.<br />
<br />
AGAIN you're missing the point, Ive already said and have ALWAYS said that warriors need to tank mobs that can 1-round a non defensive tank.   No one has EVER denied that, it would be the height of idiocy to.   The point is, USING those few examples to justify keeping warriors down in exp groups and every mob who CANT 1-round is wrong and unjustified.<br />
<br />
7. On to my quote and your analysis of it.    You're still not being real bright, but I'll give you credit, you're tenacious.   People who haven't been in a zone where a PARTICULAR piece of gear drops are FAR from being completely ignorant in playing Everquest,  they're FAR from being &quot;virgins&quot; to EQ and equipment selection decisions.    The only way your pathetic analogy would hold true is if someone hadn't played EQ at all commented on them.   ALTHOUGH there's people on this VERY forum who HAVE been there and are STILL pissed about the items' existence.  You're going to have to do some SERIOUS gymnastics to discount their arguments.  It only really serves to buttress my point that experience in PoTime isn't relevant to the argument.   Brik, it's NOT RELEVANT.    Your experience in Time is WORTHLESS, it's without merit, it means NOTHING because it doesn't provide any additional insight, particularly when Time enabled warriors are as pissed off as non-time enabled warriors.<br />
<br />
8. The aggro gap isn't closing since the release of PoP at all, it's grown by leaps and bounds.    A slowdown in the rate of growth is NOT &quot;a closing gap&quot;, it's simply decreasing the rate of growth.    The hitpoint/AC gap IS a closing gap since PoP, and there's no possibility of denying it.   To call someone a &quot;liar&quot; while presenting an argument like this is less than honest.</div></div><hr />
