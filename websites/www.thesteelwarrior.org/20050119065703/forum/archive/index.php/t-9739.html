<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caerberus</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=833571) <br />
<br />
I need some idea to get this craptastic wood elf warriors HP/AC up. Currently I am hitting 8700HP 1470AC fully buffed at lvl 67. I cant seem to break 9k no matter what I do. There are a few augments missing on my magelo gear (10AC 10AGI 10SV poison if i remember correctly -premium expired and i havent updated them yet)<br />
<br />
Another question I have is how are the HP from base stats caculated. After I finish off my Combat Agility AA's I was considering Planar Durablity to add 1.5% to my HP. When I created this character during kunark era, I didn't know of such great info as Thesteelwarrior.org and put all my starting points into STR instead of STA, so I think that is hurting me alot. I am not in a raiding guild (guild I'm in is having some issues so I may be looking elsewhere soon :( ). <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

P.S. BTW Frod tell the develoopers to put in quest to change your race from Wood Elf to Ogre/Troll  :eek:  :D</div></div><hr />

I got 180ish HP going from 69-70 alone, and I wasn't paying attention  from 67-69 so it's possible you get even more from those levels.<br />
<br />
Anyhow most OoW gear is an upgrade for casuals so keep an eye out for AC augs, Kyanite (10hp aug drops from trash, can be shined up to 45hp... not lore) boots of slaughter, armguards of repentance, iron guantlets of ruin, and some random others.  I can't see magelos at work so if you already have that stuff, my bad.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing wrong with being a wood elf. Yes you start a little bit lower with sta, but you also take less hits when that is a factor.  Once you max sta and a few key AAs (stun resist), then there is virtually no difference from a woodelf to a ogre/troll (except that you are a lot easier on the eyes).<br />
<br />
Most Oow stuff has a decent amount of sta on it, and with shammy buffs that could easily be maxxed.  So it has nothing to do with you being a woodelf and everything to do with what you are wearing.  :)<br />
<br />
&lt;--proud to be a woodelf and would never change it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya, finigh up your defensive related AA's and you'll be just as supa-l33t as them smelly ogres.<br />
I play a wood elf warrior as well and besides the overall frontal-stun nonsense which I can kind of make up with by some AA work I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even for the stupid reasons like better base charisma while pouring in the stamina points at creation.</div></div><hr />

However, like the rest have said, leveling up and AAing up will catch you up with the orges easily.  I am a wood elf and I normally raid buff out to 9k-9300hp.  Can take a look at my profile if you want.</div></div><hr />

Can't seem to get it to work to take a look at your gear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Armsmaster's quests would upgrade a lot of slots both HP and AC.  The quest requires Dragorn Loyalist faction which is also what is required for Muramite Officers Ring 11ac/120hp. Make sure ya know what pieces are needed for each item so you can keep an eye out for em.<br />
<br />
The drops from random trash mobs in WoS and MPG would be very good upgrades in HP's AC and stats for ya too. Im thinking the WoS neck and the Mazrunner Ring and Mask from MPG.<br />
<br />
Also, the 20ac aug (Ground Murkglider Eyes) that drops from the same guy you got your Warclasp ear from is groovy.<br />
<br />
Could try camping for a Bygone Butchers Cleaver or SoMWV too. <br />
<br />
Be nice to see some augs on your weaps. If LDoN not really your thing then the stun aug from Bloodfields would be cool.  Be great if there was a way around it, but you have to do a little LDoN if you want good agro augs and AC/hp augs that can hold ya until you able to get RS/GoD/MPG/etc augs for your armor.<br />
<br />
As far as AA's go you got a lot of different things started.  I would get Planar Durability/Lightning Reflexes/Inate Defense/a couple levels of Sturdiness in the nearish future. Probably busy leveling too though, so up to you how ya do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caerberus</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a few pieces for the armsmasters quests. But I don't have the faction yet (working on it tho when I can. I won The WoS Neck this morning if Blue Flame Necklace  (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30767) is what you are referring to. Got a few more AA points today also and trained Planar Durability 1 which put me at 8945HP/1502AC tonight (buffed). I probably could get a few more HP since I didn't have conviction at the time.<br />
<br />
I was saving up for waepon augs but since our guild has been slowly dwindling lately, so grinding out 50 LDON's really wasn't  too efficent to me. ALso the LDON points I had were in all different themes none of which were any useful for me. So I spent the points on what I could afford  in each theme. I think I got a +10AC aug +10 AGI aug and a +10 SV Poison aug (IIRC) Maybe if I sell some of this gear I have on my trader this week I'll finally be able to afford a BoC. But i'm not holding my breath. <br />
<br />
I had surgery on monday (tonsils removed) so I have some time to play since I don't go back to work until after Thanksgiving. Hopefully I will be able to accomplish all these things before I have to go back to work.  <br />
<br />
<br />
BTW Dima....Thanks for the consideration last night. Better luck next try   ;)</div></div><hr />
