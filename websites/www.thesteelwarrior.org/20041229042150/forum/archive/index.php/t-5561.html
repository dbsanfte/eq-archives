I see you didnt score a finishing blow on a mob that was being shielded by another mob yet.</div></div><hr />

I was amazed how often it &quot;fired&quot; ... in that situation it worked very well and I didn't consider it to be a waste.<br />
<br />
Of course if you have 420+ AA's I guess there isn't much else to buy anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seperate your mobs.  They suffer the same range limitation.  I can't remember the last time i saw a mob shield another.....chardok bank maybe when PoP came out?  I think so.<br />
<br />
Hater?  Maybe, but when people use the ol' &quot;$$&quot; to describe something retarded, I guess I get annoyed.  Hell, when they use it to describe anything for that matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finishing blow will always be more than 32k if it comes from your mainhand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats right on the $$ haass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what Trondir said, I think you may have missed his point, Haaass.  I think he was hinting that getting a 32k shot on a mob that is being /sheilded by another mob would do 16k to the one you finishing blow on, and 19.2k to the other...far from useless, if used to your advantage.<br />
<br />
Now, if it really works that way, especially in places like LDoN, or Sebilis, where you have LOTS of mobs that /sheild, and have lots in camp at once, quite often, that could be VERY VERY useful.  Imagine having a 100% health mob insta-gibbed by a finishing blow, because he /sheilded another, perhaps 1 mob in 20, if you have 3-4 mobs in camp in a normal ldon, that could easily cut 5 minutes off an adventure.<br />
<br />
Does a /sheild-er take almost 20k when you finish off his buddy? Anyone know this for a fact?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A mob doesnt go into run mode for finishing blow to even go off if theres another mob of the same faction in /shield range, I cant think of any that do anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd have to get one to running, and then pull a second one by it as it's running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, and then the one would have to start shielding the other, and you'd have to score a FB before you just killed it outright.<br />
<br />
Oh, and mobs split damage evenly, they don't do 50/75 like us, it's 50/50 for exploit purposes just like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Podling</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which would still make it a 16k hit on the fresh mob.  Nothing to sneeze at.<br />
<br />
Question, can you score a FB on a feared mob?  I know you can't fear it and get a FB at 100% life, but if the mob is below running level and the only thing stopping him from running is another mob in camp, will fear allow you to get a FB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which would still make it a 16k hit on the fresh mob. Nothing to sneeze at. <br />
<br />
Go try it. <br />
<br />
I've never seen it happen, I've never heard of it happening.<br />
<br />
THAT would be a screenshot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, considering it has a one in a billion chance of happening. <br />
<br />
But by all means, go buy FB for this purpose! If it works, let me be the first to shake your hand IRL.</div></div><hr />
