Did you happen across the Blizzard WoW message boards the day that they announced the closed beta was over? Well we did, and it was pretty sad... some of the comments were literally laugh out loud funny others made you feel sorry for the poster.<br />
<br />
In any case, we wrote a song that fateful day about the pain and agony involved with letting go of your precious beta, and now the video is ready for public consumption. <br />

I know what you mean about some of the crying on the boards.  I was LMAO, for the most part.  Some folks couldnt figure out there was an outside world to see, for that week.<br />
<br />
I too played in Beta.  Hated to see it go, but Im glad we only had to wait a week for retail, lol.  Nice video. <br />
