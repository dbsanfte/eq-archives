<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Graize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read around a bit as I do with all new boards, but I found no info concerning my questions. <br />
<br />
I'll introduce myself a bit to start. I've not been playing long, but am proud to be a warrior. I play on Kane Bayle and my warrior is 27 atm. I know this leaves me out of the veteran high level league but I thought I'd try for some knowledge from all those who have gone beyond what I can hope for.<br />
<br />
First question: Haste. I see that at later levels it seems imperative to have a haste item. I'm sure that I could get haste items later as I get closer to 65, but I'm not sure how it will affect me as a tank and or affect my ability to maintain an integral part in groups.<br />
<br />
Second question: Delay. I'm not sure what to do. I have a Wurmslayer in my primary, and the no drop 1hs sword from the Skeleton Commanders that spawned during the anniversary. People are always telling me that I need to have less delay then a wurm. I find it hard to believe that all of them are ignorant, so I will say, what are possible upgrades?<br />
<br />
Third question: Overall Equipment. Okay, I'm a low level now compared to a 65, but I consider myself twinked. It seems that at later levels you need to be even more uber then anyone else. I've seen equipment on this board that made my mouth water. Is this equipment a must have to stand up to the challenges that come with higher level grouping and raiding?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if I seem ignorant but I am here to learn. And if anyone wants to know, my stepdad got me addicted to this game, he helps me out a lot with his 65 pally.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A couple items:<br />
<br />
1.  Haste - definitely get something  :p .  This will increase your dps (which is still important at your level) and help with agro.  Fairly inexpensive options are Silver Chitin Hand Wraps (5k) and Flowing Black Silk Sash (2k).  If you have lots of plat, Cloak of Flames (90k) is nice.  (the prices I listed are on Emarr)<br />
<br />
2.  Weapon delay - go for weapon ratio - again, that'll help with agro and dps.  As you get higher level you'll want procs to help with agro, but I can't think of an agro procing weapon that procs at 27.  Take a look in the Library forum on this site - there is a post there about agro weapons - it lists specific weapons and ranks them by weapon type...very handy.  By the way, I used a Reaver until the mid 50's and didn't have any agro problems (40/40 2hs.)<br />
<br />
3.  Equipment - create a magelo profile and post it here to get equipment advice.  Also include how much plat you have to spend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) Simply put, haste is essential because the faster you hit something, the more chances you have to gain agro with a proc, etc...  If you're not hitting the mob that often, it could care less about you vs. the caster that's nuking it for 6K crits.<br />
<br />
2) Most 1H weapons that warriors look for have to have less than 20 delay in their primary hand.  This goes back to my original point about haste.  Slow weapons are not ideal, unless you really have to worry about things like riposte.  But that's not something you really have to worry about at your level.  Just as important as your delay, is your delay to damage ratio.  Most look for a ratio as close to 1 as possible, if not under 1.<br />
<br />
3)  Your gear all depends on what stage you are in this game.  My gear is adequate for where I am.  Elementally geared warriors are adequate for where they are.  Time geared warriors are adequate for where they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best thing to remember about EQ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't keep up with the Joneses&quot;<br />
<br />
Just concentrate on having fun. The rest will come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Until relatively recently, the &quot;recomended level&quot; on weapons was not actually operational in the game, which meant that you got the full damage rating on any weapon you could equip. That has changed, however, and in some ways made weapons without recommended levels much more valuable for younger characters.<br />
The reason everyone says haste is important that haste increases your aggro. Likewise, low-delay, high-damage weapons do the same thing.<br />
The wurmslayer is slow, but using it at your level is far from a disaster. I say that because at higher levels, the procs on weapons, your AAs and haste become progressively more important components in holding aggro. If you have a lot of plat, haste is available to you now, but procs and AAs are not really a factor for you or anyone else you're grouping with for a while.<br />
Get haste if you can, but whatever your haste, use the next 25 levels or so to learn how to use the other methods available to you for holding aggro. In general, some of these methods are:<br />
1. Be on the lookout for low-delay, relatively high ratio one-hand weapons.<br />
2. Use your taunt key well. For a long time we've been under the assumption that a successful taunt put you at the top of the mob's aggro list, plus 1. Recent tests discussed on this board have indicated there is a possibility that taunt has a cummulative aggro component--some set amount of hate. However, I think your best bet is to avoid punching the taunt button when it refreshes, provided that the mob is already hitting you. Save taunt for when the mob stops hitting you and starts hitting someone else in your group.<br />
3. Slam or kick the mob every chance you get. It will be a while before you face mobs that have a dangerous riposte, so use these special attacks whenever they refresh. Two exceptions to this: If you are a large race, and can slam, note that slam will interrupt casting mobs, and it will stop running mobs for a round or two. If you are in a group with classes that can stop running mobs, then the timing on your slam is not that critical; but if no one can stop a running mob, sometimes slamming them at the moment they start to run can help (marginally) prevent a mob from reaching some of its friends before it dies. On casting mobs, you may want to time your slam so that it has a chance of interrupting the mobs' spell casting.<br />
4. Hit the mobs early. The group member who hits the mob first has a head start on aggro. Warriors have limited tools for pulling, but learn to pull as well as you can, and get a good bow. If you are not pulling, make sure you have an assist hotkey, and try to position yourself so that you can &quot;tag&quot; incoming mobs with an arrow before they get to camp. At minimum, it will put you on the hate list behind the puller, and sometimes it will cause the mob to turn on you.<br />
5. Use the provoke/incite line. It is really a great tool for aggro. The three best tools you have in early levels for aggro control are good weapons, provoke, and the taunt button.<br />
6. Always try to be as close as possible to the mob you are fighting. Proximity aggro is seldom a critical factor at your level, but it never hurts. Start getting in the habit of using every single tool available to you.<br />
7. Be aware of who is in your group, and where all the mobs are and who is getting hit. All the aggro tools in the game won't help a tank who simply fails to notice that two mobs are killing his cleric. Stupid casters can get themselves killed no matter what you do, but it should always be a goal of the main tank that no caster dies before you do: it should be very very difficult for a mob to kill anyone in your group without killing you first. If the healer in your group dies in a fight and you live through it, you should analyze what happened and what you could do differently in the future to prevent that from happening.<br />
8. Understand how crowd control works, especially Mez and root. <br />
9. When you hit 30, set up a hotkey for /shield. Find out how it works, and use it when you lose aggro to a groupmate who cannot take much damage. I happen to believe that in addition to it's main function, /shield has an aggro-generating component, but I haven't done any testing on it. Nevertheless, it is a nice tool whether or not it generates hate for you.<br />
10. I'm probably forgetting something. Find out whatever it is that I'm forgetting, and work on that too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weapon delay doesn't affect your proc rate. Just the natural proc rate of the weapon, dex, weapon affinity AA, and combat effects do. Wanted to clear that up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Graize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Okay, this is my link. I'm not great with using magelo yet but I put in what I could.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">concentrate on haste atm and leave everything else alone.<br />
<br />
i would reccomend silver chitin handwraps for ~5000 platinum.  your gear is vastly better than anything i ever had at your age (got my first wurmslayer at 43), so what you have will defenitely tide you over till after you've saved enough for the wraps.<br />
<br />
you seem to have had some help on the fabled mobs.  do you have higher lv friends?  if so they can help you out in camping any of this stuff or even making some plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Graize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have help yes, my stepdad has a few characters that he helps me out with. A 65 pally, and 45 Beastlord. <br />
<br />
We are on the same account atm though so in order for me to get anything that is no drop, I have to be camped nearby, and he has to log, relog on my character, and loot.<br />
<br />
As for expansions, we have them all. Are there any quests or things of that nature I or my stepdad can take part in to help my warrior?<br />
<br />
I know that cobalt gear is useful for the spells, but it has some kind of level restriction on it. My cobalt boots in storage won't trigger yet, wondering when they activate, and also if there is anything useful for me asides from the cobalt gear. Any bit of help is appreciated, and thank you all for the insight into haste.<br />
<br />
Should I give up the stats on my apron for the haste? It seems like I can answer that myself now, but I was wondering on the viewpoints of other. Does the percentage of haste counteract any stat loss, or ac loss in the switch out.<br />
<br />
Graize</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dropable haste usually ends up in the guantlets, belt, or back slots: you'll have to give up something to put haste somewhere. The good news is that you'll be replacing all of these slots eventually, and none of them are hugely superior to the others at the moment. That should leave you free to get the best deal you can find; just look around and start keeping track of what different haste items cost on your server so that you'll know a good deal when you see it.<br />
And I would say that you are intellegently geared right now for your level.<br />
Check posts in library for potential quests. Most quests are more for fun than cost-effective rewards. In addition to contemplating gear, you might think about this: read posts on this site and notice what people say about the things that they've done that have been the most fun. Often they are not what you'd expect: running across Antonica just to see it, for instance. Spend the time to do some of these things.<br />
Go hunt. Don't worry too much about how fast you're leveling (leveling is good, worrying about it is not); work on your character development (skills, etc) and your playing skills.<br />
You're good to go, looks like to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Weapon delay doesn't affect your proc rate. Just the natural proc rate of the weapon, dex, weapon affinity AA, and combat effects do. Wanted to clear that up.<br />
<br />
Yes but if you aren't hitting anything, you aren't procing.  I did say simply put....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes but if you aren't hitting anything, you aren't procing. I did say simply put.... <br />
<br />
This is false as well.  You can and will proc on misses all the time.<br />
<br />
Now, second, don't let anyone tell you differently -- at 27, the wurmslayer owns every other weapon out there, both for damage, and for aggro.  Keep it until at least 40-45-50 range, because there's not going to be squat you can be using that will serve you better.  Just because people like to make little rules for everything doesn't mean there's not exceptions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You men make things so complicated.  Sometimes I think you like to argue for the sake of arguing.  I wasn't talking about when you were attacking with that statement!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you've just been hit with the Haass Effect. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wasn't talking about when you were attacking with that statement! <br />
<br />
Yes but if you aren't hitting anything, you aren't procing. I did say simply put.... <br />
<br />
Okay, how about we play a game called &quot;Coherent thought&quot; because I'm not following yours here.  I've read your posts about 10 times now and I still can't figure out what the hell you're trying to say.  All I know is that it sounds like you're wrong.<br />
<br />
Haste does not effect aggro generation via procs.  You do not have to hit to proc.  Swinging faster will not make you proc more.  <br />
<br />
So, if that's not what you're saying, then what ARE you saying, because I'm not seeing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'll try the KISS approach.  You do have to be attacking to proc!  This means that even if you are missing you are attacking!  Haste helps you hit OR miss faster.  While this does not affect proc rate per se, if you aren't attacking you won't proc!<br />
<br />
So I can hear the question now, &quot;Well then what does haste matter at all if you aren't attacking?&quot;  I don't know about you, but when I'm slowed, I can lose agro.  You know, you get slowed just as the wizard has that 6K crit that really tees off the mob.  As the mob begins to beat up on the wizzie, and I'm sitting there looking for all intents and purposes like I've turned off the attack button, I'm franctically shouting &quot;I'm slowed, RC please!&quot;, hitting the incite and then taunt button praying that I do not see &quot;You have failed to taunt your target.&quot;  Then the cleric lands a heal on the wizzie and the mob decides that the cleric is a nusiance.  Again you shout &quot;I'm slowed, RC please!&quot;!&quot;, hitting the incite and then taunt button praying that I do not see &quot;You have failed to taunt your target.&quot;  Then the cleric says &quot;I have not bought remove curse yet.&quot;  You would be surprised how many times I've heard that.  More than once is once too many.  As I sit there laughing hysterically, we wipe.  I do not have an earthshaker to help me out in that situation.  <br />
<br />
Oh and it doesn't just have to be that you are slowed.  No, no, no.  I do so love that wonderful FD proc of the warrior ocean giants in PoS.  I don't know about you, but in that split second that it takes me to realize that I'm lieing flat on my back and not attacking, I can lose agro.  Then there's Auliffe Chaoswind in BoTs SE tower.  As he takes me on that joyful spin and I'm not attacking, sometimes, in the time it takes me to sit and stand up again, I can lose agro.<br />
<br />
One of these days maybe I too will never again have to worry about attacking to proc and keep agro.  Then it won't matter if I have haste or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">See Graize?<br />
You probably thought your thread was being hijacked, but no: the secret to holding aggro with your weapons is to remember to turn on autoattack! <br />
That's right: with one simple keystroke, you can vastly improve the aggro of any weapon, and the beauty of it is that this is true whether or not the weapon procs and it works at all levels of the game!<br />
Strategies like turning on autoattack...you just can't get that kind of advice anywhere, you know.<br />
<br />
Nor is this mere speculative theory on my part. It's hard-won knowledge that comes of experience on the field of battle.<br />
Two nights ago I was playing on a 52 War doing several LDoNs in a row and all was going okay, typical grind, bard is doing a very workman like job of single pulling and we're plowing the mobs and about 2 a.m. the bard came in with pull number 6 billion or so &amp; I assist bard/turn off autoattack/tag mob with arrow, mob's  on top of us but still following bard so I hit taunt &amp; provoke, mob's on me, I get mob positioned so pets are at its back, hum dee dum, hum dee dum, grrrrr beastlord ganks my aggro, taunt mob back onto me, hum dee--grrr necro ganks aggro!!!! RED ALERT CASTER GETTING HIT!, run over, /shield necro...notice stupid taunt button and provoke buttons are still grey, grrrr necro still getting hit...<br />
And then I had one of those thoughts that really separate Uber warriors like me from n00b losers who can't keep aggro: &quot;Oh. Maybe it would help if I turned on autoattack?&quot;<br />
And it worked! I got aggro, mob got killed, necro lived (assuming necros are actually alive in the first place).<br />
Spent a couple of minutes hoping that everyone else in the group had &quot;others hits/misses&quot; turned off so maybe they missed that little demonstration of brilliance.<br />
<br />
edit: changed &quot;pets are at it's back&quot; to &quot;pets are at its back.&quot; Because proper punctuation is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I actually laughed pretty hard after reading your reply Brabble.  I generally don't try to dispense advice because there's always someone that will try and find something wrong with it.  So this whole thread got my dander up.  Thank you for giving me that laugh, I needed it.  Rant off now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I might also recommend when you get a few levels ahead that your start doing LDoNs. There is GREAT gear available there, the experience is pretty good and you gain invaluable group experience.<br />
<br />
Ooka</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ah, I see.  There is apparantly a common sense factor that's missing here.<br />
<br />
You do have to be attacking to proc! This means that even if you are missing you are attacking! Haste helps you hit OR miss faster. While this does not affect proc rate per se, if you aren't attacking you won't proc! <br />
<br />
This right here, goes in the &quot;no shit&quot; file.<br />
<br />
Oh and it doesn't just have to be that you are slowed. No, no, no. I do so love that wonderful FD proc of the warrior ocean giants in PoS. I don't know about you, but in that split second that it takes me to realize that I'm lieing flat on my back and not attacking, I can lose agro <br />
<br />
Interesting thing about the &quot;feign death&quot; spell....it makes mobs think that you are dead, THUS REMOVING YOU FROM THE TOP OF THE HATE LIST.  Once again, this is in the &quot;no shit&quot; file.<br />
<br />
One of these days maybe I too will never again have to worry about attacking to proc and keep agro. Then it won't matter if I have haste or not. <br />
<br />
Please raise your hand if you can hold aggro without turning on attack.<br />
<br />
Anyone?<br />
<br />
Shut up Pally.<br />
<br />
Anyone else?<br />
<br />
Ya, that's what I thought.<br />
<br />
Seriously, are you on medication or something?<br />
<br />
I'll leave you with something else you may not know.  Wearing armor helps you take damage better.  Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
