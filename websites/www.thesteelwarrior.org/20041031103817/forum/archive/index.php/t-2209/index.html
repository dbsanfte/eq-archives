<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tsebach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been forced to take a bit of time off EQ due to work travel (last played about 5 weeks ago), and since then a few new nifty weapons have hit norrath.  I have read about the Bloodsworn and Copper hammer in regards to each other as a combo, and to other weapons.  But how do these fit in to an arsenal that already includes the red blade?  I would have no problems with replacing the MESS that I currently have in my offhand with one of these (most likely the Bloodsworn, as I am partial to swords. ;)).  But should it stay offhand, or would I be better off putting the red epic offhand?  The delay on either the hammer or the bloodsworn is better than the red, but does that make up for the lack of a direct hate proc?  Or am I better off bagging the epic altogether and getting both?  (I doubt it, but I'm interested in hearing opinions).  Obviously I'd like to get them and test them out myself, unfortunately I don't have that luxury at this time.  Any input would be much appreciated. :)<br />
<br />
Definitely a very cool thing to see the weapon choice get broadened a bit, though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aratus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use Bloodsworn in mainhand, red epic in offhand. Bloodsworn procs like a gatling cannon and the red epic usually follows up afterwards. What I like about the Bloodsworn more than the Copper Hammer is that it can stun those 55+ mobs. Been fighting casters a lot lately and it procs reliably enough to interupt. With that said... the Copper Hammer procs equally as much, so just get both and bag the epic whenever you run into FR mobs. = )<br />
<br />
I've dualed the Sword/Hammer in different hands, and overall, Hammer/Sword mainhand, red epic offhand works best for me. When the red epic isn't resisted that is, still... the stun procs'll get you enough attention on their own. Results will vary of course, but that's just my take on it. = )</div></div><hr />

maybe iam wrong but when i asked a few days ago some people in this forum say me that the &quot;/65&quot; in the description from the sword means that you cant stun mobs with lev 65+. <br />
<br />
The copper hammer dont have this &quot;/65&quot; so i think ther is also a chance to stun mobs with lev 65+<br />
<br />
is this correct ? -iam wrong ?<br />
anybody have tested it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tsebach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I am not mistaken, the standard rule is that mobs over 55 cannot be stunned by normal spells.  The &quot;/65&quot; is there as a sort of override of this rule.  Thus, the hammer, not having that override, cannot stun mobs over 55, whereas the sword can do so up to 65.<br />
<br />
Once again, my recent EQ experience has been completely vicarious and through the posts on this board, so I could be off the mark here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Buldan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've yet to fight a beasty above 55 where I did not get the &quot;This creature is immune to the stun portion of your spell&quot; message with the hammer.  Of course, it could be where I'm fightin.   Whereas the bloodsworn sword seems to land just fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tsebach is right, mobs 55+ are immune to normal stuns. You have to have a special PoP stun to even have a chance at stunning those mob. However, even if you are getting the immune message, the stun still pisses the mob off.<br />
<br />
As to the original question, that's a tough call. If you did not have your epic yet, I would recommend the sword/hammer combo and sell your epic pieces for some other upgrades. Since you have already spent the jillion hours getting it, you might consider epic offhand, which ever you can get easiest main hand.<br />
<br />
If it where me, I would still go for the 2 stun weapons. I have never had any problems keeping agro over the gorup of 65s my warrior tanks for, and the few times I have had the opportunity to compare with an epic warrior, I was highly unimpressed with their ability to hold agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i was down in droga over the weekend and my friend let me try his copper hammer out with my red blade...<br />
the thing is pretty damn good; i think it's going to replace my blue blade pretty soon ( well, as soon as i can make it down to the king area that is ).<br />
the red epic still worked wonders for aggro for me there ( red/blue combo )...and kept aggro off the wizard, shammy, and the freakin 300aa 65th level rangerboy in the group who was pushing out a lot of DPS.</div></div><hr />
