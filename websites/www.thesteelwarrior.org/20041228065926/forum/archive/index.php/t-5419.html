Have all defensive AA except LR or ID.  Which one should I get first or does it matter?<br />
<br />
I have 15 AA banked and heard that GOD will have a new AA that will give warriors an additional 500 hp.  Would I be better off getting the hp first then LR or ID?<br />

<br />
LR / better avoidance has the small advantage of more misses = less procs from mobs<br />
<br />
ID / better mitigation has the small advantage of less &quot;spikey&quot; damage<br />
<br />
Think I'd be inclined to get ID/LR before GoD HP AAs (assuming you have all the PoP HP AAs) and if you buy them now you still have time to grind out another 20AA before GoD comes out.</div></div><hr />

Flip a coin.  The thing I want to know is how much it's going to cost for one rank of that hp.  That 15 AA might only get you one rank as far as I've heard they cost alot.</div></div><hr />

I know we can proc on a miss. I assumed mobs could too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Innate procs can not proc on a miss.<br />
Weapon procs can proc on a miss.<br />
<br />
So if a mob is wielding a weapon with a proc, that proc can go off on a miss, but any of the mobs innate abilities can not.</div></div><hr />

Neither your average EXP/LDoN group nor our guild raids (when they do happen, lol) are encounters that require tight CH wheels.<br />
<br />
Go for LR5.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelen</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also did LR first, if a mob doesn't hit you, it can't stun you.  Less stuns = good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets say LR5 = 1% more hits avoided<br />
Lets say ID5 = 1% shaved off each hit<br />
Overall they will have the same benefit.<br />
<br />
Now take 5 hits that will get you to low hp agro.<br />
<br />
Reduce them by 1% ... Probably low remain hp agro<br />
<br />
Have a 1% chance to avoid each hit .... <br />
With luck you may avoid one of the hits<br />
<br />
That one will be the one that will keep you alive.<br />
<br />
Both are necessary, for a non MT LR is better (augments streaks)<br />
For a MT ID is better (less streaky)</div></div><hr />

I can't find the thread now but I remember there being 5 ranks costing 4AA each.  Of course, this can all change before launch in 2 weeks.  Raw HP is the most important stat for any warrior IMO.  It should always be maxed first before any other AA is considered.<br />
<br />
I also agree with the others that posted that LR is more important than ID.  Both is best over time but you get a bigger bang for the buck with LR IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to think that LR first is very slightly better than ID, for all the reasons listed here.  Note that the difference either provides is small, but when combined with the other defensive aa's adds up to a significant boost.<br />
<br />
ankesilke, it is my understanding the the hitpoint aa in GoD has a progression of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 for a total of 60 aa's for 500 hp's.  I hope that get's tuned down a little.</div></div><hr />

Everyone has their own ideas, but I've gone with CA, CS, and PE before finishing the hp aa's.  I've got all of those except CS3 and it seems getting CA3, CS2, and PE did more for my tanking ability then ND3.  Don't get me wrong, hp is critical, but warriors also need to be able to mitigate damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did LR first too, but don't act as if it's obviously a better choice than ID.  It's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Rogue (and we are talking pre-elemental 1350AC/6400HP in usual buffs) I can tank shocking things with LR5.  If I have a healer I can still get through lots of situations when the group's tank dies.  It's messy (no taunt, no Incite, no AEtoys) but I can tank if absolutely needed.<br />
<br />
To a raiding Warrior though, I would think to spend points pretty evenly.  A path that went CS1, CA1, PE, CS2, CA2 etc would probably not be a bad one.  You die on spikes, not on a curve.  I die (to main targets) on anything, so evading part of a quad 1800 probably will keep me upright, while mitigating that to 1650s won't.  Those of ya that are getting a CH chain though are far more reliant on that NO QUAD x.ys!!! than anything else.  In other words, don't get one-rounded.  Avoidance might seen like a good answer but that's more exp-group really.  AC/Mitigation is what kills long fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I finished LR5 before starting on ID, but thats because I like to finish up AAs I start on before starting on new ones. <br />
<br />
Alternating between LR and ID is most likely just as good, if you prefer that way, a matter of taste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow--60 AA.  They must be on some major drugs at Sony HQ.  If it costs that much, I am thinking no one will buy it.  I currently have 122 AA now and it took me a long time to get that since I don't grind every day.  60 AA for 500 measly hitpoints is a joke considering a typical experience mob hits at least that hard on average.  Make it 2000 hp for 60 AA and then perhaps it might be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plenty of people will buy it.  Look at some of the magelos on high end guilds...300, 400, 500aa's.  Those people don't have shit left to buy.<br />
<br />
Will it stay 60AA's?  Depends on how many other AA's end up being shipped with it.  They need to keep dangling the carrot in front of your face you know...and 60AA's for a meager 500hp is gonna be the big test of how many more expansions they can keep selling everyone.</div></div><hr />
