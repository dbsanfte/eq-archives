<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kheldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have an anger III auged BoC for my primary.  I currently use a copper hammer for my off-hand.  I am an aggro control freak posing as a warrior, so I am looking to upgrade that off-hand.  I have a very busy and erratic work schedule so raids are not an option, the upgrade has to be either bazaar or ldon (I know GBoS is fairly trivial to get, but I simply can't raid)<br />
<br />
Choices:<br />
<br />
(a) Augment the copper hammer.  That gives me a double proc, but offhand proc rates are pretty low to begin with.  I don't like the dps from its 13/20 but the primary concern is aggro.<br />
<br />
(b) Build myself an LDoN weapon with either club of the mad researcher or the dagger and aug it with anger III and +2 damage.  That would be good offhand dps coupled with a decent proc.  The downside is that its a lot of LDoN points and would only be single proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Option B if you can afford the time invested. It'll be a better overall weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Option B but Curse Smelted Longblade from Guk- auged to 16/19 anger3.<br />
<br />
BF graphic&gt; Goranga Club graphic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kheldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know that warriors are down the road to recovery when we can start to concern ourselves with dps and appearance again...<br />
<br />
So what does the sword look like?  Got a pic or analogy.<br />
<br />
I am leaning towards option B, I think the higher dps will help smooth out aggro in between procs.  It will be a long road, and GoD will be out by the time I have the points, so I can always reconsider if better and readily obtainable weapons come out.</div></div><hr />

Man sad to say but this is true.  I have the club and I am really starting to despise the graphic....it *wears* on you over time</div></div><hr />

Like Bloodfrenzy or Tae Ew Longsword</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">on a side note, having a 15 damage offhand weapon really does help the agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">(I know GBoS is fairly trivial to get, but I simply can't raid)Can you get 2 groups of friends together? Auliffe is a push over once you get the hang of the fight. You could be in and out in under an hour with a little practice. Shouldn't be too hard to get people to go - leather ornate BPs fetch a pretty good amount of pp.<br />
<br />
Augmenting a GBoS is not only cheaper than building an LDoN 1hers, but you get 2 procs rather than 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">eindried drops the GBoS, personally, i think he's easier.</div></div><hr />
