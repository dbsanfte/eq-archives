<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">someone needs to edit this guys posts or something. He has some nasty porn that is linked in every one of his posts that he has made.<br />
<br />
Can a mod please get rid of that before someone gets a sickening eye full, and possibly lose a job or something if caught surfing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HOLY SHIT.... I made the mistake of looking back on this.  I doubt he did this on purpose... but please step up killing his sig for the time being.<br />
<br />
I also took the time to look at url it's linked out too.... yeah, I'm saying someone set him up the bomb.<br />
<br />
Also just thought bout this for a sec.... he sig was a down about 10 minutes before I saw this post, and then his sig came back up so mysteriously after I don't see him on user list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Working on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I removed the sigs on his last 75 posts, all I had time for on my lunch hour.  Hopefully before long Raaj or Shorty can log on and edit his sig.  In the mean time, be careful opening older threads if you're at work.<br />
<br />
He is banned also.  The fact that it happened right after I mentioned that his old sig was too big leads me to believe that it was no accident.  If it was somebody messing with him, well he can thank them for getting him banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Brutul. <br />
<br />
It's a shame that this level of immaturity has to be taken on a wonderful board such as this and i hope that no one got in trouble by viewing this crap or is scarred for life, lol.<br />
<br />
hopefully Raaj can break his sig for good and eliminate this altogether. Thanks for taking your offtime to clean up a little of this mess Brutul. I'm sure everyone appreciates it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">p.s. just a heads-up, sometimes people try and rip-off sigs from places like somethingawful.com and other popular sites, and the site will re-direct the image to something nasty.<br />
<br />
It happened on the Drinal boards to someone that everyone thinks is funny. Had to be one of the most hilarious moments ever.<br />
<br />
The best part was he was trying to make fun of someone on the boards with typical homosexual-stupid talk and when he posted his sig it was a giant Phallus LOLOLOLOLOL...<br />
<br />
Don't think I have ever seen anyone blush over the internet before, but this was pretty close.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OH GOD **barf**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Would be easy to go out there and see what he linked to. But I must say, I was curious, so I went looking and O M G  I am damaged for life.<br />
<br />
Sivok has takin 50000k damage from site of ugly old woman<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OMG no rocker for me just shot me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">...site of ugly old woman  Okay, I was curious before, but this gives me the idea I shouldn't go looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Go with that thought Kaesorn :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">*resists every urge to go look at this now*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think it should be gone from all of his sigs now.  Send me a PM if you really want to know what it was (you don't).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is really nasty, a fun prank to pull (if you know someone wont get fired, or uh... you know it's in a private place or they wont get too mad ;)  )<br />
<br />
<br />
Drop me a PM if you really really need to see it. I would hardly reccoment it though /em goes to barf.<br />
<br />
Thanks brutul for removing it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks but no thanks i like my job :D Would rather not be run out of it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ya'll don't wanna see.... trust me.  /shudder<br />
<br />
And I was sitting in the middle of class when I saw it.... I think the girl next did a double take on it though. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">remember the mummy returns? think of his wife...... nude..... (vomits some more)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">O_o what was it like an over 80 p0rn site?! That's just fricken wrong!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It wasn't a site, just a series of pictures in his sig.  It really was disgusting, and even though some are curious, all of you would wish we didn't describe it afterwards.  /stabs daggers through his eyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">ROFL  exactly hussar<br />

__<br />
O_o what was it like an over 80 p0rn site?! That's just fricken wrong!!<br />
__<br />
<br />
more like over 120</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thaak2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just wanted to add that the image itself was changed, not the URL.<br />
<br />
My host apparently got mad at the bandwidth I was causing and edited the pic... with something grotesque.<br />
<br />
I'm sure an admin can verify that I hadn't edited anything in my sig.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for what happened, just wanted to clear some things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree with him, whoever the bandwidth hosting site is, they did something similar over on the Triton Boards of a guy who was hosting Brittany Spears pics.<br />
<br />
You can even tell it is the same, because they use that weird one picture a little lower than the one to its left, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">you got hosed thaak...good lord man we were all running for cover when granny &quot;whipped them out&quot;.</div></div><hr />

remember the mummy returns? think of his wife...... nude..   You probably mean the first one, &quot;The Mummy&quot;...in the second one his wife is reincarnated as some young woman that probably looks mighty good nude. :D<br />
<br />
The first one was where she was still mummified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">oh your right lol my mistake, dont take of the bandages!!! my god!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The question I'm wondering was... WHERE DID ALL THE SKIN COME FROM? Was she really fat... and then became an anorexic and turned 120 in a week?<br />
That picture nearly made me barf, but I had some ham and I was all good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If I found someone leeching my server bandwidth with sig pics i'd sick the goatman on them. Be warned, leeching is bad!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Val please don't tell me how you know this &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Val is right, it's just because as you get older your skins elasticity decreases.<br />
<br />
But the part that scares me most... who the hell would take those pictures, or even want to see them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">It's called elderly relatives and i can extrapolate just fine from naked arms thanks :p</div></div><hr />
