<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>resiw33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im looking for a gate or teleport weapon other than the ot hammer ( as i am good). I know of the gate talisman and potions but am only 55 and dont have the plat to blow or the ability to get the talisman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spend about 2 hours and 200pp and work up pottery to 132 skill. From there you can make Thurg gate potions for about 50-100pp each if you buy all the components in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I hate tradeskills, but I made a point to get my pottery up just for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thurg gate potions are the best choice imo.  Very cheap, and pottery is easy to raise.<br />
<br />
It is possible to get the OT hammer as a good race though.  If your guild is capable of Fear golems (or if you get money later), you can try to get Puppet Strings.  They are 10 charges of a charm spell that works on the OT gate hammer quest giver.  If possible, it would be best to bring along shaman / chanter / bard to fully debuff his mr so he has less chance of resisting (being higher level helps also).  Then all you have to do is turn in a jade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Knikanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heck, they are free...go kill spiders in velks or go to CC and kill spiders and orcs.  All the silks and velium you need!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could do the Clockwork Talisman quests.<br />
Thurg gate.<br />
OT hammer.<br />
Buy gate potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its a bit tedious, But if a mage has the spell he can summon a necklace with 1 charge of Gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whats the name of the spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it's a level 61 or 62 spell called Summon:Talisman of Return.<br />
<br />
Some mages won't have it because they are under the mistaken impression that it is worthless, but make friends with the ones that have it. And be sure to have Quintessence of Knowledge on you as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>resiw33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i guess my question is there another hammer type object like a thurg hammer or something like that.. or is the ot hammer the only one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OT hammer is the only one with unlimited charges, and the only procing one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The problem with the mage spell (Talisman of Return) is that the summoned talisman is no rent, so you have to get a new one every time you either use it or log out.<br />
<br />
Also, it requires Quintessence of Knowledge which (unless they have changed it recently to be a vendor buy) requires a shaman to make it anyway, and it takes about 100pp in components.<br />
<br />
So... to use the mage gate, you have to find a shaman to make Quintessence of Knowledge  for you.  You need to carry these with you.  And then you have to find a mage to summon the talisman for you every time you play.<br />
<br />
So, you can either find a shaman and buy gate potions, or you cvan find a shaman and buy Quintessence of Knowledge , and then find a mage to summon a talisman of return.  <br />
<br />
Why add the extra step?  It's not any cheaper, as Potions to Bone Field cost the same as Quintessence of Knowledge .<br />
<br />
As others have said, thurg potions are the way to go.  Or just buy shaman potions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klomck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I carry &quot;potion of the Frost&quot;<br />
most shamans will do the combine for you, components cost &lt;200p per potion. <br />
<br />
the thurg potion would be better, im just not into pottery yet. <br />
<br />
the summoned and quested items require a reagent that is more of a pain IMO to get than the potions. <br />
<br />
If i ever run across &quot;puppet strings&quot; ill do the OT hammer turn in, i hear the only mob close to the port in is lt blue or green to 60+. <br />
<br />
there really should be similar items for good races, but what can we do? ? ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luczifer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As said all shammy potions and mage's amulets are expensive...<br />
Sit and calm down for 1,5 - 2 hours in Thurga bank, all vendors ya need are in same place like pottry wheel and kiln, work and get 122 skill in pottery. Then make Thruga gate potions on ya will.<br />
Support for supplies - go to CC (Chrystal Caverns) all greenies for 55-60+ and farm small bricks and pieces of velium, then proceed to spiders tunnel, get spider cryst silks, and back to thurgadin.<br />
And start to make ya thurga vials (i hv some 8 vials rdy all time)<br />
After using it, talk dorf girl, get new replacement and combine ya vial and velium pieces and never leave thurga without gate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The OT hammer is very doable by any race good or bad with any amount of bad faction.  You can kill sarnak berzerkers for their braids and bank many many many of them untill bank is full.  Im talking hundreds.  Then get an Erudite Illusion in OT by potion or Chanter.  Walk into bank fill bags with braids and turn them in.  A bank full of these will take a max KoS to Apprehensive.  Then you can work it up from there without illusion.  I myself was already Aprehensive and did just 20 turn in's(80) braids and hit Amiable turned in my jade and bingo got hammer.  You can do it, it just takes alot of patience.  Took me 5 hours to get 80 braids.</div></div><hr />
