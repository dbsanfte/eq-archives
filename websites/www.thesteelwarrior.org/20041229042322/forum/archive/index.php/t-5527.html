damage * 10 + db = max normal crit @<br />
<br />
that will get you in the ballpark, without going into all the decimals. dunno the mutiplier on crips</div></div><hr />

<br />
I notice that my max hit is much lower when my strength isn't maxed.</div></div><hr />

max hit with 31/30 (GSoT) is 219 and crit is 355 if i recall correctly.<br />
<br />
This was with max strength of 280 (I haven't done planer power aa yet).<br />
<br />
With my normal unbuffed str of 205 my epic hits for about 205 max and GSoT for about 179 max.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can guarantee that's wrong.  Windblade max hit at 61 is 325, no way a 38 damage weapon can hit for 404, unless it's fuckin 38/150.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellisand</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was reading wrong colum crits max out at 404 and and crips seem to round out at 677, so equaions are close</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea i just rounded for quick math. <br />
<br />
i get 219 max normal and 355 crit with gsot at 305 str as well<br />
<br />
oops should have rounded down 5.9 and up 10.3 gets better results</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the crit formula doesnt seem to work for 1h weapons. i know that my BF (16d 13db) has crit for over 200 before. the non crit damage is pretty close tho, 108. formula says 109 with a multiplier of 6, and 107.4 with a multiplier of 5.9<br />
the margin of error was a little closer when i used the crit formula for my GSot4W caculating out to 444, where the actual max crit was 455 and the non crit formula was 2 off at 280 as opposed to the 278 it actually hits for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try killing some old world newbie mobs, your max hit will be slightly higher than normal.<br />
<br />
Crit multiplier is 1.71 btw. I have absolutely no idea why.</div></div><hr />

Thanks I have been wondering how it works my self for a bit, but when I did the math the number were off by just a few.  How does str effect the max dmg?  <br />
<br />
Using a GSWH 35/28 DB 35 even w/o max str my max hit is still 242 and max crit is still 395.  I only have CF2 and am 1 aa from CF3.  Would getting Fury of the Ages effect my max crit dmg or just the amout of times I crit?  <br />
<br />
Another question I have is how does atk rating effect the number of times you land a crit?  W/ a atk of 1600+ (SoT/SoP/FA/Focus/Diaku/AoH) I crit more often but not that it is majorly noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">str effects the frequency of how often you'll score a hit for max damage. it doens not allow your weapon to hit any harder. str raises your attack, which raises the adverage damage you hit for. so (for example) if your adverage hit is for 60s with 205 str (i'm making these numbers up), your adverage hit with 305 str will be 80.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep not perfect, since log only displays whole numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ehh, not from my experience. I always get higher max hits when I'm at full strength.<br />
<br />
With GSoT I have never hit for 219 (max hit for that weapon) with a strength of 205.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i probably wasnt clear in my explination. when your attack (str) is raised, you'll hit harder more often, but, every weapon can only hit so hard. so...if your hitting harder, you have a better chance to hit for the max damage more often. str doenst directly effect damage, it effects your atk, which does directly effect your damage. perhaps some one else who understands what i getting at they can put it together in better words. i never was very good at wording things they way i mean to explain it.</div></div><hr />
