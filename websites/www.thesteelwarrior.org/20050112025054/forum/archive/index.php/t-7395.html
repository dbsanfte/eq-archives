<br />
So what is the next logical step after the CHoS? (purchased)  I am not much of a raider atm so my chances of a nice no drop aren't great.  1hs, 1hb or piercing.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get an sotb. If you already have it, the next logical step will be CHSD / GBoS or if you're rich a BoC. Just my $0.02, I'm currently trying to upgrade mine :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rakaul</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sotb= sword of the bloodsworn?  got that one.  Man I hate all these acronyms.  Its worse than the ones at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, thats the one. <br />
<br />
fwiw<br />
GBoS = Great Blade of Storms which drops from Eindride Icestorm in BoT. <br />
BoC = Blade of Carange, which is dropable from the Avatar of War in Kael and runs 300-400k in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Fact is the droga comba, aka CHoS + SoTB is a good combo, especially when augged.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh,common buyable stuff <br />
<br />
1)SOTB- other half of the droga combo.I farmed my CHOS/SOTB in a Droga group at 60 btw if you'd rather get it yourself.Not sure if it'd be busy on your server ,it was mostly empty at the time on Stromm.It's arguable ,but, I found it to be a little less aggro than the CHOS.Close though,  a good match that could serve well until eb weapons especially with augs.<br />
<br />
2)BOC-Alot more expensive and probably extravagent if you're not raiding and pre ep.Still ,aggro is key to having fun has a warrior.If you can afford it I'd get one.<br />
Better aggro than any other buyable weapon imo.<br />
<br />
3)DPS weapons.Not my personal choice - 2 aggro procs per weap &gt; 1.However, I know some ep warriors who do well with a3 auged, good ratio weapons.<br />
<br />
Attainable Raid stuff?<br />
<br />
1)GBOS- Bot tower raids sometimes go pickup.Heavier friends could drop this for you as well.Good weapon a smidgen less aggro than a BOC imo.Last you forever or until time with the BOC.<br />
<br />
2)CHSD-POI dragon Xanamech,another common pickup target I think.Er... if there's anything common about pick-up raids where you are.I used this with my CHOS until I got a Bloodfrenzy.A little better than CHOS imo.Again debateable.<br />
<br />
3)Blackout- Sometimes gets passed to bidding for guests on ssra raids.A good underrated aggro weapon that is a little unusual .Close to the CHSD in aggro I think.</div></div><hr />

not as good as a BoW but i would rate it better than droga weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shirmar</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i keep running into people that do not know about the weapons you can get doing LDoN's so if you didnt know here goes: You can get a 1hb 15/20 75hp 15 agi in EF adv for 1150 points, now take that and do 1150 points in NRO adv to get the dmg 2 aug to make it a 17/20 weapon then back to EF to add a anger3 aug (600 to agro proc) then you still have a type 1 aug slot to fill with maybe a sta,agi or other aug so at the end you get a 17/20 75hp with anger3 proc.<br />
<br />
Next weapon is from SRO adv for 1150 points 1hs 14/19 75 hps and do the same as the first with the augs and you now have a 16/19 75hps anger3 proc weapon.<br />
<br />
Now i know this is alot of adventures to do but in the end you get 2 weapons with a better ratio than a BoC with not that much more less on the agro proc and all it took was time no cash! <br />
<br />
JFI if ya didnt know already enjoy.</div></div><hr />

2 procs are better than one ... and only 1 proc is the crutch of ldon weps</div></div><hr />

I was wondering this myself with those new velium gemmed weapons.  Think they are 15 or 16 dmg with 20 delay and fairly affordable but no proc.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutonius</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The velium gemmed weapons have two aug slots, a type 4 and a type 7.  So with that you could get an anger proc for the type 4 and there are also type 7 proc augs that drop in GoD zones that would give you the double proccing weapon.<br />
<br />
The only problem with this is as far as I know the easily attainable type 7 procs are only DD, so you wouldn't be generating as much aggro as if you had two aggro procs going.<br />
<br />
There may be better type 7 aggro procs in some of the harder GoD zones, but at that point I'd think you'd have better than the velium gemmed weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can you place an a2 and an a3 on the same weapon??<br />
or maybe an a3 and a3 on the same??<br />
<br />
if you can will they both proc for you as they would have different proc ratio or is the proc ratio for the weapon and then it chooses one to go off in effect not making it any better then if you just had one proc??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, Mongrul --<br />
<br />
It all depends on the slots your weapon has. If you have slot 4 and slot 7, you need to find an anger augmentation that is type 7. As far as I know, none of that type has been found yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i got my gbos in a 3 group guild raid and it seemed pretty easy at the time. it leads to my question. how big a pickup group is needed to take this guy down anyway? i know the time required once everyone shows up is only about an hour.<br />
<br />
look .. way back when i did my epic when i was unguilded (druid epic). for the harder fights i begged volunteers to help.<br />
<br />
well the gbos right now is to my warrior what the druid epic is to my druid. its that big an upgrade. and it sure seems easier to recruit two groups of 65 to do that camp than it is to do an ENTIRE epic. heck .. give a 5000pp fee to every person who helps if the sword drops and even that only costs 85k (assuming 3 groups).<br />
<br />
so how many people are required to take on that camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how bout useing the same for 2 aug's that proc a DD then...<br />
<br />
sorry if i seam a noob as i am to the warrior world....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also interested in the effort required to drop eindride icestorm. I know uber level people can take him out with 1 group, as I've seen it done. I have a sneaking suspicion us mere mortals could do it too, with some smart play and a CoD chanter.  I'm looking to try it with 2 ft5 / 100 aa clerics, an 8k/1300 ac warrior, a am3/eq ranger, a CoD + TD3 chanter and 1 other, probably a shaman or bst.<br />
<br />
A hasted jord kjal can dish out close to 1000 dps, which would make eindride's 100k hp into 1.5 minute fight, so defensive will be up the entire time. Given that the only CoD options upstairs are going to be krigers, it would go even faster.<br />
<br />
Conventionally, I know he's been done with 12 people, without using a CoD pet.<br />
<br />
My primary concern is how to handle the breakin. There are several ports that drop right ontop of some krigers, but if theres no more than 2 at  a time it shouldn't be an issue.  Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
there a few a few 1-group success reports on allakhazam, fwiw...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">he has more than 100k hps.<br />
<br />
<br />
with an 8k tank i'm sure you could do it with<br />
<br />
enchanter<br />
warrior<br />
cleric<br />
cleric<br />
shaman<br />
ranger<br />
<br />
the ranger's bow dps wont be too good against icestorm, as you will want to corner tank him for simplicity sake and pet push.<br />
<br />
<br />
if his arrows hit, great, if not ... he's on pet duty.  if youre the only one taking any dmg from him via melee/ae, you should be just fine.  just make sure the shaman gets him slowed relatively early ... and cripples etc to further debuff him would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always figured that those tower bosses had around 400k hit points, but I've never measured it to know for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info. Where would you suggest cornering icestorm? if I recall correctly you can't corner him right at his spawn very easily due to the nearby spawns... I DO know that if you try to do it by the zoneout he's liable to gate and everything goes to heck.<br />
<br />
I've got logs from an icestorm fight somewhere, i'll try and parse it. I agree 100k seems super low, but I had heard that number somewhere before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">charm a kriger once you get up to the top level.  the charmed kriger should give enough dps clearing that repops are never a problem.  if the fight last more than 15 minutes you might as well call if off anyways.  you can corner him very nicely just to the left of his spawn point (facing him).  the corner is a bit buggy in me experience at first, and he will try to pushyou through the wall ... if you walk out of the wall when he starts pushing you in, you shouldnt have any more problems with it .... at least thats the way it has worked for me the last 5 or 6 times i've done it.<br />
<br />
make sure the chanter lines up the pet so it pushes straight into the corner .. same with shaman if he uses his pet (though it wont live for too long).<br />
<br />
if you have your defensive aa's, then at 8k hps i would guess you could tango with him all day with 2 clerics and a shaman to spot heal.  after that, its just a matter of the ranger and ench managing the pet if it breaks and getting it back in there.  krigers charmed and hasted parse out at around 700dps ... closer to 850 if you give them focus and ferine avatar.  at that rate, assuming icestorm has ~400k hps, you should be able to drop him in about 5 or 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
repops shouldnt be an issue as the backpop time is pretty long.  if you set it up right, it is possible to kill icestorm with full pops and no assited aggro.<br />
<br />
in the end its all about placement and mob positioning.  he isnt difficult at all if you can get your casters set up outside the ae where they need not worry.  he hits for 850 in triples and quads ... slowable ... and spends a lot of his time after 50% trying to heal himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just saw your magelo.  with 0 defensive aa's you will have to make sure your clerics are jonny-ontopofit with the heals.  i would reccomend setting up an 8 second chain with the 2 of them.  you may cut it close, but as long as the shaman keeps a heal over time up on you and keeps icestorm slowed, you should be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah... I was just going to comment that I haven't started defensive AA's yet. I'll probably have finished pd3 and possibly ca1+cs1, and auged my chos with a yak, and acquired the stuff on my &quot;next ldon upgrades&quot; alternate profile before I get around to trying eindride. If I can scam a pally into giving me bss and load up on tribute i should get to eindride at about 8200/1400.<br />
<br />
Dang I wish there were more single groupable aggro weapon options... Beyond the GBoS, basically my only other option is to fork out the 350k for a BoC.<br />
<br />
I'd love to try and 1 or 2-group cursed, but I haven't been hearing many reports that make me think it's doable by non-ubers. Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 or 2 group Cursed would be an interesting test.  With decent resists it would still be a little rough to do the cycle in the time required with anything less than EP+ equipment though in my opinion.  Then again, I haven't tried the cycle myself in a heck of a long time (and that was pre-PoP with quite a bit higher numbers).<br />
<br />
It would be amusing to see the results one way or the other though.  Of course, winning and getting a BF to drop are different things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 groups would be ok with ep people with bard resists I think.I'd view him has a raid mob in your position.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could buy off mercenaries to help you get it for far less than that. far far less. heck .. give me 10k and ill come help you. i mean in the off chance im on your server. but you see my point. this weapon is better in my opinion than a BoC. if its no drop status is ever removed the price of the BoC will plumet to 30k within six months. for now treat it like an epic mob and beg coerce armtwist and buy off enough people to get you that weapon.<br />
<br />
and no ... it wont make you the new uberwarrior. it will just be a nice item :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice here guys. I finally was able to beat the farmers to Eindride with 6 (war/clr/clr/shm/brd/enc) and we kicked his ass. He dropped the BP but the bard won it. Oh well. Fight was great fun. I was at 8k/1340 with CA3/CS2/PE fwiw, and one of the clerics was drunk so it was basically a one cleric fight.<br />
<br />
Next time I'd bring a druid instead of the 2nd cleric so we can keep the pet longer and use him to clear, like ya'll suggested.</div></div><hr />
