<br />
          As stated in title I dual Wield SoD's.. I am quite curious to find out what most post 60 warriors that have used a SoD would rather put on it proc wise... Since anger 3 is now 600 points of hate, or soon to be... I think aggro wise 2 Anger 3 augs on my SoD's would lock aggro nicely... DPS wise, 2 ykesha's would do some damage and alittle stun factor in there...<br />
<br />
I might jus get a anger 2 on each, cuz their only 510 points at 400 points of hate, or get the 600 on main, and 400 on secondary...<br />
<br />
Which Augs would you chose for my setup? Thanks for your replies, I greatly appreciate your opinions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Those augmentation procs are lore, can only have one of each, guess Anger 3 and the big Ykesha would work. Or use Anger 2 and 3 and save Ykesha for any twohander you might get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anger 3 was not lore before the patch.  I had it on my BF and BoC and had no problems looting or equipping them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaladen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I were you, I would keep one of SoDs and sell the other, and try to get a Great Blade of Storms, to slap the anger III proc on. SoDs are seriously lacking DPS and with new vendor bought sword, that can be turned into a 16/19 with a proc, SoDs will become more of a novelty item, than anything else. Putting in anger III procs into the SoD, is basically a waste imo, even a CHoS would rival the SoD with an anger III aug, so unless you have plenty of points to burn, I would hold off till you got better weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SoDs are, and will probably remain, the &quot;killer&quot; twink weapon (along with the wavecrasher) for warriors, since they aren't level limited like most of the new weapons... putting an augument on one makes it nodrop, so I'd be careful about spending many AP on something you might have to remove (and lose) later once you upgrade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zondelfinni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the advise about NOT to put a AUG on my SoD's.. And all the upgrade info... However i didnt ask for that advice... I am in a small guild, and i am lucky, very lucky to have what i do... I dont plan on twinking any chars with these weapons, nor do I plan to get rid of them... Yes I would like to upgrade, but no one in out guild groups with anyone outside the guild.. We are growing and will someday build to upgrade staus, maybe.. But if it happens, it wont be for years lol...<br />
<br />
<br />
All I am asking is which Aug's will help me hold the best aggro possible for MY setup... If it adds alittle DPS that is great too... I am quite tired of rangers imbueing procs on there weapons and steelin my aggro with ease...<br />
<br />
Thanks for your replies...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">since it has the dd stun, go with anger 3 on one and guard mirror something cheap on the other for expanded use. then you can decide what to main hand depending on mt or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">O-kay, well, then my advice would be to read the other dozen or so threads about the plusses and minuses of the various proc auguments.  Pretty much covers what you asked for, tho perhaps not in a super concise form.  Still worth reading so you can make an intelligent decision for your own personal situation tho.<br />
<br />
SoDs are nice (I still carry one for the stun/DD), but there's better stuff out there now that's very obtainable.  Maybe pop on a non-magic DD (to work vs. MR mobs better), or one of the newly updated anger procs (unless they get nerfed), but I'd really hesitate to pop a 1k+ aug on an otherwise tradeable weapon.  YMMV tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Finni, my advice as another double sod wielder is ask those who you group with regularly.  Do you hold agro good, or just good for a warrior?  IMO, 2 sods hold agro for an exp group fairly well.  That being the case, I would go with a yak 3 on the primary sod, and the poison 125 (from ruj) for the off hand.  The poison is because its not resisted as much, the yak for the stun agro.<br />
<br />
I know you 2 box with a cleric, so I would so dont go with the guard augment.  Just get bulwark of vie for the cleric.  If you regularly go without a cleric, gaurd for the offhand might be a good option though (as offhand wont proc as much, but a spell that lasts 2 min or so would be constantly refreshed)<br />
<br />
If you feel you could be tanking raids where agro is FAR more important than damage, go with anger 3 on both.  The agro from that setup, I believe, would be... amazing.  Consider, 4 procs a minute from your main hand (2 anarchy and 2 anger 3), and 2 procs a minute from the offhand (1 anarchy and 1 anger3) would give you a super agro lock.<br />
<br />
Shrug, Considering I know you 2 box farm a lot, i would go with the yak3 poison3 setup though.  DPS is just too valuable when the warrior is the dps.</div></div><hr />
