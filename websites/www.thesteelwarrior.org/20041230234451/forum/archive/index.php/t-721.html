<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnawbone</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This weekend I picked up:<br />
Heartspike (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19667) <br />
and am thinking about getting :<br />
Bonebite (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19854) <br />
<br />
The ratios are not great for a 60 warrior, but I was wondering if the proc would be any good at grabbing aggro.<br />
<br />
Miasma (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3801&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
The dot won't be anything special, but that high diseaser counter might be (I have no idea on how much counters add aggro.)<br />
<br />
I currently use a BBoT for aggro while defensive which uses a proc to keep aggro, so would this be an upgrade to it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Better ratio on Heartstrike and Bonebite over your Black Blade.<br />
<br />
I've HEARD it's better aggro too.<br />
<br />
Since you have one, you ought to be able to test it and find out.<br />
<br />
In any event, I do think it is an upgrade to Black Blade of Tormenting, on ratio alone.<br />
<br />
I'm amazed you've got the fortitude to hunt luggalds that long though.<br />
<br />
Impressive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnawbone</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I thought so. It is a situational weapon for me regardless because I already use the Stone-bladed Axe of Dismay when not defensive/evasive, and that's been holding aggro fine on the raids and groups where I get to tank. <br />
<br />
My guild has 3 or 4 regular raid warriors that have better AA and levels for the big stuff, but I tank a lot of small things like VS and a few LoY mini-bosses where aggro isn't hard to hold.<br />
<br />
Took about 5 hours to get 6 flesh (had a cleric going for ring too), but that camp was decent xp at 59. A bit higher gem drop rate and I'd live there for that reason alone.<br />
<br />
Anyway, will test out Heartspike and report on how it does. I'm not too optimistic, but I agree, should be better than the BBoT. I'm just hoping to get really lucky and find a cheap alternative to the Frosty until I can afford it.</div></div><hr />
