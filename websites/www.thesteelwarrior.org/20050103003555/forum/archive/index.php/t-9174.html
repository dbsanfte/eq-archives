The game has lots going for it, but the depth just isn't there yet.  But I'd rather play CoH than go back to EQ, in fact I may clear EQ off both my computers for good this week, I haven't played for months and I'm not missing it.</div></div><hr />

Everyone stop playing CoH or just no posts? I have been tryign it out. energy/invul tanker first but now going claws/regen scrapper. I am really impressed with the game. BUt I have heard the end game gets dull quick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still playing, almost nightly.  Ditto the house defender.  Not much to post about, really.  As far as end game goes, I think they are expecting City of Villains to cover a lot of that ground, although they are also bringing more trials, monsters and zones as well.  But at the moment (and we're in our 30's) there isn't a lot that I see after 50th level.  Issue 2 is getting a lot of howls about bugs, but we've liked the changes a bunch.<br />
<br />
It's never been the sort of game that took a lot of research/discussion to figure out.  I suspect that that will not change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really enjoy the progression of the character build up. Still very impressed with graphic smoothness. Scrapper got level 10 last night. <br />
<br />
Only beef so far is that I really enjoy doing the missions, helps ad a little flavor to leveling, but my missions took a big jump in difficulty. I went from doing level 6 mobs, with some level 5's to a couple quick talk mission, and then the next clear wharehouse style mission was all 9's and 10's. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to get a better variety of missions? Or a way to get more contacts besides the normal route.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at this time, that I'm aware of.  For the most part I find that I tend to abandon missions as I get higher in level because I can get better xp on the streets and I don't have to do the tedious things like running from contact to contact and so forth.  Most of the missions, to me, get very repetative and haven't been all that challenging.  While the streets can also get repetative, I'm at least assured of getting a steady flow of xp and always have the option of moving to a harder area if I desire more of a challenge.  In fact on most of my level 30+ characters I haven't done a mission in several levels.</div></div><hr />

I think everyone is busy respecing and so forth.  Issue 2 is live and a lot of neat changes went in.  My main is a 34 fire/fire tanker and loving it.<br />
<br />
I did missions in my early teens, got bored of them.  It took forever to run around back then but I may pick them up again.  I was too busy exploring new zones and such to care.  There are a few nice zones in the game that gave me the ooh feeling much like EQ use to.<br />
<br />
Try out faultline (but have fly or super jump), nice zone to just look around in.  Pretty nice and fun place to explore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm looking forward to the portal missions, but those are higher up.  Outdoor missions have been fun (and crowded!), tho the objectives are about the same as the indoor ones.  There are also missions which require one of multiple solutions, and missions which require multiple people to win (multiple objects need to be triggered simultaneously, they are clearly marked as being non-soloable, in purple lettering).  Story arcs are good XP now, with mission XP bonusses having been bumped up.<br />
<br />
Still, the only way to get new contacts is by referrals from old contacts.  And they get more reticent with their cell phone numbers as you gain levels, too.  Curse them!<br />
<br />
The house defender and I level faster in missions these days than we ever could in the street (the difference post Issue 2 is incredible), but the 30's are reportedly soft levelling.  Our duo eats Devouring Earth like candy - the damage output of her controller's portable army is just sick, and we are unbeatable with them out ... all I really do is run around and sparkle and say *ow* and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got my claws/regen scrapper to 12. I really liked King's Row as an exp spot. I far prefer galaxy city to atlas park.<br />
<br />
I really don't care for the hollows. All my missions are there currently and I just completed a 2 part mission. In the last room of the second mission was a boss and 1 shcoker. I figured i could take em. I turned on hasten, +def and +acc went in and died in the room. He healed himself, and then stuned me long enough to kill me, even with reconstruction up and 4 healing inspirations...very ghey. Then I went back to and killed em both, with low life remaining. I zoned out and got shot for 250 damage, then 170 damage from some high levels mobs that got trained to the ent of the mission area.<br />
<br />
Right now I am trying to figure out 3 things. Where are the tailoring places to edit my costume? What is the best spot to solo exp at 12? (I am trying skyway city, but everytime i find a small group of 10's and 11's one always runs to a large groups of 12's+) Also when i get perma-hasten, how do you auto-cue it ?<br />
<br />
Over all CoH is a really great game. There are a few areas they should expand on, but all in good time I am sure. I really liked duoing with a blaster, worked great. The only real flaws I see in coh is the amount of these daoc players and the &quot;ex-level 58 rangers&quot; that play.<br />
<br />
p.s. after playing eq so long, I am still so amazed at the smoothness of the graphics. I have zero lag most of the time, and I run at the largestest res. In eq had to have most luclin graphics off.</div></div><hr />

You don't need to keep doing the Hollows missions, just that one where all your contacts send you in to talk to that feller in the zone.  Go back to your old contacts, and they will have more missions (or new contacts) for you.  We did the Hollows on some lowbie alts, it was tuff but doable.  We enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Tho, I don't think either toon we brought could have handled it solo. (My Kin/Energy defender and her dark/reflexes scrapper).<br />
<br />
Ctrl-Click on a power to have it auto-cue.  (It will have a green ring around it).<br />
<br />
One of the tailors is in Steel Canyon or mebbe Skyway City (I remember it as being in *SC* hehe), up near the top left corner of the zone.<br />
<br />
I do my missions when I solo, but as I recall, Steel Canyon might be good but Skyway City should be fine.  Runners eventually *reset*, and so if you can't catch em, wait for them to come back.  It doesn't take long.  Chasing them down does get easier, but it's always a big pain for melee - you basically have to get in front of it before the server sees that you can reach it to hit it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogun Nagoura</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game never really appealed to me.  I borrowed by friends account for a couple weeks and took a character tanker to 16 and was completely bored with it.  No depth, can't really solo as a tank, pulling singles was out of the question and the make up for the death debt due to those problems was the nail in the coffin for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I solo with my tanks exclusively. Some are better at it than others. Fire/Fire is good for that purpose. Pull with taunt, make sure they don't fire at you until your pull is away from his buddies, otherwise they'll chain agro. Tele foe sucks for pulling singles as it is considered an attack and makes his buddies more aware when pulled making harder to split. In any case, you should ba able to handle at least 5 or 6 mobs while soloing. It takes forever to kill (defeat) thugs with most of the tanker primaries. if you aren't able to handlea more than one thug at once, then you either have a very bad build or are too low a level to be making judgements. Tankers are just really low damage scrappers until 8 or so, and that shouldn't take more than an hour or 2.<br />
<br />
As always, know your opponent and plan accordingly. Hellions are weak to cold and strong to fire. Skulls are weak to energy/strong to neg energy. Vaz are weak to lethal... The lists goes on, so when leveling, you need to try an focus your time hunting foes that are weak againsts your attack first then the ones that use attack that you have a strong defense to.<br />
<br />
Use your active (toggle) armors, auto powers are weak in comparison, they serve as back up when yo face opponents that can drop your toggles. make a beeline for 14 to get you travel powers then its smooth sailing for then on out.<br />
<br />
That's about all the advice I can give. The game is cake at present, there's really not much variety yet, but thats the case with most new MMOs. i odn't expect to stick with CoH after WoW releases, but its a very fun hold over until then. I would still be playing EQ, but for some reason I couldn't bring myself to log back in for a few weeks, so I just decided to drop my account. I can't really say what went wrong, I just didn't have the heart to log back in anymore. I suspect there are a few others here that can say the same...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Name of the game in CoH is deff Area effect.  Scrappers, Blasters, even fire tankers and area effect well.  At around lvl 20-22ish, tankers start to shine real well.  Once I got SO's, I was able to stand in a crowd of mob with no problems.  Also if you're invul, 18 is when you get invincibility.  2 more lvls and you would've felt like a tanker tank.  Tanks can stand in a group of 50 mobs and go afk and not be any danager.  No other AT (class) can do that anywhere.<br />
<br />
Just think of CoH as the &quot;inbetween&quot; to WoW (Or EQ2 I guess, bleh!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still play CoH, and actually like it more and more as I progress. I just think it's a subtly excellent game. Some great design aspects. <br />
<br />
Now playing a 33 Illusion/Radiation Controller on Justice server. Actually very fun still. <br />
<br />
I love the CoH game play -- much better than EQ. EQ was just too much work in the end, not enough fun.</div></div><hr />
