<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in PoV right now, lvl 63 warrior, and have been LFG for 2 hours. Why? Well, as usual, most of the people LFG are 65 warriors, SKs, and Pallys. In the 2 hours, i've seen 0 healers, 0 slowers, 2 rangers, 2 monks, 1 mage, at least 10 warriors and at least 10 pallys or SKs LFG. Is there a place to see the class statistics of EQ? Heck, groups here have more than 1 warrior in them in some cases. Is 50% of the people hunting in tier 2 tanks? :(</div></div><hr />

What is even worse is if you count up pure melee lfg.  At times 2/3 of the lfg 60 + are monks, rogues and warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, it's just the robes get to solo and go /anon for 99% of their online time so you don't see them.</div></div><hr />

Last night I was in a PoV group and had to leave, so i asked a friend in the group to find a replacement. It was about 1 pm EST, so you would have thought there were enough people on. Lol the LFG tool revealed not a single plate tank over lvl 61 lfg, for like 45 minutes. Everyone couldn't believe it and was like, wtf, theres always tanks lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">never fails....when i really want a group, i can be LFG forever it seems.  if i throw LFG up while raiding, even if im in an elemental zone, ill get asked if i want a group in PoIfactory, PoV, or hell sometimes if i wanna help a group past PoJ trials....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nope but 50% of LFG is tanks. also remember like above we Can't solo. so thats why alot of druids/necro's are never lfg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always get asked to places I can't go, for instance I got asked 3 times this past week if I wanted a group In BoT. I've had to turn em down though because I never got a medal and a sash out of PoS :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason you dont see healers or slowers looking for group is because they rarely have to.. they get snagged up as soon as they are available.<br />
<br />
I always get asked to join groups when I have LFG up for a raid.. never fails.. that or I get the &quot;I have a CoM/Chardok raid and the Rogue didnt show up, can you come open doors for us&quot;  Yeah cause thats my idea of a fun night.. opening doors for a bunch of strangers that would be just as happy to let me rot in LFG hell if it wasnt that they wanted somthing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyMT</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">since most guilds are cleric heavy, it is nearly impossible for a cleric to find a group during off-raid hours.  by contrast, since during those hours there are plenty of clerics, tanks are difficult to find :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">clerics cant find group... that is a funny story! do go on!<br />
<br />
Most guilds are soooo cleric heavy that ppl have to box clerics! Yah thats it! If you cann't find group as clerics it means - you are shitty cleric. Name Cittan ring a bell on my server.</div></div><hr />

It never fails if I join I see 1 monk and a mage saying &quot; we are building a group&quot;. ARRRGHHH!!! Now I feel bad and I don't wanna leave the group but I end up wasting an hour while they look high and low for a cleric/slower. Now we have a functional group but all the camps are taken and in ooc I see &quot;Left castle lookin for a tank&quot; /sigh <br />
<br />
Lesson learned never LFG at zone in</div></div><hr />

That name haunts me....hell it haunts everyone on Bertox.</div></div><hr />

I sure can. Know where they were? On alts or doing something other than playing eq and sitting on their asses lfg for the nth consecutive hour.<br />
<br />
Taiil is 110% correct as well. If i drop out of anon and sit in PoT on my shaman I can generally count on 5-10 group offers in the first few minutes.  I've gotten group offers for PoP when he's been sitting in Kurns working on quests. <br />
<br />
It's like playing a whole different game.</div></div><hr />

People pester me on my cleric (newly lvl 60) even when she is not lfg.  As my warrior, people are content to let me wallow in lfg limbo. ;p</div></div><hr />

Aye, that's always fun, but I usually disband after 15mins and tell em to give me a tell when they're good to go. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
i planned ahead though :D yay my wife plays a shaman now !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that's perfectly normal, shikarii. I play a warrior main and almost never log off to play another char, but when LoY first came out i made a froggy warrior on this server just to be a frog for a day. When the Starpyre server opened up, i made a warrior there too, to see what the server is like. When i was trying Shadowbane i had a warrior(Shadowbane is the worst game ever), and now i've made a mage on the FV server for those times when i want to relax and RP a bit. And hell, i miss being a warrior so much when playing that mage or my necro alt.</div></div><hr />
