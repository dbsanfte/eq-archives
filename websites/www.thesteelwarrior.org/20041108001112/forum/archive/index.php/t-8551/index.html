<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
<br />
Appologies if this has been posted / answered before.  I searched / looked through the library, but couldn't find a similar question.  Here goes:<br />
<br />
I understand that AC and HP do different things, but at what point is there an equivalent trade off?  <br />
<br />
For example, a new item will give +25 AC, but -25 HP.  Probably worth the upgrade.<br />
A different item will give +25 AC, but -500 HP.  Probably NOT an upgrade at all.  Where is the break point?  What is the comparative ratio between AC and HP?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a generally safe way to go.<br />
<br />
That is, unless you spend the time to research for upgrades and compare pieces of gear.<br />
<br />
Some pieces of gear have unusually high AC or Hps for a given slot. They may be worth serious consideration and factored into your needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree that surrounding the general rule are a number of other considerations.<br />
If you're talking about bazaar gear and bang for the buck, sometimes you can get farther by considering multiple slots at once. Typically, you're not going to get huge Ac upgrades from rings and earrings, to take an example, but they can be a very good place to get hps and resists, which might allow you to consider a higher AC/hps ratio on some other piece of armor.<br />
<br />
I actually think that in many cases the harder balancing act is to figure out whether to use your resources to get an upgrade now, or hold out for a bigger upgrade later, a problem that exists outside of (or in addtion to) strict AC-to-hps ratios. Generally it's more &quot;efficient&quot; to hold out for the best upgrade you can, but obviously you have to be geared well enough to do your job no matter your progression point, so everyone has to undertake some sort of balancing act calculation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For most of GoD, &quot;1 AC to 5 HP&quot; to &quot;1 AC to 8 HP&quot; is the spread.  The &quot;percent reduction for damage taken produced by the increased AC&quot; is worth &quot;the amount of HP you need to survive to the next heal&quot; with these ranges.<br />
<br />
Having less AC means you WILL take more damage on average, so having enough additional HP to soak up the increase will be the tradeoff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think this only really matters for pre-raiding gear.<br />
<br />
Once you are raiding just go for the items with the best ac for whatever slot (hp will always be in the same ballpark for a given 'tier'). <br />
<br />
I don't belive in using a forumla, it seems ridiculously skewed in favour of ac. <br />
<br />
I mean 8hp for 1ac... would you take a 120hp 50ac item over a 40ac 200hp one? I know I wouldnt. <br />
<br />
Just don't pick items with a bit more hp but say 1/2 the ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had been going as low as 4 hp = 1 raw AC.  With GoD I was finding though that the mob ATKs are high enough that AC became more important.  I think up closer to 6hp = 1 raw AC now.  Importance of AC will vary depending on how your AC stacks up against the ATK of the mobs you usually fight.  If you're already high relative to their ATK, you don't have as much room for improvement by adding more AC.</div></div><hr />
