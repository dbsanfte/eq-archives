Skill Mod: +5% Stun Resist<br />
<br />
how exactly does this work? does it decrease the amount of times you get stunned, or the duration of the stun? thanks :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just like SE.  Except that it is checked after SE, so it goes off a lot less for warriors than any other class.  I've got SE3 and about 10-15% Stun Resist and it goes off a fair amount.  It's generally not the greatest mod tho.</div></div><hr />

Like splak said, its a nice mod just not as good on warriors since SE blocks most of the physical stuns.  The one nice thing about stun resist mods is they work on spell stuns too though.  And yes it is a complete block or full land, it doesnt reduce the time of the stun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antaran</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking about that myself the other day, if you avoid the blow alltogether or just the stun part.<br />
<br />
You get the message &quot;You avoid the stunning blow&quot; That indicates imo that there was no contact where there would have been contact if you ddint have SE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No. You still get hit. You only avoid the stun potion. Watch next time you get your you avoid the stunning blow message. In your dmg intake window it will show either a kick, or more likely a bash with damage.<br />
<br />
Also if you watch enough you'll see yourself avoiding stuns when the mob actually missed it's bash or kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stun Resist is pretty much for spells only.  The ~70% physical stun resist that SE3 gives is more than enough for just about anything.  Sure it'd be nice if it stacks like how you think it does (i.e. +5% stun resist = 75% vs physical) but it's really not necessary.<br />
<br />
While you can't get enough stun resist to use it as part of your strategy, every stun you resist helps, whether it's aggro if you're tanking or just more DPS if you're not.</div></div><hr />
