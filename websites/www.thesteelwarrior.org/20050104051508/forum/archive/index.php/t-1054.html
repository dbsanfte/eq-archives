Me and my wife's cleric are getting close to getting 60 and when we get to 60 ima go try to camp the Armsman room for this.  I am just curious at my percentage of even seeing it drop at all if anyone knows.  Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you should know by now that drops are random<br />
It make take you forever or you may see it first kill<br />
<br />
I've seen a few drop myself and wouldnt rate is rare. On other note its not really worth using from my experience if you have any sort of decent weapon. I mean not worth using even for slow sure if it procs in first few rounds is nice but otherwise you are loosing a lot of dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ToD is really useful if you dont have a slower.  I sometimes two box with my lvl 40 cleric on mobs that I dont want to drag people to camp.  I hate it when it doesnt proc but it does save a LOT of mana for those hard hitting monsters.  I just slow it, switch weapons, and beat on it till dead.  CH'ing is needed a lot less on the mobs that are slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah but if my mob is dead by time you slowed yours its kinda moot point :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I two box using my ToD quite a bit.  It's rare if I go most of a fight without a proc from it.  I swap out to a better weapon once the beastie's slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumblingdeth</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you two box without a slower, you better get a ToD. I use willsapper, and ToD is used right after willsapper procs. I have had ToD not proc entire fights and had to evac with my druid, I really push the envelope. Of course I have no BoC or anything like that. If you don't play 70+ hours you csn't get the DKP, so all the kiddies will get theirs this summer vacation.</div></div><hr />

 Anyhoo, it was retard rare for me=P Killed like 20 armsman and never got it. Ended up buying one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure it even still drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol yes it drops just when u do /who in sebelis you now see less then 12 before it was closer to 70+ all the time on my server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">VERY few items are ever completely removed from the game. Of course the ToD still drops. It's just a pretty rare drop. I spent a LOT of time (days and days of exping) in the Chef area of Sebilis way back in the day before I finally and surprisingly got my ToD which I still have to this day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep it still drops but is pretty rare now compared to when I got mine about 3 1/2 years ago.  I wouldn't sell it for any price.  It even comes in handy in BoT or any PoP zone when no slower is around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I acquired one this last weekend.<br />
<br />
I found that my 2-box is sufficient to camp anywhere in the upper part of OS - a 60 warrior and a 52 cleric. Pacify = single pulls, or doubles, but with the wondrous snare necklace of hate priests, I'm golden.<br />
<br />
I killed the armsman a total of 8 times - 4 times with groups, over a few weekends, and then 4 more times when I 2-boxed my way into the Bar/Chef camp. Quite literally, I camped out my toons in the armsman room, logging in the warrior first (to ensure proper aggro), with the cleric following closely behind. Chain stun to avoid fleeing (and helps with any enchanter ph's), and presto, you have a camp.<br />
<br />
You can't see the Truncheon of Doom when he's got it, and his hits don't change; that is, the Armsman doesn't change to &quot;bash&quot; or &quot;pound&quot; or anything else, it's still hits.<br />
And it was right there in his inventory.<br />
<br />
I'm probably going to continue to camp them, and sell them / give them to friends, to help out other slow-deprived peeps on my server.<br />
<br />
Great XP - I de-leveled from 61 to 60, and haven't regretted it for one sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maineeak</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i am a 56 warr 2 boxin with a 51 cleric. i also have a 54 chanter that groups with me about as much as my 2 boxed cleric , lol. I have been wanting to get a ToD , but i don't really know OS all that well and have been looking at as much info as i can on the net to see if this is accessable to me now. <br />
<br />
<br />
   can some1 tell me if its in my range to not only be able to hang in os with those 3, but be able to get to camp and hold camp so i could aquire 1? my cleric is equipted nicely with a clicky cheal bp , and about 245 wis unbuffed. the chanter i consistantly group with is a great chanter and has hunted in os a couple times , but has never camped the armsdealer before. any info on the type of mobs i would fight in route to camp would be great. i have been recently  hunting yard trash in VL , and would like to know how the mobs in vl compare to those in route to the armsdealer camp , as well as the mobs in the armsdealer camp.<br />
<br />
   like what do they hit for? are a majority of the mobs at camp or in route to camp casters? is the armsdealer a caster?does any mob both in camp and/or  in route to camp summon ?if any of the mobs in route or at camp are casters, do any of them gate when loh? are there any traps in route to the camp ? <br />
<br />
   any detailed information on this would be greatly appreciated, and thanx ahead of time to all who answers.:D</div></div><hr />
