<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>batbrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if this is a game wide thing or if it is just on my server, but I find it very difficult to find a group when I log on. Typically, I log on and if my Guild doesn't have anything going on I immediately put on the LFG tag. Usually, it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour just to have someone ask me if I need a group. By this time, a guildy has felt sorry for me and has taken me to get experience out of pity for the long wait time. My question is this; Is there no more need for warriors now that Paladins, Shadow Knights and Berserkers (I giggled when I wrote that) have almost the same damage output with the spellbook to boot? I know there will be no replacing a warrior in a raid. In a group, though, it seems very different. It is rare to uncommon that I see warriors even invited to LDoN's, Planes groups or any other group, lately. Are we being phased out? I ma a 58 warrior with over 6200 HP's, 1300+ AC and 1300+ ATK. Not too shabby from waht I am told. I have a very good reputation as doing some serious damage and get more compliments from groups on my ability to keep agro off the weaker classes (clerics, wizards, enchanters and shaman) when they cast. Anyone else having this problem? Just curious if I should go back to playing a caster before actually getting to much more involved in my warrior.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The wording of your message in the LFG tool usually helps.  Something along the lines of &quot;very flexible, flagged for x and y but will consider anything&quot;.  Tends to get you a quick nod from most groups...the worst thing you can do is put up /lfg with no comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree with Flair. <br />
Give your potential customers a reason to select you from the pack.<br />
<br />
To answer the general question: I think some of your  problem could be your level and the maturity of your server. Your server has been around for a while. Most folks looking for a tank can probably find one of higher level who can still group with them. Which brings me back to my agreement with Flair... <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once you hit 65 life gets alot easier in terms of group invites.  Particularily for places like BoT and easy LDoN's.  Also if you list those places, alot of times folks will send you a tell even if they don't need a tank or already have one.<br />
<br />
why?  Because you're a &quot;sure thing&quot;  and like a drunk guy at 2am, most LDON groups or common pick up groups will take anything home that won't say &quot;no&quot; =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Are you running around to zones or porting between ldon camps and ooc'ing or just sitting in one spot for most of the time with LFG on?  I am not trying to suggest you aren't looking hard for groups, but I see a lot of peeps with LFG on that are afk for 15 minutes or so.  Ultimately forming your own groups is by far the easiest way to ensure a group in my opinion.  Start with a healer and a slower.  There are almost always others looking for group that you can pick up.<br />
<br />
One other suggestion, many people turn down exp groups right and left &quot;because that zone isn't good exp or that camp doesnt have any drops I need, etc.&quot; so take what you can get.  The group you turn down today may be the one that doesn't invite you to where you WANT to go tomorrow.  Also, be flexible as to your role in a group.  I do a lot of pickup groups in LDON and many times a plate tank is stuck on being the main tank for the group.  If I get in a group with 2 tanks I always give the other tank the option to be main tank or dps/offtank/puller/whatever else is needed.  Who really cares who is main tank, you already are in the group :)  Buy/camp a ToD and offer to slow for a group until they can find a shaman/chanter/bst/bard, etc.  Little things like being flexible help a group and can go a long ways on getting repeated invites from the same people.<br />

<br />
Show me a pally or sk that can sustain the same dps as a warrior when both have comparable weapons/gear. Also, I haven't grouped with a berserker yet since GoD came out. That should tell you how popular they are.<br />
<br />
I agree that wording your LFG comment just right can help you get groups quickly. I actually box a cleric so in my comment I put 'have cleric that must come along' and groups get 2 for 1.</div></div><hr />

The problems is that everyone wants to go to a GoD zone I can't tank or to elementals which I'm not flagged for.  The last group I got in was 3 days ago, for a guild raid.<br />

My play time doesn't help (play late at night in America).  But I've never had it this bad until these last 2 weeks, and my play time hasn't changed.</div></div><hr />

Btw, beware of groups that without you would be doing lvl 60 adventure, and expect a 65 warrior to carry them thru a 65 one.<br />

<br />
 Some examples.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ask me about the GoD beta&quot; - did this for two weeks following the release. Get an tell, have them ask me, I'd answer, 'GoD beta? Wasn't in it. You need a tank, though, right?'. Worked about half the time.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Eh&quot; - ALWAYS works<br />
<br />
 &quot;Unflagged, nonkeyed, still tanking&quot; - always works as well.<br />
<br />
 Running around zones with my dual Yaks gets notice too. Oldschoolers get a kick out of the tank having them for some reason.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Your biggest problem is your lvl. Like most said, be flexible. I remember when PoP came out, I was still lvl 55. I would get groups for PoI and PoJ, which suck ass at that lvl for exp, but I went anyways, cause bad exp is better than no exp. If you do a good job people remember you and will continue to invite you when they move to bigger zones. When I get bored 2 boxxing in BoT with my Shaman, I will go do a PoV group if nothing else presents itself. This too has its advantages, those in PoV now will be where you want to be and will remember that 65 Warrior that came and helped them out when they were a bit younger.<br />
And if nothing else, and you have the means to do so, get a second account and make a Shaman and 2 box.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zaknaafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Your level has everything to do with it imo. You're eligible for lv 65 ldon's, but noone wants a 58 warrior tanking those. I play on a pvp server, so there really aren't any pick-up groups besides ldon, so my perception of your issue may be unrealistic. But I seriously think you need to have friends at this lvl with a warrior. From lvl 58-64 you need to rely on people who like you and want to help you out, because people in your range expect to have a lvl 65 warrior tanking for them 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
My guild carried me through this period while they farmed AA's, without them I'd still be &lt; lvl 65 ( I was generally simply dps with a rare chance to tank). So, my advice is , listen to everyones advice here which basically says how to make your char seem cool, and potentially reap return groups which look for you in particular. At  your lvl you're dealing with a range of people who have just reached lvl 65 to people who have been lvl 65 for a year or so and have 500 aa's. You're not a badass yet, and you won't be a baddass even when you reach lvl 65. There are many people who can fill your roll, Time geared rogues can tank a regualr LDoN as good as a 58 warrior ( wouldn't want to depress you with how much better Time+ geared SK's and pally's could do your job)-- you're not in demand at your lvl except for lvl 45-58 type groups, so make some friends and tough it out, or throw in the towel because it's not for everybody. Making a warrior valuabe in the end game is an incredible challenge. GL if you thing you're up to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hey Fro, let me guess your lfg message went something like this?<br />
<br />
&quot;BEG me to tank for you b*tch!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When I bought PoP I was level 58.  Groups are hard to come by at that level no matter what you do.  I had a Ranger friend from my guild who just loved the Inner camp in PoV.  Whenever he had an open spot, I would get the call to head that way.  I would dps it till the tank that was there left, then I would tank.  Tanking PoV at 58 isn't the brightest idea, but with a good cleric it was definatly doable.  Of course, that was back a month after PoP came out.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, the only pickup groups I ever get asked to are BoT and LDoNs.  I do rarely get /tells for Tipt/Vxed runs, but I don't really like doing those with groups of people I don't know.  Since I hate BoT, or as I refer to it, Karnor's North Branch, I usually try to get in LDoN pickups.  On the Rathe there is a chat channell for people looking for LDoNs.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, if I put on a lfg tag, I expect to sit doing nothing for at least an hour.  However, if I have the cash to work on some more tradeskills or I am /lfg for a raid, I'll get tells almost instantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>batbrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks for all the helpful info everyone. I do indeed already have a second account (actually my first account) with a 65 shaman. I regularly have my warrior in PoI soloing with my shaman casting slow on mobs and Quiesence for heals. Only getting 1% or less on mobs at the moment though, lol. Like someone said earlier, though, bad exp is better than no exp. I let  this thread go for a couple of days and came back expecting only a couple of answers, not 2 pages. You all rock and I thank you for the info again. Surprised to see no one flaming me, lol. Good hunting to you all and be safe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you are going to box the shaman, go to Greigs End, its more EXP per mob, they hit less hard, and are higher level.  I'd group the warrior with the shaman, and focus mostly on the shaman, as level 65 Shammy dots &gt; level 58 warrior dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">the worst thing you can do is put up /lfg with no comment.<br />
<br />
keep in mind its the same minority usually putting groups together and the majority sitting around waiting for invites. those who do invites start to remember names and they start to remember which /lfg people have a good chance of saying yes and which dont. so .. things you can do to improve your chances:<br />
<br />
1) take off /anon. i rarely invite anon people.<br />
2) use the comment section. trust me it helps.<br />
3) when /lfg for a raid use the comment section too. pleaaase.<br />
4) if you want to hunt in a particular place try to be reasonably near that place while waiting. people arent dumb. they check what zone you are in. if they are filling a sixth slot they dont want to invite someone they think will take 15-20 minutes to arrive.<br />
5) similarly if you are hanging around in everfrost wanting to get an invite to plane of fire do not be surprised if you get a few invites to ldon groups but none to elemental groups. but a nice little line in the comment section saying &quot;elementals&quot; would go a long way toward getting the types of tells you are looking for.<br />
6) consistently being afk while /lfg eventually causes a LOT of people to remember the futility of giving you tells.<br />
7) ten percent of players probably do 90 percent of the recruiting. so be polite to them and make a good impression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">All these tips are good, normally. Here are some other things you can do:<br />
<br />
1. Agree to help guildmate (or stranger, for that matter) with a CR in some isolated semi-nasty zone. Even without lfg tag, the offers for groups will flood in.<br />
2. Get set up to do 100 halas meat pie combines. Be in the middle of this with no lfg tag. The offers will flood in.<br />
3. Try soloing in or checking out some zone you had no damn business being in. Die. As soon as you pop at your bind point, the offers will flood in.<br />
4. Agree to join a group after an hour of lfg. Immediately after you join the group for an LDoN adventure that is in a zone that was like your 4th choice, you will be flooded with offers for adventures in your first choice.<br />
5. Lfg for a long time, do something else, then about 10 minutes before you have to log you will be flooded with offers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My 2 bits?  Grab a guildie/friend who even utters the word &quot;bored&quot;, filling the rest of the group slots to taste with lfg people.  Works like a charm for me.<br />
<br />
Using this method, I have: gotten all 10 of my VT shards, half of my emperor key, gotten myself non KOS to chardok, done dozens of ldons and NOT being bored and LFG!   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>stratys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">A few other suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. Explore other avenues of finding a group. On my server, use of the LFG tool is basically nonexistant. We have the &quot;plane&quot; channel for those LFG in PoP, the &quot;LDoN&quot; channel for those LFG in dungeons, etc. There are also zones like Plane of Tranquility where it's not uncommon to find people /OOCing or /AUCtioning for groups.<br />
<br />
2. Take the initiative. Instead of sitting there with LFG waiting for a /tell, start looking around at who else is LFG. I can't tell you how often I see tanks, healers, CCers, pullers, all of the same level range, all LFG, but no one stepping up and taking charge. Even if someone DOES step forward, you are then left hoping that they will choose you as part of their team -- if you are the one starting the group, you have the luxury of already being part of the group. Even if there's not a full well-rounded group available, see if you can snag a healer and one or two others and start killing something while you keep looking for more.  This can be an important way to break out of a rut, because there aren't that many individuals who tend to be the ones who start up groups; it may just happen that most of them currently have tanks they tend to group with, and that may be why you aren't getting asked to groups. <br />
<br />
3. Network. You remember that last time you had a pickup group where things clicked pretty well -- the healer was on the ball, the puller did a good job of maintaining a steady flow of mobs, etc? Do you remember their names? Do you think they remember yours? Maybe so, maybe not. You can save yourself a lot of time and frustration later if you make a point of maintaining a friends list of people you enjoyed grouping with. At the end of an enjoyable pickup group, if you say &quot;hey, this was fun -- do you mind if I put you on my friends list? I wouldn't mind grouping again sometime&quot; you will accomplish a few things: first, it's a nice compliment to the people in the group, second, the responses you get may give you some idea how responsive they are to grouping with you again; but most importantly, it may also inspire a few of them to remember to put YOU on THEIR friends list... and to keep an eye out for you in the future.  (even if you have a bad pickup group, usually there are one or two good players, and you can do this in tells just as easily)  If you do this for awhile, you may find that you hardly have to go the &quot;LFG&quot; route at all, as you will develop a wide circle of friends that enjoy grouping with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Words of wisdom.  I rarely have to wait more than 10 mins for a full group, because I'm the one putting the group together.  <br />
<br />
Don't be picky either.  Sure, everone perfers a cleric to be the MH of their LDoN group, but a dru or shammy can be just fine.  In fact, we've even won LDoN's where 2 rangers did all the healing.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, it is significantly easier to find a group once you're 65.  Bit of a catch 22 here, because how can you lvl if you can't find a group =)</div></div><hr />

Not only is that true, but sometimes it's VERY tempting when you're in the middle of Uqua when you get the tell.   :D <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Make friends with some healers, especially druids and clerics.  PoV and BoT especially, they remember a good tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time geared rogues can tank a regualr LDoN as good as a 58 warrior  <br />
<br />
We can tank BoT, SolRo, PoE, PoF better then a low AA/gear 65 warrior.  Our DPS just drops down to a horrid rate (for us anyway.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for being remembered i try to do my best and i try to let the people know that they have done well, like a bard doing great single pulling or chanter doing great on cc.<br />

I admit to being guilty of putting lfg up with a comment in the lfg tool but not trying to start a group myself, works okey somdays last night it did not, 1 hour with cleric lfg and no tells, wiz same, then war, guess making a group myself would be the thing to do if i like to get an ldon anywhere else then mmc.</div></div><hr />
