Mellee , the pure mellee are the base and  warriors in particular are the Template every other class is made off of.  Changing the template is almost always a HUGE process.  I have been playing a warrior as my main since june 10th of 1999, level 65 and 170 aa now. I wield a BoW with a Force of Yak proc still cant hold agro over anyone who wants it.  So those 9.5k hp and 1800 ac aint doing shit half the time. Using defensive it is even worse , using evasive is only a little better than defensive. So Some agro mod is needed. But a locking of agro onto the best tank would make the game trivial to play also.<br />
<br />
And yes I agree warriors need some damage taking modification. Hell I would almost be happy with RAW HP/AC ,  the trivial ammount warriors have over knights became so pronouced when Exp mobs hit for more than it some even double the difference. The only thing i am afraid of with having 14-15k hp full buffed so i can tank in relative terms as well as i did before pop, is how trivial it will make encounters. 4-5 groups doing EP gods is not something i care to see. But thats what it would take to be relative to the mobs before and the difference before POP.  <br />
<br />
I hate relying on shitty ass weapon proc to get agro. So maybe a Skill upgrade and damage upgrade would be the alternatives. How much is too much though and what would be done to other classes , When you change the template for the other classes they also must change.  So i dont know exactly what we need as a class, I know we need something.  The chat on the 24th best provide some solid answers or I forsee shit is gonna hit the fan. <br />
   I truely think changing the whole system of mellee is the only way they could change the warriors however, And the whole reason the Warrior class has been avoided in class balance since kunark other than tossing some bones such as EB for us to suck the marrow out of.<br />
<br />
Anyway just some ramblings of an old-style long time warrior.</div></div><hr />
