I recently have figured out how to use cosmos to track my battle stats. I am currently playing a human warrior &amp; would like to spec him for PvP. What abilities should I invest in? I have also heard that 2H swords crit more is this true? If so should I use a 2H weapon that crits more because of the rage it might generate even though it might be quicker &amp; deal less max damage or should I stick with the slowest weapons I can find that deal the most max damage? Any feedback on this matter would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you go down the arms tree:<br />
<br />
Swords = Extra Swings<br />
Axes = Extra Crits<br />
Polearms = Extra Crits<br />
Maces = Chance to Stun (likely the worst ability, you stop people from using a good 5 second stun by using your 3 second random chance stun, no stun beyond the first even interrupts damage, a mob will swing as soon as it becomes unstunned, so only a stun of 3seconds or more will actually mitigate damage, losing a 5 second stun for 3 second stuns is just all kinds of bleh)<br />
<br />
If you don't get the weapon specializations its all just personal choice and whatever the best weapon you can get is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-04-2005, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Swords won't crit more, but the extra attack would be nice.  It doesn't work quite as well at axe for reliable burst damage potential though, but your rage build would be better with the extra attack proccing of of specials as well as normal attacks.  With the hand of justice trinket, you could get 8% or about that for and extra attack and still have a good crit percentage.  Every once in a while you would get the extra attack with one of them critting, giving you more burst damage than an axe could get, but not as reliable though.  The real problem is there aren;t really any obtainable swords that compare to axes for pvp, making the whole argument moot for 99.99% of the population.  Only comparable swords are Obsidian and Bonereaver, both Epic drops from MC, and the Grand Marshall PVP sword, which most of the population will never have the rank for, much less the warrior population.  So you stick with axes unless you get your hands on one of those awesome blades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a misconception. If a mob is going to hit you in half a second and you stun it for 1.5 seconds, it's attack will get delayed by one second. Also if a mob is going to hit you in 3 seconds and you stun it for 1.5 seconds, it will not hit you sooner because of the stun.</div></div><hr />
