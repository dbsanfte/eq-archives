<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had 2 extra AA's lying around and wondered how farming would work with Finishing Blow. So i carelessly spent 2 of them on this useless AA and headed to OT to show some friend my uberness.<br />

<br />
Just wondering if anyone else has ever heard of this being done before? <br />
<br />
I've never heard of this even remotely happening before, neither have all the ppl in my guild. This can't be a first. 32k Finishing Blow with a bow?<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the noobs in OT where damn impressed and I had a good laugh. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've seen a rog get a finishing blow with a throwing dagger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont know about the AA ability but yes rogues can assasinate with a throwing weapon. It however has more restrictions than the finishing blow AA. IIRC it only works on mobs below 48? and the mob has to be clasified as humanoid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lovax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">screenies of warriors doing 32k bow damage could be useful for pissing off rangers... perhaps I should log in, get that AA, and get a screenie to ruffle my friends a bit :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had this happen a couple of times.... running thru GD omw to somewhere, I tag a giant with an arrow out of habit.... shot it for 32k+ damage and KS'd the group killing it... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ranger friend of mine has the first level of finishing blow.<br />
<br />
He got a finishing blow with his bow once when trying to help PL some friends in Dreadlands a month or so ago.<br />
<br />
He KS'd them. <br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">in the early luclin days, after AA's went in, Tigole posted a bow finishing blow to taunt the rangers :p<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well, i didnt beleave it, so i went and tried this when some wizard was nuking the AC down, the 32,000 dmg overwrit his dmg (i guess dmg tables take trample into account) and i got looting right, being the nice guy i am i let him loot it lol <br />
