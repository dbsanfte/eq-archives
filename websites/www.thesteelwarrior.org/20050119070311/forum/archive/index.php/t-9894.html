The emerald jungle is not a busy zone on my server so is often quite empty.  I was wondering if I have to do something to make him spawn and where exactly he appears and for how long. Is it possible that he appears and then disappears after an hour. Any information is appreciated<br />

I dont have the exact location, but its right of the staircase.  There is a safespot to camp a tracker near where he spawns.<br />

Once he spawns he will stay up till dead.<br />

he has a wolf pet.</div></div><hr />

he has a wolf pet.<br />
To explain that a bit further, he's the ONLY thing in the zone with a summoned pet.  So if you get a wizard (your wizard buddy will be tickled pink.  He or she got this spell at level 8 and I GUAR-AN-TEE has never cast it.) to port in, cast their detect summoned spell.  If they detect anything, Sev is up.  <br />
<br />
You can also track him from the top of the stairs with a fairly low level ranger.  Of course, the top of the stairs isn't a very safe place for a low level ranger.  Check out the root muncher boards.  They keep a list of locations from where a level one ranger can track things.  <br />
<br />
He's on a... shit, can't remember now... 3 day timer, I'm guessing?  Same as all the other Kunark dragons if that helps.  Might be a week.  Pretty sure he's server up mob too.  <br />
<br />
If you get yourself an extra red scale, (say, by hammering the crap out of Nortlav, who's almost always up) isn't there a quest you can do to swap it for the green one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, he is normally perma-camped/farmed.  His lifespan is normally measured in minutes nowadays.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didiaquarr is exactly right and doing Nortlav (at least on my server) is much much easier than ever bagging Sev.  The name of the quest is: Dragon Scale Conversion (on allakhazam's) and starts with Verrell Cogswin in North Ro Desert.  You'll have to brew up a mixture as part of his quest, but I'm sure you'll find the time invested will be far less than trying to bag Sev, unless he doesn't die in 10seconds after spawn on your server.<br />
<br />
I had posted all my fight info with Echo of Nortlav in this post: here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?p=134087#post134087)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nowadays I dont think Sev is perma camped, the spawn time is 3 days but I think there is a random added interval.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I did my epic 1.0, it was around the height of team mana burn, and 100k scales in the bazaar.   Sev was the ONLY TRUE source of the green scale (i.e. there was the dragon in the old Veeshan's peak as well).   I camped that mob for week's before I was able to get my scale.   The addition of the quest to change the red scale to the green scale was a needed change as the sev bottlekneck was the most frustrating thing I have ever went through.</div></div><hr />

Has anyone done this quest? How long/difficult is it? As an alternative to Sev.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember camping the scale by just camping Dima up on a building (thx levi), nearish the northeast part of the plataeu. When I saw him back at bind, I knew sev was up because only him would aggro from a distance at that height up. Worked quite well. Especially when I woke up at night getting owned by Sev because I had my speakers on high ^_^</div></div><hr />

Could have been a graphics bug maybe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been EPic 1.0 for almost 2 years and banked mine about 4 months' after I got it with a BoC/CHSDCombo.  A year long quest for something I replaced after 4 months hehe.<br />
<br />
I doubt people are still having the old degree of dificulty getting him.</div></div><hr />

They added a few different creatures to that zone when the Beastlord epic was added.</div></div><hr />
