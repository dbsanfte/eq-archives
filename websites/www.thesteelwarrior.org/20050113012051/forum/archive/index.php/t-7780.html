My only wish is that Shadowknights could have their own self buff stack in return, and since the latest patch, they have been able to.  :)<br />

Giving buff advantages to Knights = Cool.<br />
<br />
Giving buff advantages to only one Knight (Paladin) = Unfair.</div></div><hr />

It's very possible that with their new spell the ratio of hp between Knights and Warriors will be the same when we all get there.<br />

initially it didn't stack, they specifically changed it so that it would.</div></div><hr />

But I agree, I don't really care much about it. It should be kept in mind while balancing, of course, but it doesn't get my dander up.</div></div><hr />

SK buff stacking is nice, was really overdue.</div></div><hr />

Warriors don't get better AC from leveling.  It's fine if they want to narrow the HP advantage from becoming bigger as long as itemization isn't too horrible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To balance stupidly ?<br />
<br />
They cant give war &amp; pal/sk the same ac/hp on armor or it will cause a riot.<br />
So we get better hp/ac but none of those nifty buffs.<br />
<br />
We know for sure some people at SoE are clueless (see Qvic loots).<br />
So maybe they just keep messing up left &amp; right , hoping in the end, balance will be reached.<br />
<br />
Yeah right :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends what the buff is meant to do, to determine if something on it is acceptable.  To be honest though, I was fairly suprised to see a buff in the same vein as the caster self only mana buffs given to paladins in PoP.  You can go either way on the issue of &quot;should it exist&quot; depending on what it is designed for.  I'd assumed it is meant to close the natural tanking gap (which is acceptable) and boost mana regen (debateable).<br />
<br />
Preferably, you'd see a larger gap in natural hp/ac between warriors and knights and then have the knights make most of it up with their buffs.  Items have made this nearly impossible though.  The growth of items has pretty much lowered caster utility every expansion.  Virtue on an endgame PoP player isn't as meaningful as Aego on an endgame Kunark player, for example.  <br />
<br />
Your ac complaint is valid up to a point (because of the way buffs get relatively gimped after awhile) though.  I have better AC then...all but 2 warriors in my guild I think (granted, they are the top 2 warriors and I am one of the top paladins, so its not inconcievable that I should have better stats then our lower end warriors).  So, ac on the buff probably isn't as deserved.  Eventually though, your gear keeps growing, while the ac on the buff is always the same.<br />
<br />
The buff does pose some problems though.  It is basically pointless for them to not let the new AotC upgrade stack though.  The old one does and if they'd allowed the old one to keep stacking, it essentially would mean that paladins would have gotten a fairly useless spell in the expansion as we'd be using AoTC on raids and only really be missing out on 100 hp in theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was told the new pally buff will not stack with focus, and that the current AotC stacking with focus was a bug that wasn't fixable.  Was also told the reason they gave SK's a working stackable buff was to bring them inline with Pallies, since they couldn't get the Pally buff to stop stacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got Sturdiness to compensate for the AoTC line.  It would've been a shame if their new one didnt' get to stack, otherwise they'd have had a net relative loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I was surprized that SK got a self HP buff.  I thought SK had self buffs that added to attack - which paly's don't (and should not) have.  I will never figure out SOE I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like how warriors were made to grind out 60 aa to fix something screwed up before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm not sure giving us an AA that cost a whopping 60 points was equal to a self buff. <br />

<br />
huh?  They already do this in many cases.  Ever since Luclin a great deal of armor has been useable by all plate wearers, all/all, etc.  Yes, there's some class specific armor that gives warriors a bit more hp/ac, but there's a lot that isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While, I do think the 60 AA price tag was a bit expensive.  I think 500 hp that is permanent, cannot be dispelled, has no stacking issues, and does not take up a buff slot is better then a 350 hp buff.  Even if the buff is easier to get.  The ac component is nice, though its relative importance diminishes as your gear gets better (not to say its not a bonus).  What makes up the difference is the mana regen I think, which is an extremely fair trade for a hybrid.  But,  500 hp, regardless of if tis 60 aa points or not, is a pretty nice thing and probably the equal to AoTC.</div></div><hr />
