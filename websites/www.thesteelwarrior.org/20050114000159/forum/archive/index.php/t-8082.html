<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've about 850 EF points. Anger2 on BBB, and anger2 on my h8giver. If I sold back the A2 from my h8giver I figure It'll give me the points to buy A3... but will the returning points unlock A3, or should I just get back to adv'ing? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unlock only depends on how many points total you accrued in one theme, not how many you've have at one time in a theme, so no, back to farming you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Put it another way, if you've adventured in one theme, say BB, exclusively. each time that you got a win, you immediately spent the points, so that you always have 0 points before you start another adventure. Ok, now that you've got 1750 points worth of ldon gear, but no available points left to spend. You will notice that the 1750 point items in BB are available (seen) on the adventure merchant.<br />
<br />
Now, you go to EF and start working adventures there. You save your points this time from your EF adventures. You amass 700 points from doing EF adventures. You can go back to BB and buy stuff there up to the 700 point mark, because you have 700 points left unspent.<br />
<br />
Points are not adventure specific, you can spend them on any adventure. The items that you can buy however depends on how many points you've one in that specific theme though.<br />
<br />
If you sold back all those items that you bought in BB and saved from your EF avdentures, you would still only be able to buy up to the 700 mark in EF and 1750 in BB no matter how many points you may have at one time. All the other adventure would still only have the low point charms available on them for you to buy.</div></div><hr />
