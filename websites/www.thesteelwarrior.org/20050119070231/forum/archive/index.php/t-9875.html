<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hildarm Iceblade</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know these posts can be tiresome .. but I'm really wondering if there is anything I may have been totally off base about.  Likewise, any items that you all think I really need to get and can't believe I don't have .. pass it along.<br />
<br />
I can easily buff to 8000hp+  and 1550ac+ - which I know is good enough [I hope].  My question is beyond what is in my 'Upcoming' section of my Magelo, what could I get to make myself that much better. My guild is small but very close knit so I have to be able to take on the bigger encounters with less then ideal number - but people who are quite good at their chosen classes. Along this thread, I want to be as good and tough a tank as I can to help my Guild progress and move up the progression chain through 'Old World' content into newer stuff.<br />
<br />
Some things which may or may not be in my Magello:<br />
-Less then 1 AA from CS3<br />
-100 points away from my first AngerII aug, to go in my WWHB [which goes to MH for the faster delay]<br />
-I have about 100K in cash to dump if the need arises.<br />
<br />
So at the risk of the flamers [legitimately] complaining about 'yet another &quot;Gear Check&quot; post' .. here goes ..<br />

<br />
Know it's hard to get adventures atm...</div></div><hr />

I saw one for 80k on my Server last week.<br />
This would be the most noticable buyable upgrade i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">osserkon</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Myrtiz. Hold out for the anger 3 aug. and slap it in the BoC.<br />
After that grind out the 10 AC augs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestion would be to get some new boots first. Boots of Slaughter, Boots of the Storm, Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites are all good options. A new offhander would be nice as well. Think Mace of Memories, Sword of Midwinters Vengeance, Bygone Butcher's Cleaver. <br />
<br />
Grind out your A3 aug and put it on your BoC. Also maybe take a group of friends to the Bloodfields and camp the stun-proc aug that drops there, it'll save you some time (there are plenty of threads here about it). Also grind out some 5 and 10 AC augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hildarm Iceblade</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well .. I landed one hell of a deal .. got a Helmet of Rallos Zek for 80K a few hours ago.  BIG upgrade.  I'm happy to have it.<br />
<br />
Now, to respond to some of you ..<br />
I know my boots suck large, but I do not view the Boots of Slaughter as any kind of 'upgrade'.  To me, HP always has and always will play second fiddle to AC.  AC is king, without it we are simply a chanter in nice shiney armor.  Boots of the Storm, Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites - both boots I've considered getting .. but honestly,  the prices on MS are bloody insane.  Of the 3, the Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites are ones I seriously considered saving for, except that with Augs the RA ones are better.  So BBoDR are fallback.<br />
<br />
Onto weapons .. those OoW weapons sure sound nice .. shame they'd cost me an arm and a leg to buy. And I'm not really sure I can take the mobs that drop them.  But I'll give it a shot.<br />
<br />
Also, been trying to do LDoNs where I can, but these things do take time .. frustraitingly huge amounts of time.  Oh well, I'll keep at it.<br />
<br />
Here is an Alt profile of the Gear I'm working towards getting .. lemme know if you like it, or think I could do better in the shorter-term.<br />

Bring invis potions and make sure you know your way around.</div></div><hr />

I'll have to grab em and hold em till I decide to level to 70.  Not doing that till important AAs are done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say work Armsmaster's quests as your single biggest source of upgrades. Hands, Arms, Wrists, Boots and Helm all would be nice upgrades.  The camps/mobs you get drops from are also gonna give out runes/attunables/sellables so you benefit in more ways than one. Know what pieces are needed for all these quests and do the Muramite officers ring quest too. (check bazaar for droppable quest items and buy when you find em cheap)<br />
<br />
Things to look for: stun aug from BF, Blue Flame neck from WoS trash or MPG neck, Mazrunner mask and ring, ear and AC aug from Blind Hunter in MPG, 10ac aug from Ruined City, SoMWV from MPG, Butchers Cleaver from Ruined City, HP aug from Odi in MPG.<br />
<br />
I would consider getting Heavy Rubi Girdle and using tribute haste instead. Now that you can turn it on and off its really pretty cheap to keep going.<br />
<br />
Would move SoTBS to offhand and aug with stun aug from BF as poster above said. Sell Wind Worn, Sword of Lightning, Crypt keeper, Long Sword of the Ykesha.  Keep Velium Gemmed for dps weap.<br />
<br />
Would buy Shroud of Fallen Defender for the AC clickie.</div></div><hr />

Giving up 2AC is worth the 20hp and resists on the Boots of Slaughter, and to top it off, they are getting to be pretty damn cheap.  Normally I'd agree with your views on AC, but I think in this case the benefits outweigh the very slight hit in AC that you'd take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, since you are in a close-knit guild, I'm going to make some suggestions that might be just a bit difficult for you, but not altogether undoable.<br />
<br />
Boots: Take some of your guildies and pharm hard mistmoore ldons. The experience isn't great, but leadership AAs in ldons move fast, and you'll save up points as you pharm. These points will come in handy for my next suggestion of:<br />
<br />
Arms: Using the points you've already gained from pharming mistmoores, start to unlock the royal attendant armor in north ro. Though you'll need to fully unlock the merchant, you can grab some nifty stuff using the points you'll already have. I believe there is a nice two-hand slash that you can get off the merchant in nro, when properly aug'd, you can use as an alternate to the weapon setup you're currently using.<br />
<br />
Pants: Your kizraks can last you a while, but you might consider pharming burnished antique greaves from vxed over in GoD. You might also consider pharming Kuua Infantry Leggings from Muramite Proving Grounds.<br />
<br />
Hands: Velium Encrusted Gauntlets off Tormax, or Warlord's Steel Gauntlets (pharm these in LDoNs)<br />
<br />
Wrists: Consider pharming the ring of slime event in Cazic Thule for the Acid Bracers. While you spend some time in CT, you can collect items to spawn the Construct for:<br />
<br />
Face: Thulian Visage of Horror. Probably the best tradable mask available for a Warrior in the game.<br />
<br />
Offhand: Take your guild to Bastion of Thunder, and grab a Great Blade of Storms off Eindridge Icestorm. As an alternative, take your guild to Plane of Tactics and kill Vallon Zek (one groupable with great gear, so most definitely doable with 2-3 groups and the right strategy) for an Obsidian Scimitar of War.<br />
<br />
After you grab some of this stuff, consider leveling up to 69 and making your way into Riftseekers and the Ikkiniz Trials in GoD. There you can upgrade your:<br />
<br />
Ring: Glyphed Prayer Ring. Drops off the loot names in trials 7, 8 and 9. While you're pharming these trials, remember they are pretty ok for experience, so you may want to try to get a:<br />
<br />
Face 2.0: Death Incantor's Mask (this may not be the actual name, but I'm lazy and don't wanna look it up right now) it has a focus for dots however, so if you bring a shaman or necro, be prepared for some competition.<br />
<br />
Range: A nice range with 25ac and 145hp drops in these trials as well. I again can't recall the proper name, but it drops off the Rav Hunter in Ikkiniz 8, Carved Totem of somethingorother.<br />
<br />
Breastplate: Celestial Lorica. Very nice upgrade from items available in the bazaar. As an alternate breastplate, consider pharming Lord Inquisitor Seru over in Sanctus Seru.<br />
<br />
This stuff should put you pretty far over what you're at right now, if you have the patience to go out and get it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaiel_RN</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really your not gonna get an upgrade untill your guild goes to luclin VT/SSeru or works to the elementals.  Other then that you not gonna see to many mobs rape you with the gear you have minus OoW.  I would keep your Main Hand BoC and if you go to ssra do the cursed cycle then you can pick up a BloodFrenzy to main hand and boc off-hand.  If your a Casual Guild or player then your gear is fine and your really not gonna notice to much of a diffrence fighting named mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Buy a Copper Hammer of Striking or a Sword of the Bloodsworn. Hell, anything offhand will be better agro than the wind worn. i used it for some time and was more than satisfied when i swapped it out for a stun proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really your not gonna get an upgrade untill your guild goes to luclin VT/SSeru or works to the elementals. <br />
<br />
Terrible advice that I've gotta strongly disagree with.  There is a boatload of upgrades available to you doin just pick-up group stuff. Not to mention if you have a small crew of skilled guildies. See some of the suggestions above: <br />
<br />
Armsmaster's will be huge upgrades. (dont buy any N Ro Armor, get augs first)<br />
The random trash mob drops in WoS/MPG will be huge upgrades.<br />
Blind Hunter/Odi/Dek in MPG drops all possible and nice upgrades.<br />
A nicer 1hander to compliment your BoC is completely attainable (GBoS, SoMWV, BBC).<br />
A number of really solid augs for free to supplement your LDoN ones (Im thinking 20ac from MPG, 55hp from MPG, 10ac from RC, Stun aug from BF, Ferubi and GoD trials too)<br />
<br />
Once you get these done, then more MPG drops, GoD drops, and eventually RS and MPG single group trials all become possible. Not to mention whatever you and rest of guild can do in raids or &quot;mini raids&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lots of upgrades you can work on and get good exp while ya doin it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the content your referring to you should have no problem smashing it.  However if you want to see the biggest bang for buck when it comes for spending time in front of computer and boosting abilities.  Right now I would probably sit an some LDoNs and GRIND GRIND GRIND those AAs and Augs.  Once your done with the augs you need move to levels and start hitting places like WoS, RCoD, etc... Lv 70 is a major boost (imo) in mitigation.  I don't have a very expansive log for it but my numbers show a sizable boost in on the mitigation tables from 69 to 70. As well as a good chunk of HP.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even try MPG until you have at least around 1650 to 1700 AC.  The biggest problems you will have in WoS &amp; MPG is the elite xxxx, they are the &quot;proc'0'matic&quot; 680 to 720DD, and a pain to resist short of some killer 300+ SvAll.  Only major difference is that in WoS South fields your looking at max hits of about 680, North field max hits of around 780, and MPG max hits from about 980 to 1130 for some stuff.  Also be careful of the lightening guys in MPG, they like to flurry and any tank under 8K is in danger of being &quot;one rounded&quot;.<br />
