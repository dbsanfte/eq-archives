<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am wanting to try to get a Fabled Exe Axe or maybe a Fabled SSoY, but am unsure about the difficulty of the Fabled mobs in Lower Guk.  My group consists of a 55 war, 54 shm, 53 ench, and 53 cleric.  Here is my magelo, the other toons are similarly equipped, maybe not quite as well equipped as I am.  I'm just wondering if we can take any of the new fabled mobs...  Also any info on about how long to wait for the camp or any other info would be great.<br />

Thanks in advance!<br />

Edit:  Just read the above thread, hehe, I always seem to miss the ones pasted at the top.  Sounds like the Executioner is too hard for our group.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If your server is anything like Bertox get on the list you may get your Exe Ax sometime next month after all the zerker twinks get theirs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah, should have known that is what it would be like.  Oh well, I'd rather scratch my eyes out than sit on a list for hours and hours, my EQ patience level is real low after 5 years.  Guess I'll stay happy with my WMBS and GSoT for 2H and my trusty CHoS/SotB combo for now.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, you guys would pretty much get owned with that group. Frenzy and Lord hit for 1200ish, Frenzy flurries, Lord rampages, both have maybe 50k hps. Might want to go in and check what the groups are like. The raid I was in had a list for the FFBSS, but open roll on the Yak and Exe axe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If one is using a CHoS (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62186) in mainhand and SotB (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62188) off-hand, do you think it's worth the trouble to go get a Fabled SSoY (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68263) to replace the SotB off-hand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think so, I think CHoS and SotB are just as good, if not better, than FSSoY.  It still would be cool to have one though, I'd offhand it instead of the SotB just to be different, but I don't think it's worth the effort.  I'd rather get a Fabled Exec Axe, that I would rather use over a WMBS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's a better ratio than the SotB, and the proc is more damaging, so it is a slightly higher DPS offhand weapon.  Less hps and stam, but FSSoY has 8AC. The stats are about a wash, in my opinion, but the better DPS tips the scale to the FSSoY. But they are very comparable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">they should have made the fabled short sword of ykesha look like the original SSoY; icon and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can do the fabled exec with that group if you use defensive and get a couple more healers.  He has alot HPs than the other fabled's mentioned.  You will need some DPS to burn him down though.<br />
<br />
FYI his spawn is 30 mins and expect 3-4 PHs between fabled's.  It is definately &quot;old&quot; evercamp at its worst.<br />
<br />
All that being said *when* you get it you will be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unlike old evercamp however the stuff drops every time, which helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Emar is cool, we have a 3 group raid taking all the named and handing them out in order of how long ya been there, got an exe axe, FSSOY and FFBSS in 34 hours, got offered 600k for my spot but spot selling isnt allowed and not honorable<br />

I spent all day today sleeping</div></div><hr />
