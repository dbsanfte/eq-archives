But on the same note, if they are doing somthing on the 24th then they obviously don't have anything ready to say to us on the 18th. In a way sony played a good card, at least they are starting to talk about what they are planning. Either way Sony has to give us somthing and soon.</div></div><hr />

All you're doing is creating lag and someone who may have been sympathetic of your cause might decide otherwise when it affects him in a negative way.<br />
<br />
If you want to show how this is messed up you should do what Arch Overseer's been doing.  Beating the game in the way that was not envisioned gets things fixed pretty quickly and says far more than a bunch of people lagging up the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say give them a week. Unlike the first answer &quot;We may have something by the end of the week&quot; here we are being presented with a definite schedule. With the amout of interest we have generated, I think we can go back to &quot;striking&quot; should things not work out. <br />
<br />
Also as an act of probably unjustified faith, I would say that we should not go back out until the changes have been played though for a while on test, or better yet, on live for a while.</div></div><hr />

References to the StandDown can be made in the chat on the 24th so that they appreciate the gravity of the situation and see what time frame they will commit too.<br />

Where's the option for &quot;Yes cancel, because it won't accomplish a god damned thing and never would have&quot; ? Instead of trying to make anyone who disagrees with the stupid plan seem like an asshole. What are you a bunch of EQ terrorists? &quot;Oh they better fulfill our demands or we'll be dicks!&quot;<br />

It's not &quot;being dicks&quot; as Grimmlok put it, it's showing that it's not a vocal minority that thinks warriors have serious problems but a majority.<br />
<br />
You know what a cleric in my guild said the day I cancelled my account? &quot;I didn't know there was a problem with warriors.&quot; It's for people like that. Raising awareness, not being dicks.</div></div><hr />

They've finally decided to shake their bottoms, which is nice...<br />
<br />
I would advise to postpone the StandDown to the 25th.<br />
Put a bit of pressure on the devs for that chat session.<br />
Have them want us to come out happy.<br />
Instead of just trying to shut us up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing has ever been specifically done about melees, regarding the communities.<br />
A week or so after the standdown is organised, they finally do something.<br />
I think it already accomplished one huge thing, Grimmlokk...<br />
something we've been hoping for years, and that never happened.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakonn</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Terrorists not only usually have demands that their targets don't agree with, terrorists also aren't paying you constantly for a service, which you are lax about keeping up. SOE says that it needs to be fixed, and I know damn well we've been paying them to do so.<br />
<br />
Learn the difference between protest and terrorism... We're voicing opinions (not just warriors) about the problems, and we're doing it in the only way that seems to make us be heard. <br />
<br />
And the poll is intended for people who were going to participate, not people who are against it.. I'm sorry that you might have had to live with a little lag...<br />
<br />
And by the way, coming into a forum, insinuating that people voicing their opinions is terrorism and mocking us, and then calling US Dicks....<br />
<br />
Doesn't exactly make your case for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes... the stand down needs to be postponed. Any such act now would just be excess and unnecessary. They've heard us, they're going to talk to us, that's essentially what we asked for. It may not be everything, but we'll work on that the 24th.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">logrus</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question for you to  consider before  cancelling  the standdown, has any offical statement  of  any  kind about the  24th  been  posted on -the  Eq site  or  in the forums  there, Has anyone from Eq posted anything on   this board in regards to  this. Just  my  thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakonn</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. it just came out today on IGN, and usually it takes a day or two for many sites to be updated...<br />
<br />
I'd look for the update to the site to come sometime next week. But between the statements that Absor said they might have some info later this month, and then the corresponding article with the chat from IGN.... I'd assume it's worthy enough to wait till the 24th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The event's been planned.<br />
<br />
It's all set and ready to go.<br />
<br />
It won't harm anyone or anything.<br />
<br />
I say go through with it. Then when the 24th rolls around, it rolls around.<br />
<br />
EQ needs a nice, big serverwide event anyways. The GMs certainly don't do a very good job providing &quot;events.&quot;<br />
<br />
So let's ROLEPLAY one ... and call it STAND DOWN, the WARRIOR PROTEST.<br />
<br />
Give out troll cookies and everything.<br />
<br />
Bust out some old world loots for people who stand down the BEST. Etc. Etc. Etc.<br />
<br />
Might as well have some fun, ya know?</div></div><hr />

http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052965.html<br />
<br />
And it scared me :eek: <br />
<br />
Having said that, I would agree that it could be put off and let's hear what they have to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baladure</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the Stand Down should go on but with a slight modification:<br />
<br />
A time is picked (staying with the 18th) and all warriors come together in solidarity and put their weapons away...excepting for the epics as originally planned. All warriors stand in place for a set period of time, say 15 min. then salute one another and continue play.<br />
<br />
When SOE does their chat a move is made to go back to the stand down, allow SOE to make changes, or some other tactic.<br />
<br />
The thread I read stated that one of the prime things we wanted was for SOE to acknowledge the mellee situation and open a dialogue with us over the issues. I believe SOE has complied with the first part of that and is now ready to have an open discussion.<br />
<br />
With all of that said, I do not wish the momentum to be lost. To simply stop the stand down without a show of determination on our part SOE will/may/could see it as a sign we are not serious.<br />

You'll look like a bunch of jackasses if you do the standdown now knowing that the stuff is changing... put it off for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes , lets still do the stand down, its history in the making.

<br />
Hardly history. If there is anyone around from the first 6 months of EQ, they will remember the Weekend Warrior Walkout... in which I asked that all warriros simply not play their toons for the weekend (as I did nto expect anyone to stay way from eq then) and we were askng for some sort of concrete differeance betten us an rangers. This is within the first 6 months of EQ.<br />
<br />
Hardly history in the making.<br />
<br />
They say they are going to deal with the issues and have a date up. I say, again, give them the time. OR we end up like Isreal and the Palastinians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">logrus, you do have a point.  However, SOE (Absor) is in a touchy position with the STAND DOWN.  If he responded to the thread or to me directly (Yes, I was trying to reach him to no avail) he validates the movement.  <br />
<br />
I firmly believe the posts he made here on TSW and the EQVault answers were made because of the STAND DOWN and the pressure it was causing.  I fear, like others, if we don't recognize this effort by SOE we may lose ground and ultimately damage our position.  On the other hand I hate to lose the established date, I spent a great deal of effort announcing the STAND DOWN.  Even today I must have sent out a hundred emails to EQ News sites.<br />
<br />
Its a tough call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorwick</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the warrior community should be congratulated, as I think this show of unity with the STAND DOWN has already accomplished its objective.  SoE is now starting to release definitive information including dates.  Lets wait for SoE to show us the goods on the 24th of November and go from there.<br />
<br />
I agree that postponing the protest may be worthwhile.  Its now SoE's move, the ball is in their court.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">politics demands it be postponed or cancelled.  See Frodlins comments.<br />
<br />
however, anyone who has read Absors comments should be fully aware that the chat on the 24th will not address a single one of our concerns.  theyre not balancing warriors, theyre changing the melee combat system.<br />
<br />
the timing is simply a distraction.  good move on their part, honestly.  a lot of people honestly think the 24th has something to do with warrior balance.<br />
<br />
we're gonna need some extra room in the Outhouse come Nov. 25th...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorwick</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is pure speculation at this point.  I think its really time to wait and see what they have to say.  If what they have in mind doesn't address warrior balance concerns at that point, then yeah, we can litter the Outhouse with our curses and shake our fists at SoE.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo, it should be postponed till we see what happens on the 24th. The fact that they came out to say that means the Stand Down got their attention, wasnt that what it was for?<br />
This is just my opinion, I think we already accomplished a big deal , and something good might come up from that chat :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenier Lacere</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree with many of you, the stand down got them notice.. i say on the 24th, log our warriors in, before the chat session is to begin, do an afk to show sony the support we have an afk something tothe effect &quot;we are willing to talk, but in no means are we willing to go quietly into the night without being met fairly evenly on our own playing field&quot; the 24th when the chat is held, i hope to be one of the ones in the chat, if not, i look for it to be posted, it is a tough call not to have the 18th stand down, what i would do is like someone suggested, everyone still log in on the 18th, send a feedback or something to the dev's saying &quot;we have picked our weapons up and our pride in the gods has been somewhat restored. thank you for the answer, we awwait your move &quot;check&quot; <br />
<br />
something to let them know we are merely waiting on &quot;them&quot; to meet our demands, in any situation strike or no as ireprable as this may be for many of our reputations as warriors in the game with guilds and all, we stood behhind one another, meet with hostility and did not stop. should we stop when someone is patting our back and fondling our asses? i do not know but if this is a ploy somehow on the 18th we should make it aware we are not &quot;quiting&quot; the endeavor, merely postponing it as a show of GOOD FAITH!<br />

Ya know its a sad thing when u see on the load up screen to EQ, a palidan protecting the girl......wut has the world of norrath become? Well, behind the scenes its a bunch of liars, and otherwise its a bunch of liars, users, and haters! I admit, im a hater too, i hate those who hate. Anyway, warriors STAND DOWN (it shoulda been STAND UP cuz we are standin up and facing the issues wit us, and cuz its a good song and video) another 2 cents... wether its needed or not, peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Folks, I say we Standdown on the day after the chat should it turn out to be drivelish bullshit.<br />
Hear them out, and if they dont come through then we can standdown. <br />
Intill then I say we play some more bullshit politics and see what cards SoE decides to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakonn</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What exactly would we gain by proceeding at this time? They've given us a day when they'd talk about it, and they aren't going to have information any sooner than that.<br />
<br />
We wanted to be heard... and this is what they had to offer when it was put to the question. It's also a chat, so it would seem that there will be some interaction, or at least fielding questions.<br />
<br />
There's no position of &quot;being weak&quot;. They don't follow through, it'll just happen later. Not only that, but being reasonable will possibly allow for more inclusion, unlike rash behaviour. <br />
<br />
And to be honest, we have no Bargaining chips.. this is not a negotiation... They have a plan.. what they address is what they feel like. We tell them how we feel, they react as they see fit. Right now, they've given us a response that could work for us.<br />
<br />
If you take it too far, they might be more reluctant to help, not to mention getting overly disruptive is a risk to your account. Going through with it could tick em off. We've already went through the &quot;math&quot; of cancelling your account, and the $$ don't add up to a measurable difference.<br />
<br />
We have enough for now. Our only true power is the respect and consideration we share in this... you step on that, and you can only damage it. Wait to the 24th and hear them out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maturity is letting Sony respond to the challenge the warrior community has set forth.<br />
<br />
You hurl a gauntlet at the feet of an adversary signalling a bravely issued challenge.  Let him answer the challenge before engaging combat, as any truly brave warrior would do.  This is not weakness at all.  <br />
<br />
November 24th is not that far away.  If it turns out to be SoE lies and hot air, or if the adversary displays cowardice and acts with dishonor, then it will be rumble time.</div></div><hr />

We have their attention.  They KNOW we are not happy.  If what they say on the 24th doesnt tell us jack shite then we continue with the stand down on the 24th.  Show that we are willing to listen to what they have to say. In the end we dont have to agree with it but we atleast give them the oppurtunity to put more on the table then they have in the past 10 months.</div></div><hr />

This has been one of the best rallies I've seen in my EQ career, and I'm glad to see your efforts go rewarded.<br />
<br />
But I agree, let's hear out SOE before we make another move. If what they have to say isn't what we feel it should be, then Tuesday November 25th will be the Stand Down.<br />

To be honest I don't have a clue why they haven't kept class balance at the forefront of things most important to fix but it says a lot about a company that takes 10 months to do this. it means sorry we think we hae better ways to satisfy you instead of listening to us, on the other hand I believe they are coming off their high horse and realising that hey the customer wants to lead us to what hey desire most in our video game what can it hurt to talk?<br />
<br />
Either way we need to be to the point of what we want, we cannot be wishy washy about this and we should keep a vote somewhere on what ideas are most popular and where to go from there. and we need to do this gentlemen in less than a week. So this way even the most clueless could say hey warriors really are looking for this .. blah blah blah. There are several greta ideas we brought up, I would just hate to see this become one of those sorry we missed our opportunity to strike even though its dramatically ironic we the players have to do this. its really unbelieveable, but life is what it is lets get our ideas honed.<br />

<br />
Absor claimed he'd come back and have a dialogue with the warriors.  And we backed down.<br />
<br />
Now 10+ months later they are working on new spell animations while claiming they're making progress on melee balancing giving us NO details. And we want to back off?<br />
<br />
Now they say on Nov. 24 they'll give us some answers.  I'm sorry if I'm jaded but all I expect to hear on the 24th is &quot;we're still working on it,&quot; at best, or a postponement at worst.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see pressure on SoE and our issues at the forefront, not only with SoE but with the playerbase, many of whom seem to support us (the others seem to like to come to our board to whine about us being whiners.... hypocrites).<br />
<br />
Anyhow there were over 100 people in the channel one night I participated.  I think people are watching and waiting to see what happens.  Whether the stand down goes as planned or is postponed I dont think SoE can keep dodging the bullets.</div></div><hr />

How to manage a large scale online community (http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/gdc_2002_community_files/frame.htm)<br />
<br />
More tactics<br />
• Changing the subject <br />
–Don’t answer controversies, you feed them <br />
–New info can derail a distasteful topic <br />
<br />
Well, whats being discussed on the 24th is just the POSSIBILITY of new info (mind you, not even a commitment to change anything). Also, note that Absor didn't even acknowledge the &quot;stand down&quot; action, the warrior community or this forum? Yeah, IMO blatant  marginalization &quot;by the book&quot;. Now there's talk of abandoning the stand down, its all too easy. It sure didn't take much to derail the warriors eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So go ahead and have the standoff.  You'll just create a mess of lag and probably some people will get banned/suspended for various stupidity, and it's still not going to affect the outcome of the class balance any, but you can congratulate yourself on making a difference.<br />
<br />
If you want things changed, use Knights to tank everything and give up your pride and be a second string DPS person.  If you don't want things changed, plan some pointless demonstration that will do nothing but make everyone else in EQ less sympathetic of your plight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roldon</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are we after?:<br />
1.- Acknowledgment of the existence of a pure Melee class imbalance. <br />
2.- Clear statement that the imbalance will be corrected, with a best guess of timeline.<br />
3.- The acknowledgement and statement(s) must be posted in the following locations (offhanded remarks by Absor or fan faire GMs have not and will not generate results!):<br />
<br />
What they give:<br />
Alan VanCouvering: We will be hosting a chat to discuss the changes we have in mind on November 24th. We will be doing something more than a just simple balancing pass. It's more of a melee combat system change. The goal is to make melee combat more interesting over all, to introduce a little more skill into the way a melee character is played, and to achieve the balance that we are always looking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Aswered.  YES.(implied)<br />
<br />
2. Answwered.  NO.<br />
<br />
3. Answered NO.<br />
<br />
There is no doubt it should continue as planned, HOWEVER, Sony has effectively thrown a monkey wrench in the plan by tossing <br />
out a bone big enough for 50% of the disgruntled population to chew on and keep them away, weather we vote to continue or not<br />
<br />
Our options:<br />
<br />
Option 1. We  vote to continue.<br />
<br />
Perhaps somewhat less participatoin due to the &quot;bone&quot;.  Negitive imigage protrayed by SOE, that these whinners are never happy, we tried to negoatiate with them bla bla bla.  fill in corprate BS here.<br />
<br />
Option 2: We vote to NOT continue.  <br />
<br />
It will happen anyway.  Its too late, the snowball is rollling too fast.(If my dumb cuntry ass can see it so can SOE)<br />
 However there will be Markedly less participation and substantially more SOE retoric about the whinning Warriors.<br />
(SOE rep: &quot;Honestely Mr/Ms. press person, its only a small percentage of the Warriors that are peeved at us. This happens with any game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Observations:<br />
Today is Friday, the peek times for game play are weekends,  therefore more people than already know aobut this will hear of it.  If SOE doesn't say something they are guaranteed to get more support for the STANDDOWN.<br />
<br />
However if on Friday they toss the &quot;bone&quot; out.  We chew on it all weekend and the flames start on the boards, people dissagree, Im in , im out, im in , im out, all weekend long...........<br />
Divide and concur. Result:We  look like asses, they look good, press goes away,(don't think for one second that PCGamer and others have not called SOE...because they have.)<br />
<br />
<br />
What I feel is the ultimate solution:<br />
<br />
I am a Warrior, I stand here with my brethren, We asked you to do three things, We are STILL waiting.<br />
<br />
(We asked for it on the 18th, if you can produce it on the 24th, you can produce it on the 18th, I was born at night, it was not LAST night.)<br />
<br />
I vote yes, continue.<br />
<br />
Roldon<br />
<br />
PS: I love playing this game, I play a Warrior because my friend quit playing his and I could not stand not being around one.<br />
<br />
PPS: Spelling and grammar errors were intentional in order to add character.  thank you.</div></div><hr />

I will not be overly rude .. but some of you really need to remember its a game and lower the emotions!<br />
<br />
your not BROKE yur role has been changed from &quot;The only tank&quot; to .. &quot;The Raid Tank and &quot;A TANK (one of three)&quot;<br />
<br />
I have tried to stay out of it hell I really didnt care all that much. But I am tired of this &quot;WE ARE BROKE&quot; you all spew out.<br />
<br />
I as a 65 warrior asm not BROKE. I work fine and dont NEED really anything. I would like that us Warriors and other melee get some adjustments but I dont NEED them.<br />
<br />
We have become the #1 whiners great was a major victory to finally outwhine the Rangers and Wizards of past... and what did the whining do?<br />
<br />
IT MADE ALL OF EQ BELEIVE THEY WERE BROKE!!!!!!!!!! A tag they still carry with them!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks again for blowing everything out of proportion and making the warriors look like a bunch of 10 year olds who cry and throw a fit cause they have to share the candy bar!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh.<br />
<br />
Wake up man.<br />
<br />
They've been putting the same cut and paste BULLSHIT in their Upcoming Changes message for over six months.<br />
<br />
Then 3 things happened:<br />
<br />
1- FFXI came out, and people upset with EQ, or people with short attention spans, went to play a new game.<br />
<br />
2- AO started tanking Plane of Time content with knights.<br />
<br />
3- Warriors decided to protest.<br />
<br />
It's all linked. It's all part of the here and now, and what's going on.<br />
<br />
NOW they're responding.<br />
<br />
Why? Because there's visible unrest at Tranquility stones ... because there's documented evidence of knights tanking end-game boss mobs ... and because there's COMPETITION that's gotten decent reviews.<br />
<br />
So ... November 24th, the first MENTION of actual SOLID INFO on what they plan to do to fix melee classes.<br />
<br />
&quot;your not BROKE yur role has been changed from &quot;The only tank&quot; to .. &quot;The Raid Tank and &quot;A TANK (one of three)&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Is that the role you want for your character? A one trick pony that doesn't even do it's ONE TRICK all that well?<br />
<br />
Wonderful.<br />
<br />
&quot;I as a 65 warrior asm not BROKE. I work fine and dont NEED really anything. &quot;<br />
<br />
Good to hear.<br />
<br />
It's just, someday, you'll realize that those 65 Lord Protectors and 65 Grave Lords are working better than fine and don't need really anything either. Problem is ... they're working better than you.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have become the #1 whiners &quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry, but that honored distinction STILL belongs to my class ... monks.<br />
<br />
If  you care to debate that fact, feel free to come to monkly biz, and we'll get into the finer points of class ranting and whining.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again for blowing everything out of proportion and making the warriors look like a bunch of 10 year olds who cry and throw a fit cause they have to share the candy bar!&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors don't have a candy bar to share.<br />
<br />
It's PAL/SK usable, and has mana and focus effects on it, so you're not getting it.<br />
<br />
Which doesn't matter, because, even though YOU'RE fine, next expansion, you're not gonna be tanking the boss mobs anymore.<br />
<br />
You're not needed.<br />
<br />
You may not believe me right now. But word on this type of stuff takes time to get out. Fading Memories made monk pulling near obsolete in many areas of Planes of Power. It took, almost to the exact DAY, about a year for this to go from stuff a select few knew, to something everyone knew.<br />
<br />
And now, monks are dealing with having their role as puller MARGINALIZED.<br />
<br />
Give it 12 months of NOTHING CHANGING, and your role as 1 of 3 tanks will be sufficiently MARGINALIZED that even you, who's just fine, will FEEL IT too.<br />
<br />
But hey, how're them tradeskills coming along?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panazule</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of curiosity Phantron,<br />
<br />
Do you support workers picketing for better working conditions?<br />
<br />
Or protestors gathering in front of city hall over a political issue?<br />
<br />
Do you ever contact a local politician about neighborhood issues?<br />
<br />
Do you vote come election time?<br />
<br />
Your reply seems to send the message of &quot;If you want something changed just stay silent and hope someone fixes it just don't do anything to upset anyone&quot;<br />
<br />
History really shows that is the way to get things done.  Hail to the queen, I guess.<br />
<br />
Looking at your magelo I can see why you wouldn't really care if things were changed or altered much.  It's obvious you come from a hardcore raiding guild and the problems just do not effect players of that type like they do the average joe who belongs to a smaller guild with so-so gear and has to rely on pickup groups with people he doesn't know.<br />
<br />
Those are the people this protest are aimed at, not the minority of players who have adapted through high end gear.<br />
<br />
Your right though, some people may be inconvenienced by a stand in by a portal stone.  Well people are also inconvenienced by a rally, march, protest at city hall when they try to drive home.<br />
<br />
Will some non warriors be upset at our protest? Certainly they will.  They will be upset on their way to their PoP exp groups after they get past the stand in at the stone.<br />
<br />
However it isn't those people we would be trying to send a message to and worrying about inconveniencing.<br />
<br />
In fact if those people get upset, they may furthur the cause by complaining to SoE about our activities and causing it to be noticed furthur.<br />
<br />
Will there be idiots there who poorly represent the cause? Certainly.  Hopefully the GM's will boot their asses, that in itself could only help clean out the warrior gene pool.<br />
<br />
I hardly think the decision to do or not to do something should be made on the premise of if anyone will be inconvenienced or angered or the fact that someone may act like a tard.  If that was the case noone would ever do anything about anything.<br />
<br />
I personally think it should be postponed until after the patch.  All corporations move at a snails pace, maybe a new SoE exec just leveled his warrior to 60 and is wondering why he's sitting LFG for 4 hours and why people are snickering at him when he asks if they have room.<br />
<br />
Who knows.  A minor delay in order to listen to their plans would only show that the people behind this demonstration are reasonable individuals who are out for more than just to get their names in the spot light and have something to talk about with their guildies after it's all over.<br />
<br />
Do I think the announcement on the 24th will mean anything? Not really.  I expect to hear a bunch of minor adjustment changes to a bunch of already useless skills and abilities, none of which will probably be warrior only skills anyway.  After they make their adjustments to all the pure melee and say ok there you go all fixed in the same patch we'll probably watch Hybrid's get a &quot;bump up&quot; as well just so SoE doesn't have to hear them complain that Warriors received an upgrade after years of watching hybrids/casters gain power through newly introduced expansions and spells.  I have no faith that warriors will ever directly be addressed by any patch or fix that will significantly give us skills/abilities to match such things as sos,fading memories, ht disciplines, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
It's only a week away, wait and see what they do.  If it's meaningless miniscule changes then it will only reinforce the cause.<br />
<br />
If it's something worth while then our prayers have been answered and we win either way.</div></div><hr />

At the moment, the whole issue is replete with stress and hate, and that's not helping anyone.  There needs to be goodwill and progress.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm looking forward to 24th, which can't fail to be a good day.  Either we'll learn something concrete about how melee are going to be fixed, which should create productive discussions, or we won't, in which case the outpouring of wrath and its consequent ranting will be rather entertaining.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We got more then what we wanted, they're actually going to dicuss the changes they have planned with us..<br />
and the changes they have planned is a OVERHAUL, they're completely changing the melee classes.<br />
<br />
What use would the standdown be now?<br />
At this point, a StandDown will certainly be looked upon as useless whining.<br />
<br />
Sure, a lot of people were looking forward to seeing 100s of people in PoK, but that wasn't the goal at all..<br />
the goal has been achieved, period.<br />
<br />
<br />
If we do the standdown before the 24th...<br />
and the 24th ends up being something useless and crap... what then?<br />
we want to organise yet another standdown? How much success do you think that one will have?.. not much.<br />

SOE sent the ball to our side now.. best we can do is all be there, on the 24th. And hope for the best.</div></div><hr />

tell us why a few days ago, Absor said they may have an announcement by the end of the month.<br />
note: an announcement, not one bit about talking to melees.<br />
<br />
The change itself was maybe being planned for a few months,<br />
but the actual talking to the melee community was recently decided.<br />
Wether the StandDown did anything is impossible to discuss. It's something we'll never know, and something SOE will logically deny.<br />
The fact is, it's happening... things are moving...<br />
lets just be happy, and think about what we want in those changes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed with the above about the statement as opposed to actually meeting the community about it, that's new. <br />
<br />
This DOES NOT constitute a full aquiescence to our demands, however it does in my mind behoove us to be 'reasonable'. <br />
<br />
To be honest i didn't expect we'd get an answer to what SoE's been doing in the past months bacause I suspect it would amount to jack squat if committed to writing.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to send a statement to every board where this has been posted (Darkoan writes and posts here, those who posted links themselves copy and paste to 'your' thread). and to every news site that has recieved information that , in light of Sony's 'gesture of good will' we'll postpone the protest 'til we hear what they say. <br />
<br />
Make it clear that it's only because they've made some movement and the Standdown will have already made it's statement despite never being carried through, and if they give us crap we can always proceed in the future - i'd suggest though that we give it a few days after the chat to discuss what people got from it and that we try to continue to press Sony to make a clear commitment to a timetable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will just point out that Absor did not seem to make his statement that they may have something by the end of the month until after the Stand Down was announced.<br />
<br />
Nor do I parcitularly beleive that it takes them 1600+ man hours (going with the quick and dirty 4 weeks a month, 40 hours a week) to analyse and come up with a new combat engin. <br />
<br />
SOE probably did have this going for a while (on the back burner) and I would like to think we increased is priority with our action.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Well considering that Absor said he was unsure if they would have an annoucment when the stand down was organized 2+ weeks ago, I think you assertation that it has been set for months is very weak without more documentation to back it up. Also consider they have 2 weeks to work on issuses between now and the chat, and still have not provided a date (even target date) for rolling out this mess to test or live...I think that we kicked the priority of this project up a lot.</div></div><hr />

I think it is too early to cancel it outright. <br />
<br />
 However, I do agree with many of the other posters so far, in that, it would be a plus to our cause to postpone it, as an act of goodfaith, until we can listen to what's being planned.<br />

ANd maybe, just maybe, all of this will set a precedent of SOE actually *talking* to the players, to determine what *we* would like out of our gaming.<br />

If the intent of the stand down was to be disruptive, then maybe I would agree to postpone.  But it isn't.  The point as I see it has mostly been to show SoE the solidarity of the warrior community (and their supporters), and I don't see any need for things to change.  In light of the upcoming chat, a slight modification to our message may be in order, but postponing the whole event would be a mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santril</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My opinion may not count as much here, as I'm a rogue, not a warrior. Regardless, I am fully behind the standdown, and will participate in it on the assigned date.<br />
<br />
However, SOE has thrown us a PR bone. It's a Chess game, once you start messing with a company's PR, and they have a heck of a lot more at stake than you do. There is absolutely no doubt that the chat session came as a direct result of this standdown, and now the ball is in our court again; it's our turn to move a piece.<br />
<br />
Politically speaking, and in the best interests of having full support from players, and putting on the best PR stance for ourselves, it would be best to postpone this until the 25th, should we be dissatisfied with their response. This shows, as others have stated, an act of faith on our part -that we can rise above the problem and give them a chance. We've given them 10 months to get this right; the fact that it's taken this long for a protest shows our patience. Continuing to show the same patience would demonstrate the best image. SOE has acknowledged our first demand in the standdown - to start talking. Not our only demand, but our first and biggest. As they have receeded a little, it would only be prudent, to maintain the righteousness of the protest, to postpone until the day after the chat, in the event that the chat is unsatisfactory.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a second note, they've thrown us a second problem that I have not seen addressed here. Open chats, especially on a controversial topic, are chaotic. Many people will want their questions answered, and Absor will limit the amount of time he will be speaking to us with. Therefore, if we're not careful, they'll have given this opprutunity to us, and we'll have thrown it away, by asking petty, simple-to-answer questions that Absor can fill his time with...especially if people are repeating the same questions.<br />

PR win for SOE, zero info to us. This isn't a message board Q&amp;A, this is an open chat. If Absor's prowlings between all the message boards prior to the LDoN release is any indication, there will NOT be a lot of time to ask him questions. The ones we do need] to be good.<br />

Vote: Postpone til the 25th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Its like closing the barn doors after the horses have escaped&quot;<br />
<br />
If we were going on strike, (kinda like what this is) and the Employer wanted to bring something to the table....<br />
<br />
The emplyees don't go back to work till the next meeting.  they stand outside in the cold and picket!  They even picket (Strike) The day of negotitations (SP?)! <br />
<br />
I think this is one way to get us from gathering and showing our support to the warriors!   This is their way to shut us up for awhile.  <br />
<br />
Lets hold our ground! (cause that is what warriors do!) And lets show them we can and will bind together as a gaming communtity!  <br />
<br />
It's hard to call this a &quot;strike&quot; or &quot;sit in&quot; cause those go on till demands are met.  You have only planned this for one day....  Just think what would happen to the EQ game if the warriors did a &quot;sit in&quot; in PoK or even the Nexus till November 24th when this &quot;chat&quot; is held.  I have read through alot of forums looking for more info on this thing that is suppose to happen in a week.  Who will be able to take part in this chat....  Just dump it on us that they are planning on this chat and no more information.  On the EQ boards..<br />

If you all postpone before anything is posted on the EQ web site I will no longer support.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yehan</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok lets turn this around a little guys.<br />
<br />
What does SOE want? We know what we want but do we know what they want?  <br />
<br />
We have time and again on this board and others proposed changes to the current situation.  We know they troll this board and others.  They know what we want.<br />
<br />
What do they want? do we know it? do we have a clue? <br />
<br />
Further along this line is ... what are they doing  and when are they doing it?<br />
<br />
In the event SOE will come out and say &quot; these are the proposed changes and we would like your input, they will be put into effect in the coming month&quot;, then we should listen.  BUT, should they come out and *ask* us what changes we would like to see then it should be clear to us all  that no plans have been made to alleviate the situation.<br />
<br />
Personally, after waiting 10 months I do not feel like waiting a lot longer.  I wish to play my &quot;balanced&quot; warrior during Christmas.  I do not wish to wait another 10 months.<br />
<br />
Again, from a personal stand point, I shall *listen* to SOE on the 24th.  If they even ask me ONCE what I want, then I KNOW they are snowballing me.  Because we have told them time and again what we want.  At this point,  asking us will be a slap in the face.  So I will slap them where they hurt.  My accounts, all 4 of them will bite the dust, since I WILL NOT PLAY GAMES WITH SONY ANYMORE.</div></div><hr />

Keep the stand down and dont stop untill demands are met. Wrose that could happen is SOE takes there time and people get bored and start to quit the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santril</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A beast pushed into a corner fights more fiercly and more cunningly than any other. SOE stands to lose thousands to millions if the PR spread because of this is bad enough that it prevents people from signing up for EQ2. To the point that it costs far less to fix melees, even if it means revamping the whole system from scratch. <br />
<br />
To be frank, we have no idea what SOE's gonna say. None, whatsoever. Only that, if they want to try and dodge the bad PR, they are gonna need something concrete to show us. SOE has been forced into a high-stakes game. They have money on the table, and they're gonna play it smart. <br />
<br />
So we have to do the same. Select your questions before the chat, as much as possible. Avoid semantics, avoid controversial subjects (i.e. stick to things that are generally agreed upon), and avoid class specifics as much as possible. SOE's shown in the past that they don't like addressing class-specific public statements, except when absolutely necessary. <br />
<br />
I garuntee, Absor's time will be limited. So then, will ours be. Select the best questions to ask, and only the best. <br />
<br />
The analogy of Union to Company is flawed. We as customers are not replaceable, and the negetive advertising an sink this division of the Sony Corperation. We are needed, not because of the individuals involved in this, or the number of people involved, but because of the numbre of people our statement would prevent from subscribing to furture SOE MMORPGs.</div></div><hr />

Look at yourselves SERIOUSLY and ask, do you want it to peter out before it starts just to &quot;press on&quot; and SILL look like stubborn babies, or do you want to regroup, allow the announcement to be made and reform if it's unacceptable, giving new life to the &quot;movement&quot;?<br />

At first, I thought we should continue as normal, but after some patented Ogre-thinking, I think it should be postponed. Let's see how this chat goes on the 24th, and after we've seen what SoE brings to the table, we can then all collectively decide our next step.<br />
<br />
The stand down got their attention.  If they bring us shit, then we should throw a new date for the stand down and bring it to 'em hot and heavy.<br />
<br />
We've waited 10 months and only got cut and paste responses that were few and far between.  We can wait for the end of the month.  I think they've known for quite a while that Warriors and Pure Melee have been madder than hell for months, and that they need to do something major.<br />
<br />
A complete overhaul on how melee combat works could be just what we've been asking for, and PERHAPS a bit more.<br />

Although I disagree with the fact that they are making us wait till the 24th. seems kinda odd that they would not have the info by now. So if they did have the info now why would the not share it now? And if they do not have the info now. that means they do not have th balancing figured out. And they are going to get somting that they have been tryong to fix for the last how many months? in the next 8 days.<br />

I have worked for companies who's customer service ideas were similar to Sony's . You have backed down from them and they will do the Dev chat like they say , but nothing else will come of it . <br />

<br />
1) Cancel the standown alltogether.<br />
2) Wait for the 24th announcement<br />
3) If the announcement is bullshit and addresses nothing, move to more extreme methods of protest. If they don't like a large gathering around PoK stone, I'm very sure they wouldn't like a mass cancelation of, say, oh 1,000 accounts at the same time. Lag in a zone doesn't speak as much volumes as $13,000 a month plus the backlash that will ensue from this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the developers at Sony have made enough progress on changing the melee system that they'll announce it on the 24th at a live chat why can't they announce some of the planned details now? Its not like they're going to whip up something from scratch in week....<br />
<br />
If the developers at Sony have made enough progress on revamping the melee combat system completely that they can announce it on the 24th then why haven't any changes been reported from Test? Surely Sony wouldn't introduce such sweeping changes to live servers without testing first....<br />
<br />
Cancelling the Stand Down now because &quot;they're willing to talk&quot; is the worst thing we can do. We are seeking change through peaceful civil unrest. Giving up the protest, without something tangible in return, is worse than falling in battle...its running away from the fight completely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By waiting until the announcement, it shows the warrior community is willing to be reasonable, and yes, I know we've been reasonable up to this point. However, if they are about to announce so called sweeping changes, it may be in our best interest to hear them before staging a protest lest we be labeled as being a bunch of whiners whom can't be pleased.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think a stand down is going to do bugger all to begin with, but it certainly can't hurt.<br />
<br />
Food for thought.<br />

Hell upgrade the epic and I'd be happy, atleast I would think its worth the trouble.</div></div><hr />

This is not the first battle, it won't be the last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At first, I was in the 'No, let's do it anyway.  Just to follow through.'<br />
<br />
However, on reflection, and with a cooler head, I think it wise to stand down the stand down.  SOE may have been working on something for a long time, but the latest efforts of teh community raised the importance of the issues.  It is clear that what SoE is about to do will be entirely different, interesting, and will bring about a whole new set of discussions.<br />
<br />
There is no reason to have a stand down to 'get some official word from Sony' when they have already announced that they are giving you word.  Think about it?  Why the 24th?  They could have said the 18th, but, they figured hell, let's lay it out.  Think of all the problems.  Flesh out our ideas, and then present them to everyone.  The extra week gives them time to do that.  <br />
<br />
Congrats to everyone.  Job well done.  And, stand down teh stand down.<br />
<br />
Adventure well,</div></div><hr />
