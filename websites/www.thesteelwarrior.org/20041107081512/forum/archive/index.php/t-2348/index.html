<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seneder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Excuse Me, Excuse me Ladies and Gentleman. I am here to get one message across,  As a &quot;Newbie&quot; to this board and a warrior.<br />
I am getting Damn tired of All the whining going on.<br />
Almost every post is about class imbalance, Paladins are Better; PLAY THE DAMN PALADIN AND SHUT UP.<br />
Not enough Decent weapons, I'm imbalanced, How's my gear. Damn, you people that post regularly are making me sick of this board. <br />
I have read every ones post for the past 3 weeks........... Tedious at best. You people make me wonder WHY did I decide warrior. AT best your nothing but whiners, those little glimmers of Knowledge pass through unexpectedly. Those TIDBITS of Knowledge make my day, The rest makes me want to PUKE. <br />
I've sent my personal letter to Sony as to how I'd like to see warriors end up, if they listen, that is up to them. My Money counts.... Have you done this?<br />
If you truly Believe that paladins are better, PLAY ONE. <br />
All class Balancing for warriors is DONE WITH AA&quot;S. Which Direction do you want to go? AA's start at 51, Thats when BALANCING STARTS FOR WARRIORS. GET A GRIP....<br />
But I want them to do it for me!!! SHUT THE F%^* UP WHINER. Level and You'll have Balance. Level and you'll have choice.... <br />
AGRO Management is something Players need to learn.... If your Not MT or SA: learn how to manage your agro, Paladins Included. MA and SA are the gods next to RAID LEADER. LEARN THIS QUICK and QUIT YOUR DAMN WHINING&lt; I&quot;M SICK OF IT...........................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you have hundreds of days played its a little dis-heartening to think of restarting as a Paladin.  Besides, the game is dying anyway, what idiot would start over now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummm, so you make a post to WHINE about people that are whining about being a warrior?  :D <br />
<br />
Pot meet kettle, kettle meet pot.<br />
<br />
You may want to skip the section that IS LABLED FOR WHINING then.  It isn't hard to do, just don't read the outhouse.</div></div><hr />

In this day and age you can Make Level 50 in 4 days or less. IF you want pally? Go for it. NO ONE , NEEDS THE WHINING on  a board the caters to Warriors, Fighters for there BELIEF. Warriors , Fight; Even with Sony.......</div></div><hr />

I am just waiting and passing time till something catches my eye. This game is so fugged up in so many ways it is retarded. But, since it was the first, I come to expect it to be fugged up. No matter what they add, they will never change the problems, if they did they would rename it EQ2 =\ .............<br />
<br />
<br />
But you must admit, complaining is fun. I think this section is for complaining? Yep, sure is. Might I suggest........NOT.........coming in this area? Yep, guess I might suggest that.<br />
<br />
Stop coming to this area.<br />

WoW, I feel better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya know, there is a very easy solution to your problem.  Because, it is after all your problem.  You're the one who doesn't enjoy or apperciate what he's reading.  Fair enough, you're entitled to that, you don't have to enjoy it or apperciate it.  But you also don't have to read it.  So, rather than expecting everyone else in the world to change to accommodate your desires, how about you change instead?  Stop reading them.  Pretty easy, eh?<br />
<br />
And might I say, that if you hadn't figured this out on your own, you must be a friggin retard.  Have a nice day, Mr. I want to whine about whiners.  Talk about pot and kettle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So what exactly counts as a whine and what counts as valid discussion of class imbalance Senedor? In your initial posts you appear to be saying that anyone who feels differently to you (warriors are ok with AA's) is by definition a 'whiner'. If you are less obtuse than your initial post suggested then perhaps you should've taken a bit more time to structure a reply that gets your opinion across reasonably - rather than just 'whining'.<br />
<br />
/Cue the brush off post about how 'I'm too superior to you guys to need to frame a reasoned response'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">NinjaBurger, One of THEE biggest Whiners of all <br />
<br />
Ninja is not a whiner, he is a spammer...there is a difference:D .<br />
<br />
Now on to the heart of the matter.  Do we whine here?  Yes.  Do we have reason to whine?  Yes.  Do we feel a little better for venting our frustrations here?  I know I do.  Don't like it, don't read it.<br />
<br />
And if you are only finding little bits of information buried in these boards, I suggest you go look some more.  There is litteraly tons of usefull and helpful stuff here.  When I found TSW(back at the old board, when I was level 55), first thing I learned was how little I knew about my class.  I think I am a much better player for having found TSW(and I would like to thank all those people who continue to add to our knowledge).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Level and You'll have Balance. Level and you'll have choice....  <br />
<br />
I am level 65 with 98AA points, a Blade of Carnage and a Sceptre of Destruction, and guess what?  I am STILL a slave to the RNG and the gimmicks we were given to hold aggro.  If my weapons don't proc and my AE taunt is down and there's a good chance someone could die.  There is virtually zero chance of that happening in a group with a knight.  You can sit here and think that everything is just fine, but that's your perogative.  The rest of us are continually frustrated by broken promises from a company we pay, and we have the right to bitch about it.<br />
<br />
Don't like it?  I hear the druid's grove is a nice place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am the #1 &quot;whiner&quot; here... and I'll happily 'fight' you.  I'll shut up completely and for good FOREVER if you can tell me in one sentence what I can do while playing my warrior in &quot;learning how to play my class&quot; that will make taunt do the following things:<br />
<br />
1. Work greater than 60% of the time.   This is important, when I was in school, 65% was considered a failure, an unacceptable level of success.   <br />
<br />
2. WHEN IT WORKS to have it work like it was explained by the company who made the product, i.e. to place you at the top of the aggro list plus a small amount.<br />
<br />
The moment you can tell me what I can personally, myself do to change those two things, I will shut up and never post on balance again....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow, we have one hell of a moron here.  Levels and aa balance us?  Fuck no.  Do other classes need aa just to give a half assed attempt at their job?  And why should I have to go play a paladin?  There is an imbalance, and it should be fixed.  And if you look at past cases, the people who get the fixes are the ones who bitch, so I'm gonna bitch til they fix it.  You don't like it?  Don't read it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm saying Learn your class and quit bitching <br />
<br />
Heh... you can learn how to quad kite..<br />
you can learn how to fear kite..<br />
you can learn how to nuke most efficiently..<br />
you can learn how to heal most efficiently..<br />
you can learn how to pull properly...<br />
<br />
<br />
but you need to learn how to press taunt when you lose aggro?<br />
<br />
oh my.. if you needed to learn that, then I pity you.<br />
<br />
One of the warrior's problem is the fact there is NOTHING to learn,<br />
there is NOTHING to get good at...<br />
<br />
I'd say positioning is the hardest task for a warrior... and I'm sure you find that task oh so very hard!<br />
<br />
<br />
It's like wizards telling the rogues to LEARN THEIR CLASS if they want to do as much damage as them!<br />
Ya, I'd find those wizards pretty retarded as well.<br />
<br />
I really wonder what could be wrong with Warriors that say there are no problems.... seriously...<br />
-Either you got a huge ego, and cant admit to having a few problems.<br />
-Or you're just a first grade imbecil.<br />
-Or you live on a server with 0 knights, and where everyone goes &quot;np, it's part of the game :)&quot; when he dies a 3rd time due to your loss of aggro.<br />
<br />
I'd say for most people, the first choice applies... which inevitably leads you to the second choice as well...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Otherwise, have fun in trolldom. Some day you might grow some balls.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'd like to know what class/level you are too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm trying really hard to not respond to this by spurring on another discussion as to why many of the posters on this board think that warriors are not balanced with knights because theres plenty of those posts here already and apparently Seneder has an issue with reading comprehension because he says he has read a number of posts on the topic and he clearly doesn't -get it-.<br />
<br />
I can't however resist responding to this:<br />
Agro MANAGEMENT. get it? Agro is managed.<br />
If agro management was the sole responsibility of the tank then you would have a valid arguement, however it doesn't matter how well you know your class because no warrior can manage the agro of an enchanter who wants to tash the mob before it is in camp or a wizard who wants to chain cast his biggest nuke because every now and then it makes a big number appear and someone might go &quot;ooo nice crit&quot;.<br />
<br />
If every time a group member failed to manage their agro they got whacked around a few times, and a smaller number of times they got a free trip to bind with out gear and less a little XP then people would learn to manage agro and warriors would not feel the need to express their displeasure on the boards.  However, at the moment this only happens when there is a warrior tanking.  With a knight tanking the rest of the group can fail to manage agro and there will be no penalty.<br />
<br />
With a warrior tanking everybody must manage agro, but a knight can manage agro for the whole group.  I see this as a design problem with the warrior class that I would like to see fixed.<br />
<br />
Please fill me in as to how levels, AAs and knowing my class will help me overcome this as I'd like to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Fool thats funny the only fool here is you Seneder. Not because you are a troll but because you are just wrong. Warriors have many dis advantages with the other tank classes I could list them but what is the point. You say you play a warrior I have my doubts. I think maybe SK, but it really does not matter because most here feel their is a prob if you do not so be it. However your complaining about people who are upset with the way things are shows you for what you are an SK, PALI or even worse a troll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Today I have a bit over 9k buffed using Hategiver / BBotE / The rotting Fist / Blackout .. around 180 AAs and I am fighting for each fizzle of a part of aggro as never before with a real minimum of succes.<br />

When a group in PoV .... decides to take an unknown 62 Paladin while an unknown 65 Warrior is also Lfg for better tanking/aggro .... do you not think that there is something wrong?</div></div><hr />

Go back to EQ for the Playstation where you belong....<br />

I for one have 370 DAYS PLAYED on my warrior, but thats just in EQ, my warrior has existed since 1985 in one incarnation or another. There is an attachment and many sentimental reasons for playing him. He is as much a part of me as my hair color or my glasses I wear. There are hundreds, or forgive my ego, perhaps thousands of people who know Me AS Landrain, not as Ed, but as Landrain the Warrior. Many of these people I know in real life, many I only know in the virtual world, and many have never even played the game EQ that we are discussing.<br />

PS---- I like my warrior, I am not MT of my guild, so I dont have to worry about the agro thing except in groups, where dumb asses have literally made my nights hell because I could hold agro, alot of folks do not realize they they have to hold back in order for us to hold agro.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">To the first poster... err fucktwad.<br />
<br />
LEARN YOUR FUCKING CLASS.<br />
<br />
Learning a class is not only knowing its advantages but also its disadvantages. If your ego is so big that you can't admit that there are disadvantages to being a warrior then you know nothing about the class. Every class has a limitation. Every single one. Some have more than others, and warriors have so many that they currently outweigh the advantages.<br />
<br />
I would love to honestly say that we are all just bitching for no reason because it would mean that we don't have to go night after  night begging for groups and not getting them all because &quot;were the kings of raiding&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Warriors have problmens, they are a liability to any group who takes them. <br />
<br />
Until you accept this truth you will not know anything about what it is to truelly be a warrior. Until then, you can STFU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Congratulations Seneder.  It only took you one thread to prove what an uninformed, self important, deluded, pompous ass you are.  To come here and tell people who collectively have this much experience with the warrior class that they need to shut up and learn to play their class couldnt possibly be more asinine.  And by the way, it doesnt take much knowledge to play a warrior.  The knowledge is required to teach everyone else how to play with the warrior, i.e., manage their aggro.  Which incedentally, they don't have to do if a knight tanks.  If you truly don't think the warrior class needs some adjustments, please pull your head out of your ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">My mother always told me that people such as Seneder weren't even worth the breath it took to argue with, so don't sink to their level.  Therefore in honor of my mother<br />

<br />
OK so that isn't quite doing it for me.<br />
<br />
How ignorant can you be?  You're probably one of the hundreds of crusty wearing ignorant little pricks that is getting PLed to 50.  Unless you know what it's like to tank in full bronze, unless you know the joy of getting a LoW, hell unless you know what LoW stands for, unless you know what waiting lists are, unless you know what it's like to go through a hell level (and I mean a true hell level like 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, get the picture?)  then don't you dare tell me to learn to play my char.  When I first started playing everybody was forced to learn to play their char.  Hell even enchanters that started then are better in terms of pure knowledge and skill.  You can always tell when you're in a group with an old school player.  When I do tank in groups where I am not known, I get told things like, &quot;Wow Mvreena, you're a very good tank for a warrior.&quot;  And not because I keep 100% aggro, I don't, and if you presume to say you do you're lieing.  It's because I have knowledge and skill.  It's because of piss ants like yourself, that warriors get an even worse rap than we deserve.<br />

OK, I fell much better now.  Sorry mom.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Paladins are Better; PLAY THE DAMN PALADIN AND SHUT UP.&quot;<br />
<br />
In other words, stop your own whining and go play another class.<br />
<br />
You'll have less stress when reading that class' message board, and be much happier.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Damn it man..... after reading your freaking stupid and totally clueless post, I felt the urge to crush something... and guess what... you are fucking buying me a new printer!<br />
<br />
I couldnt believe how someone so clueless is telling everyone to learn their class! <br />
Ive been playing for 2 years, if you get to lvl50 in 4 freaking days there is NO CHANCE you get to know your class... so that means, YOU got to lvl50 in 4 days and YOU have no fooking clue about YOUR class... like many have said, knowing your class is knowing their strenghts and weaknesses, and by knowing them, you can realize some things are wrong... Noone here complains cause they just have fun with it, but they want to better their class, the class you *supposely* know how to play (and I sure doubt).... you really have no idea what is to plead for procs, read what every caster is casting to wait and use Taunt to jump on the slowers agro (if taunt works, if not = slapped slower), hope for rangers not to meele cause they will have to jolt if I dont get procs at the beginning of the fight, get told by groups that you make em nervous cause you are a warrior... I MT for my guild, and it makes me really proud that they choose me and I try it my best for all of them... <br />
<br />
Not enough Decent weapons, I'm imbalanced, How's my gear. Damn, you people that post regularly are making me sick of this board.  <br />
If you didnt notice.... a warrior is mostly about his weapons and gear and skills... the only way I can get agro, is if I have a 'decent' weapon with a 'decent' proc... so, an item is what defines if I can tank or no, not a freaking spell... so you SHUT UP<br />
<br />
Level and You'll have Balance. Level and you'll have choice....  <br />
Can I laugh?</div></div><hr />
