<br />
Apo we are talking average player, your guild is not avarage when it starts to farm encounters to make previous encounters easyer.<br />
<br />
My numbers are not possible with my kind of people, your numbers are possible with your kind.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind what this topic focuses on, my kind.<br />
<br />
What kind are my people?  Those with brains??  Anything short of EP's is designed to be able to win with 36-45 people easily ... you just have to use your freaking heads instead of run at every encounter like a mother-f'in zerg.<br />
<br />
People see the 72 man raid limit and assume that's what the encounter was designed for.  On my server, larger guilds who broke into EP's with 36-50 people laughed when younger guilds started throwing 72 people at things like Grummus ... or Terris .... or even Saryrn.<br />
<br />
Caprin is a prime example.  It really is one of the more difficult and fun encounters pre-EP and guess what ... it gives out 36 flags.  And you know what?  Pickups on my server still use 30-40 people to win caprin .. but these same shmucks consider it suicide to take less than 60 into kill grummus.  Pre-EP mobs are not hard, but they do require that everyone does their job well.  IE- your theory that 80% of raiders are /assist zombies is completely incorrect.<br />
<br />
But go ahead ... believe that you must take 72 if you want heh ... my and my 40-45 other friends will be kicking back in EP's giggling that you're still trying to recruit more worthless bodies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am all for a set of &quot;close to EP&quot; armor obtainable by groups as xwraithx describes - about 110-130hp 50AC on most slots. However, I suspect that the people asking for it would not be happy with the difficulty involved in getting it.<br />
<br />
Sony's recent content additions illustrate two avenues to obtaining this quality of gear:<br />
<br />
1) Tipt-style trials, designed to always have a significant chance of failure, with Jhiru-type mobs giving guaranteed drops of such gear. (If Jhiru = bracer, imagine what kind of mob would drop a breastplate...)<br />
<br />
2) Time-intensive quests with rare mobs and long spawns, as per the new VP quests. (Raising multiple factions, competing with farmers for Zlandicar, farming ultra-rare tradeskill components...)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm all for this. Something that is to vadds (or even elemental) as thurg armor was to skyshrine would pretty much shut me up completely. I'm utterly uninterested in doing more of the same ldons for better gear. I'm still farming hards for drops and I hope to never do an ldon by the time I'm done.<br />
<br />
I've really been enjoying 1 group farming BoT towers, and am ready for something more difficult, just so long as it isn't totally undoable with a single group. Maybe some elemental mold droppers can be done 1 group, but I sure haven't heard of it, and the flagging is a total pain in the ass without a guild.</div></div><hr />

To me, both of these are more difficult than grinding 20 hard LDONs per piece of armor, and I would be surprised if most non-raiders end up preferring them to the LDON model.<br />
<br />
This wouldn't be as hard as you'd think.  If Jhiru = bracer and has ~60k hp, than Jhiru Sr. for BP can be ~100k hp.  Making the hp higher on a high DPS mob will make the encounter way more difficult.  Also, it doesn't have to be that same method as you describe. <br />
<br />
For example, the BoT Wind Tower  boss sometimes drop an Ornate BP mold.  This can be done the same way in these new GoD zones - put a miniboss that you need 12-18 people to do, that hits a bit harder than Jhiru.  I understand that this is a raid, but then a BP is a very sizable upgrade.  I am not adverse to raids.  I am adverse to raids that take 48+ people to do.<br />
<br />
I would not mind quests either, personally.  If they implemented an elemental planes key sidequest that took 3 months to do, I would be all over it.  Remember that we non-raiders are not the same as casuals.  I would define non-raiders as people who play almost to just as much as raiders, except for whatever reason they don't raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Woot Naubi got what we actually bitching about! Brutul does too.<br />
<br />
BB (VT) - majority of non-raiders here never had problem with understanding that a zone or two per expansion may be off limits to them unless they wana raid and do pharms. We were content with that system. You got your uber loot from VT which was not all that much fucking better then the stuff casual could get from unlocked zones providing they put in the effort.<br />
<br />
Now half of expansion is locked and while best casual gear has lets say 150HP per item raiders get 300hp. Thats just mesuring hp btw which is not all that mesures character power. Having raiders on their high horse saying it always been that way... Well it was not the case before PoP. High End raider vs hard core non-rader had at best 20-25% differentce in &quot;character power&quot;, thats overall rough gauge of dps and tank-ability for warriors and other shit for other classes.<br />
<br />
I dont have time now but you can compare yourself lets say Luclin gear. VT versus gear from Velious and time-sink quests. You will see what I am talking about. Also roughly same AAs count since everyone xped at same spots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Content must reflect content ... and if they added EP grade armor to single groupable events, then you are looking at 1 groupable instanced dungeons on par with Tipt and Kod`Taz ... which is perfectly ok.<br />
<br />
The problem is this ... these encounters are already available, with a few very nice pieces of gear to be gotten from them.  Some of you guys, however, have not taken the initiative to get whats already there.  But why is this?? Oh yeah ... i forgot ... either <br />
<br />
a) you literally cant (your gear at present makes you worthless there)<br />
or <br />
b) your gear &quot;could&quot; get you through with a talented group, but you lack the friends/connections required to get said groups, and pickups won't take you in because youre too close to the &quot;not good enough&quot; line.<br />
<br />
You cannot expect to jump from crusty to EP gear in a single bound.  If they added such a method for non-raiders to get EP gear, then i'd wager you'd have the same crowd as here in another rants thread titled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sony fucked casuals .. new content too difficult&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of you guys claim you need better gear available for single groups and non-raiders.  Why, then, have you not gotten the gear available to you yet from single groupable encounters?  My guess is because leap-frogging progression steps only works with LDoN in that you can do easies for a long time to get takish armor way out of your league.  Tsk ... the nerve of sony thinking people should need to complete content appropriate to the gear they are getting.  What nerve!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well for starters you( the general people saying this would be a bad thing ) claim we should get single group items, like the mask in katta with 40 ac, 100 hp and 25 str. that is not 1 group for our kind of people that is 2 at the minimum<br />
<br />
Or the signet of might, that is not a single group thing because ep is not something you can single group into, the cash to get a chaining is not something everyone can get, costs make it near impossible.<br />
<br />
Instructing us to get earth rings and ele bows also falls victim to us just not having enough cash, you also expect us to do GoD when no one there would take us (as warriors, other classes dont get the same stupid assholes &lt; whats ur hp? *tells em* no response &gt;<br />
<br />
there is a little we could do here and there, and things that are possible (not probible) we could do to move up, but be honest would you have bothered with sol ro if it required you to collect twenty thousand orc pawn scalps? hell no, why expect us to do things just as tedious?</div></div><hr />

This is the fallacy of fuckwitism - listing numbers plucked out of the sky as if they had any meaning.<br />
<br />
If the EP/PoTime BP mob is found behind a multitude of flags, the dropping mob is Rallos Zek or Quarm in PoTime, and requires 70ish people to kill when first defeated, then what should a proportionally equal difficulty mob be for a group to kill to acquire a near equal BP?<br />
<br />
It is this reason IMO such a BP will not be sold by LDoN merchants - there is NO proportional effort by an individual or a group possible that is fair to those who have completed the flagging requirements and defeated RZ and Quarm.<br />
<br />
Y'all have the LDoN BP, potentially the Kizrak BP which will be pretty trivial at level 70 and whatever is in OoW.<br />
<br />
OoW is &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot; and waiting for the release date. What's in it is in it and to salivate over a number of players making an assinine claim that casual or non-raiders &quot;deserve&quot; a near RZ/Quarm BP (denied off LDoN Merchants) and getting all excited is ludicrous. If OoW mudflates you into such a BP, well grats. But if it doesn't, tfb. RZ and Quarm have such a BP - go get it.<br />

I work till 9pm and dont' get on usually till 10pm.  I play till midnight, then play an hour or two in the mornings for *xp* time.  Total played time a week 20ish hours.<br />

I'm the extreme of a casual player.  I'm also in Time.  Don't come whining to me. I work for everything I have.  Whether through careful use of DKP or xping in zones that can benefit me with the time i do have.<br />
<br />
Casuals can be casual and go anywhere.  It's not CASUAL people that are whining.   It's LAZY people.<br />
<br />
Sorry but unless your guild only raids 10 hours a week, your argument holds no weight because for most raid guilds 10 hours a week is barely enough contribution to even keep you on the roster.  Maybe your guild is extremely efficient and only raids 2 nights a week.  If that's the case then I'm wrong and I apologize but showing up a couple times a week to collect your time gear on the backs of the hard work of guildmates who actually show up is what I would call lazy...<br />
<br />
The only thing someone would get in my guild for showing up 10 hours a week is the boot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you're working on a first kill for progression through content then yes that raid will be MUCH harder than any xp group.  Getting 50 people to all put their best effort forward at the same time and properly coordinate their efforts is a lot more challenging than getting 6 people to do the same.<br />
<br />
Most raids are NOT attempts at first kills for progression.  Most raids are for farming content that you've already mastered to gear up your people so you can get that next first kill in another month or two when you're better geared as a guild.  Farming raid content is NOT hard.  It's time consuming and repetetive just like doing LDON over and over for a casual player is.  It's the effort required for those widely separated &quot;first kills&quot; that really separate the 2.  If raiding was always as easy as the &quot;farming&quot; phase then single group gear should be almost as good.  It's not though.<br />
<br />
Raiders pay their dues during the sessions where they're learning a new encounter and failing over and over again with a net xp loss and zero loot as reward for their time.  Farming EP named for armor molds isn't hard.  Beating RZ for the first time so you could zone in was.  Farming time isn't hard.  Beating the Rathe Council for the first time was a royal pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
If raid loot wasn't significantly better than single group loot then nobody would raid.  There wouldn't be any point.</div></div><hr />

Apolyon you and I both know the encounter can be one-grouped consistently by sub-ornate geared toons. I've done it, and have a BP to show for it. A guy on my server regularly farms it with a 5boxed set of time geared tons. I call that trivial, I don't know what you call it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
BattleBlade you're reading comprehension is absolutely appalling. You don't debate, you just type bullshit over and over again. <br />
<br />
Nowhere did I say I wanted Jhiru to drop a BP too. I said I wanted the rest of the set, somewhere attainable without 72 best friends. In another thread I suggest a progression with smaller pieces like hands and arms dropping in vxed like encounters, ending with a BP from KT+ encounters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eagleclaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Here's my opinion of the situation.  <br />
<br />
Summary: EP gear on LDoN's is a BAD idea.  Let LDoN's do what they were meant to do.  Allow folks to skip over much of Velious and Luclin content.<br />
<br />
There are three current  advancement paths to progress along.<br />
<br />
1. Level<br />
2. AA<br />
3. Gear<br />
<br />
Prior to PoP releasing, the main paths to advance in power were level and AA.  This meant that opportunity for progression was there for everyone since all you had to do was keep grinding out amazingly dull xp camps and you'd get it.  Your hard core players would level up quickly and consume the content.  Your more casual players would take their time, pace it, do mostly group xping but still eventually attain that level of power. <br />
<br />
Better gear was available to raiders but it wasn't until PoP came out that it became a major progression path in and of itself.  Once that happened the opportunity available to raiders and non-raiders became drastically different.  No matter how much time someone put in, they basically needed to raid to progress.<br />
<br />
I don't believe that the solution resides in adding EP gear to elementals though.  I believe that any such solution would be hacking old broken content with a chainsaw.  <br />
<br />
Here's my proposal:<br />
<br />
1. We need to get back to level based advancement.  A level 70 Time geared player SHOULD be much more powerful than a level 70 LDoN geared character.  However, a level 70 LDoN geared peep should be powerful enough that with 3 or so groups they could take down the flagging mobs in PoP and gain access to the EP eventually.  This is consistent with all past expansions.  You can't be a dork and do this.. but a quality player who simply chooses a different style of play should be able to manage.<br />
<br />
2. A level 70 in Time gear, SHOULD be able to race through new content ( GoD/OOW ) much faster than a level 70 in LDoN gear.  However, a 70th level character should be of sufficient power to participate in new content, at least to the point that they can upgrade themselves enough, with the appropriate amount of work and effort, to continue progressing through the new content.. in effect &quot;skipping&quot; pop if they so desire.  Risk reward should still be in place, but at the same time, people should experience progression while consuming new content, not endless hours of ldons over and over again.  I dont think anyone really wants to do that.<br />
<br />
I believe much of the strife we're seeing today in GoD stems from the lack of level 70.  The encounters were geared towards level 70 characters.  So if the whiners can suspend their moaning for one moment and just imagine.  If level 70 were in game today... would it be fair to say that a LDoN/Pre-EP tank would need to be 70th level to tank the same things that a 65th level PotTime geared warrior could?<br />
<br />
My opinion is that this is perfectly reasonable.  If you think so too, then the answer is to just hang tight until OOW releases with the level 70 expansion.  Putting it another way... I'll agree that the content now is BROKEN.. however, I think everyone needs to look beyond our current content to find the solutions.   <br />
<br />

Verant/SoE calls it risk or challange and always has. Fine, be &quot;the voice of reason&quot;, but Quarm loot should not drop from Moss Snakes or the turn in of 3000 Moss Snake Fangs. There are such quests, but not a lot and they certainly aren't the game's central theme.<br />
<br />
There is a progression and more difficult boss mobs drop better loot. Boss mobs that require more players to kill them drop better loot. That's the way the game is designed. That's the way FFXI is and WoW, and D&amp;D and I rather expect most successful RPG's.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
You keep mixing extremes and it undermines your argument.<br />
<br />
We aren't killing moss snakes.  You can keep saying that despite our request that you stop, and you keep forcing us to make the request and point out the error each time, but repetition won't make it any more true.  It only makes it clear that you are dodging the real issues.<br />
<br />
We aren't asking for Quarm loot.  Again, you can continue to make that analogy if it pleases you, but it only highlights that you can't seem to address intelligently our actual requests. <br />
<br />
I've said it before and I'll say it again (each time you repeate the &quot;more difficult mobs drop more difficult loot&quot; monotony):  Of course 72 people require a more difficult encounter.  There are 72 people worth of difficulty to spread around.  A six-man group just doesn't need that much difficulty in a single mob in order to render the encounter as challenging or more challenging for those six people.  Hence, when you speak of difficulty you need to factor in the numerator. <br />
<br />
There are several successful MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER games that do not require you to AMASS MULTIPLE players.  I've already responded to how you are incorrectly using a term to describe the onling gaming industry.  FFXI does not require massive raids.  City of Heroes has the same progression available for every player (in fact, it also allows for side-kicking, which would have been a fabulous idea for Sony to impliment). <br />
<br />
<br />
Actually there has always been a single group progression path. In the original release it got you Crafted, but not Indicolite. Later it got you Thurgadin Quest or PoG (but the BP took more than a group), or Cobalt (but not the BP or Legs), but not ToV, Skyshrine or an Epic.<br />
<br />
<br />
The original release did not contain Hate.  <br />
<br />
Your points here again completely undermine your point.  My casual guild was able to head into Hate with two groups right around the release of Kunark.  I was in full Indocolite with Vigdis.  I was just in this armor one expansion behind.  <br />
<br />
My casual guild quickly obtained Thurgadin armor with the release of the expansion.  If you check my bank on my magelo you'll see an entire set of Champions sitting in the bank.  The BP did not take more effort - it still dropped from the 8th Ring armory or from the arena.  Just after the release of Luclin, my casual guild entered TOV with two-three groups with an alliance and later 1-2 guild groups.  If you check my bank, you'll note I have a full set of Skyshrine armor as well.  You'll also notice that I have my epic, and I obtained the epic just at the release of Luclin.  I even acquired an ST weapon with a single group during PoP.  In other words, I obtained the all of the &quot;raiding&quot; gear, I just got them one or two expansions behind.<br />
<br />
You may be correct that a progression did exist.  But in that progression scheme the hard-core non raider was always able to obtain the same rewards after sufficient time had passed.  I was able to cloth myself in the &quot;end game&quot; armor.  You now claim that I &quot;shouldn't be half of what you are&quot; - but in your little history lesson here I was able to be EXACTLY what you were. <br />
<br />
<br />
I am not asking for a redesign of EQ.  I am asking for it to be brought back to what it once was.  In the very examples you used in your quote and that I disproved in my response.  The design of the game was always that non-raiders could obtain the same rewards, just at a later stage in the game.  You may not like my logical analysis and reasoning here but it doesnt' change the facts.  That, however, is not the case with PoP because Sony has locked those rewards behind arbitrary barriers.  PoP is the aberation here, not the historical model.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Apol, and while we are at it, lets make sure our raiding guilds require all applicants to have first obtained Indocolite, then Thurgadin, then CoV, then Kizrack's before we upgrade them in Raex.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Read the whole thing there plz (i had to edit it).  Raex is not the next level right after kizraks.  Kizraks may do you fine in visible slots, but the non-visible slots are wear he is hurting ... and sorely.  He CAN make the step up into raex rather easily ... just not with what he has now.<br />

If you want to Skip VT and hop into the elementals, then you need to get everything that LDoN hard (droppables and purchased augments) and GoD (1groupable stuffs) has to offer.<br />

Unless you can sit there and go toe to toe with EP monsters (tanking them) then i'm not convinced that Raex is the next step up.  As is ... most EP mold dropping bosses in EP would 1-round him at 8k or barely over 8k.</div></div><hr />

Apolyon all this I realize. I'm not expecting elemental now. There ARE, however, people who are at my Step 3 Ikkinz profile NOW, and are getting stuck on those visible slots. I'm advocating for them, because it'll be me in a few months.<br />

Look at my step 1 profile and you'll see I'm already planning to do EXACTLY what you suggest, except I didn't bother adding the augs into the profile.

Edit: Response to Apolyons second comment.<br />
<br />
The point I'm trying to make is that I CAN'T make the jump to Raex, even given my Step 4 kt+ profile. It requires raid forces and flags, and I take issue with that. <br />
<br />
My guild options are limited, and besides, it's a game, I should have choice. I CAN go get Raex NOW by afking through open raids, and I think thats a really lame alternative to having another set of armor available somewhere.</div></div><hr />

I apologize.  I did not take the time to look at all your planned progressions.  Instead i went soley from the comment you made.  From my understanding if you want to bypass VT you need to follow an order something like this:<br />
<br />
1. Make sure you have your aa's<br />
2. Ornate<br />
3. LDoN/HardLDoN for augments/drops <br />
4. GoD 1-groupable augments/upgrades<br />
5. Small 1groupable events pre-EP which yield nice armor/weapons<br />
6. Hop in with a raiding crew (albeit pickup or guild) and get flagged<br />
<br />
You dont even have to buy any LDoN armor as kizraks works just peachy.  Most casual warriors arent given the hp/ac bone by not having access to EP armor ... it's because they have tunnelvision for their visible armor slots and dont concentrate on the slots you cant see.  Getting a the full set of LDoN nodrop invisibles is huge.  2 rings, 1 cloak, 1 earing, 1 necklace, 1 mask ... all of which have 85-90hps and good stats/saves.  Then take a look at the boots/bracer/gloves available and you have even more slots with 75-90hps each and damn fine ac for that level of progression.  Add in the augments and you can easily add another 200 raw hps and 50ac.<br />
<br />
I figured you wanted to jump from 2 to 6 ... but i was wrong as you did have a planned progression map.</div></div><hr />

You've more or less got it. I'm skeptical about if I really want to do 6 though, and I know for certain I don't want to hop in with a sub-par raiding crew, so I've gotta be pretty beefed up to get into a solid guild with all the uber warriors on my server.<br />

<br />
Personally? If it was me, it'd be because I would actually want to do something that provides a significant upgrade in this game without requiring I gather 40-50+ &quot;friends&quot; who have a superiority complex.<br />
<br />
Raiding seriously isn't as hard as raiders seem to think.  I've been along on several, both on my characters and friend's.  IMO, it's harder work with much greater chance for failure in groups than it is in raids, where you'll have multiple players to take over.  More of the challenge involved stems simply from having more people, not from the difficulty of the mob.  If you decide to bring stress and frustration into the raid scenario, that's your problem.<br />
<br />
And please, BB, cut the BS on killing 3000 moss snakes.  And anyone else, cut the BS on how &quot;the solution to getting gear for non-raiders is to raid&quot;.<br />
<br />
The majority of non-raiders simply want an upgrade path that does not require raiding.  Many people, including Vigdis, supported a harder difficulty style of LDoN to get the points for this supposed higher gear.  It only brings my view of raider's intelligence and reasoning down to see them state that non-raiders want EP level gear for killing 3000 level 1 mobs or several mobs that only hit for 300s.  Try reading what is actually being said, you might understand that you're only coming off as an illiterate asshole that is arguing something he doesn't understand.<br />
<br />
If you would actually read, you would understand the following:<br />
<br />
Non-raiders want an upgrade path that is equal to the level of gear raiders have had access to for quite a while and has a corresponding difficulty in both time spent and difficulty of the mobs without requiring 40-50 other players.  Many suggested Hard LDoNs, which are near to the difficulty of many elemental level mobs.<br />
<br />
BTW, I lost intersting in playing EQ because of LDoN.  Doing hundreds of adventures that are quite literally the exact same thing over and over and over again for a month to get one piece of gear is not fun, nor challenging.  Unfortunately, this pretty much is the only way I could progress.  At least raiders either get different options they can go do, or otherwise get many pieces of gear to drop per raid during their farming runs.  It might be the boon to casuals, but when it's your only real choice for upgrades for several months you decide it's not worth it.  And it really isn't for most casuals.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, a large number of raiders just simply don't understand that non-raiders simply don't like to be surrounded by 40-50 assholes who seem vaguely similar to apo, BB, etc in order to actually do something significant.</div></div><hr />

You still don't get it.  You acknowledge that we non raiders have a progression plan, we make decisions, consider upgrades, and are determined to obtain them.<br />
<br />
What you don't acknowledge is that we will NOT be joining a raiding crew merely to obtain flags that make available zones we would not have to have a raiding crew to experience in.  Moreover, the raiding crew necessary to access those zones is far larger than the one we would need to acquire EP loot in those zones.  It is the whole number 6 with which I take issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Eagleclaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I just dont think arbitrarily opening up content to people that didn't earn it is the right thing to do either.  PoP is what it is.  Lets just move past that and look at how we can address the inequities without screwing things up further.  <br />
<br />
I also dont think that putting EP gear on mobs that, for better or worse, really aren't that difficult is fair either.<br />
<br />
After all the energy people have put into their characters, 1 month isn't to long to wait for a possible solution that doesn't involve trivializing so many other folks efforts.  You can choose to turn your back on it if you wish, but I suspect that all of these arguements will be moot once you get to 70th level.  If they aren't then sure, at that point lets revisit the need to provide better gear for quality players who are genuinly struggling with some arbitrary method.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion was to :<br />
1. Let level 70 close the gap a bit between a Time geared and LDoN geared characters powerl evel and then<br />
2. Let new gear, now accessable by a level 70 LDoN geared toon, continue to close the gap - never completely - but still close it more than it is now between LDoN and Time, which finally leads to <br />
3. Level 70 casual player being able to participate in other new content, without having to have gone through PoP.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that by the time casuals get to #3, a quality group of players could probably go back to do PoP at a leisurely pace with a minimal sized force if they wanted.. but it shouldn't be required to continue advancing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">If level 70 were in game today... would it be fair to say that a LDoN/Pre-EP tank would need to be 70th level to tank the same things that a 65th level PotTime geared warrior could?<br />
<br />
While the extra 5 levels will give warriors 3 new damage tables and some new mitigation since mobs that were once red are now blue, a bigger part of that is that priest classes will be 70th. As my GoD single group index (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8214&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15) detailed, level 70 buffs will give every warrior, no matter their gear level, 725 more hitpoints. New shaman buffs for strength and agility still matter even if your stats are capped. The new cleric heal is as much an upgrade over Holy Light as HL was over Supernal (read: huge). I've done DD using Supernal Light (without a heal focus), with the paladin tank playing second healer using Light of Order. Pious Light is going to trivialize the fuck out of Jhiru/Ikkinz/one-group named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">If you're working on a first kill for progression through content then yes that raid will be MUCH harder than any xp group.  Getting 50 people to all put their best effort forward at the same time and properly coordinate their efforts is a lot more challenging than getting 6 people to do the same.<br />
<br />
Most raids are NOT attempts at first kills for progression.  Most raids are for farming content that you've already mastered to gear up your people so you can get that next first kill in another month or two when you're better geared as a guild.  Farming raid content is NOT hard.  It's time consuming and repetetive just like doing LDON over and over for a casual player is.  It's the effort required for those widely separated &quot;first kills&quot; that really separate the 2.  If raiding was always as easy as the &quot;farming&quot; phase then single group gear should be almost as good.  It's not though.<br />
<br />
Raiders pay their dues during the sessions where they're learning a new encounter and failing over and over again with a net xp loss and zero loot as reward for their time.  Farming EP named for armor molds isn't hard.  Beating RZ for the first time so you could zone in was.  Farming time isn't hard.  Beating the Rathe Council for the first time was a royal pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
If raid loot wasn't significantly better than single group loot then nobody would raid.  There wouldn't be any point.<br />
<br />
In the first 3 months of an expansion I buy this theory. I feel for the guys in GoD, it must have really sucked (and still does at the last zone). But EP/Time is a joke. We had a guild on our server go from VT farming to EP flagged in 2 weeks. How did they do it, guess what they had 1/2 dozen former hardcore time raiders. It was like farming for them on the first try. The info is out there if you want it (not saying you should want it though). But just as BB pointed out if I dont use a pooka then I am a fool, if you dont get the EP/Time info you are in the same boat (personally I dont agree...)<br />

But my warrior is not associated with the guild.  You want to know why?  Because she was my main character when I started playing this game.  She progressed through Kunark and Velious and Luclin with an extremely small guild.  That guild fractured into &quot;Unhomed&quot; (if you read Donaldson then you know the reference).  Unhomed began with six people, who had to log in bots in order to create the guild.  Everyone was an equal and an officer, everyone had access to the administration of the forums and site.  Everyone decided loot together.  Slowly that guild grew into around 18 solid players.  These are the most skilled people I will ever know.  We were practically best friends and knew all about one another.  IF someone was up that one of us needed, we didn't wait for people to log in, we gave them a call.  When my ToV breastplate dropped and I wanted to pass it along to someone else in the guild because I already wore Champions, I was shouted down with congratulations from everyone in the guild before I could even voice that opinion on the loot award.   I was Vigdis, the Warrior Goddess, and I stood between peril and my friends.  <br />
<br />
Well, as you advocate here in this thread, &quot;There are 100 different guilds on each server to choose from. Find one you like and run with it. &quot;  With the release of PoP I recognized that my guild simply could not progress any further in the game.  LDoN was not yet released, we had done all of the lower-tier single-group quests for access to harder planes and we had completed the various lower-tier item quests.  I wanted to progress and I made that fucking decision to leave and join a raiding guild.  It was resoundingly the single fucking worst decision I have EVER made in EQ.  Sure, the guild I joined was nice, but they were not Unhomed and they could never be Unhomed.  I had abandoned my friends for the sake of EQ content. <br />
<br />
It is complete bullshit to suggest to us that we should make a decision to join a guild and raid.  I did that and I raided with Melcindria, and I still do.  But I raided myself right into retiring from EQ.  Why?  Because as nice my guild currently is, they are not my best friends and I see no hope of that ever changing.  These people are my co-workers, not the people I go hang out in the bar with after work.  I want the people I hang out in the bar with and I wish to fucking god I'd never made the decision I had to.<br />
<br />
You are right, there is &quot;no greater joy than accomplishing great things with good friends ... and a degree of pride goes along with knowing that you and your chums have done something neat.&quot;  That is why I do not raid with Vigdis.  Because she is my pixelated memory of Unhomed and I will not sell out again for the sake of arranging my life around a broken playstyle model.  My best memories of this game are all based around my friends in Unhomed and I will never have that feeling back in a raiding guild.  I do not wish any other non raider to be forced into the decision I made.  Such a choice should not NEED to be made and its fucking disgraceful that you should come here today and tell me I can progress if only I abandon my ideals and my friends.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Eagleclaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">And yet this is what we've always done right?  Many guilds use the power gains ( either from level, AA, or gear ) from a new expansion to partake of the high end content from the previous one.  For years it was a general rule in my guild that we'd be doing content 1 expansion old.  This wasn't by design, it's just the way things worked out because we were more casual.<br />
<br />
What we're seeing today is the effect of not havnig a serious expansion in EQ for to long a period of time.  If something like GoD ( with the proper level expansion ) had been released over a year ago instead of LoY/LDoN then a couple things would likely be true right now:<br />
<br />
* Many raiding guilds would have moved out of PoP by now and<br />
* Smaller, more casual guilds, would have benefited from the level increases, spell upgrades, and readily available gear upgrades so that they COULD take down PoP encounters with fewer people and experience that content.<br />

But the target (i.e. content) will just shift further if history holds. All you have to do is look at the gods being moved to 80. OoW should have level 65-68 non boss mobs so the progression will merely hold constant (assuming the future reflects the past). Ok so OoW will enable many to do GoD, what kind of shit is that? Great if you are a business (i.e. fuck your customer) but bad for most real people.<br />
<br />
And dont argue that there is small progression out there for casuals. Hell there is small progression out there for everyone, havent seen a technically capped magelo yet. Its an issue of what is achieveable under reasonable circumstances. Yeah I am working on cranking out the 60+ AA I still need to be anywhere near where I want to be (WA5, St5, finish my DPS AAs which have been a focus for my playstyle) but I can chose between aaxp(PoV,etc.) and equipment (LDoN) right now. GoD can occasionally be a nice fit between the two in certain specific cases but not as much as a like (the Jihru set if it existed might motivate me to flag my whole grp). And yeah I know raiders chose xp vs equipment as well but their access to both (especially xp which is irritating given GoD AA reqs) is far better even when in single grps.<br />

Sorry just flipped back through and found the questions on 45 and 48.  Not sure how i missed them, though your comment prior to the question on 45 may have turned me off to the idea of paying much attention to you ... you know the derrogatory half-question about me gimping through with my uberly geared friends and their hasted pookas.<br />
<br />
Anywho, our best runs were with guild groups.  We've done both vxed and tipt with and without hasted charm pets.  It is considerably faster/easier with a charmed pet, but the xp is very very nice without the pet, so sometimes we skip the enchanter and just add a random guildy rog/ranger/wizard.<br />
<br />
KHJ i've tanked a handful of times pre and post defensive nerf to tipt.  Before the nerf it was rather easy with or without a charmed pet, but out of 3 tries without the pet since the nerf, i've only been successful once without the ability to hit my defensive disc.  With a hasted pet its a win every time.  Still, though, we have not yet exhausted our ideas on alternate strategies to KHJ.  I imagine the following would work rather well:<br />
<br />
-Lead off with our bard deftdance with 2 rangers shooting  (bard dispells haste and lands gimpo bard slow) ... Ranger 1 hops in with a snare or 2 and weaponshield only to pass aggro to ranger 2 and trueshot ... ranger 2 weaponshields only to let me ae taunt and furious .. then backing up to trueshot ... shaman slowed 20 seconds ago and a cleric chain healing me after furious falls ... /shrug<br />
<br />
None of this is a must, mind you, when we happen to have our guildy cleric along who has the new GoD quick heal (over 4k quickly with no crits and decent foci). <br />
<br />
It'd be easier with EP/Time level gear, but it isnt altogether impossible without.  Your average pickup wont have the kind of succcess we run into, but then again your average pickup does not consist of the same 6-10 people who both work together well and are at least moderatly equipped for the content.</div></div><hr />

Your post encapsulates every single reason why i choose NOT to raid.  I have the time.  I have the dedication because I spent the many hundreds of hours farming LDoN, Sewers, Ferubi, and Vxed.  But i will not do so because people are more important than loot, at least to me.<br />
<br />
But what what do I do after I aug out all my visible slots with 40hp LDoN gear?  I've no idea.  Some of you tell me Tipt, but even the trash there can rip me apart.  That's why I'm proposing a new set of gear, which I'll call 'sub-elemental armor', along with a new set of challenges that I can tackle to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Eagleclaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Exactly Wraith.. but instead of putting it on tedious trivial LDoN's, why not intersperse it into the new OOW/GoD content?  As you expand in power from 65-70, you gain the capacity to obtain the new sub-elemental gear while enjoying and exploring new stuff instead of the same ole same ole.<br />

Once you get your gear upgrades from the new content you'll be better prepared for new challenges, or you have the option to back and tackle PoP flags if you want.<br />

<br />
I already made my own guild, Gunnar.  And no one left that guild in the over a year of its existence.  I was the first to leave and with my abandonment, the concept fractured.  I am not interested in arguing with you the possibilities of restarting such an enterprise; I'm pointing out the underlying hypocrisy and flaws in Apolyon's statement that I should purview raiding guilds and take my pick.  In my opinion, a raiding guild, no matter how nice or non-mandatory, can never be the same as a close-knit family guild.  The two concepts are fundamentally opposed to each other.  Well, in order to try and redeem myself and maybe rekindle my past, I now raid on Vigdis with an extremely small guild of friends.  They will never have big numbers; that is not what the guild is about.  They will NEVER take down RZ, and they will never take down EP gods.  But they could eventually progress into taking down EP loot droppers.  Only RZ stands in their way.<br />
<br />
As a result, I am advocating - and have done so through 55 pages of slop - for the removal of arbitrary barriers to the planes.  In the alternative, I am advocating for an alternative gear-up path so that I and this guild can progress into future expansions.  But at the core of this argument, non raiders are advocating for the end of a one-progression model that has lead to the raiding, the backflagging, the frustration, the quitting, the burn-out, of PoP.</div></div><hr />

Your post encapsulates every single reason why i choose NOT to raid.  I have the time.  I have the dedication because I spent the many hundreds of hours farming LDoN, Sewers, Ferubi, and Vxed.  But i will not do so because people are more important than loot, at least to me.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you havent been fortunate enough to find a nice guild to run with.  I've been in 3 guilds (one disbanded to reform my current one), and they've been my best friends and closest allies.  <br />
<br />
Refusing to be in a guild because &quot;people are more important than loot&quot; is a valid reason, but I'd suggest that you simply havent foudn the right guild.  Not every guild is comprised of loot-centered assmongers.</div></div><hr />

As you expand in power from 65-70, you gain the capacity to obtain the new sub-elemental gear while enjoying and exploring new stuff instead of the same ole same ole.<br />
<br />
Once you get your gear upgrades from the new content you'll be better prepared for new challenges, or you have the option to back and tackle PoP flags if you want.<br />
<br />
E.C.<br />
<br />
I would LOVE it if they interspersed this 'sub-elemental armor' into GoD.  It kind of exists already as in Vxed you can get an ac12 115 earring, and ac40 110hp legs.<br />
<br />
It just needs to exist in more slots, and provide more ac.  It doesn't have to match Raex armor ac, but just close enough to close the gap.  Maybe 8-10ac less on each piece, llike i said earlier, and 1/2 to 2/3 of the stats.  Hell you dont even need to put any of the melee focuses on it and I will be happy.<br />
<br />
Just throw this smattering of stuff into Vxed-like trials (IE like Sewer trials), and have the 6man group at it.  You won't see people in full suits of this 'sub-elemental' armor for a while either.  It took me several several hours to just get my Vxed earring and legs.  Imagine doing that for the whole set.<br />
<br />
Then you'll have toons that people might choose to tank for a Tipt trial, or for an xp/named hunting group in Kod'Taz, because you won't that far behind the elemental equipped toon.<br />
<br />
I just don't agree that I should wait for OoW to do GoD stuff.  We are already running out of stuff to do as a guild.  We can't do Ssra because you need a good amount of toons for that still, even at lvl 65.  Can't do PoP past a certain point, again because of the numbers issue.  Our best luck now is to try for Seru with a raid force of 18.  Once we do that, well we can farm him for a few weeks.  Then what? <br />
<br />
More LDoN?  Um yay?</div></div><hr />

What is the end result?  You now have a lot of people in the Planes that couldnt before, but they still cant utilize it for the EP gear they are drooling over.  After a month in EP's they'll be just as bored with it as they are with BoT now.  I know because I'm currently there.  I've had the pleasure of MTing for a private raid club in the EP's a handful of times, but by-in-large they are simply alternateive zones for xp.<br />

Opening the EP's wont solve all the problems expressed here, as you still cant &quot;gear up&quot; in the EP's without raiding aside from some craptastic single groupable mobs which are on par with Hard LDoN loot anyways.<br />
<br />
It's a bandaid solution for a perceived larger problem.  In the long run it would only cause more problems than it would help.  Thankfully, Sony knows this.</div></div><hr />

Because, Eagleclaw, in every other expansion in the history of EQ the armor sets gained were eventually made possible and available to non &quot;had core raiders.&quot;  Why should that change?  What you are suggesting is that a non-raider ought to just skip PoP altogether eventually.  Pretend it doesn't exist.  How is that progression; how is that similiar to any other expansion in the history of EQ? It is not.  Is not how EQ was designed or how it was implimented expansion after expansion.   The concept is not hard to grasp and I cannot understand why raiders are so blind to it.  POP broke the model.  Rather than letting the content be the determining factor in whether someone could &quot;hack it,&quot; Sony set up an artificial barrier. Now, no matter how far we progress into future expansions, non raiders cannot make it through that barrier.  Unlike Hate or Fear or Air; unlike Trak or VS or Severlious or KC; unlike Kael or Thurg or ToV; unlike Umbral or Deep or Acrylia or Ssra.   To suggest that we ought to continue our progression by completely bypassing an entire expansion is missing the point entirely in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Recruit.  Every guild/group in the game runs into the exact same problem.  I'm sure there are 100 nice people out there such as yourself looking for what you have to offer them.  You could even go so far as to seek out other small guilds such as yourself and form a coalition.  It happens on my server all the time.<br />
<br />
Team Japan-  a coalition of about 5 or 6 small asian guilds on Mith Marr who trucked all the way up into time though coordinated efforts of small, close-knit guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Sorry but unless your guild only raids 10 hours a week, your argument holds no weight because for most raid guilds 10 hours a week is barely enough contribution to even keep you on the roster.  Maybe your guild is extremely efficient and only raids 2 nights a week.  If that's the case then I'm wrong and I apologize but showing up a couple times a week to collect your time gear on the backs of the hard work of guildmates who actually show up is what I would call lazy...<br />
<br />
The only thing someone would get in my guild for showing up 10 hours a week is the boot.<br />
<br />
Khumak and those of you who have taken this out of context.  I have 47% raid attendance currently and usually go between 53% and 46% depending on the week.<br />
<br />
I'm not in a QVIC guild.  I'm a family style guild that makes no mandatory requirement on raid attendance, and i still make the 50% mark.<br />
<br />
My usual raid hours for a month is 36 - 54 over 8 months of raiding.  That's over a work week of JUST raiding per month.  Saying that I am &quot;piggy backing&quot; or mooching is hardly accurate.  I am a 50% raider who stays late and is on like clockwork at 10pm EST every night.<br />
<br />
Don't blame me because I embrace the  game in a guild that fits my schedule and I take the initiatave to play the game to the best of my abilities with short time.  I also don't use /lfg.  I pick and choose my groups.  <br />
<br />
The argument was that content was not available to casuals/non-raiders.  I'm telling you that i am LIVING proof that the system works for one and all.  I feel that if all you want to do is XP, then Fine XP.  There are a multitude of zones available for it.<br />
<br />
If you wish to see certain zones you must work for them.  I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.  You want a nice home in RL?  work for it.  You want to see cool zones?  work for it.  If you do not.  and have it handed to you.....it has NO VALUE.<br />
<br />
So when i see people wanting ubar content and ubar level gear basically handed to them....yeah i scoff.  It will hold no value, and thus is worthless.<br />
<br />
If you want the gear and the experience of new zones.  YOU CAN DO IT.  This game is not blocked off from anyone, and saying that it is is is quite simply a red herring.  The ONLY way you could ever not make it through content is if you absolutely refuse to join a raid.<br />
<br />
And I'm sorry.  This is an MMPoRG.  It's major focus is social interaction......know people...you'll go places....<br />
<br />
OR wait you could SIX BOX b/c you have absolutely no social skills to maintain a network of friends, and ALL by your lonesome you can stew in LDoN's by *yourself* then attack folks on the board who bootstrap it up.......go jagoff to the seventh box you have set up for porn....jerk</div></div><hr />

I addressed this already, Apol. Again, you aren't reading (or you are simply ignoring) posts and I cannot tell if its intentional or not.  Here is what I said:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=124788&amp;postcount=673<br />
<br />
I suggest to you here today that if Sony opened up the Elemental Planes, content three expansions out of date, our gripes would cease. If we really cannot handle the content with what we view to be elite skilled groups of players, so be it. But I believe that we will successfully take down the mini-mini named, and we will be able to take down some mini-named. It is of no small note that we will have access to some of the best experience zones in the game - especially important when we have to begin searching for blue or even con mobs to raise our level. <br />
<br />
The content very well may be down by raiding guilds. But mostly the raiding guilds are starting to turn their eyes elsewhere. If they had to actually compete for the mobs, I suspect they'd turn entirely to Time and GoD to progress - as they should anyway. Alternatively, you could nstance encounters and base it on an expedition-type lock out as with GoD. Either way works. The piont is that I believe there are several encounters far easier than Rallos Zek and numerous experience spots good for a single group. Let us as it! Make us complete a huge VT-style quest, but make it doable for alternative progression. <br />
<br />
<br />
That is what I believe will happen.  You can argue 'til the cows come home that I'm wrong, but that will not change my opinion and the opinions of other hard core non-raiders like me.  I honestly believe that with the 18 people I had in Unhomed we could have taken down most of the minis in Fire, done the rings pre-dust in Air, killed off a few water minis, and farmed Sol Ro and killed all the minis there.  That is the skilled group of players from which I came.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read what you wrote.  We have pickups in the EP's on my server, but in order for them to be successful they had to do a few things:<br />
<br />
1. create their own passworded channel<br />
2. create their own website and joining procedures<br />
3. draw up a points system<br />
4. log attendance blah blah<br />
.....<br />
<br />
They never consolidated under a guildname, but but they are basically the same thing.  Looks an awful lot like a guild then doesnt it?<br />
<br />
You put too much faith into the random masses.  People are greedy and as such will only come if something is in it for them (most, though not all).  To cope with this, they created virtually a guild.  So yeah ... in order for things to work out very well consolidation is kinda needed.  You cannot throw 72 random bazaar/ornate equipped folks at an EP target and expect success.<br />
<br />
I've been on, as well as leading, several pickups.  They are a nightmare for pretty much everyone involved ... especially the leaders.  You want to talk riding coat-tails??  There's your poster-child.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Eagleclaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Vigdis, I respect your opinion.. but I just simply disagree with you :)<br />
<br />
I disagree that, with future level expansions, AA, spells, and the gear that will open up, that PoP will be forever off limits to casual guilds.  Eventually you'll be able to do much of that content with a minimal group of people.  Maybe 1-4 groups.<br />
<br />
Wraith, I think we're on the same page here :)  Don't forget the really nice legs in Vxed off the trickster either :).  Also keep in mind.. in today's game something like the sewer trial or vxed/tipt is very challenging.  That will likely change drastically once level 70 becomes available.  To the point that sewers are now a cakewalk and vxed/tipt are an annoyance.  I dont know how much easier it will be exactly.. but it'll be easier.<br />
<br />
So just moving to level 70 will help a BUNCH. It will open up content beyond what you or I can do now and open up even more upgrades.  <br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that just because we've moved on to GoD doesn't mean that we have to leave behind LDoN.  The focus will just shift from LDoN armor to LDoN augs.  You can take your 10 AC augs off the armor your replacing and put them on the new sub-elemental stuff from GoD.  Or from the looks of it, there may be a whole new set of instanced content in OOW that will have something even better.<br />
<br />
I'm in total agreement with each and every person thats frustrated over the lack of level 70 in GoD.  It shoul dhave been there.  It's obvious someone at Sony thought it would be there.  Someone just dropped the ball.  As developer they have acknowledged their screw up and are working to fix it.  For my $13 a month, I would much rather have them invest the time to fix the problem in NEW stuff rather than hack together a patchwork fix for the OLD stuff.<br />
<br />
Vigdis is absolutely right that PoP is a different beast.  I still maintain though that you should just cut your losses at some point and move on.  Especially when moving on can help you achieve your goals in PoP.<br />
<br />
This is turning into a classic &quot;Who Moved My Cheese!&quot; scenerio.  Yes, it's not right that you should have to buy OOW to partake of GoD content at all.. but what can you do?  They have already admitted they screwed up and are working to fix it.  A couple months back people were really screaming about how they were going to release a new expansion while the current stuff was broken.. so they pushed back the expansion to work on stability.<br />
<br />
We're now one month away from the new expansion.  I personally believe it's worth the wait to see how things turn out.  <br />

No matter how you put it, when you have 60 people in guild, you lose some of the &quot;close-knit-ness&quot; of a guild composed of 25 people.<br />
<br />
I'm not seeking advice on how to break into the elemental planes.  I could have done that by joining a faceless raiding guild 6 months ago.  I could have elemental gear by now in the fraction of the time that I spent on LDoN, only to have subpar armor (seriously, some of the guilds on my server were backflagging and basically, according to friends, a lot of stuff that would otherwise rot went to applicants).<br />
<br />
I just want an alternate path to progression.  I don't care if I don't have the best armor.  All I want is a fighting chance.  Not a 'Hey this guy did it, and therefore it must be possible for all&quot; chance.  Currently, the only way you will have a fighting chance past certain zones is to farm LDoN for about 700 missions.  And even then you will be subpar to an elemental toon.</div></div><hr />

I'm done with all but RZ wrt PoP flags, on open raids all of them. It was a nightmare of sitting around waiting for numbers, people afk'ing and not paying attention, and repeated wipes because of all the above. I really don't want to make all my friends do the same thing so we can graduate from BoT. GoD is fun.

Absolutely.  I think 18 people can take Flamesinger, Babs, Arch, Pyronis, the birds, Blazzax, Wise, Hydrotha, Inloker, Escar, the Cursed, Caleb, Gak, Queen, Arch Mage, Rinturion, Phar, Meler and some of the Avatars.  I know 18 people can do this because I've done it with those or nearly those numbers.  I am assuming in my quote that my friends would be level 70 with all the new AA and levels that involves.   No, I do not think 18 people (geared as I envision) could take Reparm or the rings in earth.

Absolutely.  I already know of some guilds who can do this with near 18-24 numbers and are only elementally geared.<br />

You have lofty goals and for that i commend you.  Personally, i dont see how it can be done but that's just me.  If you can do it, then more power to you  :) .  Pardon my lack of faith but i dont see how you can do it without having extensively farmed EP's for a baseline starting gear and perhaps a smattering of time stuffs.  Then again, i've never been part of a hardcore raiding circuit that has pushed the envelope in such a manner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With level 70 and new AAs I wouldn't exactly call it pushing the envelope.  But with this concession, then, why not make the content available?  In some way, be it opening zones or requiring arduous alt keys, make the content available and let the non-raiding guilds limit themselves ONLY by the difficulty of the content itself.  Let me prove my lofty goals.  I think you'd be surprised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Because, Eagleclaw, in every other expansion in the history of EQ the armor sets gained were eventually made possible and available to non &quot;had core raiders.&quot; Why should that change? <br />
It didn't change.<br />
<br />
There have always been armor sets that were eventually accessible to non-raiders: Velious, Ornate, Tak.<br />
<br />
Then there were armor &quot;sets&quot; that have always required a raid, no matter how many years have passed: NTOV armor, VT armor.<br />
<br />
Raex falls into the latter category.  It will never be obtainable without a raid.<br />
<br />
Non-raiders still can't take one group into NTOV and earn a Cloak of Thorns today.  <br />
And they'll never be able to take one group into an unlocked Doomfire zone to earn a Raex mold.<br />
<br />
Four expansions didn't turn Aaryonar into Captain Bvellos for non-raiders, and four more expansions won't turn Babnoxis into Auliffe Chaoswind for non-raiders, either.<br />
<br />
The required number of players to obtain Raex will decrease over time, but it will never be reduced to 6 non-raid-equipped people.</div></div><hr />

Because i see it as a necessary hurdle to jump over to get to the next stage.<br />
<br />
I see my Progression as hurdle race on a slight uphill grade.  Occasionally, on my slow trek uphill i have to leap certain hurdles so that i can reach the next level.  If i trip and fall the first time or cant jump high enough ... i go out, train, and come back better prepared for it.<br />

All games are like this.  Is it any surprsise that EQ is any different?  Stages have a boss mob at the end of them ... kill the boss and you move to level 2.

<br />
Vigdis, i would love to see you guys in action, as it would give me something to strive for.  ATM i get my kicks out of 1grouping BoT towers (all 4 of em) with my fellow guildees.  Accomplishing such a task without using Highend EP/Time geared toons would be an inspiration to myself and my friends.<br />
<br />
I still dont support opening the planes to everyone, though.  I could possibly see a long, drawnout quest which flagged a single person. But such a quest should/could/would need to take about as long total as it takes a raiding guild to progress through the due course of the game, and should require some challenging single groupable content so as to maintain balance.  To do otherwise would be a slap in the face to each and every raider who earned their flags the intended way ... especially those guilds who recently broke into EP's through months of hard work and dedication.</div></div><hr />

Sass, I'm sorry but you are wrong.  NTOV did not provide full armor set for Velious.  Yes, maybe someone wore Eashen's mask or a cloak, and maybe they acquired Deep Sea greaves, but raiders of that generation were outfitting themselves in the Myrmidon set and primarily filling off-slots with NTOV. Comparing NTOV to Raex is wrong.  Rather compare Raex to Armguards of the Brute.  That is where the comparison lies.  The actual armor set of the Velious generation was Mrymidons and armor set for PoP is Raex.  There is better available in the final candy zone in Velious (NToV) and there is better available in the candy zone of PoP (Time). <br />
<br />
I do think you are right, though, that with the release of PoP SoE finally did make a complete armor set of that generation that is not available without a large-scale raid.  And therein lies my problem.</div></div><hr />

You are now making up a design that does not exist and NEVER existed prior to PoP in order to maintain your one-ring-higher position in the PoP fish acquarium.  LOOK at the history of this game before you make some comment like this.  I'm not stupid.  I didn't start playing a month ago.  I have been here during the evolutoin of the game and I am able to recognize and analyze the great fuck-up that was PoP.  <br />

Furthermore, don't just SAY something without explaining your statement.  Tell me WHY it is a &quot;necessary hurdle to jump over&quot; don't just make an unfounded comment.  Why is that you feel I must kill RZ with a raiding guild in order to farm EP armor with 18 friends?  What is &quot;necessary&quot; about that?

<br />
You make two points here, EC, and I'll respond in order.  <br />
<br />
First, of COURSE non-raiders would prefer Sony take the time to fix 2 year old content.  Why, you ask?  BECAUSE NON RAIDERS HAVEN'T FUCKING SEEN IT.  You want them to focus on new stuff that you get to explore and enjoy?  Great, so do we.  The only difference is that the new stuff that we haven't yet got to explore and enjoy IS the two-year old content.  I don't mean this to be an attack on you personally, but I do mean it to be a direct attack on you perception that &quot;old&quot; content is not worthy of review.  Most of the playerbase hasn't seen it.<br />
<br />
Second, I see no reason why the EP should be opened up once &quot;they are no longer relevant&quot; to raiders.  If non-raiders can hack the content now, then that should be the only consideration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and Apolyon, for the record.  You spent a bunch of time randomly flaming one of the hardest hard core nonraides around but you failed to address the flaws in the post that lead to his conclusion.  Answer my questions, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Eagleclaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">And as I've already said, the flag mobs should be very doable by a casual group size in the near future.. so you can go back and see all that content if you wish. :)<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with that.  After all, the folks that wanted to see it before you had to go through the flagging.  If your big complaint is that you don't want to join a 60-70 person raid size thats cool, you should get your chance to do it with a much smaller force soon enough.<br />
<br />
If you complaint is that you just don't want to take the time and effort to kill the mobs to begin with.. I got no sympathy for ya.<br />
<br />
If your complaint is that, for 2 years you've been frustrated because they didn't make the game according to your version of whats &quot;right&quot; and this has kept you from experiencing content, then I pity you for not being able to move past denial to acceptence.  I hope you have a good home remedy for ulcers :)<br />

So everyone agrees then that SoE riped a huge divide between raiders and non-raiders starting with PoP (See my previous post #841)<br />
I'd characterize it rather that casual non-raiders allowed a gap to open up between themselves and hardcore raiders rather early on and never did anything about closing it because it meant little to them until GoD.<br />
<br />
In the begining, most of the raids I was on were essentally pickup semi-public raids sponcered by guilds that fleshed out their ranks with reasonably well-equipped players of the needed level. These outsiders got the priviledge of raiding because level meant a heck of a lot in the early days. Not everyone and their dog was level 50, In fact everywhere you went you heard &quot;Orc 1 Camped&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
As time went on you needed to be the right level and have the right discipline to do VS. Some players wanted to only group and others went to every raid they could find. The ones that wanted to only group eventually woudn't do a PoG or a Kael pickup raid. Although they did contine raiding some, frankly I suspect because many of them wanted their Epic. Those of us inverested in raiding joined guilds and the others drifted off into obscurity.<br />
<br />
Mind you the differences weren't much at first. Both types of Warriors wandered around with their 2 or 3 pieces of Cobalt and a Wurmslayer. But as time went on the difference got more and more pronounced. The First big deal was the Epic, then a full set of ToV armor, then a BoC or Great Shadow Platemail BP.<br />
<br />
Still the casual players were OK. Afterall there was class/diety armor and Drooga weapons.<br />
<br />
But one day they saw guilds posted on their servers having beaten PoTime and they felt uneasy. Mind you, this was no different than raiders beating PoHate and PoFear. But they compared Magelos and it occured to them that Verant/SoE had created a raid oriented game where the &quot;good stuff&quot; went to raiders starting in PoHate/Fear and in virtually every expansion including the EP's/PoTime and QVic and it began gnawing at them.<br />
<br />
It occurred to them that they would be successful with better equipment (a conclusion reached by raiders 4 years earlier). How coud they best get it? LDoN? Naw, takes forever. Doing one group content including stuff that had become trivialized by mudflation? Errrrp worse than LDoN even, you have to work your way through content step by excrutiating step (just like raiders).<br />
<br />
The answer of course is an accelerated path without time consuming flag reqirements or raiding reaching the same end or at least nearly the same end. They assure SoE that it would be good for business (it might) and raiders that they are entitled to near simular rewards since it's all just time spent (absolute bullshyte).<br />
<br />
They diminish the accomplishments of raiders and state that reaching and clearing PoTime is no different than killing Captive Coin Merchants (BS) to try to build a case that they have in fact earned near equivilent armor. As a result they risk alienating higher level players.<br />
<br />
They dispute that a progression path exists.<br />
<br />
They ignore SoE's assertion that an EP quality armor set will not be sold by Wayfarer Merchants at this time.<br />
<br />
They dismiss the fact that in the already written next expansion players will reach level 70 which will trivialize some previous content and make their progression path easier. Further, they overlook the fact that OoW may very well contain groupable or soloable content or quests that might well give them the near EP/PoTime armor they are seeking. They forget that tradeskill armor may exist in this new expansion as well.<br />
<br />
In my opinion all of this is an effort to try to convince SoE that casual non-raiding players have earthshaking legimate gripes that have unfairly consigned them to never setting foot in numerous expansions and being forced to be level 65 1200AC 5000HP Warriors while the greedy raid Warriors ride the coatails of 100 person uberguilds, press assist, and attack.<br />
<br />
Post rational things based on the actual conditions that exist in the game aimed at obtaining reasonable accomodation of a group playstyle as a viable alternative to raiding sharing some (but not all) content and some (but not all) rewards but nonetheless with a fun progression path and content in every expansion and I imagine no one disagrees with you. Post what you've been posting and every single player who has raided is going to be dismissive when you contend you deserve raid-like rewards for not raiding and not even killing cutting edge (difficult for the most powerful groups in the game) group mobs.<br />
<br />
You don't even know what's in OoW, yet you winge. Don't worry though, top Warriors in raiding Guilds like Arch Overseers, Club Fu, and Phantom Raiders will find out soon enough and let you (and me) know. Hopefully it will be content that you and more hardcore players both enjoy - that's good for the game. Hopefully there will also be a fair amount of content challanging to hardcore players with superior rewards - that is also good for the game.<br />

BB, are you retarded?  At this point I mean this seriously.  I doubt that you can read and comprehend posts being made on this thread.<br />
<br />
Several people have corrected all your various misstatements, ignorance, and hype.  Several times.  Yet you persist.  How fucking retarded are you?<br />
<br />
1.  I have already stated that in EVERY SINGLE EXPANSION PRIOR TO THIS ONE nonraiders could eventually obtain the armor sets immediately available to raiders.  I had each of those sets as my small guild slowly progressed.  In PoP we cannot.  SO YES IT IS FUCKING DIFFERENT than raiders beat PoHate and PoFear.  Are you so stupid that you don't see the difference?  Are so you ignorant that you don't know about the difference?  Or are you just so fucking retarded that you don't care about the difference?<br />
<br />
2.  We don't want Quarm loot.  I've corrected you on this now about five times.  Other people have corrected you.  Yet you persist.  Are you so fucking braindead that our corrections don't seep in?  Are you such a complete nit-wit that you think everyone doesn't notice that you keep throwing out red herrings?  Did you hit your fucking head in a sky accident and you can't remember things past 5 minutes ago?  Honestly, what in the fuck is your problem here?  Deal with the facts or lock yourself in a goddamn padded cell and start blathering.  The shit you post is useless otherwise.<br />
<br />
3.  I have, in this very thread, said that I think I can beat many raid mobs in Fire, Air, Earth, and Water with a small 3-groups of friends (or I would have been able to, had I not left those friends behind to join an uber raiding guild).  Clearly, then, I am willing to raid.  Just not on the massive scale necessary to apparently REACH those encounters.  Do you not want to deal with that issue?  <br />

I've now asked Apolyon to defend his baseless assertion, untethered to facts or analysis, that RZ is a &quot;necessary hurdle to jump&quot; in order to beat mobs that are significantly easier.  Apolyon has chosen not to respond.  Maybe you will since you make the exact same fucking baseless case about PoP flags.  I mean, your guild probably got you BOT flagged in a couple raids worth of POS visits. OoooooOOOOoo Time Consuming!  I grouped in POS for weeks with a group of friends for our alt flag.  Maybe your guild took a couple weeks to learn Terris Thule (Eeeek The Statues are ALIVE!), my friends took several weeks camping in PoD in order for all of us to get the Torment key.  You pissing and moaning because I refuse to do &quot;time consuming&quot; bullshit arbitrary flagging encounters?  I'm willing to put in the time you asshole. I've stated I'm willing to put in the time and I've provided examples of what I feel would be an appropriate amount of time.  Rather than deal with those suggestions on the merits you fucking ignore them because they don't fit with your case.  You wanna debate with me and other non raiders or would you just prefer to create your own alternate reality where shit is exactly as you wish it to be in order for your points to make sense?<br />
<br />
Yes, this post is demeaning and yes I'm infuriated with your complete and utter refusal to response and discuss the actual issues at hand.  I'm TIRED of your lies and your ignorance.  We are talking in circles here because you are not talking about the actual fucking facts, you are making up your own.  Let me know when you get back to the real world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Sass, I'm sorry but you are wrong. NTOV did not provide full armor set for Velious. Yes, maybe someone wore Eashen's mask or a cloak, and maybe they acquired Deep Sea greaves, but raiders of that generation were outfitting themselves in the Myrmidon set and primarily filling off-slots with NTOV. Comparing NTOV to Raex is wrong. <br />
We will have to agree to disagree on that assessment, Vigdis.  Warlords was mid-tier gear obtainable by any guild that could kill Vindicator.  NTOV armor pieces were top-tier gear, and they DID add up to a full set.<br />

In visible slots alone (minus chest since Vindicator BP &gt; all):<br />

You keep saying you eventually accessed raid gear as a non-raider in the past.  It's not true.  You still don't have access to NTOV or VT gear as a non-raider, even after 4-5 expansions.

<br />
<br />
The same progression could be made of Ornate, Elemental, and Time armor.<br />
<br />
Hence the comparison of NTOV ought to be to Time armor.  I'm not sure why you ignored that statement.  Sure, you can compare it to Elemental and ignore Time altogether but I'm not sure how that makes sense.  NTOV was the final candy zone of Velious and Time is the final candy zone of PoP.  Both had armor (that was NOT a set) that fit into most &quot;set&quot; slots and was superior.  I wold never call NTOV a &quot;set&quot; of armor, like Warlords or Myrmidons.  It was made of a mishmesh of peices; as is the Time set.  Hence, why I instead compared Myrmidons (or Warlords) to Elemental - they are complete sets and they are the best it gets unless you make the candy zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, the raid-farmed NTOV &quot;set&quot; was heads and shoulders above the Warlords armor that eventually became farmable by single groups.  The NTOV &quot;set&quot; is still not obtainable by non-raiders today, 5 expansions later.<br />
<br />
The NTOV armor is available to casual guilds that happen to raid.  It takes around 18 of us or less to beat Aary and that is the only barrier to the content, which you noted later in your post.  This corresponds directly to my initial statement that in prior expansions the high end complete armor sets were available for those who were not hard core raiders...they were just available much later in the game. <br />
<br />
I honestly don't know how to judge VT.  Luclin didn't really have any armor sets.  There were upgrades, surely, in VT and Seru and elsewhere.  But there was no actual set.  In terms of the progression and availability of Luclin, however, I agree.  VT is not available and I don't believe it ever will be.  Its hard for me to compare it to the historical Velious/Kunark/Norath model or to the PoP model, though, for the lack of sets. <br />
<br />
<br />
One day Raex might only require 15 casual players instead of 36+, just as parts of NTOV are now doable with 15 casual players instead of 36+.  But 15 is still a raid.  The only place you might see a single group earn an EP mold is in PoTime tier 1.  Shall we open up PoTime?<br />
<br />
We totally agree here.  One day Raex will only require 15 casual players (indeed, I believe that it already is at that point with respect to some mobs in the planes).  15 is a raid to you, but to me it is gathering up three groups of friends.  The piont remains that same either way:  EVEN THOUGH Raex is obtainable with 15 casual players, the players cannot access any of the mobs that drop it because RZ will not be doable with that few, ever. <br />
<br />
A single group will never get an EP mold in phase1.  Phase1 does not drop EP molds, although it does drop some nice offslots.  I believe Time ought to be the candyland restricted to the raidres as was the case in recent prior expansions (NToV, VT).  I just don't think the entire Elemental Planes should be so restricted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">Vigdis,<br />
<br />
One of  Sassinak's post's (#864) sums up my assesment about armor sets. It might be possible to get Crafted without a raid or Thurgadin or PoG. But best armor in EverQuest and each of the follow on expansions (excepting LDoN) have always been obtained in raids and has required a conciderable amount of time for groups to be able acquire on their own. PoHate/PoFear, Trak/VS, ToV/NToV, VT/Ssra/Seru, the EP's/PoTime, and QVic all took a guild. Some of these targets became doable by small raids or groups, but it surely wasn't while the top 10% Warriors were still wearing the armor. The facts are the facts.<br />
<br />
Your assertion &quot;2. We don't want Quarm loot.&quot; appears to be at odds with &quot;nonraiders could eventually obtain the armor sets immediately available to raiders.&quot; Quarm drops the Raex BP mold. That's part of the set where pieces are first found in the EP's. Numerous players have stated that they want EP armor or near EP armor.<br />
<br />
The use of the word &quot;immediately&quot; is also confusing. The armor set available to Warriors soonest upon entering PoP was tradeskill Class/Diety armor followed by Kizrak. I have advocated individual non-progression flags into ToSoRo. Since access to this zone and BoT makes an armor set &quot;immediately&quot; available to Warriors available to you, I'm not sure what you are shouting about.<br />
<br />
Your point #3. Raid size has decreased from 72 to 54 - nearly 1/3rd. In addition, many 54 person raids can be done with fewer people, especially if everyone gets 5 more levels. I would think this trend would delight you and others willing to raid some. It promices that small gulds, pickup raids, and guild alliance raids will have an increasing viability.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not retarded. It's none of you business, but my IQ is around 160. High enough to wander around without an aide, but not so high as to be comfortable trying to keep up with the truely gifted.<br />

One Vulak piece, the gauntlets.  Subtract 16AC 35hp if you prefer to leave Vulak out.  Even so, the top Velious gear is still NTOV by a long shot, and it's still not casual territory even today.<br />
<br />
I do find it interesting, however, that 'non-raiding' has been defined as '18 or less people'.  Allow me to put forth a prediction: 18 will still not be able to kill any EP mold dropper at the midpoint of OOW.<br />
<br />
(Since EPs are closed, let's select an equivalent benchmark mob: how about Zun Muram Votal.  Will he be killable by 18 unflagged people halfway through OOW?  I doubt it.)</div></div><hr />

The previous post sums up my assesment about armor sets. It might be possible to get Crafted without a raid or Thurgadin or PoG. But the amount of time to get the best armor in EverQuest and the follow on expansion excepting LDoN which was initially only obtained by raiding has always been conciderable. The facts are the facts.<br />
<br />
<br />
What?  There was a time where one could not get Thurgadin armor without a raid, or POG armor without a raid.  As Sass and I discussed above, this armor is now available to single-groups or small groups.  NTOV is available to small groups as welll.  Hence, the &quot;best&quot; armor in EverQuest is always accessible by casuals and non hard core raiders.  The fact that the time it takes to get it is considerdable is irrelevant.  Of course it is, and both raiders and nonraiders alike spend considerable amount of time acquiring it.  The only difference is that raiders get it within that expansion and nonraiders get it after.  These are the facts.  I'm not sure what facts you were stating or what point you thought those facts were making.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your assertion &quot;2. We don't want Quarm loot.&quot; appears to be at odds with &quot;nonraiders could eventually obtain the armor sets immediately available to raiders.&quot; Quarm drops the Raex BP mold. That's part of the set where pieces are first found in the EP's. Numerous players have stated that they want EP armor or near EP armor.<br />

Since access to this zone and BoT makes an armor set &quot;immediately&quot; available to Warriors available to you, I'm not sure what you are shouting about.<br />
<br />
<br />
By immediately, I meant within the expansion period.  I figured you'd be bright enough to catch on to that, but I guess you couldn't help but throw in another red herring out of sheer obstinance. <br />
<br />
As for the Raex set, /shrug, exclude the BP if it makes your day.  What I want is the loot available in the Elemental Planes barring Time that I could go in and acquire with a few small groups of friends.   As for the BP dropping from Quarm, yes that mob does have an extremely small and random chance of dropping any class BP.  It primarily drops from RZ, though.  Not that I'm interested in having RZ loot be made available. <br />
<br />
<br />
Your point #3. Raid size has decreased from 72 to 54 - nearly 1/3rd. In addition, many 54 person raids can be done with fewer people, especially if everyone gets 5 more levels. I would think this trend would delight you and others willing to raid some. It promices that small gulds, pickup raids, and guild alliance raids will have an increasing viability.<br />
<br />
<br />
That ignored my question.  Here, I'll repeat it:  <br />
<br />
<br />
I've now asked Apolyon to defend his baseless assertion, untethered to facts or analysis, that RZ is a &quot;necessary hurdle to jump&quot; in order to beat mobs that are significantly easier. Apolyon has chosen not to respond. Maybe you will since you make the exact same fucking baseless case about PoP flags. <br />
<br />
<br />
I already stated that I am aware expansions and mudflation will permit fewer people to take down mobs.  I've outlined in this thread exactly what mobs I feel a small group of friends can take down with 18 or less people.  My PROBLEM is that in order to access that content, we are required to take down a mob that will require significantly more than 18 people.   I am not interested in guild alliances or pickup raids.  I want to know why you somehow think that having an arbitrary blocking mechanism like RZ is necessary in order to get into the planes. <br />
<br />

<br />
Are you serious?  I am fairly confident that I could take 18 people from my guild and kill Pyronis right now, and we aren't exactly high end.<br />
<br />
(no I won't prove this because Pyronis is a &quot;guild raid only&quot; mob and I am not allowed by my guild leadershop to lead FFA raids on him).  I can say though, that I have been in on a 4-group Pyronis kill, and not a single person in that raid owned a piece of elemental gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">Ok, one counterexample, I set myself up for that, and I deserved it. :)<br />
<br />
There are people who trio Aaryonar and the other bosses in NTOV today.  That doesn't mean those mobs have become targets for non-raiders.  For those who could actually profit from them, they are still impossible without 3 groups.  A variety of things such as AE's, trash, and fight duration prevent these encounters from becoming trivial just due to the addition of levels and AA's.  I think the same will be true of most EP encounters at level 70.<br />
<br />
Most of the air avatars are very easy like Pyronis, and would be sensible choices of EP target for newcomers if the EPs were opened up.  But could 18 level 70 non-EP-equipped people crawl up to an island, complete a ring, crawl back to the avatar, and kill the avatar before despawn time?  I don't think so, but perhaps you will prove me wrong one day. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">Vigdis,<br />
<br />
Please forgive me for editing my previous post to more accurately reflect what I wanted to say.<br />
<br />
I don't believe that groups routinely did PoHate and PoFear while the 2nd and 3rd tiers guilds were still in them. I don't believe groups routinely did Trak and VS when the 3rd, 4th, and 5th. guild on a server were still killing them. This is true of Kunark dragons, VP, VT, ToV, and NToV.<br />
<br />
Basically all of the regularly raiding guilds not waaaay back in progression have always done certain mobs and zones before a group or even a very small raid that had not done the content before succeeded.<br />
<br />
If this was not the case, SoE would be urged to make it the case.<br />
<br />
Groups should not be interferring with legitimate raid content that has not been completed by at a minimum the top 4 or 5 guilds on a server - else why raid and why have raid content or guilds.<br />
<br />
It is for this reason barriers like flags have been used. WHEN you are powerful enough to get past the Juggernaughts then you can take a whack at Trak didn't suffice. Guilds had continued legitimate interest in Trak beyond that point. So fences were errected. Want to do VT? Great! Now have everyone in your guild do all the shard camps - it kept uber non-raiders from hitting current raid targets.<br />
<br />
Want EP armor? Great! Now get everyone in your party past the flagging requirements. Guilds are still in there. Want to compete with them? Fine - here's the flag requirements.<br />
<br />
This system may not make you happy, but as long as guilds are doing the EP's and PoTime and had to get past all those flags it's fair - you can do exactly the same thing.<br />
<br />
When however the EP's are empty, then by all means alert SoE that this is not guild raid content anymore and insist they should ease entry requirements. I've suggested doing this for ToSoRo for this very reason.<br />
<br />
SoE has encouraged raiding and encouraged the formation of guilds that raid. The results have been the formation of communities that are a hallmark of EverQuest.<br />
<br />
I'm told that in OoW there will be less locked content. I'm fine with that. The real answer all along has been instanced content. With it locking content would not have been necessary.<br />
<br />
But realize at the same time, the PoTime flag progression forced raiders to kill mobs in many many zones and to see a great deal of content. This gives an expansion a longevity and richness of experiance it would not have if everyone showed up in the EP's and PoTime on day one and began beating on the content because all other loot in the expansion would be trumped by EP/PoTime loot.<br />
<br />
The progression should do exactly the same thing for non guild or non hardcore raiders or groups. In their case, the desire to move from 4k HP to 10K HP's should move them through many many zones, in a suportive interested in entertaintment way - &quot;forcing&quot; them to experiance a great deal of content, inproving in a step-wise manner, and not simply showing up at their endzone on day one beating on their end content because it trumps all previous loot.<br />

With the exception of a Clawed Earthcrafters Hoop my my only EP stuff is Raex Armor, the same as my PoTime Raex BP. Every other slot pretty much except for GoD items contains a drop from PoTime. While most EP items are trumped by PoTime items Raex isn't. But then the Raex BP drops in PoTime.<br />

Confused? The ultimate visable armor set in PoP is Raex EP/PoTime armor. The best acessories arguably are found in PoTime.<br />

No, Haass ... i fail to see the problem in the same light you do.  You see, there is a viable progression for non-raiders ... they simply don't capitalize on it (as i have pointed out many times already).  The only solution present back when you quit the game was &quot;raid to progress&quot;.   EQ has changed dramatically in the last 6 months ... it's a shame you weren around to see it.<br />
<br />
If you really think that the only solution i've offered is to &quot;raid&quot; then i suggest you go back and read my now 151 posts in the Outhouse over the past week yet again .. because it seems that 151 times you have missed the point of what i said: that there is indeed a path to progression other than raiding, and that my magelo and the shinanigans of my close friends are living proof.  Without ever obtaining any EP loot a few of us now have several items with type 8 augment slots.<br />
<br />
For those of you out there who havent played during the LDoN era ... type 8 is reserved for Time gear only in PoP ... and time-equivalent zones in GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ is a big game and needs to be fun for all.I always enjoyed loggin in with my wife and crawling through new places even with just the two of us.I still like to do this in our spare time.I certainly never expected kewl dragon lewt(read raid type loot)to drop from our efforts and I didn't care.More content to play through would be great.I don't really hate LDON...I enjoy playing there with friends.It just seems cheap and easy compared to exploring Sol A,HK,KC,Seb,Nadox,GOD etc.<br />
<br />
Being raider number 56 does not mean you are more skilled then non raiders at eq in general.My guild is filled with casual players on limited playtime...the majority of us are not erm...&quot;leet&quot;.However,contributing to a guilds rise from velious to time does require more sacrifice and effort then endlessly plowing through LDON or even the toughest group content.Weaker players in a guild may find Tipt say,more difficult than self reliant players who have practiced particular grouping skills over and over.That doesn't mean that those raiders are not persuing a more challenging path.From adjusting rl schedules for the team  to sucking up the bumps as one small seeminly under appreciated cog in a big wheel.From bearing up under the scrutiny of many and continuing to fight hard and do their part despite their efforts being often misunderstood by peers.Being forced to learn to adapt quickly to a greater multitude of variables and circumstance.Before an injury put me at a desk i was a proffesional soldier for 10 years.The challenge of making stuff work was never solely the responsability of command,everyone had a part to play and needed,drive,focus and a resonable understanding of their environment with common sense to apply skills.EQ is not rl and almost anyone can reach &quot;elite&quot; status in the game.However,group dynamics and good attitude and determination do apply.Out of the last 7 or so guilds of more hardcore folks to rank ahead of us in ep+ content on Stromm only 1 is left.It is likely that there will be another formed by raiders of time left without a guild on our server,but, it go's to show the challenge of raiding.Far more guilds fold under the pressure(however derived) than make it. Progressive raiding demands more from people than casual grouping and pays bigger rewards if succesful.This is obviously intended in SOE's game design.Raiding is the high end of the game.<br />

Yeah,there are lots of raiders who haven't earned their wings so to speak.There are also lots of talented people who are non raiders atm,who would be a valuable addition to any raid guild with some gearing.The solo and group game is challenging.The social network aspects alone are daunting.There's tons of fun to be had outside of raids and more content should be implemented to support this.I like the idea of raiding being the exception and not the only game left like in high end pop.Still the idea of someone endlessly grinding LDONs so they can have a comparable magelo to ep raiders is kinda yucky imo.Doing bigger stuff should earn bigger rewards.More content is needed imo to support the new expansions.The exact balance of added rewards is open to debate and implementation by soe.However,it should not undermine all past content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">The thing is Gunnar.  Even if they were to implement today an armor line that was somewhat close to EP level in quality at a higher price, it's going to be two expansions before very many people even acquired it.  Most non-raiders aren't geared in top end LDoN today yet alone have the points set aside to purchase an ungrade if it was available.<br />
<br />
Two expansions down the road EP armor is going to be considered complete and utter crap, the very minimum needed to even begin to be called a tank.  And where are non-raiders going to get this armor?  Yes, some pieces they'll get from GoD, but not all.  Not by a long shot.  And they sure aren't going to be flagging up and raiding the EPs.  So unless SoE releases some new armor sets in OoW, what happens from that point?  Seriously?</div></div><hr />

You my friend are a fool if you think this is true (unless you are talking lore only, no game). It takes two weeks to go from gold to distribution. Half the bitching would be solved by giving people a bone (OoW) to chew. It would fix most of the complaints with the non-raider accessible GoD content just by giving everyone 5 more levels to soak up damage, etc. let alone the new buffs. Only after 2 months would people realize that nothing has really changed (unless it actually does which would be suprising but pleasantly welcome).<br />
<br />
But the damn expansion is nowhere near done up to any kind fo reasonable quality standard so they are still working on it. Amazon has WoW at mid Oct and OoW at mid September, I think the one month gap is about right maybe a little short. If I were SOE I would be working overtime to catch its customers for one last payday while also working real hard to re-engage them before they bolt for WoW (only time will tell if they come back).<br />

The use of the word &quot;immediately&quot; is also confusing. The armor set available to Warriors soonest upon entering PoP was tradeskill Class/Diety armor followed by Kizrak. I have advocated individual non-progression flags into ToSoRo. Since access to this zone and BoT makes an armor set &quot;immediately&quot; available to Warriors available to you, I'm not sure what you are shouting about.<br />

An armor set we can already buy from the raiders/farmers via the bazaar (hmm is that the very BP in question in my magelo, thought so). Your point is?<br />

So this argues that there should be a trivial loot flag? Oh I forgot its ok for the 6 time guilds on our server to do dragons, AoW, VT, etc. but not vice versa. Got it thanks for the memo.<br />

I think there is maybe one active (maybe 2) EP guilds on our server. They all seem to implode because the Time guilds steal the ambitious for backflagging. I do not believe (and I could be wrong) that there is an active guild working through the EP progressoin to get to time on my server, pretty sad, last one imploded after going VT-EP flagged in 2.5 weeks.

Put masking tape over your level 65 indicator. Got 800AA's? Sweet, but you can get by with 120 or so.<br />
<br />
Let's race to be the most effective tank. You sit with your buds doing Orc 1. I'll go off with 100 people and zerg Bronze armor, cause I know where the good stuff drops and I know how to get it and I'll take the steps necessary to get it.<br />
<br />
Now, today, four years later you announce &quot;Well crap, my gear sucks. I've had fun with my buds and we are up to BoT tower minis now, but look at BB's armor. It's not fair! He played the game to get teh win! We should have the same gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horse pucky. Results are dependent on time spent effectively.<br />
<br />
When I first started playing I knew a Warrior that started about the same time I did. He was more insightful about what gear mattered and how to get it. When I was soloing exp in Mistmoore, he was doing PoHate, Vox and Naggy. When I was still wearing Jagged Bands almost he was doing the Coldain Ring quest. When my sholders sucked, he had Strength of Elements.<br />
<br />
Oh, I caught on eventually, a little, but I was already a year behind where I thought I should have been. I started joining raiding guilds. I raidied. I progressed.<br />
<br />
After awhile, I noticed some Warriors that were my contemporaries were wearing Enameled Black Chestplate, Cobalt Boots, and weilding a Wurmslayer while I was in Indicolite with an Incarnadine BP, a couple pieces of Cobalt and weilding a Frostbringer and Jarsath Trident.<br />
<br />
Now, some of these non-raiding casual players were pretty good at it. In fact, they'd ocassinally raid, but only for a chance at specific loot. I knew of some with a Blade of the Black Dragon Eye, Red Epic, mostly Cobalt and an Incarnadine BP.<br />
<br />
But when I got to ToV, NToV, Ssra, Seru, VT, VP, etc - all rading zones that they entered only ocassionally if at all there was no &quot;contest&quot;.<br />
<br />
I still see these players around. They might have a Loyalist Shield of Armor, some Ornate, a BoC, Eyepatch of Plunder, and other stuff they can get with their mostly group activities, but as they had never set foot in VT/Ssra/Ser, much less EP's, PoTime, Qvic their gear is what mine was in total effect 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
1. Many of them have put in the same amount of time as I have (I wasn't very efficient).<br />
<br />
2. Having selected what they knew was a less effective path they have &quot;arrived&quot; at a different place in the game.<br />
<br />
Those that have chosen to spend their time making pp in the bazaar, or mostly socializing, or seeing the sights, or grouping with 2 buds are on the path they have chosen doing what they chose to do.<br />
<br />
We have never been assured that regardless of what we did our equipment would be similar. We KNEW that I would see zones and fight mobs that they would not experiance.<br />
<br />
There's content for all of us in every expansion. Each of us has multiple progression paths. We can group casually, sell stuff in the Bazaar, tradeskill, raid, or fish in Cobalt Scar if we chose. But the zones we can experiance, mobs we can kill, and loot we will have are determined and always have been by the choices we make every time we log in.<br />

Welcome to EverQuest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">I'm wondering if a good deal of this discussion and the disagreements in it aren't fueled by three distinct possibilities:<br />
<br />
1. PoP in certain respects was a very odd expansion. The 72-person raid &amp; flagging designs appear to me, anyway, as having originally been put in place to slow down top guilds. Why would SOE want to slow down top players? I keep thinking of this issue that SOE must face: the top players in this game are unbelievably relentless in exhausting content. It's expensive to hire and retain programmers and designers to stay ahead of these players, and in each expansion something has to be there to occupy the top raiding guilds long enough that the next clump of content can be built. The PoP time sink is qualitatively different from anything in Kunark or Velius, though. The PoP speed bump for powerful guilds looks pretty much like a wall to single group/small guild/non-raiding players. I don't really think SOE thought down the line far enough to realize how dispiriting that wall would be to a big part of EQ's player base.<br />
I really don't think that nonraiders will *ever* see some of the PoP zones. Rather than redesign that expansion to modify the flagging system etc., it will be far easier (and economically more profitable) for SOE to make new exansions that provide nonraiders access to better gear outside PoP &quot;locked&quot; content. You won't get into PoP, but you won't care any more than it drives you crazy that you can't seem to find the time to go to Runnyeye to loot blackened alloy armor.<br />
<br />
2. In addition to providing new content, SOE has to provide new levels of non-gear character power. Originally I think this was mostly covered by the characters' advancement through levels. Over time, a greater emphasis was placed on AAs. The level cap at 65 has been around for a while, and again I think it put some pressure on SOE's game design folks. Try this next time you are online: do a /who all 65 warrior and then do a /who all 52 warrior. It's possible that you'll get a &quot;too many&quot; response on the 52, search, but I seriously doubt it. On the other hand, day or night, I'd be surprised if the 65 search got much past the &quot;Big Ogre&quot; part of the alphabet. There's a massive clump of players sitting at level 65, but not all level 65s are the same. There's huge variation in power among 65 warriors, and this crops up all the time in various threads here, particularly in discussions of hard LDoNs. It's very annoying to be asked your hitpoints before you get a group but really the question is not much different from finding out someone's level before inviting them to group. If you are a level 62 warrior it doesn't shock you that you are not invited into a group of Level 65s getting ready to do an LDoN hard, but quite possibly there's less difference in power between you and a newly minted 65 warrior and that new 65 warrior and a 9K hps 1900AC 200 AA level 65 warrior.<br />
This issue backs its way into our threads all the time too. Part of the time the guy who says, &quot;Boss Mob 01 is a pussy! I two box him!&quot; is just basically flashing people in the park, (&quot;Dude, that looks like a real penis, except it's smaller&quot;) but to some extent the radically different assessments of mob difficulty you see here are a direct outgrowth of the the situation where an easy duo target for some folks is damn near a raid target for others, and that has to do with the fact that level 65 nowadays is really a bunch of levels crammed into one.<br />
<br />
3. There's tremendous variation in approaches to this game, and it is hard to keep in mind what influence real life and other factors have in making some things possible and other things not possible for players different from oneself. Ascribing causality to different levels of power only by considering commitment or socialization skills or player skills is an oversimplification. I realize I'm repeating myself, but I think there are strong economic reasons that players at all levels are in this together. For raiders, a large player base of casuals helps generate the revenue that supports the development of new content. For casuals, EQ's reputation of being the richest content game helps attract new players to the game, and helps provide casual players with more access to content. Attrition among any group is a serious matter for all groups.</div></div><hr />

PoP has been out for 2 years. On my server 5 guilds have been there. In six months another 5 will be through it if they bother. PoP is no different from Kunark. A certain number of players make it through to the end and the rest don't. When the new expansion comes out, there's a method of skipping much if not all of the uncompleted content. Both affresive raiding guilds that might have farmed NToV or PoTime for 4 months because they had nothing better to do and those only finishing up their Cobalt set or with 3 pieces of Kirzrak Amor have stuff to do in the new expansion.<br />
<br />
The problem is that it gets ridiculous for SoE to have a full progression path in every expansion for those that have fallen behind. You might be able to skip PoHate. You can skip VT/Ssra/Seru. But you can't skip everything. All that content you skipped if still out there - a HUGE amount of content that you haven't enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Those that solo or only group have chosen what amounts to an alternative progression path. Until LDoN, there were some major gaps. Someone who skipped everything might not even be able to find enough others to do the old content. With LDoN, they don't have to. BUT it's still there - uplayed, unenjoyed, fresh content.<br />
<br />
Equipment has always had a major role in EQ and it should. Armor, weapons, etc. are important in a FRPG.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't see what the complaining is all about. Casual players have a HUGE amount of content to do and a path forward made easier by mudflation, LDoN, level 70, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">I'm wondering if a good deal of this discussion and the disagreements in it aren't fueled by three distinct possibilities:<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep to all the above, quite likely one of the 10 best posts in this thread IMHO.<br />
<br />
This game is broken for too many people, now the question is can SOE fix it without pissing off too many people. OoW may be a step in the right direction via lack of flagging, the question is gonna be how do you add content (and equipment) for non-raiders while still giving raiders something to do? If you make the whole expansion challenging for raiders then the non-raiders wont buy/play it. In my mind you have to write off the hardest of the hard-core raiders. The 9 guilds stuck in the final GoD zone can not be the basis of a game. But that is what we have come to. Hell there is even a topic about it on PoN how some of the pallys in those guilds are pissed and are shocked that nobody other than them cares, well duh, we all have our own problems.<br />
<br />
My solution? Figure out a way to make it beneficial for high-end raiders to help lower people. In DAOC there were skills (equiv to AA) that required xp to get. The xp came from only certain mobs. Higher players would get bonus xp of this sort for helping lower players through the trials (how you get those AA). So how does this work in EQ? Well you build an expansion that has parts the higher players can defend permanenetly from lower player access (equiv to Kod Taz/Fire in many ways) where they can play by themselves. Maybe more than one. Then you build rewards into the system (titles, augs, special AAs, etc.) that can only be earned by doing things like going on a raid where over 1/2 of the grp is unflagged for that content. Can there be abuses by boxers/alts, yes, but that is up for SOE to figure out how to deal with. Not only does this help both parties but it cross-polinates people and opens up new potential avenues of play. Higher player guilds looking for new members would also expose themselves to those very possible recruits. Lower players could learn from some of the more skilled higher players while also seeing different/more content. SOE benefits by making more people happy and by making an expansion that sells.<br />
<br />
The problem is no one wants to think out of the box. We all want it to be like the old days (pre-PoP) or the new days (post PoP) depending on where we stand on the food chain.<br />
<br />
And one thing that no one here is willing to admit. In order to gain/maintain members SOE is going to have to dumb parts of this game down/make it easier/make it quicker. The hardcore gamers are already here, to keep this thing afloat there will have to be compromises made to attract/maintain those less hardcore types. Hence EQ2/WoW focusing far more on casual playstyles while also supporting hardcore.<br />

<br />
We don't want your TIME armor.  Since you are a fan of repetition, let me say it one more time.  We don't WANT your TIME armor.<br />
<br />
I am talking about 2 things here and they are related to each other<br />
<br />
1) Because the EP planes are artificially blocked in a way no other expansion has before, non-raiders do not have access to 1-3 groupable mobs that drop upgrades to them, even though they very well may have the skill/organization to beat these mini-bosses.<br />
<br />
2) Because of the lack of upgrades via EP, the progression path in GoD to Kod'Taz is MUCH MUCH more difficult for the non-raider.  Areas like Tipt and to a lesser extent, Tipt, are 10x as difficult as someone in LDoN armor than someone in Elemental armor.  If EP planes can not be opened up, then why does GoD not drop items from its harder zones better in quality than LDoN items (except for a few choice slots, that is the truth)?  And many suggestions have been made to try and address that.  Personally, I favor some new Vxed like trials that find a way to drop 'sub-elemental' gear.  Yes, I said gear inferior to elemental.  I do not want the Raex type BP dropping off of named mobs, because frankly that is unfair.<br />
<br />
<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
1. Many of them have put in the same amount of time as I have (I wasn't very efficient).<br />
<br />
2. Having selected what they knew was a less effective path they have &quot;arrived&quot; at a different place in the game.<br />
<br />
Those that have chosen to spend their time making pp in the bazaar, or mostly socializing, or seeing the sights, or grouping with 2 buds are on the path they have chosen doing what they chose to do.<br />
<br />
We have never been assured that regardless of what we did our equipment would be similar. We KNEW that I would see zones and fight mobs that they would not experiance.<br />
<br />
I have accepted that my gear will never get past a certain level.  My only problem NOW is that the level I have is hindering me from doing further one groupable content in the newest expansion.  It is not balanced in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I don't want shiny new armor to put it in a magelo profile.  I don't want shiny new armor because I am jealous.  I want something that provides a reasonable upgrade so that we can do the content in the 6 man groups.  I don't want to ask an uber friend to tank for us everytime we want to beat Tipt.<br />
<br />
As an aside, at now 7400 unbuffed or so and pre-elemental with 1500ac, my guildleader has maxxed himself basically in game since he chooses not to raid.  He does not want to dissolve the guild and leave for a raid guild.  And he still has a bitch trying to tank in Tipt.  It seems AC is just that important.<br />
<br />
There's content for all of us in every expansion. Each of us has multiple progression paths. We can group casually, sell stuff in the Bazaar, tradeskill, raid, or fish in Cobalt Scar if we chose. But the zones we can experiance, mobs we can kill, and loot we will have are determined and always have been by the choices we make every time we log in.<br />

<br />
What about those of us who just play as hardcore as you do, but just don't wish to be forced to leave their friends and family to do so?  Why are we forced to raid in order to get any sort of progression, at least until LDoN.<br />
<br />
And please STOP with the stupid PoTime stuff.  I STILL don't want to be near you.<br />
<br />

A consistant theme in your post is the theory that casual players must catch up. I contend that while SoE can and maybe ought to ease their path forward, they should have to WORK their way forward. The path has always been there.<br />
<br />
SoE should NOT stall out higher level players.<br />
<br />
SoE should not provide players with an &quot;Insta Uber Potion&quot; of any kind. No EP armor not earned by having to do the EP flags, no AA's not earned, No free pass into the Ep's or PoTime. Wanna see that content? You know how to get there, it's not a mystery.<br />
<br />
SoE has eased the path foward a LOT. Class/Diety Armor, Drooga Weapons, the list is very extensive. Add level 70 alone and all that stuff I've done for the last 3 years can be slid through like buttah on a muffin.<br />
<br />
Xwraithx,<br />
You can winge on this board and beg SoE in Emails. But I guarantee in the end doing the already existing progression content that already takes you far beyond where you are will be more productive than waiting for stuff to fall in your lap from the sky.<br />

<br />
I honestly think they want a cheat code. They took the easy way out by not raiding and now they want an easy way to nearly the same results. There is content.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
And with this pile of steaming shit you continue to demonstrate that IQ (I will take you at your word on the number) and common sense are rarely in the same package. Are you in academia?<br />
<br />
1) Its ridiculous for SOE (or any business) to have a business model that caters to 20% of its customers at the potential risk of the other 80%.<br />
<br />
2) Took the easy way out? We are principally talking about stuff that is focused on those parties who are trying (many of them far harder than you) to progress. We are not talking about the lvl65 with 12AA and 12 play days. We are talking about the lvl65 with 150+AA, 6-7.5k unbuffed hp, and 75+  playdays. Likely another 15-20% of the population no the whole 80%.<br />
<br />
The remaining 60% are likely in for the social aspect or dont care as much so you need to focus on what they care about and address that as well.<br />
<br />
3) Get out of your self-centered little world and wake up. And before you try and take the subject off-topic by saying I am selfish, frankly I dont care if SOE adds this stuff. I can tank up to KT (using accpeted tactics to include pooka) if I so choose. I can hold aggro against almost anything I will likely ever face given my changed playstyle (and would be able to do so even better with WA5 and a 2nd anger3 proc if I felt I needed that). I can serve as the basis (but never would) of those 6 man loot grps that take down the old trivial raid content for bazaar farming.<br />
<br />
But the difference between you and I is that I am trying to look past that not only for my sake (I want the game to survive, I have far too much vested here to move to WoW for example) but for those others I see who still enjoy the game but are frustrated by these issues. I am willing to give up a little of my personal uberness (i am the 2nd highest non time guild hp on my server - would be first if I did my Sturdy5 which #1 has - and the only one obviously with a DB) to let others prosper along with me. The path I recently chose when I decided to reguild myself verifies this. Going to a VT/early PoP family guild that aspires to take down some of the flag stuff but in family way. Hopefully I can help but I refuse to 1) tell them how to do it and 2) take any loot (until such time as they are time flagged which is unlikely).<br />
<br />
I am not diminished by other people's success but rather strengthened by it. Where I graduated undergrad from its called &quot;the Corps has.&quot; In short those who come after me had it easier than me (mostly it was just different) but I take pride in that I had it hard. BUT WE DONT GET SO VESTED in the mere fact that things have changed or needed to change. Just because it used to be one way doesnt mean that it should or will stay that way. In the end, I take pride in my accomplishments not in demeaning/holding back others even if by objective standards they did/do have it easier. <br />

The game is NOT centered around 1 guild per server regardless of what you think. Maybe you didn't see me say 5 guilds on my server have been in PoTime and another 5 will finish it in 3-4 months. That's 1000 players on a server guy, that's not some miniscule number.<br />

what is effective for you may or may not effective for me.  Sure I can effectively get into your living room by driving a truck through your window.  Thats a very effective way to get in, of course I imagine you'd be more than a lil peeved at me.  But I made it in damnit!  In EQ I can lie, cheat, steal, beg, backstab, etc., my way into the uberest gear zones, but I aint gonna have many peeps to play with.

For the most part you are right, you never will catch that carrot.  Problem is folks ARE catching the carrot.  They've done all they can do and they are bored and bitchin.  I believe it was the more hard-core beat the top end NOW before anyone else does types that perfected that fine art (them or the Paladins /giggle).  Now the less than hard-core types are hitting the ceiling and its their turn.  The funniest part is to see how threatened uber types get at the notion anyone else could get any further ahead with out raiding hardcore like they did.<br />
<br />
For folks like me who have actually made a choice to NOT join a non-stop raid guild, there isnt much room to bitch about not getting into the EP's.  I do think there is a valid argument for folks like me who can never hope to see beyond tier 1 in GoD because it pretty much takes EP gear to hang through the trials.  Maybe this will be fixed when OoW comes out, maybe not.  We'll see.</div></div><hr />

Your solution?  &quot;Join a raiding guild or do the boring repetitive content that you have available to you instead of actually progressing.&quot;  What a joke.

I haven't always been in a raiding guild. I haven't always had 10K HP's unbuffed. I have in fact had equipment like you currently wear - heck almost every item you have was a major upgrade for me not a year ago.<br />
<br />
In a separate thread, you state that you are &quot;going for it&quot;. THIS is the kind of thing that helps players - an example that it can be done. I'm pretty darned sure you don't want spoilers, cheat codes, high level players draggging you though, to be PL'd or SoE to hand you EP armor. I'm also pretty darned sure you don't need that kind of stuff - that's not being helped - that's being gimped through and you know it is.<br />
<br />
You might have missed it although I made two references &quot;Gentleman's C&quot; and bell curve. There is a way for even the most abject casual player to progress at a good clip - a new SoE philosophy, everybody wins! They can design content not to be challanging, but to be not challanging.<br />
<br />
You may not remember. The Paladins were very concerned with adjusting GoD trials to be made easier. They specificly asked that pre-EP Warriors not be able to do them. Yet, this is exactly what most of the casual players are complaining about. Who should SoE listen to?<br />
<br />
In this case, I believe casual groups containing pre-EP Warriors can do the trials, but not all pre-EP Warriors. Most will have to gear up to take on content that SoE may have made pretty challanging for them. But with level 70, doesn't that all really go out the window? Seriously, who's kidding who?<br />
<br />
Keep us posted on your progress please. I expect it to be pretty exciting and proof that a good group of casual players are just as &quot;uber&quot; as any raider.<br />

Nice try deflecting the issue at hand. And if you bothered to read anything posted (which you dont unless you can twist it) you would see that my LOW POP server has 5 (actually 6 if I remember right) Time+ guilds but very little in-between as the lower guilds are being gutted to feed the raid monster. You are also choosing to IGNORE the fact that we are not suggesting comparable but slightly worse gear and also choosing to IGNORE the fact that those raiders could get it as well, thereby benefiting everyone. And your right its not one guild, its one TYPE of guild.<br />
<br />
And as far as cheating goes, nope, its simply E-PENIS MAGELO fluffing. Cheating is if you hack into the code, not get an item earlier than someone else. Hell my paladin got a White Dragon Helm faster than 99.9999% of anyone who played the game. Its called twinking and if how about those Droga weps I won by boxing some other 65s to get him the stuff. Is that cheating, nope. How about using a Pooka to tank because its easier, is that cheating, nope. <br />
<br />
Your justicification (to include posting your IQ) continuously demonstrates to me that you appear to lack self worth other than how big your magelo is. Take pride in what you accomplish and quit worrying about everyone else so much. Your accomplishments are only diminished if they are done so in your mind. In fact you can be arrogant and say well you guys had it easy (back to the Corps has concept). I respect the hell out of most high-end players but I dont agree that makes them any better as people or any more deserving of seeing the &quot;majority&quot; of this stupid fucking game.<br />
<br />
And by the way my grad school did do the gentlemen C thing. And by the way it was the #1 ranked business school in the country when I was there so its not like it doesnt happen. And oh did I forget the Phsyics course I took in undergrand (mandatory by the way) where 85% of the class failed EVERY test and the whole scoring was done on a bell-cruve. It was a pure and simple haze and an attempt to piss us off and prove that their academic penis was bigger than any other department's. Did I whine? Nope, got through it. Laugh about it and am proud that I was part of that 15% (ok so I passed like 2/6 tests in both semesters).<br />
<br />
I know, beating my head against the wall, I sometimes wonder why I bother but than I meet this great new 64 is loves (and plays all the time) the game and I worry about what he will face within 6 months (esp. since he is a SK).<br />

I am, and whether or not I will succeed remains to be seen.  I have a lot of faith in the people who are telling me I can do it, and that's why I just dumped 2 grand into buying new comps to play this fucking game again (well, hey, what good is money if ya can't enjoy spending it).<br />

However, all of that still doesn't change the fact that it's assinine to hide small group content behind raid content.  Sol Ro is the biggest Ornate farmland there is, and what is it being used for?

Brutul just came here and said flat out he could take down the lower end &quot;Raid&quot; mobs in the elemental planes with a gimp group no problem, so then why the fuck are we locked out of this again?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">Here is my take on the whole issue.<br />
<br />
1.) Raiding Guilds and people who are dedicated to raiding and spending the amount of time they do in their respective guilds to progress do need the ability to gain and grow at the highest level of the game and casual people regardless of how hard they work do not deserve the same rewards for less work and effort.<br />
<br />
2.) Bored members of high end raiding guilds should not be perma killing the lower end content out of boredom or the desire to twink an alt. There should be some content that is left so that people who are actually trying to progress can be given the opportunity. The problem as I see it is that there are those that are trying and not able to access higher end content but the higher end guild members are taking lower end targets for kicks and twinks.<br />
<br />
3.) More Casual raiders need to get off their soapbox. I for one do not want elemental level armor and weaponry in exchage for raiding crushbone level content. The level of the content should dictate the level of the reward.<br />
<br />
Now having said what I have be aware that I am a member of a family guild and I play almost every night and have for over 5 years but don't feel entitled or deserving of the same rewards that those players have earned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unlike a lot of people in this thread, I don't want them to add Elemental armor to LDoN.  I don't plan on doing LDoN for armor anyway.  What I want is to get elemental armor FROM THE ELEMENTAL PLANES.<br />
<br />
Will I get there slower than everyone else?  Sure.  Will it take me 2 more expansions, 400 aa's and level 75?  Maybe.  Will I get there eventually, without doing &quot;Crushbone&quot; content?  Absolutely.<br />

<br />
I would hope our class correspondent who is supposed to READ would. If you did, you would see that hardly is it, my point is that your 20% and my 15-20% make up 40% and frankly between us make up the 40% that likely another 40% will strive to be (either uber or good given time/playstyle constraints). Fix my 20% and you will likely be 80% fixed and the other 20% may not care. Right now too much focus is on the top 20% frankly because they bitch more and louder and will leave immediately taking their whole guild with them if they are not fed (i.e. Afterlife among others). Non-raiders dont work that way and Sony knows it. Non-raiders are their own worst enemy (i.e. they dont group up and bitch at Sony). Lets ALL REMEMBER WHO WENT TO SAN DIEGO!<br />
<br />
As far as missing out because of the hype, somewhat I agree. But I think you and the raiders with whom you most commonly frequent (I assume here) are also overlooking the difficulties of GoD relative to what many are used to. You can not tell me GoD is not far harder than comparable pre-GoD. Make a mistake in Barindu and let a 2nd or third guy in and many are toast. Let one in an LDoN, PoV, BoT and you are ok 95% of the time if only because they dont swing as hard/fast and can be fully slowed. I dont preach from what I dont know. I took my same grp that I box all the time and did GoD for a couple of weeks. Far more fun definitely. Risk vs Return for anything other than pure chance of equipment upgrade, not worth it. Equipment is situational depending on how down the farm chain of non-raiding you are. Hardcore non-raiders have to get to KT to really benefit and that is not easy unless you are part of a dedicated grp of players. 5 Levels should help, and I am ok with waiting (OoW) for new stuff for the masses to see if its enough to get more non-GoDers into GoD. If not then something has to be done. My fear is that it will be too little too late and even more will migrate to WoW...<br />

<br />
I'm tired of dealing with your inability to read, comprehend and then respond to points that were made 20 pages ago in this thread.  You've already said this same exact thing.  I've already shot it down.  Your history on this game is complete dogshit.  Rather than waste my time re-writing exactly how wrong you are, I'm just going to quote the passages you continually ignore.  <br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=125060&amp;postcount=779<br />
<br />
Your points here again completely undermine your point. My casual guild was able to head into Hate with two groups right around the release of Kunark. I was in full Indocolite with Vigdis. I was just in this armor one expansion behind. <br />
<br />
My casual guild quickly obtained Thurgadin armor with the release of the expansion. If you check my bank on my magelo you'll see an entire set of Champions sitting in the bank. The BP did not take more effort - it still dropped from the 8th Ring armory or from the arena. Just after the release of Luclin, my casual guild entered TOV with two-three groups with an alliance and later 1-2 guild groups. If you check my bank, you'll note I have a full set of Skyshrine armor as well. You'll also notice that I have my epic, and I obtained the epic just at the release of Luclin. I even acquired an ST weapon with a single group during PoP. In other words, I obtained the all of the &quot;raiding&quot; gear, I just got them one or two expansions behind.<br />
<br />
You may be correct that a progression did exist. But in that progression scheme the hard-core non raider was always able to obtain the same rewards after sufficient time had passed. I was able to cloth myself in the &quot;end game&quot; armor. You now claim that I &quot;shouldn't be half of what you are&quot; - but in your little history lesson here I was able to be EXACTLY what you were. <br />
<br />
<br />
Non raiders have always progressed to the very top of the game in past expansions, just at a slower pace.   Since Kunark, however, there has always been exactly one - and only one - zone that requires more work but it has not otherwise hindered progression.  VP, ST, and VT are entirely bypassable - and after a certain amount of time has passed even the first two are also all entirely accessible, even with a single group.  In PoP, charitably, there are six zones  from which any nonraider or casual raider is entirely excluded and from those zones the player would obtain progressive armor that they can obtain and that will enable them to tackle future expansions.  The most recent expansions were built with EP armor as the base-line for tackling the content, particularly when it comes to the necessity of high AC. <br />
<br />
<br />
SoE should not provide players with an &quot;Insta Uber Potion&quot; of any kind. No EP armor not earned by having to do the EP flags, no AA's not earned, No free pass into the Ep's or PoTime. Wanna see that content? You know how to get there, it's not a mystery.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why?  I've asked this once and I'll ask it again.  You don't get to just say that we must earn an EP flag in order to kill a far less difficult mob for EP armor without tethering it to facts and analysis.  You always seem to miss out on that half of the argument.  You are good at rhetoric but you fail to support it.<br />
<br />
When I asked this before all you did was throw out more obcenely retarded rhetoric as you &quot;reason.&quot;  Your first argument was that &quot;Groups should not be interferring with legitimate raid content that has not been completed by at a minimum the top 4 or 5 guilds on a server - else why raid and why have raid content or guilds.&quot;  This has to be the saddest fucking statement I've ever heard a raider make.  Are you suggesting that you and other raiders can't handle the competition?  You need to have your own separate kindegarten recess time?  I seriously doubt any other raider would ever admit that they need a MUCH MORE DIFFICULT mob to stand as gatekeeper to comparatively easier content because they can't hack the competition with nonraiders and casual guilds. <br />
<br />
Your second argument, is that &quot;the PoTime flag progression forced raiders to kill mobs in many many zones and to see a great deal of content. This gives an expansion a longevity and richness of experiance it would not have if everyone showed up in the EP's and PoTime on day one and began beating on the content because all other loot in the expansion would be trumped by EP/PoTime loot.&quot;  This is slightly better but still utterly ignores my and other's suggestions.  If you honestly believe the flags need to be there in order to force the player to experience content, then an alt-flag quest would suffice to meet the same goal.  It has already been acknowledged as an appropriate mechanism through the alt-flag BOT, PoTorment, PoTactics, HOH, CoD.  If the expansion needs longevity and richness, then make the alt-flag quest for EP longer, more tedious and more difficult.  But make it possible. <br />
<br />
<br />
You can winge on this board and beg SoE in Emails. But I guarantee in the end doing the already existing progression content that already takes you far beyond where you are will be more productive than waiting for stuff to fall in your lap from the sky.<br />
<br />
<br />
Winge?  Oh, shit, I'm a WINGER!  I find it amusing that you recommend I do &quot;existing progression.&quot;  What you advocate is that we ignore an entire expansion...and you are so hypocritical that in the same post you talk about the &quot;longevity&quot; and &quot;richness&quot; of the content in PoP that all players should be experiencing...Your 160 IQ can't seem to grasp that I am asking to do the existing progression, and I am willing to beat any mob in the EPs in order to obtain my EP armor from him, I just think sticking an arbitrary barrier between me and that content is absurd.  And so far neither you nor anyone else in this thread has been able to put forth a cogent and logical reason for that level of difficulty and content cockblocking.</div></div><hr />

Nothing at all and I honestly don't see that as an issue with anyone. The guilds that are now in Time and knee deep in GoD content were in Velious at one point and now several expansions later they are not. Progression has always been there and always will.</div></div><hr />

Back to the point why is fire xp and alot of good lower loot) held behind a mob that takes a real raid, and 18 months after the fact. And if GoD was so great I would think that the majority of the Time+ guilds wouldnt be doing EP- content consistently (everyone likes nostalgia every once and a while).<br />

lower guilds are being gutted to feed the raid monster<br />
There are 5ish PoTime guilds on your server. That's around 500 players - a substantial portion of the players base that's going to be more than ready for GoD, neh. Raid Monster or graduate school?<br />
<br />
Speaking of graduate schools - Grats on attending Sloan School, MIT is a great instutution and going to the #1 business school is a significant achievement.<br />

Musta been a bell curved course in Philosophy 101 that caused you to write that little gem. Read it again - sloooooowly. See where you are claiming not comparable then comparing and adjusting B to be just slightly less than A? See it? Get it? Never mind, take yer seat - thanks for paying tuition - here's your diploma.<br />
Cheating is if you hack into the code<br />
OK, you've got me there. Getting the progammers to hack into the code isn't cheating. It's having one guy run the mile in 4:36 and getting the officials to move the finish line a half-mile closer to the start before your run. But you follow up this technically correct argument with an example which proves my point. Somebody is going the get a White Dragon Helm first. It can be you the way you got it, or it can be me, determined to solo it and convinced that should be just as valid a way to get the item.<br />
Take pride in what you accomplish and quit worrying about everyone else so much.<br />
Thanks, perfect advice for casual players. I couldn't have said it better. As you've observed somebody is going to get that White Dragon Helm first. If I'm determined to solo it and not do it in the most effective way, I shouldn't worry about those who get it sooner.<br />

<br />
<br />
One of the funniest things I ever saw was a screenshot a friend of mine sent me. He wanted me to see a harmtouch crit number or some such thing but what I noticed right away was that he had like four dialog boxes and while he was tanking this nasty mob he was engaged in several conversations running from saying &quot;hi&quot; to  officiating guild matters to you know, communicating with people who were raiding the mob he was tanking. I'm lucky if I can avoid accidentally hitting the wrong disc while I tank, let alone carry on four conversations. And as we all know I have superior innate damage mitigation compared to an SK, so you'd think I'd be less busy trying to stay alive than he was.<br />

Well, er...pretty sure a bunch of PoP could be done by one group, heh. I just can't go there to see because those parts of the zone are behind flag events. Look, whether it's 60 or 72 is, in fact, not material to me. The size of the force and the length of sessions required to get through this stuff *is* a barrier to entry. It was designed as a barrier to entry, and it is functioning as as a barrier to entry even for many good players, and I still think it is a qualitatively different sort of barrier of entry than anything that SOE tried before. I didn't need a flag to get my ass kicked in Chardock or Kael or hard LDoNs, for that matter. My current warrior dinged 53 while tanking in the Hole an he didn't need a flag to get in there (did need a rogue, though, heh). My main point was that PoP was structured differently from expansions previous to it, and substantially different from anything that came after (well, so far). <br />

Sleepers Tomb was also artificially blocked by dragons considerably harder than most of boss mobs within ST other than the ancients at the very back.  At the time, first brood dragons took 30-50 (raid force) people to kill (other than zland maybe) and only resulted in one flag (key) at a time.  VP was also closed behind a nasty raid mob (Trak) who's kill resulted in a handful of elusive key pieces.  A long, drawn-out quest was also involved.<br />
<br />
And Vigdis, PoP was aimed exclusively at the 46 crowd, where every other expansion to date had content ranging from at least 1-50 (the exception being Velious which started at/around level 20-25).  I'll not try to tell you that PoP wasnt designed with raiders in mind ... because it was.  It was a flaw that they should have delt with before its release by providing maybe a good bit more content.  Maybe they assumed that non-raiders and newcomers would capitalize on older content to follow the natural progression which was now more or less clear of the hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
Just pointing out, though, that this idea of closing the hardest raiding content behind raiding mobs is not some new beast which arrived with PoP.  It's been around since day 1 of the 2nd expansion.  Nor did they open up old locked zones 2 or even 3 expansions down the road.  To my knowledge the following zones are still locked<br />

What ? playing about 4h a day, 5days per week is a too big barrier for you? <br />
Your exped in VP with your warrior? you have experienced ST / VT or inner acrilya? so how it's different?<br />
What about HS or seb? you didn't need a key for these zone?<br />
Be fucking happy that they gimped BoT / CoD / HoH and torment access.<br />
CoD is one of the best zone in PoP, that the only one where it's remontly challenging and fun to exp in ( rat part ), and how often there is a group there? 0.<br />
<br />
Also I was speaking about raid content, I have done everything up to rathe with less than 60people, and I bet that rathe would have dropped too with less than 60 before it was gimped but the guild where I was didn't want to try because &quot;bigger&quot; guilds didn't manage it.<br />
<br />
On a side note, my war who is not even 60 yet, is halfway to EP, and all the flag are from open raid in less than one month, surprising isn't it? And I could be EP flag ( beside fire ) if I was 65 and with a bit more energy.<br />
Oh and these raid doesn't take more than 2h to do or 3 for the longest, want to get your quarm loot on a silver plater too?</div></div><hr />

And it was impolite to take the rest if you hadn't killed him. He wasn't the hardest mob but he was harder than many of the Dragons behind him. So Back then a casual group I guess could have Gone into NToV Managed at this point not to have ruined their CoV faction and get ready for Aary and Die realizing they probably didn't have the ability to win. Now they very well might be able to win. The only real difference is now instead of big mean mob Standing guard preventing you from passing the same way. (You could just train Aary off while DA I guess) They now force you to kill him for your &quot;Flag&quot;. <br />

For me I wouldn't mind them opening up Plane of Air to level 67. I think it'd be fun. I love that Recluse that goes right to the graveyard.You all should also. Now admittedly I find this zone far harder than the others but hey you want EP access well here you go. You get 1.<br />

Point being these zones were locked from the start and are still locked.  Whether it takes you 1 group or a raid force, content has always been locked.

For you to just say that you didn't actually comprehend the fucking flaws (or maybe you didn't read the post). <br />
<br />
<br />
Non raiders have always progressed to the very top of the game in past expansions, just at a slower pace. Since Kunark, however, there has always been exactly one - and only one - zone that requires more work but it has not otherwise hindered progression. VP, ST, and VT are entirely bypassable - and after a certain amount of time has passed even the first two are also all entirely accessible, even with a single group. In PoP, charitably, there are six zones from which any nonraider or casual raider is entirely excluded and from those zones the player would obtain progressive armor that they can obtain and that will enable them to tackle future expansions. The most recent expansions were built with EP armor as the base-line for tackling the content, particularly when it comes to the necessity of high AC. <br />
<br />
<br />
There. Deal with that.  The flaws prevalent in PoP have most certainly NOT been around in the past five years. Why is this so hard for you?  Why do you bother arguing shit like this?<br />
<br />
If we really want a useful discussion here we have to be able to agree on some fundamentally basic concepts.  One of those concepts is that PoP was an entirely different expansion than any before it and therein lies the progresison problem.  PoP was not a hiccup in the progression scheme it was a fucking pulminary arrest.  We ought to be able to agree on some of these concepts and then once we do we can start talking about what really matters.</div></div><hr />

I read it, i just thought it was bullshit.  You think that EP molds are crucial to the advancement into the next expansions when in fact they arent.  There are other viable options for gearing up for the next expansions.  They may not be quite as good, but since when has raid gear been required to continue moving forward.<br />
<br />
Basically, what youre saying is non raiders need the EP's openend so that they can conduct PU raids in the EPs to gear up for the next expansions?<br />
<br />
 :confused:<br />
<br />
<br />
And Haass, most of the content in EPs is NOT doable by average small groups.  Brutul and his friends are pretty seasoned raiders with at least some of the best gear from previous expansions ... not to mention boss loot from earlier in PoP.<br />
<br />
A select few targest may be doable by 18 (EP geared already) or 24-30 (VT gear and seasoned) ... but by-in-large you arent going to get anywhere on the various rings found in earth and air and the moderately hard raid named in fire.</div></div><hr />

If you think you'll make within spitting distance of 2200ac and any degree of shielding with small groups in the EP's, then you're sorely mistaken.<br />

Max EP gear (including the strictly raid quality) will net you ~8500hp and 1900ish ac (maybe more of 1 with less of the other depending on how you go about it) ... Max GoD groupable will get you to ~8k hps and 1650-1700 ac.

<br />
In short:<br />
<br />
1) X is old or traditional <br />
2) Therefore X is correct or better<br />
<br />
This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because the age of something does not automatically make it correct or better than something newer. This is made quite obvious by the following example: The theory that witches and demons cause disease is far older than the theory that microrganisms cause diseases. Therefore, the theory about witches and demons must be true. <br />

You responded:<br />
Dude this is one of the things casual are pissed about. If you dont get it let me explain it to you nice and simple.<br />
Still don't get it do you? I didn't go from 7.5K HP's unbuffed in a day. I hunted the componts for Bloodmetal Earrings as soon as I could. I bought a Steel Ring of Earthen Resistance, Heavy Rubicite Girdle, blah blah in the Bazaar. After 5 months, I got a BoC with my guild in the EP's. I did every flag mob to the EP's 3-5 times AFTER we were succeeding.<br />
<br />
I broke 9K HP's finally about the time we entered PoTime. With Studyness, accumulated progressive upgrades often as little as 25HP's for attending numerous raids, and grinding LDoN without letup to fill ALL the augment slots I could. <br />
<br />
To make it short this is the difficult pita raiding that many of you eschew. Nit a gimmie gimmie at all.<br />
<br />
Miffed because that progession path is raid only? Some contenst has always been raid only and that content yielded armor and accessories that always have put raiders far ahead of non-raiders.<br />
<br />
Remember Brenlo saying:<br />
&quot;Like it or not Warriors will always tank better than....&quot;?<br />
<br />
Well, I believe it's accurate to say:<br />
&quot;Like it or not hard-core raiders will always acuire better equipment....&quot;<br />

You have a progression path. It leads to current content. All the content I did is open to you as well, however you might have to do it in the same order as I did.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u195"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p195">so the issue it is more than 1 zone? or that the exp is higher? imo Tactics pit is as fast as PoE ledge, GoD sewer trial faster than either. <br />
<br />
The issue is two fold.  First, it is that rather than lock one zone PoP locked five zones.  Second, unlike many of the single zones locked in earlier expansions, PoP locked those five zones behind an encounter significantly harder than much of the content in those five zones and so hard that I believe it will NEVER be beaten by small guilds or small groups of friends.  <br />
<br />
Apolyon listed what he believed was the list of locked zones from past expansions:<br />
Seb<br />
Howling stones<br />
VP<br />
ST<br />
SSra (emp chambers)<br />
Seru (the arx)<br />
VT<br />
<br />
Of those locked zones, ONLY VT is comparable to PoP in that it continues to remain locked to small guilds and small groups of friends.  Every single other zone you listed is accessible via soloing or via a group.   Moreover, I believe that with level 70 and more AAs even small guilds will be able to attempt and beat Emp were they so inclined.  I do not believe a small guild, even with additional levels and AA, can beat the RZ script with 18 people.  Ever. <br />
<br />
As for the experience, you are simply wrong.  POE, POF, and POW are the best experience coupled with ease of continual pulls.  I know this because I exp'd in them with my enchanter. <br />
<br />
<br />
Or is it that the armor difference? The problem  with GoD is they have admitted it was built for level 70 to be included in the expansion then they held off last minute. Frankly GoD has no rush to me though I am in a guild that seems to get hungrier and hungier to raid all the time we take our time and learn encounters and slide along at our own pace. Am I &quot;uber&quot; lol I dont think I am anywhere near it. One other thing before you blast me I have played since 99 like many old timers and payed all my dues every expansion(normally being 1 expansion behind the top runners). I cannot hunt in Ikk or Tipt or any of the other no vowel ass zones, does this make the game less fun to me? no I am playing with my friends of the last 5 years and new friends that I met through my guild. The gear is secondary<br />
<br />
<br />
Wud, you are a raider with three peices of Raex and several items from VT and you have 7.7k HP.  You are telling me right now that you cannot hunt in Ikkinz or Tipt.  I hope you realize this directly contradicts all the raiders in this and the other thread, including the class correspondent Frodlin, who are trying to convince nonraiders (and themselves) that nonraiders are lazy and directionless because they will not try and beat GoD content with LDON gear in order to acquire GoD content that will net them 7.4k HP total.  In truth, I feel that you - like many raiders - are too used to relying on your comrades to make through the single events like Tipt and Ikkinz with a group.  Nonraiders, on the other hand, very well may succeed in beating these encounters despite having significantly fewer HP because they have the drive and determination to do so and they are accustomed to only relying on themselves and their small group of friends.  But I'm not sure its doable.  I turned down a Tipt invite yesterday on Vigdis because I didn't feel I could possibly act as the main tank, geared as I am. I didn't do this because I'm scared of the content.  I did this because I am familiar with the content and I am a realist.  I'll try it when I have more LDoN augs and some VP quest gear - but I don't know if I'll succeed.  And I think its rather telling that raiders like to tell us we aren't trying hard enough when they beat the content with 3k hp more than me and the ones with only 1k HP more than me refuse to try the content altogether.</div></div><hr />

Please leave Ikkinze out of it.  Many non-raiders can not tank Tipt with a LDoN-GoDgroupable group to get there.<br />
<br />
Of course if you add in drops from KoD'Taz+, then you'll reach 8k.<br />
<br />
My problem is that non-raiding people have a very hard time in Tipt, even maxxed out on LDoN and GoD droppables.<br />
<br />
Think about it.  We just heard a warrior with 7.7k with a few pieces of Raex refusing to group in Tipt because he can't tank there.  Do you expect a lesser geared warrior to have a higher chance of survivability?</div></div><hr />

More to the point, we just heard why casual warriors are feeling locked out of the content.  Lets face it, if you're not in an uber guild, and you don't have RL friends that play EQ like I do, you're relying on pickup groups, and pickup group mentality for your success.  This guy just says he can't tank a zone with 7700hp.  He probably told his friends, they probably told their friends.  Pretty soon, poor Glatius has no chance of even sneaking into a group like that because they tell him he's not good enough to tank there, and he doesn't have the resources available to him in the current game to ever get to that point.<br />
<br />
If you can't understand what I just said, read it again until you do.  Perception is just as much of a problem here as anything else.  I might be able to do it...but even if I can, I've already got a leg up on the Gerick's and Glatius' of the world because I know the 6 toons I'm gonna be walking in there with, and I know none of them are gonna balk at the content and shit their pants just because I have 8.3khp raid buffed.</div></div><hr />

The reason you are max GoD 1-groupable ceiling is because a lot of the GoD 1-groupable gear on that magelo is inferior to gear that I'm already wearing and I haven't upgraded Vigdis with an item since May, 2003.  You are wearing one of the three really kick-ass upgrades from GoD.  Look at that magelo.  The test case has 1400AC.  Now add AC augs whereever applicable.

This is a more realistic magelo of someone who at max GoD level.  Please note that at least 4 of those items are insanely rare trash drops.  Also note I put in also one Cazic Thule drop, and 2 AoW drops - all stuff you need at least 3 groups to do these days.  So this isnt technically a non-raider, but the avg equipment level of our guildies is getting pretty close to this.<br />

Yes that is way extreme.  To get that stuff you need similarly geared people doing both the tanking and the healing and the DPS.<br />

The real reason why the mountain trials are actually easy has nothing to do with the difficulty of the mobs but rather the existnece of the 1K DPS Pookas that you can charm.  With some luck on your side, you can pretty much kill anything in the mountain trials regardless of who your tank is.  <br />

I've done a lot of camping in various GoD zones due to BiC and helping people on BiC and I've seen enough items to maybe fill out 1/3rd slots on a person, if that.  These items aren't hard to get but they're not exactly something you can outfit an entire person in with ease, either.  Also there's the fact that if you actually have a group of people needing this stuff (hence casual) it'd take about 6 times as long to get a person with all that gear due to sharing.<br />
<br />
The only real good zone to gear up is Kod'taz since Ageless Relic Protectors can be triggered nonstop as long as you're willing to put in some farming work.  GoD is an alternative but it is not a shortcut to gear up.  The game expects a certain amount of effort to progress.  Frankly it'd be faster just to find enough people who's going to try RZ (who is pretty trivial now I think with all the info and gear that is available) than hunting rare mobs in GoD, unless you like to XP in GoD, in that case the gear is something extra you get along the way.</div></div><hr />

Tell me how many LDoN's does this person have to do?<br />
<br />
Do you think that is a realistic expectation to have non-raiders go through?  550x LDoN in order to stand a chance?<br />
<br />
<br />
Do they want to reap the rewards?  Then i absolutely do.  I could sympathize much more if there was no progression path and non-raiders were just plain out and out fucked over.  This isnt the case though, as you can now, with an equal amount of time invested (as a raider) receive virtually the same rewards without ever killing any Gods or raid encounters.<br />
<br />
The key is that you have to spend an equal amt of time working at it ... which most don't but a few do. As has already been stated: this is a nonraider/raider debate ... not a lazy/dedicated debate.  You get out of the game what you put into it.  If you only play 10 hours a week, dont expect to have even half the goodies/stats of someone who plays 40 hours a week.</div></div><hr />

My mistake.  Let me rephrase then.  This is a REALISTIC magelo of someone who is max LDoN, max vxed level:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1075311<br />
<br />
Anyways, my whole point in being here, as a newbie to Steel Warriors, is to try and voice these concerns in hopes that the raiders would understand.  My guild is nearly equipped as that magelo above, but we have a helluva time in Tipt.  If we dont find more stuff to do in game, I fear we will soon move to a different game soon.  I know I am burnt out doing LDoN's over and over again trying to 'gear up', as others have said.  At this point, I am definitely going to try WoW, and most likely will cancel my EQ account.  It's not a threat or anything, but just simply how I feel.</div></div><hr />

I said an equivalent amt of time invested ... not and equivalent amt of time spent raiding.  IE- one person spends a month farming for VT keys and killing SSra ... 2 months farming VT gear with his guild ... 1 month killing progression mobs and backflagging (assuming low competition) ... 2 months or more of farming EP's ... all the while doing ldon and xping on the side.<br />
<br />
so far we're up to 6 months of raiding time + the amt of time spent doing ldon, xping, and other progression in general.<br />
<br />
If you take that kind of time and apply it to LDoN and subsequently pursue GoD with the same vigor ... i daresay you could equip yourself to the max via GoD in under 2 or 3 months.  The only catch is that you have to pursue it with the same vigor a raider/hardcore raider pursues his interests.  If you wanted to and were flagged for the GoD content ... i'm sure you could then even apply to a GoD raiding guild and skip past time.<br />
<br />
Who, then, is the sucker?  The person who spends 6 months raiding and gearing up with their pals ... or the person who spends 2-3 months working at it for a reward only marginally inferior ... a position which also gives them the ability to skip tons of time raiding Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u216"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p216">Haass i absolutely understand what was said about &quot;perception is everything&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Good, now we're making some headway.  Now keep your head out of your ass and lets continue with this.<br />
<br />
Just because it is assumed something cant be done doesnt mean it is impossible. Why have you changed your position on this one? Werent you the one who was succeeding where others were failing with raids? Didnt people call you crazy?  <br />
<br />
I changed my position on this because people I respect told me that it was possible to actually progress in GoD.  I don't buy SoE expansions on blind faith anymore.  They haven't earned that right.  I'll buy them when people I trust tell me they're worth buying.  Now we see if they're right.<br />
<br />
I understand most people dont have the in-game connections with close friends that you do, Haass, but to say that something is impossible when it isnt is rubbish. Cant tank tipt at 7700 unbuffed? Hogwash ... i did it at 7k even ... my sk friend did it sans defensive/furious raid buffed at 9k max (and yeah he tanked it all start to finish). The fac that there are cowards out there unwilling to step out of their comfort zone does not prove anything. <br />
<br />
I didn't say it was impossible, and if you'll notice, I never said it was impossible.  What I said was the perception  is that it's impossible, and a bazaar geared tank is not qualified to work in GoD.  That leaves us with 2 possibilities...join a raiding guild to get to that point, which the majority of us don't wish to do, or do literally hundreds upon hundreds of LDoN missions in order to get 1492 armor and augment it with the best augments available.  Neither of those are particularly appealing to people.  Can you blame the EQ populous for being pissed off about that?  Do you want to grind out LDoN for 6 months straight..day in, day out, nothing but 8 hours a day of LDoN to get your armor up to snuff?  I don't, Glatius doesn't, Gerick doesn't..and quite frankly, no one else does either.  This is the situation that the vast majority of non raiders are faced with in EQ today.  As you can imagine, it is a very dismal situation indeed. They can't get GoD groups because people won't let a tank with 5khp in the group.  They don't want to do LDoN for the next 4 years to get the armor to tank in GoD, and they don't want to leave the guilds they're in to join raiding guilds to get the armor either.  So what do you propose these people do?<br />
<br />
I came back to EQ for one reason...to see if it's possible, and in the process try to do the non raiders a favor.  If I can succeed (and I'm sorry, but it's gonna be awhile guys, gimme some time on this.  It may very well be midway thru OOW before I can say for certain), then people will have the ammunition to educate the people they group with and say &quot;Look...that fucking asshole did it, and the entire server hates that guy.  We can do it too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Are we starting to make some headway yet Apolyon?</div></div><hr />

This is not representative of real life, apol.  I have friends who joined a raiding guild recently.  She went from ornate bazaar gear/LDoN to time equipped in a span of 4 months.  Sure she isn't as well equipped as some other druids in her raiding guild.  But she sure is better than the druids in my guild, and thus better to survive, DPS, and heal in the GoD arena.<br />
<br />
A lot raiders do not follow the path of progression all the way through, while you may have.  Please do not try to imply that all raiders have farmed their VT keys, have killed every mob up to Time, etc.  Meanwhile, I have to do the SAME content over and over again to get my rewards.  I've done around 10 hard LDoNs in the last 2 days.  To be frank, I am starting to hate seeing the inside of these dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Yes, i do believe we are.  There are even alternatives to farming endless LDoN's to buy 1492 pt armors as well Haass.  <br />
<br />
I know you dont want to grind out LDoN day in and day out, but i'd reccomend you spend a good bit of time in LDoN hard when you come back to EQ.  Your friends and yourself will see upgrades faster than you could imagine off of named, and if you can get into the groove where you can grind them out to a win every time, you'll have plenty of points left over for ac/anger/hp augs to boot.<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna presume to tell you how i did it or you can do it because i know you dont like me and won't take the time to listen  :(  .  I'll let you figure it out on your own and with the advice of others if you seek it ... but i strongly urge you to not bypass LDoN in general and dive straight into GoD, as a lot of the Hard ldon drops compliment GoD items rather nicely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Truth be told, any guild lately into the EP's has spent much less time breaking into them as the ones who first did it. Does that mean you shouldn't get the same rewards, because it took you less time to do it? Nonsense.<br />
<br />
 Better way to compare it would be through manhours, frankly. If it takes a 40 person raid X hours to gain Y drop, then it should take a group of non raiders ~7X hours to gain an equivalent to Y drop. Unfortunately, in too many cases there IS no equivalent to Y drop available to full groups, or even a reasonable facsimile.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with Apol here.  If you are lacking in gear, hard LDoNs drop some of the better stuff out there, better than some GoD items in fact.  Bypassing LDoN will make it rougher on you when you do Sewers trial 1-4.</div></div><hr />

Your response to my post makes it clear to me that I'm not making myself clear, which may be my fault, not yours. I'm not saying that I have nothing else to do or anywhere else to fight, or even that I think I'd be in the PoP zones in question if the flag system was removed. I was just pointing out something that seems to me to be true, which is that the method of making many PoP zones difficult to access and time consuming to move through was different from the methods that designers had previously used to make content difficult. What I was getting at ultimately is that the PoP issue is likely to be less important over time, even to casual players, because everyone will just drive around that speedbump as soon as it's easier to go around it than go over it. I think it was a much bigger barrier for casual players than raid folks, and that this was not a result whose full consequences were anticipated by the designers (though it is possible they wanted to get rid of some of their pesky customers).<br />
<br />
This quote of yours: &quot;What ? playing about 4h a day, 5days per week is a too big barrier for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Right now, it is, yes. It wasn't always, but now it is. Some weeks I can play that much, but I can't pick and choose which weeks or which hours. The possibility that I couldn't pull my weight in a raiding guild under those circumstances is a near certainty, and I'm not at all interested in not pulling my weight. <br />
<br />
My arguments about PoP's structure are disinterested outside of the my belief that design elements in the game that are unpleasant for a significant portion of the player population are potentially bad for eveyone, including me. But I can tell you with certainty that if I had time to hit this game as hard as I used to, I'd feel exactly like Haass: I wouldn't want EP armor from some other zones, I'd want it from EP zones.<br />
<br />
The structural aspects of PoP design do not depend on the number of hours a week I play. The hours one plays and the quality of one's play ar not, in fact, the barrier here. <br />
<br />
I keep trying to read the rest of your post in a way that suggests it was not insulting. But I keep coming up with things like I should be &quot;fucking glad&quot; that this or that was gimped, and also &quot;want to get your quarm loot on a silver plater too?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm very much having trouble seeing this as anything but an insult, and a weird one too, since I thought I was boring people by all the posts I make about very much prefering to loot my own gear.</div></div><hr />

Actually you failed to address a single point as usual and have resorted simply to petty personal attacks to validate your (and by extension raiders) perceived superiority.<br />
<br />
Lets see:<br />
<br />
There are 5ish PoTime guilds on your server. That's around 500 players - a substantial portion of the players base that's going to be more than ready for GoD, neh. Raid Monster or graduate school? So a whopping 6% (rounded up, 500*44/400000) are eligible for GoD under your criteria and this is a good thing? This is substantial? Looks like back to Algebra 101 for ju.<br />
<br />
Speaking of graduate schools - Grats on attending Sloan School, MIT is a great instutution and going to the #1 business school is a significant achievement. Sorry try again. I know the thought of a MIT being #1 might appeal to your engineering focused mind but guess what its not all about numbers, its also about people. Based upon this statement alone (but also magified by your comments towards others here) I wouldnt trust you to lead my cat out of the catbox let alone trust you to run any size business. <br />
<br />
Musta been a bell curved course in Philosophy 101 that caused you to write that little gem. Read it again - sloooooowly. See where you are claiming not comparable then comparing and adjusting B to be just slightly less than A? See it? Get it? Never mind, take yer seat - thanks for paying tuition - here's your diploma. - Guess you missed philosophy 101 huh? This whole argument is one big ad hominem attack upon me. Guess I got more out of class than you did. Better ask for your money back, you got robbed.<br />
<br />
OK, you've got me there. Getting the progammers to hack into the code isn't cheating. It's having one guy run the mile in 4:36 and getting the officials to move the finish line a half-mile closer to the start before your run. But you follow up this technically correct argument with an example which proves my point. Somebody is going the get a White Dragon Helm first. It can be you the way you got it, or it can be me, determined to solo it and convinced that should be just as valid a way to get the item. The irony of this statement is you don't represent this type of person, the uber non-raiders do. You and your 71 closest friends will likely go and get that WDH first, not Haaas trying to do it on a wing and a prayer while facing the likely potential of continuous defeat, and defeat that cant be resolved by throwing yet another body at it or benefitting from the vast array of tools available to a raid that are not available to a grp. In the end you can get on the boards, where you dominate, and just bitch enough about it to see it nerfed, that works too.<br />
<br />
Thanks, perfect advice for casual players. I couldn't have said it better. As you've observed somebody is going to get that White Dragon Helm first. If I'm determined to solo it and not do it in the most effective way, I shouldn't worry about those who get it sooner. Typical engineer, perfection at the cost of sanity. Build the perfect machine and spend so much time and effort doing so that by the time it is done it has no value to anyone. Like I said, I wouldnt trust you to run a business with views like this. It should not be solely about the end, but rather also about the journey, but raiders wouldnt agree with that.<br />
<br />
Physics 101-102 (Calculus not required)<br />
Ya, got that out of the way in HS. But the Materials course had really high standards - woman I never saw once took the final did it in 15 minutes and accepted her 100%. I got a B+ for the course and the final took me 4 hours - What is the rate of migration for intersticial impurities in a bcc crystal under a tortional stress of..... It doesn't take a penif, it takes effort and a brain. - Actually did calculus/physics (along with all the standard 1st year college subjects) in HS as well and attended a college were calculus/diff eq. was required for ALL students, so no it was not no calculus required (although perhaps less than the true engineers might have liked). I like you (I would bet money on it at least) graduated from a school with a reputation for engineering. The difference is every student had to be well rounded and be able to deal with people, something books cant teach you. And I actually knew the woman who got the 100%, she is now a particle physicist at Los Alamos. 2nd smartest person I have ever met and a 200+ IQ and member of Mensa. She dated my roommate who was dumb as a brick and now is a lumberjack of all things. Guess you should have spent less time studying and more time meeting people. All work and no play make BB a dull and apparently angry boy.<br />
<br />
Did your school (EP/PoTime) have high standards or could anyone get in (flag requirements) and graduate (accomplishments)? Yes but like every school there are not written in stone beyond a baseline. Not 1600 SAT no entrance. They adapt to reflect the needs of the school, its graduates, and society (this is especially true of my school more than others). In fact the year I entered it was the toughest school in the country to get into (6% acceptance rate) and not because it enrolled only those with the greatest intellectual capacity, but rather it admitted smart people who were more than one dimensional (i.e. brains). Doh rewards for something other than one characteristic (raiding), UNHEARD OF!!! Even if you had gotten in, I can pretty much guarantee you would not have graduated as your attitude would have gotten you booted out by your classmates. You my friend simply dont play well with others when they disagree with you but I a guess I am dumb enough to keep butting my head against this wall&gt; I guess I find it amusing that anybody can have so much personal self-worth vested in a computer game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u225"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p225">Check out my personal magelo now plz.  In it i've added all 1 groupable upgrades possible at this point in time (including augments).  8300hp unbuffed and over 1700 ac unbuffed.  Better gear can be got from raiding, but at present there isnt much harder content available besides high GoD trials other than raiding.<br />
<br />
The reason why your &quot;one-group&quot; profile and the accepted test &quot;GoD&quot; profile from the bunker are so different is because  you have included items that are not in fact obtainable.  Here let me break it down for you:<br />
<br />
1. Earring of Resonating Battle.  Ikkinz or KodTaz.  Starts hitting for 1300max and ends hitting for 1600. <br />
<br />
2.  Earring of Destructive Essence. Ikkinz 1 (this would be the Ikkinz that Frodlin conceeded he never knew if a nonraider had ever even tanked, with or without a raiding guild group backing him up). <br />
<br />
3. Pendant of the Triumphant Victor. VZ in Tactics.  Perhaps one-groupable with a good puller, but I've seen EP-geared fail.<br />
<br />
4.  Helmet of Ralloz Zek.  AoW.  Not single groupable until Time-geared.<br />
<br />
5.  Gaunt Veil of Purification.  KodTaz.  Acquired from a raid event that requires additional peices to spawn.  According to some asshole raider &quot;we did it with about 24 to 30 LvL 65 elemental equiped peeps it aint that tuff.&quot; <br />
<br />
6.  Glyph Prayer Ring.  Ikkinz.   Again, there has never been any statement by ANYONE that a nonraiding tank can beat Ikkinz 1, especially without a raid group backing him up.  <br />
<br />
7.  Crafted Wristband of Strife. Ikkinz3.  Unless a warrior here is able to post that they are a nonraider and completed Ikkinz1 without a raiding group, this isn't possible.<br />
<br />
8.  Pitted Vambraces. Sewers.  Doable, but last night in the warrior channel everyone was recommending AGAINST upgrading to these from Kizrack's ffs.<br />
<br />
9.  Dauntless Muramite Ring.  KodTaz and Ikkinz. <br />
<br />
10. Bracer of the Heartstriker.  Tipt.  We just heard a 7.7k tank express his belief that this is not doable.  <br />
<br />
11. Fleshbound Shroud of Aggression.  KodTaz.  A raid encounter.<br />
<br />
12. Cape of Broken Enchantments.  Miraguls - not GoD and clearly doable. <br />
<br />
13.  Warlord's Steel Gaunts. Ruj - not GoD but again clearly doable. <br />
<br />
14.  Taelosian Girdle.  Sewers - doable and on the profile. <br />
<br />
15.  Burnished Antique Greaves.  Vxed - doable and on the profile.<br />
<br />
16.  Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites.  MM - doable and on the profile. <br />
<br />
17.  Blade of Carnage.  AoW - not single-groupable. <br />
<br />
18.  Obsidian Scimitar of War.  VZ in Tactics. <br />
<br />
19.  Carved Vrex Totem.  Ikkinz.  <br />
<br />
Basically, the HP-heavy armor listed in your little magelo is in KodTaz or Ikkinz, both zones that were barred in the GoD Bunker debate because its questionable whether they are doable for nonraiders and casuals.  But all of sudden because that sparked such interest you start pushing the envelop and believe you can pawn off on me solely KodTaz and Ikkinz loot.  I think you are full of it. <br />
<br />
But even if you are not, this entire magelo ignores an entire expansion.  It pretends PoP does not exist because rather than address the significant deficiencies with PoP you'd prefer to sell me on the idea that I should obtain gear from a new expansion without first having obtained the benefit of gear from the prior expansion.  The exact opposite of any sane progression model. <br />
<br />

edit-  Oh and by the way Vigdis .. that magelo sucks.  It was created by a cleric who wanted to show a taste of what is out there for Warriors in every-day GoD.  It wasnt created to show you where the ceiling was in 1groupable progression, or even created for these threads, so quit waving it around as your poster-child &quot;top of the line&quot; GoD 1groupable warrior.  It was made by a cleric and posted in the bunker section to show casuals a taste of what is out there and on their level atm.<br />
<br />
No. It was created and limited specifically to content that is DOABLE one-groupable content for casuals and nonraiders.  Ikkinz and KodTaz is not that content.  I am well aware of the ceiling.  My max magelo right now can reach 8.1k, but a lot if it isn't with GoD armor and some of it assumes help with things like VP key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, looks like I forgot something.  Let me also add that the stigma surrounding GoD also surrounds hard LDoN.  A lot of tanks can't get hard LDoN groups because they're not well enough equipped, as percieved by their groups.<br />
<br />
So, riddle me this, and this is an honest question.  Upgrade my magelo, without LDoN, without GoD, and obviously without the EP's.<br />
<br />
Yes, there are single groupable upgrades I can get.  I could buy a Zek helm, I could buy a few other pieces of high end loot, but that's all I can do.  It relates back to the bottom feeding problem I said earlier.  When I quit EQ, ring of slime was always down, Dozekar was generally killed by elemental + guilds.  <br />
<br />
What we have, is a barrier that is preventing people from progressing based upon perception.  I have 5500hp.  Most groups won't take a tank like me for anything that would yield me an upgrade.  So then how do I upgrade?  We've heard it countless, countless times on this board.  &quot;You're not well enough geared for LDoN hard, or GoD, or whatever.&quot;  So how do we progress without grinding out 550 LDoN normals?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make some friends ... or use existing contacts in game to help you get groups and progress.  Most people have a handful of several close friends by the time they hit 65.  I started farming Hards at under 5500 hp unbuffed.  My roomate (bard of equal gear level) and i put together groups consisting of other close friends we knew and went at it.  At times, we would zone in and see several named on track.  In such a case, we'd skip trying to complete the mission and just go on a named hunt.<br />
<br />
When my friends weren't online i did normals ... some progresss &gt; no progress.<br />
<br />
If you are constantly relying on the /lfg tool and not capitalizing on friends/contacts you have, then you're not using your time very efficiently.<br />
<br />
All of this is beside the point in your case Haass.  You've already stated that you have a tight band of close friends who are goal oriented jsut as yourself.  I understand that it's not easy to do all the time.</div></div><hr />

The situation does not affect me, but I can understand the problem. <br />

Things starting to be a little clearer here?  You don't need to be affected by the problem for it to exist.  I'm not affected by the problem at all.  In fact, I really really hope I'm sitting at 7500 unbuffed in a few months, that will make me really happy.  At the same time, I can understand the plight of people who, due to RL and playtime constraints, and the friends they have in game, can feel like they're banging their head against the wall trying to progress.<br />

It's really kind of sad that you don't get it BB.  It's not about &quot;teh win&quot; its about staying in the game.  Unless OoW opens some doors for non-raiders and allows them the opportunity to reasonably, and I would go so far as to say fairly, gear up to deal with OoW and GoD content, then lots of non-raiders are in all probability going to throw in the towel.  If non-raiders were as hyper competative as you are, they'd all be in raiding guilds.  They aren't and they're not.  And you attempt to use that as justification for excluding them from the majority of the game from here on out.  They were too lazy to do all the things you've done, too lazy to follow the exact same paths you have, and therefore not deserving of being allowed to participate in new content.<br />
<br />
Great, I understand your perspectived.  I think it's ass, but at least I understand it.  Just so long as you're willing to continue to pay the higher prices for new expansions as the player base continues to shrink so that it contains primarily raiders only, then I suppose non-raiders can just go ahead and start looking around at new games and new opportunities.  We don't need to be in competition with people like you.  That's not why most of us play.  Frankly, you're not a very enviable person to emulate to begin with, Mr. Warrior #10.</div></div><hr />

Must be reading a different thread(s) then me. IQ quoting is an implied attack on everyone else for example. Like I said throughout,  if you cant see that by extending a personal attack (rather than a factual one) on me that he sought to discredit what I said then so be it.<br />
<br />
I do, however, find it quite interesting that the same was not said to BB after he posted, but I dont expect any one to defend/agree with anyone on the other side of this debate. I would say that if you bothered to read this thread you would see that I agree with many of the points made by the more raid-oriented people on this board, just not &quot;its gotta be this way because it always has been and I feel diminished if its changed.&quot; The answer is usually somewhere in the middle.<br />
<br />
And unlike many of the raiders on this board, you will NEVER convince me that hiding 40%+ of PoP and 50%+ of GoD (especially the beginnings of the better parts of both) are a good thing. That and requiring Fire xp for GoD AAs when most cant get Fire xp.<br />

Agree with most of this but it defies the trends over the last 2 years of giving non-raiders somethat that is effectively their own and defending it from higher parties. (LDoN had its use for raiders, if not then take out you wep/hp augs and throw them away please).<br />

- Gunnar wasnt a dig on you just a point that the principal 1grp content that everyone will cite as an example of the giving casuals content is in fact very raider friendly as well. This cant be said for much of PoP/GoD. - EDIT<br />

This is the final end-state purpose of my comments in this thread without all the misquotes that has gone on between then and now. If you disagree with this then I suggest you start saving your money for rate hikes. Most of us arguing here on this thread for more options/content have been attempting to say this (and this comment or something like it pops up every 150-200 posts).<br />
<br />
If you raiders (applied loosely) truly believe what you are saying about doable content and progression then take some time out of your busy schedule and try and help the problem (grp with lower people in situations that can help them) rather than sit here and fight a rear guard action (i.e. talk) against change. Show them that they can do it (assuming they can). Demonstrate your skill rather than talk about it. Quit downplaying the problems others might be having and show them how to really do it. The reality is, for better or worse, a lot of people feel (notice didnt say know) that they are reaching the end of their days due to lack of upgrades, be it content, equipment, skills, etc. If you cant do this than be prepared to be fighting the same mobs over and over again because there will likely be no progression for you either when there is no money for new expansions.<br />
<br />
Its been fun (up until today) but the utility of this thread for me personally is long gone and as such this is my last post on this subject. Even if you disagree or think I am an ass then I hope you understand that this argument will likely be reflected in ways that only SOE understands, simply fix it or lose my 7 accounts. If OoW doesnt help the situation then I will be gone and I for one wont look back as this year (to date) has left a bad taste in my mouth.<br />

 Well, BB, the problem is if you do any pickup groups, many folks refuse to do easy anymore. Those folks are the ones used to grouping all the time with EP+ geared tanks. Now, you don't have the need for pickup groups, or LDoN for that matter. Bully for you. Most 65 Warriors do, and as long as perception keeps us locked out of GoD and hard LDoN, then there's been an artificial lengthening of that gearing process which is already more than long enough, if you're comparing to EP/Time gear.</div></div><hr />

I probably understated by half the number of LDoN hards I've done......<br />

In brief I go along with group wishes. If they bite off more than they can chew, then they make my don't group list.<br />

I suppose my guild tag is helpful, but I don't stay/lfg much - a little perk that ya get when you raid and do more advanced content.<br />
<br />
Warriors that play well and that are equipped for the content they are doing don't sit /lfg - we don't have aggro problems anymore. I've not seen more than 3 or 4 65 Warriors /lfg at anytime in the last three months.<br />

Reasons include how easy LDoN - even Difficult is, many players 2-boxing and forming their own groups, and players that group regularly with friends.<br />

Not only are you being arrogant, you're being insultingly arrogant.

 Secondly, the people wanting tanks for hards aren't chance takers. Taking a 5k tank may lead to a wipe. They don't want wipes. So they look for 7 or 8k tanks. They want easy. Just like you claim the undergeared tank who wants to do hards is.  :rolleyes:<br />

Maybe on your server. To be honest, I only see two kinds of groups do Difficult. Guild groups where success is assured and pickup groups of under equipped risk takers because they want the drops badly.<br />
<br />
Everybody else knows Normals are almost 100% guaranteed and 2 Normals take same time as one Difficult.<br />
<br />
Now maybe on your server everyone falls into the two catagories I mentioned. But on mine, the majority are between the extremes and actually want the fast guaranteed AP's more than the iffy loot. 90% of my groups do Normal and I've done a lot of LDoN (this is the main reason i feel this gambit is highly improbable).<br />
HP/AC, it's 'Droga weapons yes/no?'<br />
ROTFL 8). Actually I've never gotten &quot;qualified&quot; by an LDoN group (this is the other reason). The funny thing is generally someone will ask me while in the Dungeon about my HP or what my primary weapon or BP is (Warriors are always happy to talk about their HP and equipment). So I'll link the item and apologize for having my good stuff in the bank.<br />

What I dont understand is substandard pickup groups who can barely complete a Hard in 90mins persisting on making things difficult for themselves. Sure there is some ok items in there, but surely it would be a better plan to put off getting them until you had a better group build then 5k tank+FT3 cleric+chanter with 1200hp unbuffed. I have seen such groups trying to grind out hards and they end up winning 1 in 4 at best, and they take 75-90mins to do it in. There is a difference between taking risks, and simply not being prepared.</div></div><hr />

If you can kill a named, you can get a nice upgrade for somebody, and you don't have to worry about cockblocks or blown spawns or 'racing' farmers. That has great appeal to casual players who attempt them.<br />
<br />
 <br />
And sure, it's a risk - so's a raid, for that matter, by those standards. However, it's a risk that I'm willing to take to progress. Since my job's flaky hours don't permit me long stretches of playtime on anything, I wouldn't mind the 'drop in and look for named' approach, or even trying to win the damn things. I know I can reliably tank anything in a hard LDoN but a named, and the only reason I've yet to try tanking one is because - well - the two times I got to try a hard, no nameds were up.<br />
<br />
 Once again, tho, problem is not my willingness to make effort, it's that folks looking for tanks won't take a flyer on me. Until I get Jedi mind powers, nothing to be done about that. 'You don't need to see my HP and AC'.   ;) <br />
<br />
 (Note: I'm not discussing normals here, because, well, I was doing those when I left, and when I come back, my next win will be #100. I'm still doing the slow progressing, but forgive me for looking for alternatives that don't take umpteen bazillion LDoN's to do on my schedule.  :)  )</div></div><hr />
