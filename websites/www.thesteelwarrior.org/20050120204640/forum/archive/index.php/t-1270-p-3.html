<br />
I remember 3 expansions ago, knight classes didnt have much to offer.  On raids, I often wondered what they did.  I mean the other classes has very specific roles and usually they do em.<br />
<br />
Ocean Lord is feeling real good right now because knights are getting exp groups finally!  I say throw em a bone, it sucks to be underpowered.  <br />
<br />
My case is the same as this original thread.  Its the case about aggro and I personally would like an improvement.  My HP/AC, offensive, and defensive abilities Im fine with as a warrior, just the ability to hold better control of the mob's attention.<br />
<br />
As for exp groups, a lot of warriors already dont have too much trouble getting in them.  On raids, we mostly are the ones 1st equiped in good gear and for a time . . . The knights got seconds. <br />
<br />
Let Ocean Lord feel high and mighty now.   They prob dont let him post much on his own boards so he's got to come over here :p .  But steelwarrior has always been an open forum.  Anyways, the paladins are getting all wiled up now because the nerf storm might be looming.  They got their moment of glory for a bit, but possibly for not tooo much longer :confused: .</div></div><hr />

I mean if biographies on the lives of pro wrestlers can go best seller I'm sure &quot;The case against aggro lock&quot;  can top Harry Potter. :D  <br />
<br />
Seriouly though I remember ten pages or so ago when I tried to talk common sense to Ocean about agro and  knights vs. warriors.  But as I'm sure your all aware now the guy is like a 4 year old with his hands over his ears shouting &quot;LALALALA I can't hear you! I need agro! I'm an uber mage-knight! LALALALALA!&quot;  Is our utility going to get knights groups?  Not really, but they do help, buffs that stack with cleric buffs, group heals, heals over time, root, flash of light, loh, pacify undead spells etc. it's all handy in different degrees depending on level, who your with and what your hunting but it all adds up to make us better, any paladin claiming other wise is doing an Ace Ventura impression of mister assholio.  Yes, the agro off stuns is a big factor in how good we're doing atm but even if stuns had zero agro we could just chain stun, tank a stunned mob for 14 seconds, drop flash of light, still hold agro, do good damage with a big 2hander,avoid damage better than most warriors from those stuns and if we lost agro, drop a stuns until you get it back or root.  So for the last time Ocean, Agro is not the be all and end all of the knight classes, it's everything we bring to the table that makes us good tanks! <br />

I have a number of very good friends in this game who are knights.  I consistantly find that the attitude of most knights in game is very good.  When grouped with a knight, most actually prefer me to tank, using their tools to help me do it well.  I look at the knights(well, pallies) who have posted in this novel and while I disagree with many of them, I still like them.  Razner, Apothes and Aeka(whom I disagreed with bitterly, but was well spoken and polite...and I have read her stuff over on PoN recently, after checking it out folloing the banning controversy, and have been very impressed with a lot of what she has said) all strike me as very decent people.  Ocean Lord is just a troll, and should be ignored, he is not worth the effert to reply to.<br />
<br />
Agro is not the be all and end all of the knight classes, it's everything we bring to the table that makes us good tanks!  <br />
<br />
I think this is the clearest, best stated and truest comment made here.  Pallies bring a number of wonderfull utility spells to a group, in adition to good ability at absorbing damage, and great agro controll.  Agro is probably the most important(to some at least) part of that package, but even the edge in agro, pallies will still be good tanks.  Any change SoE might make in the name of tank balancing will almost certainly have unexpected consequences, and might go to far, or not far enough.  It is impossible to judge in advance.  But I do believe that never again will knights be driven back to Kunark, they offer too much, and do it too well for that to happen.<br />

I think he is limiting ideas to just warriors, leaving other classes out of it.  I think it is well known that warrior woes is in relation to knights.  When it get's stickied, it will most likely get linked on other message boards(as the druid sticky did), and he hopes we don't like quite as rediculous as some thought druids did in asking for what they did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I hate to turn the troll train back on track...<br />
<br />
We are discussing Aggro Lock and the EXPERIENCE GROUP situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are a few concepts and Ideas from EQ...<br />
<br />
Aggro - aggro is the complex system of AI used to determine the target of a mobs attacks. By affecting a mob thru spells, abilities and combat damage, a player gains aggro.<br />
<br />
Hate List - this is the current list of targets that the mob hates. Depending upon what a player has done to a mob they may move up or down this list. Spells and abilities are designed to lower or increase a players hate.<br />
<br />
Frenzy Aggro - Frenzy aggro is when a player has low health, the mob can sense the weakness and moves in for the kill.  This aggro overrides normal hate list order.<br />
<br />
Rampage List - Rampage aggro for mobs that rampage is determined by the chronological order that players were added to a mobs hate list, thru spells, range, damage,etc. This list never changes unless they player zones or mob dies.<br />
<br />
Rooted aggro - when a mob is rooted, its aggro list is determined solely by range, it will attack the closest target.<br />
<br />
Mobs Target - the target of a mobs attacks is determined by the hate list. If a player is at the TOP of the hate list, the mob will attack or move towards that player.<br />
<br />
Aggro Lock -  this is defined where one class thru spells or abilities can maintain itself at the top of the hate list on an targeted  mob. With aggro-lock players may attack a mob with no fear of retaliation.<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Is aggro-lock bad?<br />
<br />
Aggro-lock is not inherently bad, it is in fact the goal of virtually ever encounter. If a group/raid is able to maintain the focus of a mobs targets upon one person, then they are able to control the encounter. This is part of the design of encounters, making aggro lock too easy trivializes an encounter, making it impossible creates a potentially impossible encounter. There is a balance that must be maintained.<br />
<br />
The EQ aggro system was devised that the players LEAST able to withstand a mobs full attention, were  able to grab that attention the best. While the players best suited for that attention had to work at it. Thus casters with high DD, debuffs,slows etc.. could rapidly move up the hate list, while warriors designed as tanks had a very hard time.<br />
<br />
This created the skill known as aggro management. whereby players had to balance their skill at doing damage to a mob and maintaining their position behind the tanks on the aggro list. Classes were given skills, abilities and spells to help manage their aggro.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
That sounds great, so whats the problem?<br />
<br />
Planes of Power mobs were designed different from normal eq. These mobs have very High DPS, and LOW HPS. That combined with a extremely high Zone Experience Modifier, made for very fast  experience gains. This created a mindset,  where killing the mobs faster and faster is the goal. To do this most of the standard aggro management skills were disregarded. Mobs slowed before tank gets aggro, casters casting full power rapidly, melee attacking as soon as mob enters camp, all designed to kill mobs as fast and gain exp at as fast a rate as possible. <br />
<br />
The one weakness in this was the ability for the tank (ie. warrior) to gain aggro and maintain it throughout the fight. Since the mobs have such high dps, slow is imperitive to preserve mana and also to prevent from instant death to casters not designed to withstand such damage. Warriors are completely unequipped for this role, and in this situation...<br />
<br />
Up step the Knights. Knight had always been able to generate extreme snap aggro, thru their use of spells. This previously was used to protect and save casters who over-aggro'd. <br />
Originally, Knights were tank classes, but they were in many ways inferior to warriors as a pure Tank, they were designed as a hybrid. Their hps/ac were much less and they were unable to take a sustained beating. Also due to their hybrid design, they had much smaller mana pools, and were unable to maintain casting during combats for extended periods.<br />
<br />
In Kunark all agree that Knights had problems. They Tanked little better than rangers, did very little damage, stole experince from groups and where generally unwanted. Since then throughout expansions they have benn consistently upgraded. They no longer have to choose between being a tank with high HP/AC and being a caster with high WIS/INT/MANA  they can get both. Their spell lines at first very limited have been greatly expanded. Their weapons usable only by them have been upgraded. Essentially what started out as perhaps  -- 50% tank / 50% caster -- is now -- 90% tank / 60% caster --<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Knights now can tank as well as a warrior in normal exp situations, anyone who says 'but warriors have defensive' is diverting the discussion. Knights also have the ability through low-cost fast casting spells to gain and maintain aggro-lock at will and indefinately. <br />
<br />
This fact is well known, every class sees this and realizes that there is some imbalance in the game. Just as in Kunark where everyone knew there was something 'wrong' with knights. People know that there is something 'wrong' with warriors. Warriors are still around only because people still 'think' we are needed on raids. Once they discover that that is not the truth, then we will no longer have any role there either. We will all log on our caster on our second account to join raids, put the warrior on auto follow on the enchanter in group 12, When it comes time to use defensive on Uber_God_01   do our 3 minutes of glory and then go back to playing CasterQuest...<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Aggro Lock needs to be balanced.. <br />
<br />
In an Exp situation...<br />
<br />
Either all tanks get it, or none..  Giving a class or two supreme advantage over another is not fair or balanced, this was true of charms, it is also tru of aggro-lock.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In a raid situation...<br />
<br />
For the most part it is balanced..<br />
<br />
The number of encounter that this is a concern are much smaller in number and much easier to tune rather than the thousands of exp type encounters. The mobs here can be tuned easilly to compensate for any increased warrior aggro ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When they decided to work on the casters, and to use the warriors as the baseline for everyone else, that started the trend of ignoring the warriors, and to a lesser extent, all melee, when thinking about adding abilities or items... not completely, but noticeably more than the other classes.<br />
<br />
Also, when they addressed the caster issues by means of addition of focus effect, flowing thought, and many other forms of increased mana regen, as well as new spells and abilities of all kinds, they essentially went overboard, and gave TOO MUCH to caster types. Now, they have to corect the situation.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to note that I can't believe they were stupid enough to give all casters 5 levels of spells, but give the pure melee no new abilities whatsoever. Did they not REALIZE that would be unbalancing, and not giving warriors new abilities while giving paladins 5 new levels of spells is going to vastly increase paladin capabilities, totally messing up the balance between casters and noncasters? /boggle</div></div><hr />
