<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, i used to wear a CoFlames, and recently dkp-bought a Cloak of Daggers and later a Woven Shim Choker.  So I /bazaared a Soulscream Belt so I could get some haste before I could get the choker(which I now have).  My other belt is the Silver Girdle of Stability.<br />
<br />
The Silver Girdle(no drop) is mainly AC but with my stamina, the Soulscream belts adds alot more HP.  <br />
unbuffed with Silver Girdle HP 5369/AC 1376 <br />
unbuffed with Soulscream Belt HP 5421/AC 1351<br />
<br />
I havent been able to sell the CoF yet(2 for 59k in baz atm).  When I do, I would love to buy a Heavy Tooled Weapon belt or a Heavy Rubicite Girdle, but I can never find one for sale when I have the cash.  75k for Tooled was last time I saw it, and havent seen the Rubi Girdle for sale at all.  Are there any other belts that have some sta, ac and 40+ raw hp that are easy to come by if i throw enough cash at the situation?  Will have maybe 75k to spend, if/when i get CoF sold.  I would have maybe 20k more if i sold the soulscream belt too.  But I like what the Soulscream does for my hp, but not AC.   argh!  I need some advice on if i should keep the soulscream for the HP, or use Silver Girdle for AC, until i can buy a different belt :)  My magelo is current, and the test profile has the Silver Girdle of Stability in it.<br />
<br />
I will be able to get my gloves upgraded to Gloves of Stability as my guild is taking out LTK very often, and should be able to get them in the next couple of weeks, but not anytime soon.  This will help me out a little bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You've obviously killed King Tormax and Xanamech judging by your magelo profile, so I see no reason why you can't add Dain Frostreaver to that list as well.  If you're curious as to what I'm talking about, the Belt of Dwarf Slaying (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4362) makes for a solid, all class useable, upgrade until you start edging your way into Vex Thal.  On top of that, Dain is spawned every time someone turns in pieces for the 8th Shawl and Dain ring (9th or 10th, can't remember), so he's up A LOT.  <br />
<br />
Just a thought. ;)</div></div><hr />
