<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I got one of these and it is a beautiful 19/14 1hs. I tend to use it in offhand with Fleshgrinder in primary. Works a treat for aggro generation. BUT they are currently selling on cazic for 125k :/<br />
<br />
Now, with 125k I can get myself some pretty nifty stuff (ornate molds, and a cheaper 1hs for secondary) I rarely MT, mainly do DPS, for which I use a Bladed Staff.<br />
<br />
Should I sell the Split Blade ? I love it, but well, 125k, I mean...<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For DPS, you want a 2 hander.  I have never used Splitblade, so cannot comment on other similar agro weapons that you could buy for offhand.  You could with that money get a Windblade or War Marshall's Bladed Staff for DPS, a GSoT for agro(price has come way  down on them), and have a good chunk a cash left over.  But if you really love the Splitblade, and are doing well with it, why change?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my 2cp is dont buy any ornate for a bit<br />
prices are dropping by the day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I completely agree, ornate prices will fall through the floor.  I would definitely dump the split blade asap though.   You should just go camp a Greatstaff of Thunder or similar quality 2 hander.  We got about 4 in a 10 hour grind yesterday in the south wing.  If your guild can do him, head for BoT and drop Auliffe.  Greatstafff of Four Winds is *very* nice dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally, I'd ditch the split blade.  For that price you could buy a good procing weapon (new hammer or sword from droga as an example), or even a GSoT for 2handed aggro, and still have a good bit left over.  Definately hold off on ornate while the prices take the time to drop like crazy.<br />
<br />
And since someone mentioned it, the Greatstaff of the Four Winds is very nice.  I use it as both my aggro weapon, and my dps weapon heh.  I just hold off a bit when on dps, and use proximity to lessen my aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd sell the split blade because:<br />
<br />
1.  Odds are it is at its peak in terms of pp value<br />
2.  A number of substitute items are bound to be coming out with next expansion (which will cause price to plummet)<br />
3. As stated above if lookin fer pure dps a War marshall would at least be equal (and odds are better).  If for agro a GSOT would definately be better<br />
4. If you find yourself missing it odds are you can buy it back in 2-3 months at 50pct the price.<br />
<br />
I'd advise you take the proceeds and sit on them (100k now is still worth something in a couple months).  Its hard not to spend the money but I've already seen some good deals popping up for ornate...unless they nerf drops in Sol Ro tower the supply should really start outstripping demand soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sell the split blade <br />
<br />
Its a crummy dps weapon and it lacks a proc for agro. It looks the shiznit - but thats about it. The hps are great but theres no point having 1000's of hps and not taking the knocks.</div></div><hr />
