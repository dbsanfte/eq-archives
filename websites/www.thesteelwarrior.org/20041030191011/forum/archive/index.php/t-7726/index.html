<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I've looked around (even used search) and while I admit to some brain damage in advance...I couldn't find a direct answer to this. <br />
<br />
I'm returning after a fairly significant absence. Currently I've a pretty casual warrior so I know I'm not going to have much if any access to good nodrop weapons for some time...hence I'm going to be bazaarified in my weapon choices till at least 65.  What I'm curious about is the tradeoff at 60 between the current agro favorite <br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn     <br />
Damage: 12 Delay: 19 <br />
Dex: +4 Sta: +8 Agi: +4 Disease Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5 HP: +55 Mana: +45  <br />
Planar Strike (0 stun 75hp) <br />
<br />
and a<br />
<br />
Velium Gemmed Long Sword   <br />
Damage: 16 Delay: 20 <br />
Str: +10 Wis: +10 Int: +10 Agi: +10 Fire Resist: +10 Cold Resist: +10 Magic Resist: +10 HP: +80 Mana: +80 End: +80  <br />
<br />
Sotb has a DPS of 13.16 while the VGLS has a DPS of 16.5.  Stats clearly favor the VGLS...but the proc obviously Sotb.  But with VGLS dropping down into the 12K range I'm really wondering if that much added DPS would make the VGLS a better offhand weapon.  I have a Copper Hammer of Striking and was thinking that might be the better primary weapon...with the VGLS aug'd with anger or Yak...but I see so many people talking about the Sotb...<br />
<br />
So to cut to the chase...assuming the 5-6K difference in price isn't an issue...is the SoTB still a better choice than the VGLS?  or now that it's so cheap is the VGLS the new choice of droppable 1hs?  <br />
<br />
Anyone made a comparison yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you want cheap ditch both and get a Greatstaff of thunder as its good aggro for small price.<br />
<br />
if you want the best buy the SoTBS ... dont waste money on the velium thing.  its good dps, but it sucks for aggro.</div></div><hr />

Ah, I see we've found a new splitblade of destruction that we're gonna have to hear about 150 times this month.</div></div><hr />

That's why I searched and then asked.<br />
<br />
On the upside the VGLS is 12K instead of 120K.  But thanks for the info and I'll save the pennies and go with the droga drops.  I knew the SBoD wasn't worth it (amazingly overpriced)...but at 1/10th the price sometimes things change :D and I haven't had the benifit of playing for a while so I didn't think it would hurt to have the question/answer clarified.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />

On the other hand, I think the velium gemmed greatsword (34/28) is a really nice minor DPS upgrade from a WMBS if you can pick one up at a good price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What makes the SotB such a clear winner, Zurd, is the inherent proc in the weapon. <br />
<br />
Planar stun lands successfully on just about every mob you're likely to encounter. That stun interrupts casting and generates hate. And the proc is free. It's already in the weapon. That augment you're thinking of buying for the Velium Gemmed will fit just fine in the SotB, too, making it an even more awesome choice for you to wield.<br />
<br />
My rule of thumb: never augment a weapon that doesn't have a proc already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/shrug.  A piece of crap is a piece of crap, no matter the price tag.<br />
<br />
If it's worth spending 12k on, even tho you know that it won't be in your aggro setup (Or shouldn't anyway), then by all means, buy it, fuck around with it, parse it, post some data and then sell it when you get bored with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What doesn't show up in the post above is that the Velium Gemmed Longsword has two augment slots (type 4 and type 7), not one.<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever seen a useful aggro-related augment for slot 7 out of GoD?</div></div><hr />

  Pretty sure slot 7 is still just stats, so the best you can get out of that is ac or hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Theres a Slot 7 lifetap aug called the muddy gem of lifetapping that drops in the sewers.<br />
<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26562<br />
<br />
Why there aren't any other augs I have no idea... Why don't they just make a type 7 anger 3 aug and be done with it, it sure would shut up a lot of us who are whining about the unavailability of EB weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wonder what happens when you aug that with the type 7 lifetap and a type 4 proc.  If it works perfectly normally I would be surprised, since generally they don't think that far ahead when they code something (at least from past &quot;you can't do that&quot; 's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It just plain dumb they put a slot 7 on that.  If they had out 2x slot 4s it would have been a winner.  Instead you have another weap thats designed for dps not agro (I'd say this is more of an improvement in the splitblade category not a replacement for the 2x EB category).<br />
<br />
Still it might be worth a whirl if you can get one cheap enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah. 2 slot 4's would solve the problem equally well. Although I wouldn't be surprised if there is some sort of a technical  issue with having two slots of the same type on a given item. Given that having at least a pair of stun/hate proc's is more or less required in order to be a viable warrior nowadays, I don't know why SOE insists on leaving us with such limited options. <br />
<br />
I'd also be interested to know if the type 7 lifetap proc works in conjunction with an ldon type 4 proc. It would be amusing to have a 4 lifetap weapon combo :)<br />
<br />
I'd really like to move beyond a pair of innate stuns + yaks in order to get rid of knockback, but I can't until I can get my hands on an innate EB weapon (400kpp or a raid guild).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">AoW is pretty easy these days ... any guild that can field 4 decent clerics can kill AoWar .. you just need a bit of dedication on the part of the people to lock down his spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It would be amusing to have a 4 lifetap weapon combo :) <br />
Black Acrylia weapons have an innate lifetap proc and a type 4 aug slot ... thus you can already get a 4 liftap proc DW combo if you want.<br />
moreover the type 7 aug lifetap is lore, so you will ba able to get only one of them, thus the 4 lifetap combo from the cultural weapons will actually stop at 3 procs combo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope lots of the armor has two of same type (usually 2nd tier LDoN armor), it could be different for procs vs stats but I would think that given how procs work there shouldnt be a real problem (i.e. lots weps out there with 2, 1 innate 1 aug, on them already). But I am usually wrong, so ....  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I could see a few things that could potentiatly happen with aug procs though:<br />
<br />
1.  They both work and they both proc at an independent 2 ppm in mainhand (what we would like to happen)<br />
2.  They both work but share their proc rate, so you now only get 1 ppm for each aug.<br />
3.  Only one of the aug's work (probably the first one put in) and it works at it's 2ppm rate.<br />
4.  They both work and they both proc at the same time every time you get a proc (would be interesting, but would probably get fixed fast)<br />
4.  You no longer get any aug procs.<br />
5.  You no longer get any procs, and you crash the server/zone or your client each time your weapon tries to proc (memory problems).<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably other scenarios that could happen to, just from a programming point of view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would hope that the above is the correct behavior, and if it were different, SOE would fix it. I wonder if an ldon type 7 anger 3 aug is the sort of thing we could get added to the list of possible ldon tweaks. Does anybody have a problem with it?<br />
<br />
<br />
AoW is pretty easy these days ... any guild that can field 4 decent clerics can kill AoWar .. you just need a bit of dedication on the part of the people to lock down his spawn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah. Too bad I'm not involved with any guilds atm, so rounding up even 2 good clerics can be tricky. I'm gonna try Eindride Icestorm with 2 clerics and a CoD pet first, and then maybe shoot for XTC and/or AoW next. <br />
<br />
I looked up the last AoW fight I was in, and he appears to do a worst case round of flurry (6?) x 1100ish + a kick(&lt;500), so a fast CH rotation should be able to keep even an 8k tank up.<br />
<br />
He mitigates melee dps like a champ though, so it would take a fair bit of DPS to knock him down before the clerics run oom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah good points. I should have noted that 4 lifetaps while doing decent DPS would be particularly cool :) There should be more dropped proc augs, anyway. Maybe a droppable anger 4, with a dd, from ikkinz, or something. I do enjoy those procs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you want to build a lifetap-combo you could Dualwield 2xBloodpoint 10/21.<br />
They have a 80pt lifetap instead the 45pt lifetap on black acrylia weapons and are pretty cheap. Of course you can add lifetap augments here too ;-)</div></div><hr />
