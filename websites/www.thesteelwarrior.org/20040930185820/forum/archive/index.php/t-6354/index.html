We made some test runs in HoH with the earth pet tnaking and with me tnaking (self buffed im at 8k hp) and it performed almsot as well.  i knew mage pets needed an upgrade but they went overboard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so the result of this ... i have a lot of mage friends. i always invite them you see and so they like me.<br />
<br />
now they all get upgraded and can add even more damage to my groups :)<br />
<br />
i mean ... if i ever group with my warrior anymore that is. im a bit leery of taking that guy out since this new feature where every time i get hit it makes me do a 90 degree turn to say nothing of all the other screwups theyve added.</div></div><hr />

You might be suprised how many people/message boards say that about their chosen class.  It's never true, nor is it in this case.</div></div><hr />

Thats not true! It is contingent upon to many things you don't control. If Mage pets start taking the lower end Warriors job away, the shit will start hitting the fan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;but i can see all caster groups happening since a tank is no longer needed for them&quot;<br />
<br />
All caster groups have existed since before I ever began playing everquest.<br />
<br />
And will continue to exist, whether this change goes live or doesn't.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Mage pets start taking the lower end Warriors job away, the shit will start hitting the fan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pets can't tank when other PCs are in melee range. So even low end warriors are still going to have a TON of grouping opportunities.<br />
<br />
The only time this earth pet can tank is when there are only casters around. Which as explained above, is already a common feature of everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nah there arent very many places for an all caster group to xp in pop, in fact the only place i know of is the tables in PoF.  With the earth pet now having almsot as much unbuffed hp as a high end warrior (read 7300ish hp) all caster groups can now flourish in areas where melee where tanks were required.  For instance BoT and Tactics.  Im glad magicians got their pet changes but if it starts to take away groups from tanks that need them then the changes were overboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;For instance BoT and Tactics. &quot;<br />

The same Bastion of Thunder that casters used to solo the nameds?<br />
<br />
The same Bastion of Thunder where mages were still one of the few classes that could solo some of the nameds?<br />
<br />
I disagree. There are still quite a few places in Planes of Power for casters to gain XP without the use of melees.</div></div><hr />

Actually there are several, anything which doesn't summon ( so fire and water for exemple for elemental zone ).<br />
<br />
 all caster groups can now flourish in areas where melee where tanks were required. For instance BoT and Tactics. <br />
<br />
It was already the case prior to this change.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the earth pet now having almsot as much unbuffed hp as a high end warrior (read 7300ish hp)  <br />
<br />
It doesn't.<br />

<br />
In fact with this patch it's seems that mage pet get no hp upgrade. <br />
And even if the bert range+ would help to boost the hp of mage pet ( before the patch hp of earth pet + bert range about 6200hp, same after patch ), 7300 hp wouldn't be the hp of a high end war, but a twink war of a high end char or recruit / MIA war, so in other word, an useless war for this guild for a good while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I contend that MOST Warriors fit the description of &quot;useless&quot;, that 90% have less than 7300 hps buffed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In an &quot;ideal&quot; world, focus item for pet would increase the pet at different stades of the game.<br />
If a mage pet focused with the range from bert  tanks as well as a 7300 hp war, I don't see any problem, this kind of war would be useless for this guild ( at this moment, IE maybe and surely in the futur with better gear he won't, but then he would tank better than this pet ).<br />
Now if any fucking mage and their pet can tank like this there is definitly a problem.<br />
<br />
An another problem, a lot of people don't see the huge mudflation with PoP and stay like if it was velious era.<br />
Prior to pop, 7300HP war wouldn't be possible, now one group of time level people could enough farm to make this doable without any real problem for a twink.<br />
And GoD started already high on the mudflation, mage pet definitly needed an upgrade with focus pet, but as I said if any fucking mage can make pet like this, they have done too much, it should be only for focus superior or equal to the range from bert ( http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20508  ) .</div></div><hr />

These are AVERAGE Warriors, not even low end! I am almost always SA at Tunare general server flagging events unless a Divine Crusade tank is there. I guess all these people should quit (esp now that WoW and Lineage 2 are almost out) because some idiot can type /pet attack and presto kill a mob BETTER than their char can even after spending all that time leveling a warrior (not an easy class to level considering the FORCED grouping). My SA in my guild has 5500hps BUFFED, and the Paladin is 3rd with 5000hps. THESE are low end, SOE made this game way to easy for casters to get overpowered pets.<br />
But I agree these Warriors and everyone behind should quit, then SOE will have to combine servers, and 28 guilds can fight over Plane of Time/GoD.</div></div><hr />

Its just the mage can heal the pet and not you. It isnt overpowered in any way shape or form. This is no cause for alarm.<br />

<br />
You are kidding I hope ?<br />
These are really low end warrior profiles, <br />
they aren't better profile than high end war during velious era ( without AA / level 60 for the velious war ).<br />
SoE will never ( and happily ) balance the pet / focused pet agains't these things.<br />
<br />
I guess all these people should quit (esp now that WoW and Lineage 2 are almost out) <br />
<br />
If they don't have fun, or aren't much interrested to play more, they should quit doh ( like I did 2months ago as GoD didn't interrest me, no dragons again and instance donjon / zone sucks... but several friends keep asking me to come back playing so still checking what it's done if I replay again ).<br />
Lineage2 is a mmorpg PVP oriented so not everyone will like this  and I bet WoW will be the same than EQ after 1 years or 2, don't kind yourself ( &quot;mudflation&quot; problems ) beside there will be more &quot;security&quot; problems ( already happening in fact it seems ).<br />
<br />
because some idiot can type /pet attack and presto kill a mob BETTER than their char can even after spending all that time leveling a warrior (not an easy class to level considering the FORCED grouping). <br />
<br />
I am agree with you, these kind of gain of power for pet / focused pet should be only for time / post time mage, but there should be a small boost for those prior to this level ( GoD is current expension, and there were no pet power gain since PoP ).<br />
<br />
My SA in my guild has 5500hps BUFFED <br />
<br />
That wouldn't put him at 4000hp unbuffed....Ask him to put some gears....A RZ cultural geared warrior would have more hp than him unbuffed seriously....<br />
<br />
<br />
But I agree these Warriors and everyone behind should quit, then SOE will have to combine servers, and 28 guilds can fight over Plane of Time/GoD. <br />
<br />
If they are behind there is a reason, and they will be &quot;behind&quot; in any other mmorpg games.</div></div><hr />

I am doing CLOSED beta, LOL. I am in already! My friend is a game developer and got me in.

I highly doubt a casual gamer in EQ is adversely affected by the mage pet change. <br />
In fact I'd say the casual mage gamer has got a improvement in better pet survivability.  which had affected the core of the mage class.<br />
<br />
Now stop whining about how it undermines casual gamers. Casual gamers will not be grouping with Ubah Time Mage (which would be the only one able to effectively out tank a casual warrior) anytime soon.<br />
<br />
In part thats due to eliteism, the casual gamer cant go to fire and play there etc. and the other part, the time mage is prolly too busy raiding to be exping in valor. <br />
<br />
Now we have dispelled the casual gamer cry of help. THE 65 EARTH PET WILL NOT TANK BETTER THEN A CASUAL GAME WARRIOR. <br />
<br />
Also tell the guy in the 4400 hp gear to do EF LDoN. and hook up on the 750 point gear there. By the time he is done, he will be around 6.5k hp in around 6 weeks at 2 hours a day in LDoN. <br />

i can hit 7k hp buffed thanks to my AAs, and that isnt to shabby, but a GOD DAMNED PET SHOULD NEVER BE CLOSE TO THE SAME LEVEL PLAYER.<br />

it didnt spent 2-4 fucking years leveling, you did, and your pet is balanced by YOU.<br />

That's great.  Of course, the quote I responded to said &quot;SOE employees,&quot; not &quot;the ten developers that were in a chat session one time&quot;(or however many there were).  So unless you're trying to assert that every single SOE employee is a developer and was in that chat, it doesn't really have much bearing on what I said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The average warrior, IMO, is around 4300hp unbuffed at 65, give or take a few hundred up for AAs or lack of gear.  If you have less than that at 65, you really shouldn't have powered yourself to 65, or really need to get cracking on hp gear now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Silverblade-T-E</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Gerick,<br />
A time geared mage pet SHOULD be as good as a Tier1 warrior (with no defensive AAs), so tough luck there. Go check gear etc and htink about how a lvl 60 mage in North TOV gear was better than a lvl 60 warrior in crafted.<br />
My mage has 3200hp *unbuffed* our MTs hit 10k+ buffed (elemental alliance). So, for folk in higher gear they *should* be better than someone who is not, k? Basic point of gaming isn't it?<br />
<br />
Joe Bob in basic gear, casual player, vs Jim Bob in medium gear, raids a bit, vs Jay Bob in Time gear the hardcore player.<br />
The folk in the better gear will wipe the crap out of mobs the casual player finds tough, due to equipment, skill and AAs. Any disagreements there?<br />
<br />
K, so, mage pet is *part of the entire class's abilities*, GET IT? Mage pet to the mage = 50% of a warriros abilities/hps/DPs etc to the warrior. If it doesn't scale up, there's a BIG freaking problem with the game...fact is they DIDN'T and that angered so many mages they *QUIT* the game or changed classes. This happened before and they had to tweak pets way back n late Luclin because they hadn't been upgraded since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Go play a mage, you and Doomflayer, then come back and debate class balance *please*? And yah I played a warrior too, quit about lvl 40 'cause EQ made warriors boring as hell, soloing sucks in downward curve...but I didn't get so much crap LFG as I do as a mage. Soloing is nice when you want to, when you lack time etc, so EVERY class should be able to, that is a valid point.<br />
<br />
Oh yah, sure, casters have an easy time of it...<br />
:rolleyes: :rolleyes: :rolleyes: <br />
Basic fact of EQ: Mages and necros are two of the LEAST played classes in the ENTIRE game. If they are that easy, that powerful they'd be all over the place like drood halflings are. Since they are RARE, they can't be easy or powerful or they have problems. Ergo yer talking garbage if you say &quot;casters are easy, over powered&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />

I have a BIG problem with all the pets getting upgraded! Even Elemental should, BUT CASUAL PLAYER MAGES SHOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED IT.<br />
BTW no bottom feeding? Blitzberg (Talisman) Warrior with friend have been seen MANY times killing EVERYTHING in Kael, and probably destroying armor! He has 10,500hps UNBUFFED! Thats the scummy behavior COMMON on Tunare. I remember a conversation I had on getting Royal Velium armor, someone said it was easy to get from raiders when Velious first came out. It was a big LIE (yet again), the raiders on TUNARE (Kreiger scum) DESTROYED it rather than let others have it! They are hell bent to stop others from progressing ingame to cut competition. <br />
DC is the only guild on Tunare helping people flag, so they can recruit later I am sure, but it is helping many. All my flags are due to ONE guild looking out for the casual gamer, the rest are ASSHOLES, and will fold when people won't join (like defunct Kreiger and Cynosure who have horrid reps on Tunare).<br />
Not expecting the new found power Mages got from the BOUGHT pet to be misused is the same ole BULLSHIT we have been fed forever. The Devs DO SOLELY play Intellligence casters (minus our friend the Paladin, and you know that story), SO NO ONE REPRESENTS WARRIORS AT SOE!<br />
The funny thing is a few games have done polls of their players and the MOST popular was melee. So why SOE is hell bent to screw melee is just gonna be their problem when a several servers depopulate when WoW comes out. I hope to see 12-15 Time guilds on some servers just so you get to feel the squeeze of their stupidiy also.<br />
BTW I have a Necromancer also, when I want to power game thats what I play. Being overpowered doesn't make a class popular, being a class people want to play means they get played. Many don't care to play men wearing a dress or EVIL char classes.</div></div><hr />

So only Eddy izzard would play male casters?! *boggle* :p<br />
An overpowered class would result in all the &quot;lemmings&quot; flocking to play them, its happened often enough. Beastlords, druids, enchanters and necros are seen as &quot;overpowered&quot; usually, then folk find the last 2 ain't as easy as they thought.<br />
Necros are WAY powerful, but running one well is NOT easy, so not too common a class. i.e. the &quot;idjits&quot; rarely play caster classes, though I have met some who played mages as they thought they could be lazy and just &quot;pet, nuke, sit down&quot;...pfft :/<br />
<br />
Also it's not merely &quot;Time&quot; players versus everyone else.<br />
Look you go through tier 1, 2 and 3 and 4, and get upgrades, right? Especially in Tier 4 and some of Tier 3.<br />
Mages get NONE for their pets. You can get focuses for nukes of varying flavours, mana regen, etc etc, but your pet stays the BLOODY SAME. Gah!!<br />
I didn't play a mage to be a wanna be wizzy, point of playing a mage is the pet 1st and foremost. Same pet tier 1, tier 2, 3 and 4...Would you like to be stuck with the *SAME* weapon from tier1 to 4? <br />
<br />
Note please, the lvl 65 earth pet *isn't used* on raids (though this new thing about rampage sounds weird), so in tier 1 you can get all your pet spells. Melee are now finding out the joys of collecting &quot;spells&quot; (tomes), so some may now realize how much of a PIA it is as a caster to not only aquire gear, but *spells as well*.<br />
And Doom, don't dare say it's &quot;easy&quot; for casters to get spells.<br />
I'm old school, I've researched my damn pets and hunted juggs for spells when they were the king kong butt munchers in EQ..*ponders how many folk now would laugh at the idea you needed a raid to do juggs*. I worked for those spells.<br />
<br />
Warriros are not represnted by the Devs...omg, same cry some mages call...rubbish. The devs are slow as hell fixing/updating some things and that bites EVERYONE in the butt. If they only played mages etc, why do you think the mage class died off *AGAIN*? Like any large group they keep having problems, not enough staff, bosses shafting them, bosses doing dumb crap (yah great idea moving CS to India, way to go SOE, that makes everyone's life bad, devs included)<br />
<br />
Yah, hell bent on downing melee...*points ot the uber melee loots in GOD*  :rolleyes: <br />
Man you really need better folks to play with, and wake you out of this rut you seem to be in, Doom :/ Melee are on a roll, ESPECIALLY warriors, or you may not have noticed what's happened in GOD. Melee need tweaks, especially in the *make the classes fun and exciting, not merely excellent in the game mechanics role* are really needed for melee.<br />
<br />
last I checked  there was hm 12?? guilds/allainces in elementals on Karana. *sighs*<br />
<br />
Reason mages got stuffed with soloing AND melee was the way from PoP on mobs just went stupid for DPs to make them more challenging, but not boring slogs like Luclin. That was a bad call on the Devs part but they are limited because the game is 10 years old basically, thus they CAN'T add better mob AI etc, so they have to rely on pure melee damage form mobs to make them challenging (base xp mob types).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">silver why should you get the power of a 65 mage and a 65 warrior when you did NOT spend the time leveling the 2? i just think your spoiled, also we dont frenzy or what ever the fuck your pets do when they are low on health, its bullshit when i cant solo a giant in BoT but your pet can, i have come across this several times and im sick of it.<br />
<br />
You said it yourself, warriors are a pain in the ass to level, SO by that alone we should be entitled to a little more power than your fucking brainless minion, i would understand it if your pet was hard to get, but its not, you get 2 characters for the play time of one now, that isnt right OR fair to those that level up their melee's, there is no gear, AA or focus effect that can jump up our preformance in one teir as much as your AAs can improve your pet per teir<br />
<br />
course im sure i will see another post like your last 2 that seem as pointless as my own<br />
<br />
and you can take that finger you point to GoD and stick it up your rear, it is for the elite players YET again, if players are in casual they normally dont get to the top teirs and loot because they cant make it past luclin raids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yep and casual Mage players got nearly the same pet power increase as the others. Its BS, my guilds Mage pet can out-tank every tank except myself, and has ZERO flags! There was NO time spent getting the pet.<br />
Necros are not played because most HATE evil chars, they even hate evil races. Thats the reason, not that a Necromancer isn't overpowered, because they are!<br />
Remember, my friend is a dev, he has no particular attachment to ANY class in EQ. He looks at EQ in a different light than a Mage or Warrior. He sees how stupid it is, you play a Mage you are pro-Mage, you play a Warrior, you are pro-Warrior. Someone outside calls EQ class balance IDIOTIC, PISS POOR, it is!<br />
Soloing IS important, the fuck it isn't or we wouldn't have so many Dr00ds. So wake up.<br />
They want classes balanced it won't happen from a group of devs who don't play classes that NEED to be balanced more than they have been.<br />
I never said anything about increasing Warriors played by casual players, and they sure the hell shouldn't have given Mage pets the power either!<br />
They should have tiered up the power, but we all know how clueless and lazy the SOE devs are.<br />
I do need a new guild, 10 players are the ones doing EVERYTHING, but, all the upper ones are full! I am looking closely at Legends, a player from an Uber guild I know thinks the reservation system is dumb there. I think he and his croonies are greedy, because I see them killing mobs for loot that are also blocking others advancement (PoP flag mobs) but thats the name of the game in EQ. <br />
GoD is a steaming pile of shit, Richard Waters himself has blasted the lifeless fools who play EQ, rip through content and then bitch they need more. Get a clue, EQ should not be about a bunch of players spending 100+ hours a week playing, but it is. Get rid of the stupid time sinks and start putting flag non-loot mobs in and make it so PoT players can NOT kill them. Nothing is up more than 36 hours after a patch, thats fucking insane. <br />
PoP flag mobs should be INSTANCED, but the idiot Devs love pitting players against each other to stop progress.<br />
Remember, look at my gear, on open flagging raids I am ALWAYS #2 or #1 in hps. These are players who want to raid, some in raid guilds, who can't even muster 6000 unbuffed hps. <br />
Itemization and mudflation are out of control when 10000hp Warriors and 4000hps Warriors, both 65 are in the same game. They didn't need to put the crazy loot in. But the people who play to much EQ, demanded it. The money is coming from casaul players in large part. WoW is going to put a hurting on that. Yep, Karana has a lot of Time guilds. Now how the hell will those players gear up? When they have to combine servers (and they will) it will only get worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">yep, we have seen what they call itemization, its clear they do not care about splitting up the player base more than raiders/non raiders, it terms of relative power at least, its shit poor when a time mage has the same pet as a tier 1 mage, but its piss poor when both have more relative power than another class in the same teir<br />

its time to raise the level cap, or have a new system of abilitys and gaining xp so it can be split up with more creativity than making the mobs hit for 2k, or have to much hp to have a good xp per min rate, to clean up the bottem feeding we need more areas to divi up the bottem feeders into</div></div><hr />

We won't see anything in the bottom for anyone. WoW will have that, move games, let them combine servers, and then you will hear screaming!

The pet in no way tanks nearly close to me, it easily out-tanks EVERY other tank in my guild though! Thats real fair considering the Mage paid a whooping what 50pp for the spell? Yep, screw the players at the low end 9esp melee) thatas what EQ is about. Because some Plane of Time players and Elemental players have a pet problem, lets do what SOE ALWAYS does, UPGRADE EVERY pet so they out-tank players again! Remember, this is a GAME, people don't play 30+ hours a week for the most part (90%+ of the population of EQ), go ahead keep screwing melee by making casters farm better to push melee out of exp spot. WoW is gonna tital wave this game, and they WILL combine servers, than the upper players will howl after they let the rest get screwed.<br />

if you cant get into elementals chances are you are not doing any of the high end luclin raiding content eather(vex thal etc)<br />
Chances are if you are raiding high end luclin content (vex thal etc) it is because you arent in the elementals yet.<br />
<br />
As for what constitues an average warrior I think you guys have your head stuck up your arses aswell... those are average magelos of casual warriors, so you are taking the average of the low end, not the average of warriors across the board.<br />
<br />
I did an EQ rankings search for my server (used my server as I know what guilds are raiding at what level - roughly anyway)<br />
<br />
The Tribunal has about 140 profiles listed on EQ rankings, 117 of level 65 warriors.  So an average warrior would be #60 on the rankings? ... here's that warriors profile:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130226<br />
<br />
She is in an elemental guild, and other ele flagged warrior magelos feature as low as #90 on the rankings (though not all those inbetween are ele flagged.  Doing a quick run through the listing the 1st warrior that I know isnt ele flagged is #66 and I know atleast 11 of the warriors below #66 are in elemental guilds - so thats atleast 76 lvl65 warriors on the tribunal with elemental access (though I know its more than that as I know a couple of warriors in my guild arent listed there and Im sure the same goes for other guilds), also a 9th guild obtained ele access over the weekend and I didnt count them seeing as they arent exactly &quot;elementally equiped&quot; yet.<br />
<br />
So if the Tribunal has a minimum of 76 elemental flagged warriors and keep in mind that the Tribunal was the 30 somethingth server to have a guild kill RZtW for elemental access, you are telling me that there are 760 level 65 warriors on the Tribunal? Piss Off!<br />
<br />
It is more likely that the average warrior is in a casual raiding guild that is currently doing content such as Ssra named, AoW, working on Tier 3 PoP Flags, and possibly has VT access.<br />
<br />
Here are some magelos from some actual average warriors: - (taken from EQ Rankings for the Tribunal of Pre VT Warriors)<br />

What server are you on, That Rathes son, the 65 spell costs 50plat? More like 50k in plat.<br />
<br />
Your numbers are so off it isnt funny. <br />
And yes if you have 3k unbuff hp tanks then rathe son will out tank them. Thats what happens when you dont gear your guild.<br />
But I will guarentee you that the mage that is out tanking you has busted his ass off or paid rl $$ to buy Rathe's son.<br />
<br />
And in that situation yes it should tank better then a 3k unbuffed warrior. and thats the bottom line</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">well atleaste they didn't balance mages by giving them bigger nukes again. i think sucks if they got both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">eoden you do know that most warriors who make profiles do so for the soul reason as to prove they have a warrior with this or that gear, i really think you have YOUR head up YOUR ass if you think everyone and their dog has a profile.<br />
<br />
and dont misconstrude what i ment about VT and elementals, all i was saying is that if your casual the most you may do is a few turkey mobs from each expantion.<br />
<br />
and also forgive me for thinking that a PC tank has more right to fight for their group than some brainless minion, im sorry if i do not see why you should get 2 characters for the play time of one, can you really justify why you should get a second level 65(for all intents, mitigation and purposes) at ANY time or place when you yourself are 65?<br />
<br />
here is my problem, you wana nit pick and say well its only 7% more mitigation, well its only improved by tribute focuses that ANY caster can access by turning in a clockwork observers helm for 7500 points, its only this or that is all i am hearing from your &quot;data&quot; <br />
<br />
but lets take into acount that the pet has a spell depending on its elemental type, the pet has frenzy( i know how it is being abused, i know mages that LET their pets stay at half health just above enrage so that they may get a fast one off) i know you guys are saying your pets are shit, and for the most part they were when it came to a time mage having the same pet as someone who pisses about in teir one, but the answer is NOT to give an &quot;about right&quot; pet to a time mage AND a casual mage, and dont tell me it doesnt happen because part of the improvment was making focus items work better on pets from what i recall, so guess what? tribute buffs out the ass = better pet for all.<br />
<br />
sorry if i seem bitter, but i had 300 hp less, 50 ac less and no tanking AAs you pet could kick my ass, and tank better than me.<br />
<br />
sorry if i take offense to brainless minions being better than thinking people<br />
<br />
i tend to pick up the fight for the up and coming warriors, i missed this kick in the ass by little more then arms length</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">im going to leave the topic of raids aside since its indisputable mage pets cannot tank the highest encounters.<br />
<br />
id rather focus on experience groups.<br />
<br />
first of all i dont begrudge all caster groups or single caster soloers or any of that. those who resent such things should make a mage or druid or necro or whatever pleases them to solo and they will having nothing to envy anymore. but what about full groups? here is the split. the more pet classes you have (and less melee) the more dps you will have ... at least in the lower end game im still playing  having just reached 65 today (grat me! :) ). and yes you can do an ldon or a PoP group with no melee tank at all. but there is a price to pay.<br />
<br />
pets not what you might call &quot;very sticky&quot;. they are often difficult to peel off mobs. i see what enrage does to pets in spite of the best efforts of pet owners to pull them back. and they are practically impossible to pull off a mob that isnt rooted (mezzed or whatever) to engage another mob that desparately needs to be taunted. <br />
<br />
ok now i play a druid too and im partial to &quot;mobility groups&quot; .... read that as &quot;all caster&quot;. i enjoy them. i get a mighty big kick out of trying to navigate my way thru a dungeon with nothing but a charmed pet or something. but.<br />
<br />
but .... most people i know do not feel remotely comfortable with pets tanking anything but the most staged pulls. im talking about .. pull one .. kill it .. pull one .. kill it .. pull one ...<br />
<br />
yeah if i were a mage you are quite correct if you wonder if i would go for a 6 pet class dungeon raid or ldon at least once. but the large majority of people i know call my warrior and say to him &quot;we need you!&quot; because they dont want a pet playing MT. they want something that is quicker reacting than a pet.<br />
<br />
ps yes they do need to raise the level limit. talk about level crowding going pathological. on a /who all warrior 65 i am now indistinguishable from every single one of you (buahahahaha!). id love to see the level limit raised to 100 and made extrordinarily slow to raise ... like one fifth the rate of level 64-65. thus 1 level would be equivalent to 20 aa in difficulty. at least. add to that significant defense skillups with level and a greater dependence of damage on AC (and hence level) so that just as my 65 warrior can take down a hillgiant solo and finish at 100 percent health (sometimes) a level 80 would take down a kunark dragon in the same manner. naturally we would have a whole new series of higher level zones to challenge such ubernesses. it would be quite nice.<br />
<br />
and yes the mage would nuke for 40k so lets not us warriors get cocky either over this idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">and again someone  said that lineage2 dev was laughing about &quot;class balance&quot;...<br />

You have exactly the same &quot;class inbalance&quot; if you can call this in lineage2 and EQ apparently ( case at least for the first 10 level and I don't see how it will change really ).<br />
And 73warrior in elemental planes...eoden has totally reason.<br />
And 4000 - 4400hp warrior, would be a 65warrior in kunark / old content gear...wake up that's not your &quot;average warrior&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
4839 hp, 1712ac velious, no AA level 60<br />
5339 hp, 1712Ac, velious, ND3, PE1, level 60<br />

8558 hp, 2167ac PoP, ND3, PE1, level 65<br />
9000 hp, 2167ac PoP, ND3, PE1, PoPAA level 65<br />
<br />
That would be the &quot;top warrior&quot; kind of profile at different era ( PoP profiles has been changed a little ) without the charm or any augment http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=977205 ( can be argued for &quot;gear&quot; etc ).<br />
Now take in consideration the augment, GoD era AA + other, and you will see that 4600hp  is not the average warrior profile, it might be for the unguilded, no friends one, but how many of these kind of warriors there are ? 2 ?</div></div><hr />

90% are! I will say it again, our server has open flagging raids. Even Time guilds send people there that have missed flags that are applying for membership. I am ALWAYS #2 or #3 Tank out of 10-15 tanks there! I also tank for a &quot;United&quot; group of guilds, same thing. <br />
The magelo ranking are BRAGGING rights, THEY DO EVEN REMOTELY REPRESENT THE EQ POPULATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOE needs to pull the numbers, then start balancing off that. I am very glad for you Time/Elemental people that you have nothing better to do with your time than play EQ! But don't screw with the balance at the 90% end, throwing bogus numbers around, GO LOOK AT PEOPLE'S GEAR AND YOU WILL SEE IT, thats is if they can get away from RL for 5 minutes to play. Not your &quot;we have no life&quot; people in your Time/Ele guilds. The AVERAGE player. <br />
All Casters groups should NEVER happen, and I believe the Dr00d above he loves them, another of the MOST hated class in EQ talking about why they are the scum of the scum in EQ.<br />
The magelo ranking are bogus and your bullshit is showing through! The non-raiding Mage didn't deserve an upgraded pet, they got one because SOE devs are lazy. A NO DROP PET SPELL SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN ELEMENTAL/TIME, BUT SOE IS TO STUPID TO DO THAT. I knew this was going to happen, because SOE employees almost exclusively play casters.<br />
BTW, our &quot;open&quot; server raids aren't even truly open. I got an invite after tanking for some LDoNs with the leaders. I have WAY better gear than the &quot;average&quot; player. So STFU, take your caster biased anti-warrior BS and go back and congratulate each other on SCREWING the casual tank players yet again. So pets tank over them in your fucked up precious &quot;all caster groups&quot; when tanks can't solo but you can. Thats why they call em Dr00ds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So we should make it even more common?  For exp groups, meleers need casters, but casters dont need meleers.  That already kind of sucks.  Why make it worse?<br />
<br />
A time geared mage pet SHOULD be as good as a Tier1 warrior (with no defensive AAs), so tough luck there.<br />
<br />
None of these upgrades have a damn thing to do with Time geared this or that.  Any half assed mage who levels up gets them.  So your point is useless.  This has always been an issue though.  PC tanks are extremely gear dependent.  For instance, whats the first question a tank gets if they want to do an LdoN hard (or numerous other things)?  Whats your hit points?  And to tank it effectively, they have to have pretty good gear and should have their defensive AAs.  Meanwhile no one gives a shit what the 65 caster has.  I can tank LDoN hards now, but I couldnt do it very well at all when the expansion came out.  That was with well over 100 AA and L65.  Caster friends with inferior gear and no AA had no problem at all finding groups for this more challenging content.  Must be nice.<br />
<br />
Casual players if they play int casters dont deserve upgrades, yet casual warriors do?<br />
<br />
Casual mages were plenty powerful enough already, so no, they dont deserve upgrades.<br />
<br />
You can get focuses for nukes of varying flavours, mana regen, etc etc, but your pet stays the BLOODY SAME. Gah!!<br />
I didn't play a mage to be a wanna be wizzy, point of playing a mage is the pet 1st and foremost. Same pet tier 1, tier 2, 3 and 4...Would you like to be stuck with the *SAME* weapon from tier1 to 4?<br />
<br />
And its still the same for pets as they progress.  Now they just start more powerful.  You want a pet upgrade as you progress to/thru Time?  That seems somewhat reasonable.  But SOE gave it to all mages.  Your pet isnt the same anyway thanks to AA boosts.  One possible solution is to keep your pet the same and progressively nerf everyones pet who is below you in gear level. :p<br />
<br />
A mage pet outtanking L65 warriors in tier 3, if true, is utter BS in terms of balance.  It should never, ever happen, unless said warrior forgot to wear his armor today.  When that shit is happening, its just another sign of Welcome to Evercaster.  At least its not as stupidly overpowered as Charm.  <br />
<br />
The spells argument is stupid.  With a few exceptions, getting spells in the game is now trivial.  Having to get better and better gear constantly as you progress just so you can do your job is not.<br />
<br />
 and I believe the Dr00d above he loves them, another of the MOST hated class in EQ talking about why they are the scum of the scum in EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Okay<br />
Since this has turned into a idioits debate.<br />
<br />
There is NO connection between a Mage who has Rathes son and a 4400 hp warrior AT ALL.<br />
And I'll tell you why<br />
Rathe son 65 spell, Glyphed Rune Word, MQ (on Nameless) 30k Spell itself 50k<br />
Now, unless the mage raids and therefore isnt a casual gamer, Then he by all rights should have a advantage over a non raiding casual warrior.<br />
<br />
Point 2, If Its a casual mage vrs casual warrior, The casual mage had to DO something to earn 50k plat to buy a single spell. Where in 50k plat would more then likely take the 4400 warrior up to 5k hp unbuffed. <br />
<br />
Point 3 Tribute focus IS weaker then LDoN focus. There for if the casual mage wants to purchase something to upgrade him or his pet he should. <br />
<br />
The entire arguement is nothing but hysteria to cover up attention whores screaming to be noticed.<br />
<br />
You cant call someone who shells out 50k for a single spell a casual gamer, You cant call someone whom raids to get a spell a casual gamer. Because they are not in any way shape or form. <br />
<br />
That's why the entire point of your arguement has ZERO merit Doom, Because no one wants to even look at what the mage puts in. <br />
<br />
Now like I said, 2 hours a day over 6 weeks will bring any character in lDoN (if they get 760 points in EF to open up the armor) Mid grade gear. Its time invested &gt; casual to get anywhere.<br />
<br />
Just like it was time invested to get the plat to buy the spell that your bitching about.<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />

Doomflayer - you're lvl64 with gear mostly a couple of expansions old, almost nothing requiring a raid to aquire and only 36 AAs with over 6khps unbuffed.  I take it you consider yourself to be in the upper echelon of warriors then if the average 60+ warrior has 4.5k - 5k hps?  Going back to EQ rankings for Tunare server you are ranked #52 of 95 profiles listed.  Using this line of thinking you would be in the upper end of the 90% of warriors who arent no-life ubergamers? so there must be 800 odd 60+ warriors on your server?  <br />

The &quot;average&quot; Warrior hasn't even been in NToV, never mind VT!  In fact he couldn't tell you what the acronym means! HoT, whats that? They don't care.<br />
See, I went to PoP and what did I see, bats, and bugs, and all the stuff I seen when I was level 1-6! Guards kinda like DE guards I killed at level 16. Same percentage of hps lost per hit too!<br />
Oh boy, outdoor zones, YIIIPPPEEE! Great AI work (snicker)<br />
The game takes no skill and is a big waste of time.<br />
The &quot;average&quot; warrior not only hasn't posted on EQranking, he doesn't even know (or care) it exists! They don't know this board even exists, nor care about that either.<br />
They don't play EQ 40+ hours a week, one of the HUGEST waste of time like you.<br />
/played=300+=no life EQ loser<br />
None of my chars read over 50, and that is even to much.<br />
<br />
Rich Waters himself has bashed on you, pretty nice when the game devs rap on their players for playing to much.<br />
<br />
Now for sale (on playerauction) your very own level 65 Caster with all the spells, $535, your account, people will do it too. To some saving the time is worth the money. Guess who you get to group/guild with, LOL.<br />
<br />
One of our EP Tanks is BOUGHT and the guilds MT. MANY Time chars are BOUGHT. I know a few on the third owner. How much skill did that take?<br />

Geez there are some people totally stupid.<br />
Caster group has always existed, and 1AA per 30min soloing ? big deal, a group of the same &quot;kind of player&quot; will rank up 1AA / 20min or less if they are doing &quot;full exp&quot; boohoo.<br />

How much work did the non-EP/Time Mage do to EARN the pet? NONE, exactly what I expect from a class that thinks /pet attack is brain work.<br />
<br />
It takes no skill and no life to=what you laughingly call Uber in this game!<br />
<br />
You want REAL Gaming? Deguild from your Uber buddies helping carry you through the game. Devote some of your time to getting non-guilded/family guild chars flagged. Throw an open server flagging raid together, not one tank much over 6k unbuffed hps and pull down an EP mob, with only 2 clerics present. We do it all the time,  this game isn't that hard if that is happening is it?<br />
<br />
The devs are IDIOTS (yet again) and LAZY (yet again) for doing sweeping pet changes when only a few Mages needed upgrades, Instead of adding the spells (no drop pet upgrade) in EP/Time the dumb shits added them across the board, thats my point. And I told you so, I knew they would do it and posted that opinion here when the Mage whine first started.<br />

I bet part of the reason is that SoE feels mage needed upgrade and I feel the same. <br />
<br />
Anotehr bigger part of the reason why mage got pet upgrade is probably beacuse they saw you going against it. <br />

<br />
again, my point in this entire thread is 2 things.<br />
<br />
i dont care how much of your life you wasted, your PET should not be abled to invalidate another player the exact same level as yourself.<br />
<br />
two, the pet did need an upgrade at the high end, NOT the sweeping chage we saw on patch day.<br />
<br />
you do not start a person out on a shotgun(what shoulda been a time pet now) when they havent been trained with a pistol(what the old spells where, and what the low end should still have)<br />
<br />
you worry about fucktards playing poorly now, but with these up and coming mages that had a uber powerful pet to save their ass, you will have to deal with them.<br />
<br />
i can hear it now, my pet has it, or my pet can OT it, or HEAL MY PET!<br />
<br />
you will have people growing up with a large safty net in EQ, and when they get to a point where they no longer have room for error, and they and the mobs have outgrown that safty net, its going to be YOUR raid wipe that will pay the piper</div></div><hr />

If you think that earth pet with the base AC of your average lvl 60 rogue and 5k ish HP and hits 83ish max is out doing you please go get some gear.  You are also wrong on a casual mage getting the same power upgrade as a time mage also.  It's on the patch message (tanks do read patch messages I hope) the foci's now tier up with your lvl of play.  Yes they boosted the base stats for the pets but the baseline isn't that much better and in fact all the data collected so shows no increase in the HP of Rathe's Son.<br />

Now to me that doesn't look like joe sixpack magi is getting the some power as time magi or his neighbor GoD magi.  Best advice I can give you is don't worry about it and just go do like most of us in EQ go read about WoW and talk about it in PoKnowledge.<br />

Yea, and it did it to Wizards, I hear them bitching about it a lot on our server flagging chat, no group wants them now. So lets next power up Wizards, then Melee to catch up, then pets again....hahaha, MORONS.<br />
Instead of fixing crap, instead of giving bug free product, lets do this crap. Its to funny.<br />

<br />
Of course a naked mage is gonna have the manapool to heal a pet vs unslowed BoT mob. /boggle. Yes mages wear gear too...... Sure if we're using ornate armor as our baseline yours will cost more but yea we still need armor in order to achieve this seemingly miraculous feat. <br />
<br />
Not to mention those spells too, last i checked we need more than just the pet spell, we need some means of healing the pet, again NOT cheap. Oh and FT costs suck too!<br />
<br />
As for the pet focus effects themselves these are designed to scale with the pet's master. Much in the same way your average tank will scale as he gets better gear. Where 760 LDoN points will buy me a nice pet focus item, those same points will buy you something nice i'm sure. If/When i recieve time level pet focus, i'm sure that the warriors i work alongside will have far improved gear also.</div></div><hr />

Hold on, need to tell all the rogues and monks to piss of too, well my pet is so uber and can tank so great, they wont be able to mellee anyway so no use for them, according to you anyway, ill ask the guild what they think about this &quot;idea&quot; of yours, will say a warrior told me its right.<br />
<br />
This goes for any XP group in the game, ask any mage (yes im a mage) how many times he's been asked to join a group cause they want the pet to be tank.<br />
<br />
Our pets are our ONLY line of deffense, without our pet we are nothing, we have no snare, we have no root, if we get aggro on some high mob without a pet, we get mashed so quickly its not funny and theres fuck all we can do about it, and if you honestly believe our pets can tank like a tank.... well i have to wonder if you know anything about the game and your chosen class at all cause theres a lot more to a tank than just getting smacked on.<br />

Aww, thats nice, make fun of my Warrior's level. Damn you swayed away from my comments pretty fast. What, trying to ignore what I said?<br />
<br />
Jackass...<br />
<br />
Anyway. What about Wizards? Wizards still get groups. And they do better on raids than Mages do. We have no concussion, etc. <br />
<br />
We have Mod Rods, and focus. They have port, BEST nukes, pet swarm, evac, ports. They are a friggin damage machine.<br />
<br />
I will agree that wizards have issues, and the beating they took from SOE was unfair.<br />
<br />
But damn, this is mages. And from what I remember mage pets were pretty damn strong before PoP.<br />
<br />
And if you want to bitch about us soloing, then make a damn solo class. Warriors are basically group based, if you don't know that by now I hope you have fun in WoW because the Tunare server dosn't need a Warrior that hasn't learned this yet.<br />
<br />
Mages can now solo again, and we're happy. We still have issues, but so does every friggin class.<br />
<br />
So suck it up! You did before, do it again.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and Paladins should get upgrades so they can tank nearly as good as you...<br />
<br />
And yes, that was an insult... I know you guys hate knights. :P</div></div><hr />

GOOD that is how its ment to be, they gave ya a better pet in the hopes ya would get a few more groups and stop whining, they fail to see you all(those complaining, if your time equiped, everyone that your with will remember how bad assed ya are and invite you to come back, unless you TRULY suck and you need a good pet as a safty net to hide your lack of skill) dont want pets for group use, you want it for 2-3 person caster groups, or kiting groups</div></div><hr />

Our pets are our ONLY line of deffense <br />
<br />
you are truly a moron, there is taunt, anger, the effect on the bp, stuns, sk hate spells, NDT, life taps, all the mountainanus things added onto weapons and items so we may hold aggro over YOU, and your brainless minion, if you get splatted its your fault, or the tanks fault.<br />
<br />
it is NOT there to be a tank, it has enough HP to live encase you send your pet out to soon and the warrior hasnt gotten the mob back to camp, its HP is there so it can live thru your mistakes and your groups mistakes, its there to suplement your damage, i hate to have to tell you what it is there for when YOUR the mage, but FFS!<br />
<br />
if you wanted a solo class ya should been a necro, they even have FD incase they make a big mess up, thing is i dont want necro version one, two(mage), and three(Bls pre nerf) running around hogging my leveling spots that are ment for groups of six, not two or three greedy fuckers(who think nothing of having one of their mobs peel off onto my shaman friend because they canni'd under 40%, its our fault somehow)<br />
<br />
and sev your the king twit in my eyes, there is limited space in EQ, and i dont want you and the other mage you hang around with (i know they are nice pixilated tits, but that is a dude on the other computer you tard) kiting around mobs dangerously with little regard for others, and taking up hunting spots of others or ourselves, i dont think its right that you take a camp ment for 6 lower levels</div></div><hr />

As far as mage pets go, I don't give a crap.  I see nothing that will adversely effect Warriors or any other class.  Mages could already group without tanks and solo in BoT anyway.  This changes nothing.</div></div><hr />

The only impact I can think of for regular groups is that pets can now offtank an add decently.<br />
<br />
When Weebo said pets are our only line of defense, he meant while soloing. He was also wrong. Mages have the defensive spell gate in addition to our pets. Leaving the zone might be overpowered compared to mez, root, snare, fd etc that the other int caster classes can use while soloing. I really see your concern here...<br />

Oh and Gerick, maybe you would sound less bitter if you'd picked warrior version 2 or 3 (pally/sk) instead of version 1. Oh wait, that sounded like a really dumb argument.</div></div><hr />

btw, for your info, i dont solo, never have since level 49 or something, dont want to either and dont give a toss about snare/root whatever<br />
<br />
As for your bullshit rant about all those other forms of defence i have in my group.....  Ill remember that next time a mob spawns right on top of me and proced's to smear the floor with me in a second flat, no i dont have clerics barriers, i dont have a necro's FD, i dont have no freaking tank or SK's hate line, only my pet will save me here, you have your far superior HP and mitigation, and if you had half a clue you'd know not even a fucking super quick tank could get something that triples for 900 of me before im a floor mat<br />
<br />
Next time you morons are on, do a /lfg and have a look how many tanks are LFG and how many mages are LFG, i guarantee theres more mages<br />
<br />
and next time you need to leave your group, tell them your brining in a mage to replace you (we outtank you afterall lol), it'll cheer up anyones day with the sheer hilarity of such a suggestion, which is exactly what this entire topic is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4. I don't want godlike wizzy nukes. Maybe some improvements over druids... And only because a priest should not hit as hard as they do. And maybe a nuke improvement in the low 50s, at that point a cleric has a better nuke than we do *I think, if I remember right*<br />

<br />
did you mean something like a spell to decress your aggro, and not something like adding hate to all pet spells(thats the fastest way i could figure on helping pet aggro)<br />
<br />
if that is the case, i think that is a bit more fair, because you would have to activly maintain a low aggro amount BEFORE your biscuit got burned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Sevius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Problem is the Earth pet isn't exactly very good at holding the agro from what I understand.

<br />
As for agro management. Something like a spell to decrease agro would be nice. In raids the mage gets summoned ALOT, and it seems this is a very big problem for the class, infact one of the biggest.<br />
<br />
I'm not exactly sure how good the new pets are yet. I haven't played in quite a while. But from what I hear they're quite nice.<br />

We now see that number four isn't always true.  That, however, is not a matter of pets being overpowered in the brain department, but Doom and Gerick being woefully deficient.<br />
<br />
BTW - Any 65 warrior with anywhere near 6800hp(buffed) and 1200ac(buffed) had better look to their incompetence rather than some gross conspiracy - my sub-elemental 65 beastlord with only 42 aa's buffs to that, and only has a couple of pieces of raid gear from low-end luclin and BoT tower mobs.  According to the cleric and druid I group with, he tanks much better than my mage pet ever did.<br />

<br />
Your idealism is refreshing. However, you assume too much about me. I rarely solo unless I'm LFG, and if I do I pick a spot I know has a high probability of being empty. Check outside the regular paludal-&gt;BoT route and you'll find zones for all levels that are completely empty.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that mages haven't gotten something new here, we're just brought somewhat up to par with the other 3 int caster classes in terms of soloability. If your worry is bottom feeders, your timing for crying out is off by a few years. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Edyil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">There are some far out assumptions about mage pets here.  Mage pets cant tank most blue mobs that arnt slowed.  I have done lots and lots of Advs.  My usual group is a 3 person group with RL friends.  We are BST SHM Mage(me) all 65.  I can assure you that the pet of the casual mage cannot tank mobs that are not slowed.  Now, like the shaman can, my mage pet can tank slowed normal adv mobs just fine.<br />
<br />
As a mage, I have very little to offer the group other than DPS and rods.  So I make it a point to be very good at CC.  Most my AAs are geared that way.  When we get extras, I pull them off and have the pet tank them.  But they had better be slowed, thats for certain.  I contrast this with numberous Advs I have done with no slower.  The only one that can tank are the plate tank classes.  My pet cannot tank nor CC those Advs.  There is no way.  Likewise, I cannot CC slowed mobs in hard ADVs.  They are just too tough for my pets.  Yet the warriors do just fine.  No they are not uber.  They are doing advs for crying out loud.  You rarely see the high end players doing any LDON advs.<br />
<br />
Agro is another problem.  My pet will get agro.  But its a question of when and if its in time.  When the shaman/Bst slows fail during our 5 mob pulls in the 3 person group, things get quite difficult.  The pet simply will not get agro in time and I end up nuking the mobs to me so others can get the slows off.  The point here is:  A warrior can easily take care of this problem.  Its a struggle for me and is very high risk.<br />
<br />
In addition, the warrior can pull is mob away from other mobs.  The only way I can do that is by nuking the hell out of it.  The problem is, if I am CCing a mob and its close or pushed towards the group, whats the point?  The mob hits the players and not my pet.  Warriors have a huge advantage in moving mobs from the group or walls or pits or whatever.  I have some control over positioning, but its limited.  Not to mention how things go in close quarters where Mage CCing is pretty much useless.<br />
<br />
Ive never grouped with a warrior and thought to myself &quot;my pet could do a better job than him&quot;.  Thats insane.  Hell I wouldnt think that about most of the rangers I group with.  Like was mentioned before, the only difference is that I can heal or Layhands my pet.  If I could heal the warrior, I would.  But I cant.  The only thing I can do is try to CC when needed and increase the damage of the group.  I have no idea why anyone wouldnt want me to do that for us.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have noticed a slight decrease in the damage my pet has taken since I got my LDON focus.  That was last week.  Do the math.  When was LDON release?  I am casual and not guilded and have been 65 for quite some time.  I am by no means uber, but I take pride in trying to be good at what I do and contribute to the groups to the best of my abilities.<br />
<br />
I have been playing EQ off and on since I was in Beta4.  Since day one, we were toted as being the best solo class... by Verant (back then).  Not by the players.  The mages over the years have been asking for one of two things:  Either change our description or make us a class that can efficiently solo at all levels.  Well guess what, these pet changes are not going to do the trick.  They will help, but they wont address the problems of the mage.  If you really want to see where the mage falls in damage output, you might want to check around.  Things have changed some since the LDON release.  Assuming that what was once the case still holds true, would be a mistake.  The mages moved to the top of the food chain for only a brief period.  Go check for youself instead of assuming things.<br />
<br />
As for money, its in the eyes of the beholder.  50kp is a great deal of money to me.  I do not farm.  I dont do much of anything other than Advs.  If you CHOSE to farm money or group in zones where you think you can make plat, and then complain that your gear isnt good enough, then that was your choice.  You shouldnt complain about it.  Screw the money.  Do your advs and gear up.  There is nothing more rewarding than buying your stuff after some good advs all the while earning some much needed AAs at a decent (to me anyway) clip.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, just a friendly tip.  If some of you guys spent as much time doing Advs as you did complaining, you would have double your HP by now.  Hell, as a mage I have 4200hp buffed (no hp increasing AAs).  And like Ive said, Im not guilded, casual and have bought/earned all my gear (no raid/Ele gear).<br />
<br />
Anyway, realistically, the warrior is far better at what they do than the mage pet is.  Groups that I have been in where the warrior has gone LD in our Adv has slowed dramatically when my pet had to take over as tank.  There are too many uncertainties for the group at that point, agro management, positioning and ranger/rogue meleee damage decreases just to name a few.<br />
<br />
If you have the opinion that mages overall are too powerful, then I will respectfully disagree but acknowledge your concern.  If you are saying that the focused mage pet is better than most warriors, I have to you are way off base as to the job of a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Dalren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Shocking that Doomflayer is whining about changes that mages NEEDED.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Maige</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Ya know, having played a warrior as my main up until Luclin, and then switching to mage as my main, I'm finding it pretty pathetic that there are some warrior who actually think this is an issue.<br />
<br />
First off, the recent upgrade applies to only the best of mages.  We have 4 zones at most where we can get the types of pet upgrades put into play with this latest patch.  We can focus our pet via hours in NRo LDoN, which puts our pet at the baseline where it should be in the first place.  We can go to VT, and get an upgraded pet focus off a mob that spawns once a week, and has a drop rate of 1 focus per 10 spawns on average.  We can go to Plane of Time, phase 5, and get an even better pet focus off of Bertox, again with a rare drop rate.  We could do LDoN raids for an even better pet focus, but the RVR on those raids is even more pathetic than the warriors currently complaining here.  No guild able to do the Time raids will actually spend time doing them, not when GoD is out with better gear.  So that focus is out of reach for everyone who doesn't already have it, which is an incredibly small number.<br />
<br />
I'm sure warriors would unilaterally cry foul if all of a sudden all aggro weapons, and all AC and HP gear stopped dropping in every zone, and only became available from a single mob, from VT, and from Phase 5+ gods in Plane of Time.  Hell, as it is, warriors can get very high AC, HP, and even aggro weapons with high dps, even as casual players.  This is from levels 1 - 65.  The pet adjustments were for 61-65 mages ONLY.  So, any discussion of pets vs warriors must be limited to those players.  <br />
<br />
Level 65 trivialized a lot of old content.  AoW being done with 2 groups now.  Vindi being single grouped.  If this is the content you're worried about as mage pets taking over for warriors, I'd say you're living in a pipe dream.  That content is already trivialized for lvl 65 players, regardless of class, with bazaar bought gear, and a modicum of AA's.  The mages we're talking about tho, you won't find them in those zones, as someone earlier pointed out.  I'm in Plane of Time.  I xp in elemental zones.  I raid Time Gods, and the new GoD expansions.  Why in the world would I want to go take some warrior's place in a PoV group now?  My best pet focus still is the LDoN one.  As I said before, the other focii are rare as hell.  And every single one of them is NO DROP.  But even with the best of the best focus available, my pet still cannot take the place of a tank on a raid, and not in a normal xp group.  At the very best, I can off-tank an add, if the add is slowed, long enough to get a real tank on the mob, in elemental zones, and in GoD zones.  <br />
<br />
If the biggest whine you have is that pets have so many hp now, compared to below average warriors, again, that means squat.  Hell, I have more HP than the warriors you're touting as &quot;average&quot;, but there's no way I could go tank the mobs in a normal xp group in ep, GoD, and hard ldon zones.<br />
<br />
You really need to get your head out of your ass, or go back to playing single player games.  Life would be much less stressful for you I'm sure.<br />

When was the last time you were actually a warrior? The rogue version is Counter Attack btw. Also this is not a guarantee. We cannot toggle it off nor on and with air pet there is only about a 85-90% chance of it firing off. Translated, when you need it, it isn't there. Earth pet I barely use as I group (you know that thing where normallly you get a tank of the plate type) so I don't need to use him. No pet will ever replace a PC. TBH I only use my pet when I get desperate i.e. we cannot find a qualified tank (one that is in our level range of at least 63+). And even then we are leery.<br />
<br />
Lastly, my rogue gets 6787 (give or take) fully group buffed and raid buffed about 6.9k (give or take) and 1220-1250 AC. I can tank anything in an ldon that hits under 1k. I guess they should nerf me too huh? Once I get agro I stand there with attack off and backstab for 130/229 (crit) every 8 seconds. On occassion I will turn attack on for 3-5 seconds.<br />

Seriously no one wants to replace warriors. Yes sucks that melee can't really solo but didn't you know that when you made the class? The class descriptions are pretty indepth. Also, iirc we still do get an xp bonus (granted they did not apply it to AA points...) which casters do not. I hate not being able to solo but you know what? Between my monk, rogue and mage, I have done a lot of fun stuff and when it comes down to it, I don't care if I can't solo well if at all. I have more fun grouping. Sounds like you are whining to me... Class envy mayhaps? *No this is not posted to all warriors in general but at the likes of Doomflayer and his cohort. I still pick a warrior over a pet given a choice.*<br />

What I want to add is that I would prefer a warrior in front of me bashing a mob over my pet every day of the week.<br />
<br />
Thank you Warrior's <br />
<br />
Let me ask this, if the the group your in and your the only tank class and lets say by some misfortune the tank goes down what would you want in front of you? <br />
<br />
A pre upgraded mage pet that may last 3 seconds or the new and improved mage pet that may finish the mob off?<br />
<br />
Also they did scale the pet to the level we are raiding at via the pet foci. A time mage's pet with time foci will beat my pet every single time<br />
<br />
Also pet control when he is off tanking will be a problem as they have a habit of hitting other mobs if they get to close <br />
<br />
Also I haven't been on a raid yet or group where they want a earth pet mostly mage's use air, water or epic<br />
<br />
What mage's want the most is pet survivability and group/raid utility<br />
<br />
pet survivability - we wanted a pet that lasted longer than 3 seconds on tier 2 and up mobs<br />
<br />
utility - we want something that makes us more wanted for groups/raids</div></div><hr />

What I am saying is get yer ass to NRO and earn gear or shut up. Most of us have earned the gear by mains or alts but the point is it was earned. We did not sit here and complain about giving us free stuff because we want to be better.

They needed to be on equal footing with wizards and other dps classes.  Just like warriors suffered with aggro mages suffered from lack of desirability.  The problem is that soe went about the wrong way in creating that.  Yes there have always been casters groups, but now there will be MORE caster groups.  Yes mages have soloed in bot, but it was with a pet that could break at any second and wipe the floor with the mage.  Mages had some pretty good things going but they needed one thing to keep them on par with wizards.  They needed dps.  THe problem is that the dps upgrade recieved by the foci items is paltry.  Instead they increased the ability of a pet to tank wich does not translate to the desirability demanded by class balance.  If you cut out some melee positions where does that leave the melee.  Grats mages now get more groups but at the expensve of joe warrior, joe plaay/sk that can no longer compete for groups because casters will now want a mage pet (ldon focus from points earned) that can tank like your average bot warrior (and yes i've tested it).  <br />
<br />
As for aggro ability,  An earth pet can hold aggro almsot as well as a warrior and over time can hold better aggro.  The group set up was a cleric a warrior (me, read my magelo if you want stats) a mage and a wizard.   The mage pet tanking by itself managed to maintain aggro from 4 sos's within a 10 second span of each other just like i could.  i am much better equipped than anything you can buy from ldon (minus boots) and yet here is the pet that requires a bit more healing than i do and holds aggro almost as well.  They should remove the mage changes and instead give their pets dps upgrades that would get them better groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;all pets got an upgrade&quot;<br />
<br />
No, only 61+ pets, and mostly only for those that have FOCUS items.  LDoN focus item (760pts) is about the only one a casual mage can get.  Other items are VT, Time, GoD and LDoN Raids.<br />
<br />
&quot;pets that are 7300hp&quot;<br />
<br />
No, they are not.  Unless you have Virtue, Focus, etc. on them.<br />
A 65 earth pet has just over 5k hp, about what an average warrior has.  But far less AC, no disc, and I have to spend AA's just to get him to behave (pet discipline).  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
&quot;a spell you can get for 50pp&quot;<br />
<br />
No, more like 30-50k mentioned earlier.  And you must be level 65.  And this is just one spell out of many we have to buy in order to compete.  I have spent over 100k easily on PoP spells.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well I spent 70k on an Ornate bracer!&quot;<br />
<br />
So, I spent 100k on an Ornate bracer (FT-2).  Do you think magicians don't have armor slots too?<br />
<br />
&quot;I should get the wizards in on this. . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Go right ahead.  Did you notice the only changes were DEFENSE changes to pets?  We have no DPS increase from this and therefore won't be replacing wizards anymore than we were before.<br />
<br />
Pets are our primary weapons.  The problem as we saw it, pets never got better.  How would you like to be Time flagged Warrior using a Windblade?  Well, that's about what we had for our pets.<br />
<br />
Magicians have very little AC, HP, no melee skills, no root, snare, FD, Rune, SoW, Evac, or really any other defense mechanisms.  We have (1) pet and (2) a level 4 gate spell.  (Ok, I know you warriors would love gate. . .)  So in the matter of magicians having a need for upgrades, a DEFENSIVE upgrade to PETS was the best option.<br />
<br />
And trust me, they don't really take the place of warriors.  Frankly a 65 Beastlord with good AAs can tank just as well.</div></div><hr />

:rolleyes:  Yes you are right one is not like the other. 2 different playstyles. Way to mix and match though, shows you at least read even if you misunderstood. As was said one is hard, one is normal. My pet can tank pretty good on a normal with slowed mobs but on a hard no feckin way. 992 mobs plus the agro list of pets is screwy. If I give him a target and have him switch, sometimes he will not go to the new target if the old one hits him or he will try to double tank which is bad (getting hit from behind you take more damage, even as a pet).<br />

<br />
This is crazy talk.  Tank classes are no less desireable for any group than they were before this pet defensive upgrade.  All-pet groups were a viable choice pre-patch, altho those groups weren't able to xp in certain zones due to mobs hitting too hard.  Now they can do it in BoT.  Big whoop.  You get any group with even a single melee in it, and the mage pet cannot tank, period.<br />
<br />
As for aggro ability, An earth pet can hold aggro almsot as well as a warrior and over time can hold better aggro.<br />
Then I would suggest you don't know much about aggro, or about pet aggro.  This simply is not a true statement.  The only mage pet that would come close to generating high, long term aggro is the epic pet, which did not receive the defensive upgrades in the patch.<br />
<br />
They should remove the mage changes and instead give their pets dps upgrades that would get them better groups.<br />
Thanks for your concern about mage desireability.  Removing the new defensive abilities from our pets isn't something the magician class desires, or would benefit at all from.  Believe it or not, having a pet with beefed up defense is a good thing for magicians, and in no way steps on player Tank's toes.  Even the SOE developers have stated, emphatically, that they will never allow a pet to tank as well as a player tank class.  As far as the DPS is concerned, it is a nice thought.  I'm hoping the devs continue their adjustments, and examine pet+caster dps, and bring those in line with other dps classes also.<br />

<br />
And over catering to soloers is one area EQ has gone badly wrong.  Sure, you should be able to solo.  But it should be in an area and for rewards that are far lower than what you can achieve in a group.  If a typical group of people at your level and gear quality can just do an exp group in tier 3, then there's no way in hell you should be able to solo tier 3.  And maybe mages can't, except for the stupid ass overpowered charm (which is much worse on chanters) and those BoT platforms that let you instantly lose aggroed mobs.  But certainly other classes can.  Are any mages soloing elementals now?  I don't know.  I know bards still can.  Chanters most likely can.  I'm not sure who else.  And it's all utter BS.  <br />
<br />
No one, and I mean no one, should be able to solo the elemental planes.  I don't care if you're fully Time geared and pulling in some GoD stuff now.  It's BS to let people solo that stuff.  And hell, especially overpowered bards who can often solo things for better exp than most people can get in a group.  <br />
<br />
The capability to solo content that other people with your level and gear need a whole group for turns those people's accomplishments to sh*t and gives out undeserved rewards.  (/cheer We took out a_tough_named_mob_01.  Oh boy.  A freaking chanter with worse gear and AA than me just soloed the same mob thanks to charm... wheee....).  <br />
<br />
so... yeah.... I'm not interested in improving anyone's solo ability.  EQ is already far too generous with the soloing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, the other mages posted were sensible enough not to think they should have that good of a pet.  They went out of their way to try to tell tanks that no, their pet does not tank as good as a warrior, don't worry, etc.  I don't know where to start.  Can we pretend you didn't say this?  :p<br />
<br />
Explain please. Our pets should be able to tank in zones in which we exp.<br />
<br />
oh i see, if you do grind groups in tier 3, then your pet should be a good tank against tier 3 mobs?  Sure, that way you have even less need for an actual player tank and you can go hang out in your all caster groups.  Reality check.  That's badly overpowered.  If you are soloing or using an unbalanced group (like all int casters or all meleers or all clerics, etc. etc.), you should NOT be able to hunt in anyways near as hard of an area as you can with a balanced group.  As a result your potential rewards (exp/loot) over time should be far less.  <br />
<br />
example: your regular grind group does tier 2-3 exp mobs.  Fine.  Go solo in Droga.  You can exp there, but it will probably be considerably less exp per hour than you could get in a good tier 2-3 group.  That's how it should be.<br />
<br />

<br />
 Level 65 here, ~4700 unbuffed if I'm wearing my stat weapons. Every piece on my magelo but one has between 30 and 90 HP on it. And I KNOW I'm better geared than quite a few tanks out there, even 65's. People forget that just because every tank in their guild has multiple 100HP+ items and 305 STA that not everyone has them.<br />
<br />
 There IS a large disparity between hardcore raiding Warriors and non-hardcore ones. Unfortunately, the two rarely cross paths, and it leads to misconceptions on both sides. I can't see 3500 HP Warriors at 65, but 4500 is all too easy to see among casual Warriors.</div></div><hr />

Just to explain how the test was conducted (since its stupid for a mage to tell me i don't know a damn thing about aggro)<br />
<br />
2 tansk were used on the HoH suits of armor.  I was completely unbuffed with 7600 hp and the pet had its pet weapons haste mask etc.  The wizard is  a 5k mana wizard with id 4 focus item 200aa's no concussion memmed.  the pet tanked first then i tanked to see how many ch's were used to heal each of us.  only one tank was on the mob at any given time.  Next we tested aggro.  i tested first.  the wizard managed 4 sos's through out the fight with no other spells cast.  then the pet tanked by itself and also managed to prevent the wizard from recieving aggro.  the mage was also nuking but mage nuke aggro is inconsequential as sos is much more aggro.  Also, when the cleric was ching the pet, she was ching it for 7kish hp, so yes the pet has 7300ish hp.  <br />
<br />
note that both the pet and i were unbuffed.  no slow was used.  only 1 person/pet was on the mob in each test.  i recommend others get a mage/cleric/warrior/wizard  and test this themselves.<br />

PrePoP<br />
This is the one place I can solo and slow is absolutely not needed for 90% or better of the content. This is also where the xp is the worse making my time + RvR not worth it. This is farming content.<br />
<br />
Tier 1 PoP<br />
Mala pull (fuck the resist rate of the other mala line spells, mala is my tool to debuff)<br />
Sic pet<br />
Heal once to get him started, nuke and med. I do not need to chain pets on most of tier one mobs I would hunt for xp (keep in mind I have DPoC focus and this is prior to the pet patch). Heals needed, 3 max.<br />
<br />
Tier 2 PoP<br />
TBH I don't even bother. Why? Well my preferred pet was air pet to solo since I did not have earth and when I did the mitigation was shitty. Also the death march would be hindered by a root. PoStorms was the only place that it was feasible without slows and then you still took a chance of adds on pulls. With gate being needed since zone out was so far away you could not afford mistakes. RvR was not there for me. PoTorment has that annoying silence that is used making me useless and my pet inept. CoD the proc would fug my pet up (you know the poison resist thing. Also hard to single as a mage solo, same as Torment). PoV, the razorfiends are okay to fight unless they proc that glass shards and that is where it got hairy. Unless you can cripple them you either resorted to chaining (which I don't like to do though I can do it) or chain heals making your mana bar go from 100-50 fast. More than 5 but less than 25. It varies on mob resists to nukes and how often that stun stops em.<br />
<br />
Tier 3<br />
Slow please. I can only charm in BoT, land of the plane, train and constantly camped. Birds hunting is too much of a hassle to rely on for steady, efficient xp.<br />
<br />
Sol Ro<br />
Don't even try it. 660+ hitters = no chance to effectively do this without slow<br />
<br />
PoHate<br />
I can pet tank efficiently in tier 1/2 only because my wife duos her necro. If we go to tier 2/3+ we are in way over our heads as mobs hit for 520+ and most are not necro slowable making RvR not worthwhile unless you are hunting quest goods. Heals needed, 8 minimum if it is unslowable, 3 or less if it is (pet hold + DPoC)<br />
<br />
Seb<br />
Don't hunt there but from what I did see the one time I tried it, it was not worth the time/effort for poor xp.<br />
<br />
PrePop to include hate and up till Tier 1 I can solo efficiently in volume of pulls. Volume of pulls however does not = amount of xp. I can get the same amount of AA xp on average of all the above prior to Tier 2 in a regular LDoN. In HoH+ it is about 2% per and that is without the extended hassle of down time in most cases. The ZEM of the zone you are in determines the xp (I avg about 1% per 2 kills) as we all know. Take into factoring how long/hard a fight is that can be very poor xp even if it is xp. I don't say I can't solo lower than Tier 2 but it isnt worth it to me. Tier 2+ it becomes not worthwhile to try due to the hp + melee of most mobs.<br />
<br />
Now about my portion you quoted, what I am asking is how does my statement tie in with your comment? Yes we are not alike in our play styles but that is what it is about to me. If I could only play one way I would have quit long ago. Now to address the all caster groups. I have oft times taken non casters when forming all caster groups provided that I have a snarer and I see they have been lfg for a long time. That includes warriors and other tank classes. The only thing they have to understand is we likely have no heals, no rez and if you get agro you are screwed. Casters (mostly pet classes) band together when enough are lfg because we get tired of feeling the need to be desired.<br />
<br />
If you want to beef about folks soloing or pets tanking better than a warrior, look to beastlords because they can slow and tank in BoT/Tactics. Hell probably now in Sol Ro. Druids and wizards can quad in HoH. Necros can solo in all the above via agro kiting. Bards can kite as well. So can rangers and some SKs can straight tank. Hell some monks can solo the tier 1 crap we usually resort to. So why pick on mages? This is where it comes to be a slight class envy problem imo amongst those that are complaining. In order to solo for a mage in half of the zones that the aforementioned are able to we have to be fast, well geared in focus items (heal/pet/nuke) and on our A game. The only real form of root we have is from our pet by yoyoing and that is still hairy. Factor in we can barely solo pull you start to see a picture. For us to maintain even the slightest picture of being able to solo, we rely on the pet. If our pet cannot handle the tanking and we resort to yoyo kiting to me that is just not worth it.<br />
<br />
Now before anyone gets pissy I am not saying nerf the classes I mentioned. I am saying though, look at all the classes that can solo and see who has the hardest time of them all. Btw I forgot enchanters. Charm/haste me a mob that cons dark blue, slow his friend, and I am not even having to break a sweat. Snare kiting classes don't have to worry much as long as they can land a snare before dying. Seriously comparing our pets being able to stand up for their masters to warriors is pointless. Our pets only have replaced a warrior in one place I can think of and that is Sanctus Seru because they banish (the Sigil earring mobs). And even then the beast pet is the better tank. Oh btw I never said warriors were clueless. Bah I lost my train of thought due to work but I will end this for now...<br />

Sure it did, you just missed it. But that's.....OK. ;) <br />
<br />
 Explain to us clueless Warriors how it is you solo. You don't have a slow, so your pet is tanking unslowed mobs. (Which is also why I found Edyil's original comments and his subsequent attempt to weasel out of an untenable statement hilarious) Do you heal the pet? Do you chain pets? If you heal, how many heals does it take? If you chain, how many pets does it take to kill a dkblue to 65 in Seb? In LDoN? In Tier 1 PoP? Tier 2 PoP? Higher?

<br />
I said:<br />
My pet can tank slowed blue normal LDON mobs<br />
My pet cannot tank unslowed normal LDON mobs<br />
My pet cannot tank slowed hard LDON mobs<br />
<br />
Why is that hard for you to understand?  Other than the obvious reason...<br />
<br />
I think that you have an unrealistic assessment of how many 65 mages actually can, do or want to solo.  Our solo ability is probably somewhere behind the ranger who is behind the shaman, bard, druid, beast, enchanter and necro.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that I could take out some easy PoP blues or LtBlues without slow.  But the reward and downtime would hardly be worth it.  Im not sure what that has to do with this discussion about tanks in groups, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">To the mages that are posting here and reading this thread.  I hope you realize that the stupidity and ignorance found in this thread is in no way indicative of the warrior community in general.  <br />
<br />
Some mages actually appreciate the wealth of good information on other threads of these forums. I am one of them.<br />
<br />
To answer the valid question of &quot;how do mages solo for XP,&quot; it is as it has always been -- light blues and &quot;barely blues.&quot; The XP rates even after the changes are significantly less that what one sees in a group of most any size -- typically a half to a quarter of grouping experience with the &quot;best&quot; soloing targets. With Time-level gear, I still use Luclin and Tier 1 PoP when I can't find a warrior-based group to hit GoD and am sick of tradeskilling and am willing to settle for a few percent of an AA while waiting for a decent group.<br />
<br />
There has been a lot of &quot;flexing of muscles&quot; to see just what the changes mean, so you will see many posts about mages soloing mobs in PoP. Just because you can solo a mob doesn't mean that it is worthwhile to do so. Burning a full mana bar on a 5% AA mob just doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
GoD is still unquestionably the warriors domain, especially once in Kod`Taz. (Below that I would consider a knight, but only if a warrior were not available, and certainly not if I intended to do anything but farm augs/tomes/spells.) Even with the changes, mage pets are decimated by any mobs tougher than those in Barindu.<br />
<br />
I assume that the concept that HP does not equate to tanking ability is well accepted in the warrior community. The changes in combined mitigation/avoidance have the Time-focused pets that mages use in grouping situations taking damage at a rate somewhat faster than the mage's ranger or rogue peers. (The earth pet roots, so it is generally not used in grouping situations; the air pet is the next &quot;strongest&quot; pet and takes damage at a noticably higher rate.) No PC can step into melee range without taking aggro over the pet.<br />
<br />
I hope a little information in return has been a positive contribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>XugXug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">This whole thread is just one person's attempt to flame mages (or whoever happens to be currently balanced).<br />
<br />
Your only knowledge of game balance comes from your &quot;friend&quot; who is an alleged dev on lineage 2, he is no doubt biased.<br />
<br />
You say that the mage pet is the second best tank in your guild, then I would say you are a guild of very under-equiped people.<br />
<br />
Warriors have a lot of abilities to make them useful as tanks that mage pets do not, they are disciplines and a brain.<br />
<br />
A warrior who only judges themself on HP is not a good warrior.  Warriors know how to rotate MOBs, how to pull agro from pullers, position the MOB and hold agro.  A mage pet cannot do this.  As a matter of fact the pets are quite dumb and push forward making positioning very difficult (and can push a MOB out of reach of the people).<br />
<br />
You should just stop whining and perpetuating class envy and improve you playing skill.<br />
<br />
I am glad mages got an upgrade, because if we can't find a way to control the crowd, having an emergency offtank can be a group saver.</div></div><hr />

I find this hard to believe. First in order to get that determination pet would have to hit enrage. The enrage timer is only reset one way unless you wait a long time for auto reset. Second she would have had to start the CH late to get that accurate a reading of 7k which would mean he was at 300hp (one swipe). Third was it a crit heal? As we know crit heals do not mean you have that many hp. If I 15k heal someone that does not mean they have that many hps. And last to follow up was it once or more she ch'd for 7kish? If it was twice I have to say truely inaccurate unless you did the one thing that resets enrage timer or you changed pets. Even then our library has the correct info if you care to have a look (click here).

 As far as my point, Sirulus, Edyil was complaining his pet could not tank unslowed ~400 hitting mobs (LDoN blues). Since Mages can and do solo unslowed mobs in Tier 2 (where mobs hit for 6-900), I find this not the easiest statement to take with a straight face.<br />

<br />
Ah now I understand your quote + questions after. Basically it is not worth it after a certain point to solo anymore is the general gist and some folks want it back (personally grouping is more fun although you do not have to roll against your pet for drops lol). Now back to the group thing, I really wish Doomflayer would understand; no pet will ever replace a well played PC tank. XugXug hit it on the head for each and every reason why and Itchy has pointed out very crucial points as well. As Itchy said about his soloing in Luclin for 'filler xp' while lfg, our pet is a 'filler' but when that tank comes along, the pet is just extra dps. The pet is good enough to get you meager xp but the PC tank is superior as you can increase your xp gain. Eventually I want to dust off and get to GoD but I have more gear I need heh.<br />

Dont confuse my pet or my gear with that of other mages.  There is no way that I can currently solo in tier2 with any sort of meaning or coordination.  Hense my use of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;my pet&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">I did some &quot;Oh ^%#@!&quot; testing the day of the patch to see just what mobs a Time-focused and self-buffed pet could provide some defense against. Mages don't have any option other than pet or Gate -- no runes, no root/snare, no mez, etc. -- and trying to channel Gate with a mob whacking on you for a few thousand a round is tough.<br />
<br />
These were not &quot;what can I solo for XP&quot; tests, but &quot;what can I survive if jumped&quot; tests. I usually ended up well down on mana and around half health past Qinimi. I was chaining DDs and heals as fast as I could. Mage HP regen is 10/13 per tick plus 8 from self-buffs, so there is a lot of &quot;licking the wounds&quot; time before you could continue on your journey.<br />
<br />
Qinimi -- 325 hitters, comfortable wins<br />
Riwii -- 500 hitters, close, but still wins<br />
Barindu -- 500 hitters, consistent losses<br />
Vxed/Tipt -- &quot;Yard trash,&quot; pet evaporates without even enraging<br />
<br />
I am guessing that Qinimi/Riwii mobs, should a Time-geared solo warrior have a &quot;see-invis moment,&quot; could easily be trained to the nearest zoneline without having the warrior die.<br />
<br />
Add a second mob to any of these situations and you have a dead mage, even in Qinimi, as the mage won't be able to cast much of anything.</div></div><hr />

this might put it into prespective for some, pre upgrade, a mage with VT gear + some pop gear (not elemental flagged however) could barely solo entrance mobs in plane of innovation<br />
<br />
Bullshit.  Among our usual group of friends who hang together is a 65 mage, HoT-lvl gear, with PoP jewellery, FT2, and a couple of pieces of ornate. Far below VT-level gear, in fact.  He can handily solo the PoI entrance mobs, quite easily in fact.  And that is truly soloing, as in un-slowed mobs, no healer for his pet, etc.  However, experience is/was pretty slow there, so his usual preferred spot is/was The Deep, apparently the exp bonus is nice there, and a number of nice spots where you can single-pull a handy supply of dk blues.   That's pre-upgrade, btw.  I'm not saying that the upgrade to mage pets was not needed; I'm simply saying your above statement is inaccurate and misleading.</div></div><hr />

mulk i said RELATIVE power, i didnt spout anything untrue, RELATIVE power means &quot;about&quot;<br />
<br />
i dont care if your pet has such and such ac, DPS, and hp less than i, i dont care because there are tricks to make up for that, bottem line of relative power is this.<br />
<br />
This is true you are correct.<br />
<br />
if you and your pet can take it down, and so can i, we have the same relative power agesnt that mob, if you can kill it and i cant, i have less relative power, so before you asume something, read the post twice<br />
<br />
And that is why we all know EQ is out of balance and why SoE has to be having nightmare about games like WoW.  Only thing I can say in my defense is four years ago when I read about the EQ classes it said a mage was a decent soloer vs a warrior being what was needed for a group to take down mobs.<br />
<br />
and mulk you left out tribute foci  <br />
<br />
What tribute pet focus?  I mean really I'm not perfect by any strecth of the imagination and I'm only in a freshly flagged EP guild but I swear I do not know of such a tribute that boost the pets power.  I will look into this though.<br />

Gerick I just looked at your magelo. I was... anyway, to get the focus which gives pets improvements you need to raid or do LDoN. Granted our focus does not cost as much as an outfit of armor from NRO but we don't get that huge a boost in performance from the LDoN piece either. What I am saying is get yer ass to NRO and earn gear or shut up. Most of us have earned the gear by mains or alts but the point is it was earned. We did not sit here and complain about giving us free stuff because we want to be better. My rogue atm has a few pieces of ornate that will be swapped for LDoN gear soon as I get about 20k points to fully kit it out /laugh. But seriously, if you don't like where you are in the game either get out or get ahead.<br />

at the bottom of the magelo says the last time it was updated, i have had alot of gear change since then, i stopped using my magelo because i relised it is all a big E penis, and since that time i have forgotten my password since i no longer need it, i have alot more hp, ac and AAs since that was made.<br />
<br />
im fully aware what i may go for, currently im trying for an ornate BP thru constant pick up raids, and as i can, i get Ldon points, im fully aware of my options because i have had plenty of time to consider them.<br />
<br />
i play my warrior very well, i never pissed about with alts, im all warrior(you can switch &quot;warrior&quot; with brutish asshole if it makes you smile) and i see things thru a drunkin warriors vision, and since this is the warrior board, i may do so.<br />
<br />
oh mulk, i guess i wasnt all that clear, im refering to the tribute effects that make summoning your pet and healing your pet a heck of alot less mana intensive, just about every effect you can get on your armor you can get thru tribute buffs now(it also makes casting them faster(i think that effect is in there) so you have a bit of room to breathe now)<br />
<br />

Again showing your complete cluelessness:<br />
<br />
1 - a pet will not enrage several times in a row, once he enrages it's gone until you finish that fight and have the opportunity to suspend/unsuspend him.<br />
2 - he can be forced past enrage (and it happens more often than not when he engages heavy hitters) by something that can hit for more than 10% of his HP.<br />
3 - miss your timing?  Your dead.  A mage gets splattered by the things he hunts if they get past his pet.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
(1)  Nope, only once actually.  It's called enrage and the only way to reset it is to make a new pet or suspend the current one, and you obvioulsy can't do that during a fight. <br />
<br />
(2) Of course, because I can't command it to do it, it only happens when a pet is about to die!  Yes, it occurs after a pet goes below 10%, how often do you think I want that to happen??<br />
<br />
(3) Even if it had endurance, it wouldn't matter for an ability that only occurs maybe once every hour.   If my pet hits enrage, it means he is about to die, and I'm about to hit GATE spell ! <br />
<br />
The only time this gets used on a regular basis would be during &quot;chain-casting&quot; pets where you let them die on purpose and just keep making new ones.  But that means you are using unbuffed, unhasted, no toys equipped, no special effects pets. <br />
<br />
And these tributes you speak of, well Warriors are just as equally benefited by tributes as magicians.  Hmm, look, +AC, +HP, +ATK, +HP regen, etc. etc. etc. <br />
<br />
There is no pet tribute to make pets better.  Only to make casting the spell that creates the pet (a) faster casting and (b) less mana use.   I don't bother with either of those tributes personally.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and back on the 7300hp pet.  I'm going to test this out personally later.  But I guarentee that pet HAD VIRTUE BUFF.</div></div><hr />

even tho its 10% hp, the pet reposites melee damage, effectivly making it imortile to melee for a short time, and since you plan on it dying it doesnt really matter, thing is only someone with alot of experance and a good connection can time this, but it is still possible and still a balance issue, just like warriors with earth shakers (earth shaker doesnt drop anymore, problem sovled)<br />

That truth is no one is going to call a mage for his pet to tank unless it is on specialized mobs (see the mobs in Seru for Sigil earrings) or an all pet group (which comes into play when we can't find the healer and/or slower to keep a tank alive). It is easier to chain pets at a mob all day (a point that I did not argue against) on mobs than to wait for hours to put a group together at the risk of losing group members. Kiting groups I have seen tanks and other melee a part of having formed some myself. As long as you do not grab agro you won't end up dead or kiting it. Also I am aware of the limitations on discs as I do have a 65/58 rogue myself. One that I leveled up through a love for my class. I then took it upon myself to raise his hp/dps by using my mage for gearing and searching the internet for quests I can complete. Gerick not once did I mention mages problems except in pointing out where the ones we do have would be apparent if you tried to use a pet as main tank or soloing. Not once did I say I prefer a pet to a warrior while grouping.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: The learned warriors that have posted in this thread and actually took away some knowledge are probably the warriors, casual or not that have pushed and continue to push for better gear to better their enjoyment of the game. They do not feel threatened. If you really want to feel more confident that a warrior will not lose a group spot to a pet then follow the path of the rest and go with the nature of the game called EVERQUEST. That is everquesting for levels, gear, and aa xp. Do a poll in /ooc or whatever other channel in which you can get their attention and ask, who would they rather have tanking for them in an xp group. A mage pet or a warrior. Barring the dumbasses I bet it will be warrior.<br />
<br />
On a side note, in order to get the tribute you need points. To get any long lasting tribute effects you will need more than 20k points. My rogue only has VENG X turned on and it quickly used most of the 55k+ points he has in tribute. That is just one effect. Try using a healing/spell haste tribute. Btw, healing tribute and spell haste tributes do not stack. They are introduced as worn gear but without the actual benefit of having an item with the effect. This isn't like an invisible bard song. I point this out because a lot of mages have spell haste 4 items or healing modifying gear (I have the spell haste but not the heal modifying gear).<br />
<br />
Doomflayer stated his true motive; he wants instant gratification. To him I say work. We all worked to 65, we worked to get our A game. Some of your fellow warriors worked for their gear and continue to work. Our pet upgrade was not instant, it took a long damned time. <br />
<br />
Have pride in your class folks (doomsdayers). If you have just an ounce of real pride you would form those friends and quest the gear (for those that are not hardcore raiders) or make that mage alt to farm it for you. I hate LDoN with a passion and if you look at my rogue's magelo as I said before, he has some decent amounts of ornate and better. However, I will still be building points on him when I can stand it to make him better.<br />
<br />
As for your disc timers not resetting upon death, neither does our swarm pets, servant of ro, or any of our toy AAs. Gerick you seem to at least think out of the box and if you read back this started out trying to say mage pets will take your tanking spots and that is simply untrue. Also, there are only 2 abilities I know of that can reset on death. Harmtouch (regular) and LoH (mage's pet only LoH does not reset if our pets or ourselves die). And I say again, the only class you should look with the merest shot of replacing you if you have pet class hate is the beastlord. I know some that can tank in places warriors and other plate classes can. Hell I know clerics that can tank but I would not replace plate melee with any of those unless there were none lfg. Bleh train of thought fading. Was trying to log in just now and finally read that the servers are down. WTF is up with that?<br />

And snare/root in of itself isn't being exploited? It is meant to slow mobs down but with it one can kite and quad kite. This leads to soloing (something you are not happy mages can do) and we know that Sony prefers grouping. Once again before all hell breaks loose I am not saying nerf soloing, snaring, or any class that can do the two. I am saying that it can be view as an exploit just like chaining pets or resetting an enrage timer can too.<br />

<br />
Yes, they went overboard, kindof.<br />
<br />
When you consider all of the facts of the game, they didn't really.  A warrior/pally/sk will always be needed to tank in PoEarth and PoWater, and in LDoN hards.  However, in low DPS encounters, such as normal LDON and pre-PoP my pet can now tank as well as/better than a warrior.  <br />
<br />
THE PET STILL TAKES MORE DAMAGE.  There is a study on the Mage Compendium and IIRC the pet WITH the mitigation AAs tanks as a warrior with around 1400 AC, which is gunna get torn a new asshole in any encounter where the mobs hit for over 600. <br />
<br />
Yes, my pet can now tank for me while I solo in plane of valor.<br />
<br />
Yes, my pet can now tank for me while I 2-box in bastion of thunder.<br />
<br />
Do I consider these two facts unbalancing? Yes and no.  Yes in the fact that it can be done, no in the fact that it takes a while to get there.<br />
<br />
Don't worry warriors, you can never be replaced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Missty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">Ok Doom I waas really trying hard not to comment to you on anything but what they hey.<br />
<br />
First, no offence but your guild warriors suck.  My friends little twink 45 War has 5k+ hp unbuffed.  Thats with no LDoN crap yet.<br />
<br />
Second If you think mage pets are so godly now why dont you get out there and group with them or are you afraid of getting a mouth full of your shoe?  Keep in my most mages do NOT have ta time or VT focus.  It looks like it because many mages are made to be COH BITCHES.  They never get played other THAN that.  My guild till recently had 5 mages. Only 2 were played for more than 30 minutes worth of CoHing.<br />
<br />
The pet is 80% of a mage easy.  Take away the pet and you dont have crap.  We cant root, we cant rune, we cant fd, all we can do is pray we can kick off gate before we are killed in a quad.<br />
<br />
As for the crit AA and what not, that has to be EARNED.  We cant just log on and decide 'wow I think I'll give myself some pet crit dmg!'  Sorry to burst that bubble for you.<br />
<br />
As for focused pets I am elemental flagged, spent much time in VT (and still never got my focus gloves) so I live off my Boon.  Let me tell you something.  Yes I can solo PoI and HoH somewhat.  This is without ANY GoD AA.  I cannot handle more than one mob in even PoI without having to use pet LoH and my turldings to save my ass.  Our heal is BS.  We can heal the pet 1200 hp every, off top my head about 8 seconds?  Not a good average since the mob can damage my pet almost as fast.  Do I nuke?  Usually only once because I am so dam busy keeping pet alive its sick.  I could chain but then so much for pet gear, and I would rather have a armed pet than a dead one.<br />
<br />
I can NOT solo BoT.  My charm breaks within 30 seconds of casting.  Out of about 6 hours attempted soloing in BoT I have succesfully killed ONE mob.  Not much to make up for the deaths.<br />
<br />
Those focus are earned.  That takes a LOT of time to get.  As for time focus who gives a damn?!  If a mage gets a time focus then those same wars tehre with him are a hell of a lot better off than that pet.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned about mage nukes and I agree.  Keep the damn nukes away from me.  I am about my pet not nuking.  I am not a GD wizard.<br />
<br />
If you feel that threatened by a pet that after much time becomes halfway useful for something, I pity you. A lot.  Thats just sad.<br />

That same warrior who's magelo you posted, at level 65, with a few upgrades *valorium rings, earring of engagement, lupine frenzy earring, and a 2nd FH bracer*, will only have 4650 HP.  By your own admission, this toon is &quot;twinked&quot;.  Lots of warriors, hell lots of any class, don't have that luxury.  So this super &quot;twink&quot; warrior, is actually the same, ordinary, run of the mill 65 warrior that you are slagging, who hasn't yet gotten his AA's or LDoN gear.  The gear he has is definitely acceptable for his level, it's not gimp at all.  Just not everyone will take the time out of the push to level up, or has even necessarily had the chance yet, to get those AA's and gear.<br />
<br />
-edit- Gerick had a good point.  A lot of warriors aren't RZ or Tribunal worshipping, and thus will lose what, 200-300 HP or so?  by wearing their own cultural armours.  In such a case, that would take a number of upgrades/aa's to get that back.</div></div><hr />

Nope, don't get me wrong, I have NO problem at all with mages getting their upgrade, I'm actually really happy for them, as well as me.  I love having mages in a group, I'll take em over a wiz any day of the week *well okee, 'cept maybe not on those trips where you'd REALLLLLLY love to have an evac'er along, or mebbe a trip up to Hate or something :p*  My only problem was with what information you used to back up your case with, which was clearly wrong/exaggerated.

<br />
waah?!<br />
<br />
 How am I blind if I am stating the truth? That truth is no one is going to call a mage for his pet to tank unless it is on specialized mobs <br />
<br />
duh, all along i have said i dont want you guys soloing and crowding group spots of others, i havent said that any group would call on your pet to tank unless it is one of the pet tank groups, any other group would be insain to.<br />
<br />
my beef is solo'ing i can deal with one class like a necro running around doing it, i can deal with some not so smart bards and not so smart druids doing it(because most learn after a few deaths that their class can not do it all that well) but i dont really want the game to become loaded with solo'er</div></div><hr />

<br />
and if you guys would also read the entire thread i already said i do not feel threatend for myself, i feel bad for those you keep from grouping in zone ment for them while you solo or duel box, just because im not poor doesnt mean i cant send a check to feed the children</div></div><hr />

You sir are talking out of your ass.<br />

and if you guys would also read the entire thread i already said i do not feel threatend for myself, i feel bad for those you keep from grouping in zone ment for them while you solo or duel box, just because im not poor doesnt mean i cant send a check to feed the children Take your own advice and read the entire thread as I have. Also, how are we keeping folks from grouping in a zone that I may or may not solo in. Remember, our xp spots are off the beaten path and have more risk than reward. You again are talking out of your ass. Bleh, no matter what happens you are going to believe we are overpowered when you refuse to look at the classes that can solo in PoFire for crying outloud. I am done with this thread. Can't talk logic to one that refuses to hear it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u190"><b>Zacatac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p190">Ok, just did my own testing in response to the &quot;7300hp pets&quot; we supposedly have. <br />
<br />
Rathe's son/Earth pet (65 spell) <br />
DPOC (LDoN pet focus) <br />
2 blades of kedge (63 spell) add +50 hp each <br />
1 Girdle of Magikot (64 spell) adds +500 hp <br />
VIRTUE BUFF from cleric, +1405 hp <br />
<br />
Now, this is fully mage buffed and VIRTUE from a cleric. <br />
<br />
CH at 10% = 6464 <br />
CH at 9% = 6533 <br />
CH at 7% = 6721 <br />
<br />
So to the person that insists we have 7300hp pets, I'd have to say no, not unless they are buffed by outside casters. <br />
<br />
Numbers are more like this-<br />
LDoN focused pet = ~5200 HP<br />
Weapons +100hp<br />
Belt +500hp<br />
Virute +1405 hp<br />
<br />
Total 7205 hp</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u198"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p198">Since some people have a problem with my opinions (and some sure don't) let me spell it out clearly for you.<br />
<br />
(a casual player can obtain LDoN gear in a 100 day period by doing 2 adventures a day to equip)<br />
<br />
Okay, 2x2hours per adventure per day for 100 straight days. You don't see a problem with this? You have the problem not me. That does NOT define casual, thats addictive behavior. You work maybe 8 hours a day (or for the many kids on here go to School) you have some time to spend with your family? Study? Do ANYTHING more useful than glue yourself to the computer?<br />
<br />
(I need the pet to solo PoN, PoV)<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you were SPOILED by SOE with a soloing class. There are maybe 5 zones a CASUAL (by MY and most players opinion) that you can adventure. They are already hard pressed to support the groups in them already. The last thing this game needs is more soloers. You think a &quot;casual&quot; tank player has an easier job than you getting a group? You don't think the Cleric they are grouped with is aware of their hps after the first CH? Do you think they will easily get groups if the whole group has to struggle to keep them up when they could instead get, say my 8500hp buffed/41% haste/17/20 LDoN weapon  instead of their 5500hp buffed/21% haste/13/20 bazaar weapon char? I have looked at the lfg list EVERYTIME I play, Mages your full of crap it contains more Int casters than Tanks almost ANYTIME of the day, tanks far outnumber any class on the &quot;lfg&quot; list.<br />
<br />
(Kadah started throwing insults at me FIRST)<br />
<br />
Well &quot;PUNK&quot;, right back at you! Maybe you, the &quot;NAZI&quot;, who tries to ram his opinion down someones throat, MAYBE will think about the amount of time you and others spend playing EQ. Why is it so important in your life? Why do so many spend so much time getting gear when they will just add more gear to the game (that again you MUST have). I did this rat race, it is boring, and old.<br />
<br />
Killa1 comes on here, first time, and jumps right in on my side and  gets blasted. How about blasting those shit head twerp Mages, with their &quot;WHAAA, I gotta solo attitude&quot; that are first time posters? Because many of you WANT to defend EQ no matter how stupid it becomes. You want your Elemental equiped buddies to clog up zones soloing and screw the CASUAL player.<br />
Bottom line, there aren't enough exp zones.<br />
<br />
In closing I would like to say, Killa1 you are an idiot! The Mages crawling to this board are idiots. SOE devs are idiots(at least they are paid idiots), you, and I are idiots for wasting so much time on something so unimportant as EQ! If you can't handle being flamed, avoid the &quot;outhouse&quot; it smells in here (what it smells of, you hope none of it is on your shoes).<br />
<br />
Now it is time to go read a classic, &quot;knights must have defensive or else post&quot;. Arbosch, you are most welcome to post anytime you like. You Sir, are a one of a kind, class comedian!</div></div><hr />

Remind me the average time spent in front of a TV?<br />
<br />
<br />
their 5500hp buffed/21% haste/13/20 bazaar weapon char? <br />
<br />
That would mean a &quot;really&quot; naked level 65 war with a 21% haste and 13/20 weapon. So in other word, not a casual or average player.<br />
In any other online games, he would have the same problem I garantee you if not worse ( no &quot;forced&quot; pvp for exemple in EQ ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">lel that isnt true, EQ started out as player vs environment, but now, the risk is mostly gone, maps for those that get lost, now its all player Vs player.<br />
<br />
me Vs my play time, me Vs that cleric for this or that ornate, My guild Vs that guild for a mob, my guild Vs that guild for progression this week.<br />
<br />
this is a game of player Vs player, but its in the form of gear,contested camps,spell drops and not direct Pking<br />
<br />
no game will ever be PvP free unless its all about fun and games, and if it isnt hard people prolly are not interested, it would take instanced zones for all, gear upgrades if you stick around long enough, regardless of time put in, or time you couldnt put in because another guild jumped the flagging mob on you.<br />
<br />
The bigger the time sinks, the worse it gets, but we all play it because we want to get to the summit.</div></div><hr />

 Yes, Doom, you cry. You cry like the smallest man in the holding cell. You cry about soloing. 5 Minutes with the clue phone would tell you all you need to know about productive soloing and being a Warrior - that it's about like your sex life. (nonexistant)<br />
<br />
 You hold yourself up as a champion of the 'casual Warrior'? 'Casual Warriors' like me and Gerick are embarrassed by you, like parents whose kid just shit his pants in the grocery store. You're newtank with dual wield. <br />
<br />
 Your hissy-fit diatribes are repeatedly wrong. The fact that people who play your own class tell you to STFU should be a warning. Even in the outhouse, we expect our Warriors to bring room temperature IQ's, and you can't even unfreeze water. Which is ironic, considering that hydrocephaly is undoubtedly the reason for your stunted mental growth.<br />
<br />
 You're an arrogant, empty-headed chucklefuck, although WHY you're arrogant is unknown, simply because nothing you do or say is superior in any way to your normal shit flinging chimpanzee.<br />
<br />
 Now at this point, you'll start foaming at the mouth about 'I have a life and not a game!' or some such other moronic bullshit. So let me edify you. NO ONE CARES that you lack the attention span to get off your ass and improve your lot in life in game. Given your grammar, school isn't a large part of your day, and given the obvious (No one would employ a walking lawsuit to be dipshit like you, and no woman with the abillity to formulate coherent thought would have you), exactly WHAT is stopping you other than the pile of Jergens-soaked Kleenex blocking your monitor?<br />
<br />
 No, don't answer, because like anything else associated with you, NO ONE CARES.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u207"><b>dalead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p207">Gerick, for the last time, some facts:<br />
<br />
1. No Mage pets can hit 6K HPs unbuffed without Time focus or better. (6K unbuffed HPs pets are not for casual players).<br />
2. You don't use suspend when chain petting.<br />
3. If a mage is chain petting, that means, no pet buffs, no toys, nada. So even the Earth pet is an unhasted, un DS'd, 5300 (DPoC focused) paper wall waiting to die, lasting about 22 seconds against any PoV mob if you get lucky enough and pet enrages. If you don't get lucky, it's about 12 - 14 seconds. <br />
<br />
Also, so you don't have a problem with druids, necros, wizzies, bards, beastys, enchs and SKs soloing a spot, but because a mage might now be able to do so with limited success, it's wrong. Based on that, you have a specific beef with mages you are not telling. What's your beef with a Mage?<br />
<br />
Doom.<br />
I see what your problem is. In an earlier post, you said you wanted instant gratification. You want shit just handed to you without working for it. I see why. As a warrior, you must really suck. If it takes you 4 hours to complete 2 advs, you need to re-evaluate the class you are playing. Something is definitely wrong there. Do you die on every pull? 2 advs are alotted 3 hours. Most advs are finished within 45 - 50 mins, unless it's a hard where you might use the entire 90 mins.</div></div><hr />

I'm tired of dumb-ass posts like this.  Yes, you're right, most adventures themselves ARE done in 45-50 minutes.  However, by the time groups are made, adventures are sorted through to get the one your group wants, buffing is done, group members who leave are replaced, etc.; adventures DO take 2 hours each for the casual player.  Sure, I've had days where everyone in our set group was on, and available to play for a few hours, where we easily burned off 2 in less than 3 hours, by far.  However, there have also been days where you log in, spend 30-45 minutes lfg, wait another 15 minutes for the group to be filled, spend 10-15 minutes getting an adventure, then another 15 minutes buffing and medding and last minute afk's, and THEN you spend 45 minutes to an hour doing the adventure.  Then, it's back to the camp for another 10 minutes to roll on loot, split, etc.  That's how it is for the average casual player.  During the week, I usually have about 2-3 hours to play per evening, sometimes more.  For me, 2 adventures in an evening is in the minority, by far.</div></div><hr />

Word to the wise.<br />
<br />
Make your own group. If you're always sitting down waiting for someone to invite you, you're just being lazy.<br />
<br />
You don't spend every day you log on LFG for 45 mins, 15mins getting rdy and 60 mins to complete it. For every day you spend 3 hours doing 2 advs, you spend a day doing 2 advs in 2 hours and another day with a quick 2 advs in an hour and a half.<br />
It averages out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u211"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p211">Actually, the average IS around 1 1/2- 2 hours per adventure, unless you have a set group that logs in/plays at the same time.  Matter of fact, I do make my own groups when I can, if I'm not waiting for friends to log in.  However, there are always more groups LFHealers than there are healers LFG.  You can do an LDoN without CC, and without a slower, and without a specialty puller, but bind wound just isn't gonna cut it.<br />
<br />
And unless you're elementally geared or up, I seriously doubt you've done 2 adventures in an hour and a half more times than you can count on one hand.  Course, if you're elementally geared or up, you're no longer classed as a casual player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u212"><b>dalead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p212">Actually I've done 2 advs in less than 2 hours lots of times and I am a casual gamer. I play about 3 hours or so per day about 3 times per week. A little longer on fridays.<br />
I'm not uber. I don't believe in the holy trinity. It's nice to have, but not required for a regular adv. Can't find a cleric, grab a druid. There are lots of em, so it's easy to find one. If you can't find one, grab a shaman, works just as well. Regular advs don't require much healing, unless you are pulling 5 at a time. Things die way too quickly to do much dmg.<br />
It goes like this. Knock off an adv in 40 mins or so. Usually when you go through one that fast, people don't mind staying for another real quick one. Have 1 person gate back to camp, make em leader, get another adv, run back to camp. Another adv started in 5-10 mins from end of last one. Another 40 mins, another adventure done.<br />
Now I'm not saying this is the norm. But on an average, it doesn't take 4 hours to do 2 adventures. If every single day you log in it takes you 2 hours to do an adv, something is wrong. 2 1/2-3 hours on average seems about right if you're taking it easy. I consider 3 hours of play a day casual. Probably alot less time than most spend watching TV.</div></div><hr />
