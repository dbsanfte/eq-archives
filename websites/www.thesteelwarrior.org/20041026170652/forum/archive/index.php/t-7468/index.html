<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tachyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well , was looking over what the other classes get from their geomancer stones and its just makes me more mad.<br />
<br />
Why is it that pure melee only gets one single upgrade from geomancerstones and all spell casting classes (including hybrids) get 3.<br />
<br />
Why the heck is it so hard to include some new stuff , like lets say kick upgrade to allow stuns to level 65 mobs (keep the same % chance of success)<br />
<br />
Or to include some other not to overpowered skill , but at least add something new and refreshing.<br />
<br />
Its just anoying that because i am a pure melee i have to sit in the backseat of all the nice upgrades that a caster gets.<br />
<br />
I am not complaining about the warrior upgrades we got from the balancing , just that GoD still follows the same pattern as all other high end expansions of further widening the gap between pure melee and spell casters.<br />
<br />
edit: my dumbass posted it under wrong forum so feel free to move it  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We always only had one 'tome' in this expansion.  The Geostones just faciliated the obtaining of the other spells, i.e. instead of hoping a beastlord happens to be on when Turepta Blood drops you can just let him loot a Geostone whatever when he is on.<br />
<br />
Certainly more tomes would not have hurt, but I can't think of very interesting things that wouldn't be too overpowering offhand.  I suspect it'd be more trouble than its worth to come up with some 'lesser' (after all the other 2 spells are weaker spells) tome that does a minor but nontrivial thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tachyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well as i mentioned , improved kick ability would be one.<br />
Another one i would like is a pushback ability that knocks the mob back , much like if i throw myself at him and move him backwards.<br />
<br />
Not overpowering , but yet very usefull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coroq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">another new disc idea: one that works like the original Aggresive :) In other words, lasts 3 mins or so and boosts damage a ton, but side effect of melee damage hurts way more. In other words, inverted Defensive.<br />
<br />
It definately would be fun to get more discs tachy, but those stones are spells and we are fine without lots of new ones. I do agree with your point, but since pure melee just got the new disc system I don't think that the few GoD spells the other archtypes get are unbalancing like, say, PoP spells were.<br />
<br />
But this a concern for Omens, we'll see what they do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They didn't. They changed it to 60 sec of increased damage and no penalty while tanking.<br />
<br />
Also  I'm pretty sure kick can stun level 65 mobs if they aren't mark as immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well originally each class only got 1 spell from the Taelosian Geomancy Stones and from the Chaos Runes. But due to the uproar over how the lesser spells are dropped they came up with a new stone system to allow spells to be more readily available.</div></div><hr />
