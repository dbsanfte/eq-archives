<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm considering the possibility to getting a laptop, mainly for school and portability purposes, however I would also like it to be able to run WoW as well as other games well...like say, C&amp;C Generals, WC3, perhaps some first person shooters (you think HAlf-Life2 could be played on the average laptop?  I heard you could play it even on lower power systems).  I'm not exactly looking for top-of-the-line, but a solid laptop that can play these games...even if it must be at the lowest details.<br />
<br />
I know I won't be able to get this dirt-cheap, but I'd rather prefer not to pay out the nose for it.  Just a laptop that can actually play some of these more recent games okay enough, yet doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  I'd build it myself if it were a desktop, but I can't really do that for a laptop.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how powerful it needs to be?  Especially for WoW or even Half-life2 if possible?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miron</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure it has at least 512Mb of RAM. My laptop only has 256 and I'm constantly paging (Loading information from the harddrive to RAM). If it wasn't for that it would be able to handle WoW good enough as old as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I figured about 512MB RAM.  How about CPU speed?  I'm an AMD fan, but I don't know much about notebook chips (I've seen 1.73GHz Intel chips in newer notebooks, which is odd considering Intel's desire for high speed chips).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">low freq intels are the Mobility(r) ones, they are meant to be very economic (cusume few energy) to last longer (4+hours).<br />
<br />
I'm planning to buy a 1.8GHz Intel Mobilty + 1GoRAM + ATI GL 9000  Mobile + 60Go HD for same raison as first post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I have read you don't realy need anything that powerfull to play WoW. Half-life2 I don't know a damn thing about however.</div></div><hr />
