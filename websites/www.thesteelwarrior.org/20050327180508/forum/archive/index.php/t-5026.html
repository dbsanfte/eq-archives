<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good discussion here for me as well.   I have been doing High adventures lately just for the &quot;fun factor&quot;.  The Normal adventures have become down right BORING to me.<br />
<br />
I use cleric, rogue, enchanter, wizard, druid, and me.  All 65 with 100+ aa's and ornate level gear.<br />
<br />
Lull is unreliable.<br />
<br />
What we do in a 3 or 4 pull room is each root class targets a different mob.  We actually worked out a clockwise mob selection for our group.  I shoot an arrow at a mob at exact time the others root there specific mob.  Root has never failed in the dozen adeventures Ive run through.<br />
<br />
Now all this aside, Ive yet to win an adventure in the deisgnated time and names have been VERY far away .. though we don't zone in , leave adventure, try another till we get close name... we just go in and have fun.<br />
<br />
I don't know your magello, but mine is posted.  I can't take 3 high mobs with out Furious running and that's only once every 30 minutes.  I do NOT have enought endurance to use evasive / stonewall every 7 minutes either.<br />
<br />
Well, unless anyone has better advice, my only advice is to set up designated rooters when you cant single or double pull and do NOT rely on lull.<br />
<br />
O.. and mobs hit for 140's then blam they'll double for 948 (max ive ever been hit for).  Its so unpredictable we rely on Infusion and Supernal Light / Supernal Elixir.  And I always use 2handers in High adventures.<br />

Clr War Bard/chanty Ranja ( Sham/BST ) ( Rog/Pal )<br />
Shammy and Rog or Bst and Pal, gives me a healer for the group decent DPS and the Clr on me.<br />
Ranja pulls with snares and roots...cuz Lull and Paci just blow on Hard lvl, fails way too much.<br />
Ranja runa around like a headless chicken with the mobs untill the CC can get it or its rooted, we DO take bets before each mission on the number of Ranja deaths, though even him dying 5x don't stop the wins:)<br />
All and all its usally fun cept when we get the spacecadet CC or healer who trys and heal the ranja on a pull LOL :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, there are 2 classes of trash mobs.  The tough variety hits me for 950.  The weaker, 946.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I have found that tanking isn't much of a problem if I use a 2h weapon. 1h weapons beget ripostes.  A few extra 900 point hits add up fast.  There are times, with 1h weapons, that I'd lose 4500 HPs in a single round.  Mob would hit a few times, and riposte me.  Le ow!<br />
<br />
Named mobs are where it's at.  I have never tanked one without being defensive, they hit for 600 or so max then.  They don't seem to have many more HPs than the trash mobs, so they go down before too long, and drop nice loot.  Except for the three nodrop aggro-bash shields that dropped in a row from Ruj, we have never had loot that wasn't immediately equipped by the winner of said loot.<br />
<br />
If you have a chanter, just pull and mez, don't fight more than one at a time. Basically, practice good CC behavior.  Having a plan for rooting overpulls is good. FD puller owns but if FD fails, LOADING PLEASE WAIT.  I have done LDoNs successfully with a skillfull bard being the puller and CC.  He dies a lot, but expects to.<br />
<br />
I get from 50% to 70% of an AA for every hard adventure.<br />
<br />
Just try it.  And be prepared to lose the first time.  We always do collections now.  Exp and Drops make it worthwhile even if you do suffer the odd loss.  Two of my 3 losses have been by 2 minutes or less.<br />
<br />
The other loss I suffered was by 10 minutes or so.   Our group didn't gel.  Took us 45m to get out of zone-in.  The first room was small and had 4 mobs, some being casters.  That set the tone.  We were impatient.  Our chanter was inexpericenced.  We died a lot.   We pulled a LOT of mobs to the ZI, and very nearly got back in the game.  But we simply had too many deaths.  Annoying as it was, it was a blast.  We killed to a named, who dropped face armor with like 90HPs on it.  The chanter won it, a HUGE upgrade.  In fact it would have been a huge upgrade for any of us. <br />
<br />
Hard LDoNs are teh win, even when we lose.<br />
<br />
One word of caution. I only do LDoNs with a balanced group, and the group must be made up of people I know or know of.  You can do normal missions with one cleric and 5 tanks. No the case with Hards!<br />
<br />
EDIT - spalling, and grammur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slowmotionz</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... so they hit for about 900 or so...<br />
<br />
Thats like HOH armor camp minus the bitch AEs... sounds difficult... but doable :) Not sure how the change to discs will make it... hopefully I'll have enough end to go defensive/stonewall/evasive when I need to (AKA. When the cleric is being slow) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild just recently started trying Hards, and we had some trepidation going into it after hearing about 'everything hits for 900+' and 'only certain group configurations can win' ect, ect...<br />
<br />
So, we take 2 warriors, ranger, shaman, enchanter, and a cleric in for two collections...  2 wins.  Next day we do 3 in a row (all wins) with the same 2 warriors, a sk, shaman, enchanter, and a cleric.  Note that we only on the 2nd day used a charmed pet for any given time...and even then only on one adventure for longer than 5 mins.  5-0 on hards...and boy are they more fun.<br />
<br />
Advice from my experience is:  don't try FD'ing unless you anticipate 4+, otherwise just give your enchanter a mez target, and a rooter a root target before you pull.  Be prepared to use stonewall/defensive/furious on 'opps' pulls...and AET/Shield when enchanters/shamans get resists.  I've found the ench/cleric pacification to simply not work well enough to justify trying.  I'd rather pull 3 and have them beating on me, than try and split 2 and have the enchanter take a dirt nap.  For all 5 of the adventures we won, I was pulling for the vast majority of the time...typically with Incite, though often I'd try and butt-pull or just arrow tag it if it's obviously solo.<br />
<br />
The key to winning without a charmed pet is simply have a group that's on their game, and that can handle contigencies.  With a charmed pet (if you get one) you can be a little sloppier and still pull out a W.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Mobs only hit for 339 at most which is how hard thye hit on normal difficulty adventures. All of us were expecting a tough fight. We collected our23 vampire fangs in less then 30 minutes and were out of the dungeon with our casters never having to take a med break.<br />
<br />
Not sure if that was a bug or if mobs only hit for 900+ if everyone in the group is level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">average level 61.5 <br />
<br />
Isn't the cut off for the &quot;next level&quot; at average level 62?<br />
<br />
So you didn't get the high 65 dungeon, you got the high 61 dungeon which is the normal 65.<br />
<br />
/scratches her head<br />
<br />
Some how that logic seems correct though I'm boggled on how i even typed it coherently.<br />
<br />
And our CC is root / snare.  Makes pulling 3-4 mob rooms easier to pre target your assigned mob to root.<br />

I've been using CH for the heals instead of Supernal and I've won all the High adventures I have gone through since.<br />
<br />
Seems cleric mana has never been an issue since swappign to CH.  Anyways, thanks everyone for your input on the High missions.  They are alot more fun then normal... though we've only made it to one named.<br />
<br />
On the enchanter board they suggest doing Rescue Missions over gathers/slaughters.  Any idea why they would suggest these?  I asked them, but haven't gotten a reply yet.   Anyone here recommned Rescue &gt; Gather?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would imagine enchanters prefer rescue missions because they are only killing as many mobs as necessary to get the rescue mob to follow you, then only killing the ones in the way on the way back out. With good maps and spawn locations, you can make a beeline for the rescue mob and kill the bare minimum amount of bad guys.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't see the point in finishing an adventure faster than 35-40 minutes anyway since you have to wait for the next adventure to be given. Other than dick swinging, there is no point in finishing an adventure in 20 minutes. Might as well spends all 40 minutes killing mobs for exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you have to kill a set amount of mobs to get the captive to even spawn.<br />
<br />
The captive will stop even if a mob is on the other side of a wall, and in some of the dungeons you have to follow a long path to *get* to the room on the other side of the wall.<br />
<br />
In my 72 wins, I've found it good practice to treat a rescue like a slaughter.  Clear well, use your map to determine if side passages need clearing to prevent the &quot;behind the wall&quot; hangup, and just stroll out with the captive.</div></div><hr />

Best chance for success is either ele planes geared folks of any variety and i mean fully ele geared or one of these combos  for pulling.<br />
<br />
1) bard . they are teh win if they are smart enough to use there charisma song b4 lull.<br />
<br />
2) sk.  pullers need hps to survive pulls and and pull them fast enough in order make the alloted time. We are talking an 8.5k + fully buffed sk.<br />
<br />
3) chanter and rogue. rogue pretargets w/ sos and pulls . typically rogue will pull to his demise once or twice a mission but this combo is surprisingly effective.<br />
<br />
4) chanter and monk. Age old combo if one is ineffectual hopefully the other won't be.<br />
<br />
5) 5 tank beat down w/ cleric not reliable but then again with good enough gear most things are possible.<br />
<br />
Couple things that really increase your chance for success is having 2 slowers/mezzers and having 9k+ hps yourself. These are doable with 8k but its really a crap shoot with mitigation.<br />
<br />
dps is essential.<br />
<br />
In my experience charming mobs is really a double edged sword. charm has been nerfed and has tendency to break when least wanted but speeds up kills if chanter is an ace.<br />

With all the enchanter and shaman mobs you will get a lot of mobs inc that are hasted.  If you dont have someone overwriting their haste with a slow you will take astronomical amounts of damage.<br />
<br />
My pet peeve about hard adventures:<br />
<br />
Its very easy to aggro kite cheese these adventures.  A group of guildies last night had their only healer LD for all but 10 min of the adventure and still won.  Why bother tanking something if you can just aggro kite it by pets, nukers, rangers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) bard . they are teh win if they are smart enough to use there charisma song b4 lull. <br />
<br />
No, bards are the win of they dont use that crutch at all. Learning how to really pull works out much better than relying on lull.<br />
<br />
Basically, mez, fade, and highsun are 20x faster and more reliable on hards then lull. Rarely use highsun even. Mez is the single best pulling tool.<br />
<br />
2 spawn, mez one and buddy runs to camp. Slow buddy as its inc, switch over to warrior fast to intercept! then remez the intial one as it is running into camp 3 full ticks later.<br />
<br />
3 spawn, do the same thing and either mez the 2nd free add as its inc and fade at camp for a single, or let 2 run toward camp timing it so mez the second free one is mez'd in camp, then lock down the intial one in camp 3 ticks later.<br />
<br />
etc and so on. Much much faster than using lull and having to keep doing it untill it lands (resists a ton in hard) or a failure and aggroing 6 mobs in a room and having to blow all your mana.<br />
<br />
Can even do stuff like aggro a room full of 6 and kite them mezzing in a circle then let party members root them down if your on the mood or mez if an enchanter, easier usually just to split in 2 waves of 3.<br />
<br />
As for the difficulty, i both tank and pull them and i havent lost one since i started two-boxing them. After a few tries and adjusting to them they are quite fun and easy, while still challenging cause if you mess up it can kill people fast if your not the best geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the group being required to work well together.  High risk dungeons aren't something that you really jump into a pickup group full of random morons.  I'm an enchanter, and I've always always always pulled for my groups.  People just have to pay attention.  Pre-targetting stuff helps.  You should never get more than 3 mobs on a pull.  If you DO get more, odds are that you should've been initially hard aggroing something else.  At any rate, even on pulls of 3, I'll say tank, assist on this mob_01, cleric stun mob_02, and I'll mez mob_03 to start the pull.  We do this in guild groups where no one is VT+ geared, and have never had a problem.  I don't think we've ever lost a high risk.  We even did one with 5 people (not by choice, shaman went LD on zoning in and never came back, won with ~2 minutes left).  You'd be surprised at how far you can get based on competence rather than worrying about your gear :cool:</div></div><hr />

I'm a monk, and many times the one putting the group together.  Pallyies are really good at stalling a mob waiting for Mez via stuns.  Either the mob is stunned and waiting or stuck to the pally waiting on the mez.  <br />

I can pull singles and doubles very reliably and with good tagging is becomes almost a no brainer.  Sure I can die a bit, but not all that much really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did a normal the other day after doing 3 highs in a row.. WOW, talk about BORING.  The advantage of a High over a Normal for me is a rejevenated game play.<br />
<br />
Playing a High reminds me of the ole days when I easly could wipe in Chardok or DN were death actually ment something.  In a High adventure death usually means re buffing, medding, and a large time loss and potential of failure.  Though the &quot;old&quot; days of CR's is different then the &quot;advent of death&quot; now, the &quot;fear of death&quot; is still heavy on my shoulders.  I like that feeling again.  <br />

<br />
Been thinking of trying a hard adventure with my regular group...I have just under 5300 hp and 1250 ac unbuffed, and can tank Krigers without much trouble and without discs (tanked 2 at once with defensive yesterday and cleric never went low on mana.)  The other grp members would be 65 cleric (60 aa's), 65 mage (70 aa's), 65 chanter (50 aa's), 64 druid (&lt; 20 aa's), 65 monk (40 aa's.)<br />
<br />
What do you think our chances would be? <br />
<br />
Note:  most of us have been grouping together a few times a week for over a year, so we have good tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radalas</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest with that group makeup, to get 2 slowers.  <br />
<br />
with 5300hp unbuffed you are asking for a wipe on any 2-3 pulls without a dedicated slower.  I would replace the druid with a shaman.  <br />
<br />
I've tanked Hard before at sub 8khp, but you really have to put a lot of healing in it.<br />
<br />
Its duable I suppose... but I would think you would need a bit of luck on your side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd probably give you about a 50% chance of success with that group.  If you replaced the druid with a shaman of equiv. power, you'd probably bump up your chances a bit...  The enchanter on a multipull might be in for some pain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For pulling, i'd say the only classes most dependable are monks, shadowknights and necromancers in that order.<br />
<br />
First off, monks can split with FD, but ive noticed though their feign death fails more than necro/SK, they have enough time to get up and do it again with rapid feign, however on tight pulls, necros get 1 rounded, and sk's have like a 2 sec casting time so monks can feign the fastest and will be able to give the best results IMO<br />
<br />
but theres no denying the fact that all chars fd will fail at one point, and more than likely will result in a death at least once in every hard adventure. To me thats just expected, because if a monks FD fails, it would be wise for him to stay there and try again and/or die there to save his group from a wipe.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents...</div></div><hr />

I think Dima was having a slight seizure when typing &quot; The aggro range there is shit&quot;. MMC is easy to pull even as a warrior. I rarely get doubles in normal mode, so I am sure this would be advantageous in Hard mode.<br />
<br />
That group will do fine Abynormal777.  Just pre target the mobs you want rooted / mezzed and give some distance between pulling.  Leave a room between the pull and the camp.  And don;t hesitate to look outside the box on pulling, you'd be surprised what types of &quot;pull methods&quot; you can think up when you want to do well.<br />
<br />
O, and shame on you for saying that warriors don't pull.  I pull 3-4 when stonewall or furious is availble giving several seconds to get the crowd under control.  There is beauty in making my group mates work hard :)<br />
<br />
Also, Abynormal777, don't hesitate to have the druid evac to save from a caster death.  Mana is a very highly prized possession in a High adv, also have the casters bind outside, in case they do die they can have some mana as they run in.<br />
<br />
Unless you care about the Leaderboard there is no harm in trying... you may succeed )</div></div><hr />

I think the odds of you winning your first High Risk LDoN are extremely low.  That said, I would suggest that with practice, you can win them with that group.  Also, even if you can't win, you can pick up some VERY nice loot even while losing.  I would suggest you get full raid buffs before entering the dungeon.  Everyone bind as close as possible.  Evasive is your friend.  GSoT or other high-agro 2h is what you need to be using.<br />
<br />
Don't get discouraged easily.  Some maps are a lot harder than others.<br />
<br />
Remember that the leaderboard doesn't say who had the most fun.  Your xp bar is not a fun meter.  If you spend 90 mins and lose while having fun playing heroically you will have probably gained xp, possibly gained awesome loot, and definitely learned something for next time.<br />
<br />
Let us know how you do!</div></div><hr />

They are so much more fun and they actually present a challenge as opposed to the mindless slaughter normal missions are. Like some people have mentioned, your chance for success with that group is not all that good Abynormal. However, I would highly recommend giving it a shot until you guys figure it out. Just like anything else, once you figure out how to pull and the best way to attack a high risk dungeon, a wide variety of group make ups will work, sometimes you just have to be a little creative.</div></div><hr />

I think your group will do fine in a high risk LDON.  I do suggest that you take collect missions to get everyone in the feel of things.  Given that you have been grouping with these folks for a while, you already have the mojo going for the group.  Just be patient while the monk breaks things up.  Also, don't worry too much if you get 2-3.  Trying for singles wastes more time.  Dieing is not a big deal either.  Just recover and keep going.<br />
<br />
My regular group has been doing hard ldons for a few weeks now.  We have won all but one mission.  All 65 (pre EP) average 145 AAs.  (Sham, Mag, Wiz, Druid, Bard, War).  The bard pulls and the sham/druid keep us alive.  I have a buffing team (Ench/Cleric) at a common point if we need re-buffs for deaths.  Heck, last night in the first mission we managed to kill everyone at least once and still won a collect 27 with 15 min to spare.<br />
<br />
All in all, try it out and figure out what works best for you.  It may take an adventure or 2 to get your tactics down but after that you will enjoy yourself.</div></div><hr />

I prefer normal. <br />
Where you can just rush stuff and mindless charge.<br />
Rushing a room with 6 7 mobs in Guk is a pleasure.</div></div><hr />

It is more efficient but I like the whole feeling of moderate danger in a Hard over the min-max fun of rushing trivial content.  Damn do I wish there was a Medium though!<br />
<br />
I far prefer Hard adventures but I'd be the first to say that I won't do them without people I know.  Equipment is a determinant but not really as much as reasonable skill.  The one fairly key bit though is a skilled puller and for that I prefer a Bard overall.  An Enchanter, Monk, SK or Necro can do it but a competant Bard can do it better in my opinion.  The real kicker is that at least 1 in 3 pickup people in LDoN are completely useless.<br />
<br />
Tanking, Healing, Slowing and DPS need to be there also of course but there are many, many ways around that.  A good Shaman is invaluable but a competant Beastlord and Druid can do some amazing things as well.  Bard, Cleric, Warrior, Rogue, Druid, Beastlord is about my favorite composition although I'd freely admit a charm-class instead of the Rogue would be more dps.  As I play that Rogue though I'm a little biased and I do get to break at least one of the pita rooms per adventure, if not two.  The Druid is perfect for backup heals and Exodus while the Beast I frankly like for paragon and more dps.  A Shammie would be more reliable for Q and consistant slows but hey, I know an incredibly smart BL and it gets the job done ;)</div></div><hr />

Fun though how in that other thread (LDoN raids) you claim you really want an extremly difficult adv type.<br />
<br />
I prefer hard because you earn points alot faster that way.<br />
I don't really &quot;enjoy&quot; either type as much as I enjoy raiding.</div></div><hr />

But since mobs are harder you will have to deal with being able to slow earlier (unless your cleric can compensate for that).

<br />
This is actually the opposite to what I've found.  While only doing a limited number of hard adventures so far *around 10-15*, our group has definitely found the mobs to be packed a lot tighter together than what would be in a regular adventure, especially the ZI rooms, or the first room.  Where on a normal adventure you might have 2-3 mobs, in hards you can expect from 4-6 in the same room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're group is under 63, say 62.8, then picking hard will give you the same dungeon a level 63+ group would have gotten on normal setting.  Pretty sure the cutoff is every 5 levels (so 63, 58, 53, etc).<br />
<br />
If your group is right on the cusp of the next cutoff, it can be good to bump up one difficulty level, as normal will be too easy, and hard will give better xp and points.</div></div><hr />

Had myself (65sk), 65 nec, 65 cleric, 65 sham, 65 wiz and, 65 war.  Necro pulled and would agro kite adds that would resist root.  Had the war and shaman die a few times but all in all it was a fun time.  Death's Peace is a 1 sec cast time, and a necro w/ decent hps should be able to get off atleast 1 of his DA spells while it resets.  <br />
<br />
I did a little pulling and FD helps a ton as long as you got the hps to live through a fail/fizzle/interuppt.<br />

For pulling, i'd say the only classes most dependable are monks, shadowknights and necromancers in that order.<br />
<br />
First off, monks can split with FD, but ive noticed though their feign death fails more than necro/SK, they have enough time to get up and do it again with rapid feign, however on tight pulls, necros get 1 rounded, and sk's have like a 2 sec casting time so monks can feign the fastest and will be able to give the best results IMO<br />
<br />
but theres no denying the fact that all chars fd will fail at one point, and more than likely will result in a death at least once in every hard adventure. To me thats just expected, because if a monks FD fails, it would be wise for him to stay there and try again and/or die there to save his group from a wipe.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience Bard is a better puller in any LDoN due to lull and fading memories.<br />
<br />
Though Hard LDoN isn't really that hard to pull.  Your luck may vary, but in general as long as you're not doing Tak or Guk you shouldn't have very messy rooms to deal with.</div></div><hr />

My normal group does not even have any FD types or cleric and have only failed 2 of 20 hard missions (and those were months ago).    I've also done hard ldon as a 62 cleric.  The rest of the group was 65 (shamy, bard, druid, sk, paly).  We did fine and won as well.  <br />
<br />
I think bottom line is doing hard with folks you know makes all the difference.  Also, when i'm tanking, i'm using a marshall's blade.  While aggro can sometimes be an issue, my group is used to me and we rarely have aggro issues.  Worse case someone dies, hits the buff team and is right back in action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a new gripe about Hard LDoN's.<br />
<br />
At the moment they are pretty much all I am looking for when I play my chanter.  I log on, put /lfg up, add a &quot;Hard LDoN only&quot; message into the LFG tool and start tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
Get the usual half dozen Want a BoT/PoV XP group tells and a few LDoN offers.  If its LDoN I'll do a /who on the player and if they are sub 65 say no thanks, if they are 65 I'll sometimes say &quot;if you are looking to do hard&quot;, and invariably I get back &quot;sure we can do hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
90% of these people have never done hard before, have a druid main healer, some pissant knight who barely makes 7khps buffed tanking and no FD puller / bard to split pull.  Some of these group leaders invite me and then choose a mission on normal difficulty anyway - leave adventure / disband time.  Some of them have chosen hard but not told the rest of the group that they were going to choose a hard mission.<br />
<br />
Now I don't mind losing a few adventures, I do them for the fun and loot, not for the XP and points, cos really if I cared about the win/loss ratio theres no way I'd be doing pickup groups for hards.  So far I've won more than I've lost, but the number of people jumping up and saying &quot;yeah we can do hard&quot; when they have a snowball's chance in hell of succeeding is getting ridiculous.  Suck it up and find another slower cos farming shit for tailoring is more fun than normal LDoNs and much more fun than trying to win a hard with a druid healer and a 7khp tank.</div></div><hr />
