Dropped 56 mobs in 56 mins for a gain of 105 adventure points.  I wont complain about getting only 105 adventure points because although it is a bit light, its not terrible.  Anyway Mobs in hard adventures tend to hit for about 990 max as compared to 360ish or whatever for normal.  Again i wont bitch about the dropped augments only giving 1 more resist or stat, even though they should give + 15 in hard.  But this is what really pissed me the fuck off.  We finish the adventure and our chanter leaves and gets his chest open spells.  Comes back opens the chest and what do we get?  A fucking green potion.  For those of you who dont know what this is it is a lore no drop 1 charge of poison awareness 1.<br />
<br />
Poison Awareness I  Detail | History | Stacking | Raw Data  <br />

Cast on you: An aura of poison awareness surrounds you. <br />
Wears off: The awareness fades <br />
 <br />
Thats right, a 65 time enabled hard adventure gave us an item that only works on spells up to level 20.  It doesnt take a genius to realize this is some fucked up shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, the points ratio which to me is what matter the most is good in your case thought.<br />
<br />
105 pts in 1 hour, where before your best was 51 pts in 45 min.<br />
<br />
Even if you do 2 super fast normal adventure you would take at least 1:15 (and 1:30 if you want to start a 3rd one) to get 100 or so pts.<br />
<br />
I agree that loot sucked.<br />

We did 2x hard Guk last night with Time geared people and we where killing at a much slower rate than 56 in 56 min. We did a slaughter 51 and slaughter 54 and both took longer than 56 minutes.<br />
<br />
Our group was war, bard, necro, 2x wiz, cleric. Both times we had a warrior death that slowed us down some, but we were killing 1 mob every 75-80 seconds which would have put us close to 70 minutes or so without including death slow down.<br />
<br />
Do the mobs in Guk have more HP? I know the eyes have a crap load of HP and we did seem to get a lot of them, maybe that's the difference.<br />
<br />
Hards are fine now, except no drop loot : 90% of them decay. Yeah, we had 2 of the Veng3 90hp belts rot. Too bad, my warrior could use one!</div></div><hr />

We finish at about 1 mob a minute on slaughters. Assassinations take between 65-80mins, depending on mob types. Collect and Rescue don't ever get accepted ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did 3 hard missions in a row(2 rescues+1 slaughter 54, in Ruj). It took 3 hours 9 minutes, from the time we accepted mission #1 until we completed mission #3.<br />
<br />
Thats a decent improvement over doing normals imo. <br />
<br />
However it does require a pretty wellbalanced group. We used a charmed pet on the last 2 missions, if we hadnt, I think our completion times would have been much worse, as we were lacking in DPS.<br />
<br />
We had Warrior+Monk+Wizard+Enchanter+Druid+Cleric.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You pretty much need a charmed pet to do 1 mob/minute.  There just isn't enough DPS in any realistic group makeups if you don't have a pet.  If you don't have especially high DPS classes, slaughter 60 will pretty much use up all your 90 minutes.  <br />
<br />
The no drop isn't really a problem.  If you're at a level where none of the no drop loot is useful to any member of your party, then you're geared enough so that the Hard missions shouldn't be that hard for you.  No drop is what allows them to put some fairly powerful items in the dungeons without having too much mudinflation.  You're getting 100 HP/mana (but usually not both) items with 6 people, and you don't need any special plane access, and although Hard isn't trivial, it's still easier to take down a Hard named (low HPs, double 1Ks) versus an elemental mini named (more HPs, quad 1K usually).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our wizard DPS in long missions is pretty damn good, they never go OOM or LOM... of course they all have maxed mana regen, focus items, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just like the idea of 105 points for an hours work that's far more lively than a back-to-back normal snoozefest.  The loot is secondary to the points at this stage, and in most groups I'm in for hards we don't need the loot anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm not a 'power adventurer' (23 wins and 4 raid losses! wuwu~).  I wanna unlock 1492s as fast as possible, and hards are now a good route to do so.<br />
<br />
Also, the mission selection for hards seems to be relatively untapped, meaning more kill count missions available right off the bat.  No cycling through rescue-collect-collect-collect-rescue-rescue-collect....<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  But if I was in a group 'pushing the limits' on hard in pre/mid-VT gear, finishing with 3 mins to spare and I got that loot, I would be pretty pissed too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're in pre/mid VT level and you're actually able to complete Hard, you should have nothing to complain about considering the named mobs drop item that are almost as good as VT.<br />
<br />
Why are people even expecting anything remotely good out of chests?  The chests are no longer the atomic bomb in a box like they were before so it's not exactly a matter of life and death opening one.  The chests were never that hard to open.  It's just that you'd be stupid to open one since they can blow up your party if you messed up.  I'd estimate you get about at most one useful augment per adventure via killing, so you certainly should not expect getting more than 1 useful augment/trinket out of chests per adventure.  I agree poison awareness I isn't quite right, but something like say a charge of Vah Shar illusion or a random augment or even some cash items is perfectly in line with the risk (very little now) to opening chests.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hrm top shaman cleric warrior enchanter rogue and ranger on the server.  We didnt charm at all, but the chanter was pulling and always had a mob there to kill.  I would say mobs had the same hps as they do on normal adventures, they just hit for 3, as much.  And as for the exp it was so so, half an aa off the 56 mobs.  Overall i dont think hard adventures are worth the risk unless you have a stacked group and know you wont fail.<br />
<br />
Edit: I was using blade of war w about 1800 attack, rogue was useing ifir main, khal off w 1900 and gar was using SEWS w 1900ish.  Chanter was only pulling and mezzing, shm was slowing + nuke and melee dps thanks to his coral hilted mace, and cleric was healing obviously and fm the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurgeh</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">45-50 mn for an assassination is average for my usual grp, just have to be lucky to find a pet fast. It seems to me slaughter are longer than assassination, providing you know the map.<br />
did some w/o pet at all, it's more like 65-70mn. For a balanced elem geared grp, there is not much challenge in a hard adventure. In fact you can do them with an unbalanced group just fine.<br />
Imo too bad there are only 2 difficulty settings, we could have used a level between normal and hard for non raider that want some challenge, and a very hard setting, for balanced group stuffed with high end gear, I mean we're talking about farming efficiency, what about a real challenge? It's still harder to complete a mark of justice than to win an hard adventure, it's a bit sad that in an extension designer for single groups does not even beat PoP single group encounter difficulty.</div></div><hr />

4. Bard (EP guild, puller, mezzer)<br />
5. Mage (VT Guild)<br />
6. Ranger (EP guild, 200AA)<br />
<br />
Finished with 15 mins left.<br />
<br />
then one with all guild members, EP guild<br />
1. Warrior (me)<br />
2. Cleric<br />
3. Enc<br />
4. Ranger<br />
5. BST<br />
6. Mage<br />
Finished with 20 mins left (enc didnt charm since all CoD-able mobs are level 65 to us)<br />
<br />
Overall, 105 points is fine. did the best record for normal 25 mins with non-optimal group, so the time vs Adv. Points is fine, but the loot really sucks, almost all NO DROP in high risk, but for those who do high risk Adventure, 90% of them wont need those.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
Parse yourself and learn. <br />
3 SoS per mob = 10,5k damage. Thats already more than 40%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No wizard can do thee SoS every minute for 60min.  NOt to mention SoS will be resisted quite often in hard adventures.  Sustained wizard dps in most groups is about 150dps.  If you want to log though, you should just look at total damage done by each class.  Monks and rogues will do more total damage.  Monks will be close to them and rogues will be quite a bit higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Torrin <br />

<br />
And Aspit, mobs in high risk have 25k hp.  In normal they have 15k.  I do parse all the time. While I haven't parsed an LDoN mission, I can easily sustain 150 DPS in PoF using spells that are less DPS. With a bard in group I can sustain closer to 200 DPS. Any time geared wizard should be able to do that.<br />
<br />
NOt to mention SoS will be resisted quite often in hard adventures. You'd be surprised. Yesterday did back to back high risk and had 5 full resists. That's 5 more than I would get with draughts that are very rarely resisted, but the difference in DPS is worth the very occasional resist. The biggest problem with SoS in LDoN is not the resists, but rather the agro it generates. I often land SoS for 3300-3500 damage and when a mob only has 25khp, they notice when you hit them for 12-14% of their HP.<br />
<br />
If you want to log though, you should just look at total damage done by each class. Monks and rogues will do more total damage. Monks will be close to them and rogues will be quite a bit higher. I would be very surprised if either monks or rogues do more total damage in an LDoN adventure. Quite a few guilds have published parses from Time tier 1-3 and wizards are consistently the top damage dealers with rogues and monks a bit behind them. I would suspect that you'll get the same thing thing in an LDoN mission.<br />
<br />
But, I'll follow my own advise and parse a couple of missions and post some results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me make one thing VERY clear.  Exp groups are NOT 6 minute god kills.<br />
<br />
Wizards are great on raids.  They arn't in exp groups.  Its been this way for 4.5 years, save for the rare aoe group before they nerfed them into oblivion.<br />
<br />
My warrior with a BoW outdamags the best geared wizard on my server on long missions.  Ths is with a bard, nine, SD, VoQ, maelin robe, ele gloves.  You can say he sucks all you want, but he is the highest damage on any god we kill, and I assure you he plays very well.<br />
<br />
Brodda is very correct in that casters cannot use damage per second to measure anything.  When comparing caster damages, always use sums.<br />
<br />
Another very important factor to keep in mind is downtime/combat time.  If your group pulls slowly and has a low combat time (i.e. below 50-60%) then you are ROBBING melee of their damage and inflating caster damage.  Good play punishes wizards in EQ.  Its poor design, I know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a prase of myself ina group with 3 wizards, a rogue, and a cleric.<br />
<br />
The wizards had beast buffs and VoQ before we went in.  I was tanking and the rogue had crap gear.<br />
<br />
I did more damage than all three wizards.  And each of these wizzies were the top 5 best equipped wizards on the server.  ONe wizard got close to me and the other wizards were no where close.  I did more damage and I was also tanking.  <br />
<br />
ANother problem with casters is that people are lazy.  They get distracted by real life stuff or just get bored.  An afk wizard does no damage.  An afk melee can at least hit autoattack.<br />
<br />
I am a logging junky and I have spent a LOT of time trying to see what classes out damage me in exp groups.  The only class that has out damaged me (i don't include charmed pets.  =P) is rogues.  Wizards, rangers, mages, beasts, none have out damaged me and I have looked for it.  I have asked them to specifically to do their best to outdamage me.  <br />
<br />
But they STILL do GOOD damage.  Just not the best.  WHich is balanced considering the sickly damage casters can dish out in burst periods.</div></div><hr />

Combined? May I suggest we stop talking about AFK-zards when speaking of damage?<br />
<br />
Or are you even a warrior? I'd be surprised if a monk couldnt outdamage you, also your weapon might be of interest ~<br />
<br />
However, without any numbers I doubt Wandor or anyone else will listen to you :)</div></div><hr />

In any case, I did get numbers for myself. Did a high risk slaughter 56 in Miragul's. Group was:<br />
<br />
65 war<br />
65 rogue<br />
65 wiz (me)<br />
65 mage<br />
65 chanter<br />
65 cleric<br />
<br />
We had the cleric die once and had to evac, but other than that slow down, we killed a mob a minute or so. Here are my stats anyway -<br />
<br />
cast 97 Draught of Ro 1 full resist<br />
cast 77 Strike of Solusek 1 full resist<br />
cast 15 sanres<br />
cast 5 roots<br />
<br />
Total damage - 262665<br />
<br />
Only had VoQ, 2 mob rods, and self buffs for mana regen, 30% Fire damage focus. Not having 9+SD hurt, and getting stuck on snare/root duty cost me another 30k or so, but not bad overall.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I am no where near the top wizard on my server. So yeah, if the top wizard on your server can't keep up with the damage in a 1hr+ long adventure, then either the wiz is doing something wrong, or your server has gimp wizards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly the point. No bard, no 9, no SD and on snare duty and 262k is still a good number when competing against time equiped melees and a hasted charmed pet. I'll try and get buffed up and run a parse with others hit on, but I can pretty much tell you what the results are gong to be. A time equiped wizard will do 300-400k damage per hour over time. Simply convert snares and roots to nukes and I would have done over 300k without good buffs. Anyone capable of doing high risk adventures that thinks caster DPS sucks over time is delusional or they group with lame casters, simple as that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people do not play the game truly min/maxing pull and totally 'sacrificing' one person who will do nothing but fetch mobs non stop, to always keep melees swinging and keep uptime at 95+%.<br />

Personally, I try to have the enchanter or shaman or puller start pulling much earlier than the first mob is dead, in regular experience spots like BoT or CoD, however, since nobody in my guild is VT geared, whenever we do LDoN hard dungeons we usually have a mix match of people and cannot quite sustain truly non stop pulls, so our uptime in a hard group is much lower - probably around 70% or so.<br />
<br />
In LDoN, with around 65% uptime I still outdamage fairly handily a warrior in guild who uses a mixture of boc/gbos &amp; GSo4w during adventures, but I am pretty sure if he used 2h full time and our uptime as much higher his DPS would be higher - and I have ft 15/mc3 + all the goodies.<br />
<br />
Incidentally Torrin, while I like the idea of having a group set up with Enchanter + shaman, in which the enchanter is in charge of always having mobs coming and mezzing on incoming, to keep the uptime higher, don't you think your DPS is much higher by lowering your uptime down to 65% or so, but adding a 700 dps charmed pet?  As I said, we use charm A LOT in groups, but haven't tried chain pulling in hard, and we have beat adventures before in under 40 minutes on hard without any VT gear in group.<br />
<br />
Either way Wandor, don't take what was posted here as an affront to wizards, very few people truly chain pull, and a chain pull enviroment hurts wizards a lot expecially with no horse in LDoN, since it doesn't allow for sitting down since constant unaggro'd mobs are incoming that would rape the wizard upon sitting down, and melee damage spikes up much higher.</div></div><hr />

Who does more damage, druid or wiz ~~<br />
after he posted a 3 hour log of a group of his in HoH where a rogue outdamaged his own 65 wizard with FT 15.<br />
rogues are different. but the common opinion here seems to be that everything &gt; wiz in terms of damage, which simply is not true.<br />
but adding a 700 dps charmed pet?<br />
I parsed an FB elemental pet in BoT at 900 dps (attacked from behind), so in LDoN from behind we would be talking about more like 1,2k ?<br />
<br />
since constant unaggro'd mobs are incoming that would rape the wizard upon sitting down, and melee damage spikes up much higher. every mob gets slowed, that is enough agro for a wiz to sit down. There's no such thing as an &quot;unagrod&quot; mob in pulls, as it would go for the healer first. You simply cant afford having 2 955hitters on your cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things - A mage hasted charmed pet in BoT can do over 900 DPS, however mages charm their pets using Burnout V, Frenzied Burnout and Muzzle of Murdu, on top of dual wield.<br />
<br />
In LDoN, only enchanters can charm on hard, and they are stuck using 68 % haste for their pets instead of 100+ that mages do.  Also keep in mind, each adventure set has one unsnarable mob type that is charmable, and not always can be set to dual wield (in Rujarkan for example - wolfs cannot be made to dual wield, in MM mummies can)<br />
<br />
700 DPS is a fairly conservative estimate, I assume that if you charmed a mummy and gave it a muzzle + FA it could break 1kdps peak, but wouldn't consistently outdamage a flurrying mage pet.<br />
<br />
Second - assuming you are chain pulling, an enchanter might pull a mob either with recant or by mezzing a neighbour.  The next mobs then chase the enchanter into the group, and would switch to attacking the warrior because the warrior is currently engaged in a mob due to attacking aggro, assuming the wizard is sitting down the instant an unaggro'd mob is into camp it would make a beeline for him and wack him once - once the wizard gets up from the hitting the mob would then turn on the warrior, since warrior is attacking a 'friend' of the mob.  This is assuming you aren't slowing exactly on incoming, but even with slow the wizard is likely to get hit a few times if he is sitting as a group of three mobs is pulled while the warrior is fighting another.</div></div><hr />

We had no real puller, but we managed with a paladin and rogue puller.  Group also had mage, ench, necro, and my cleric.  No warrior.  It was quite a challenge to keep the paladin alive, even though he's around 10k hps.<br />
<br />
We got about 100% of an AA, which is approx 2x more exp than I'd get in a normal.  The only problem was that the only loot we got was research pages... no augs, no drops... :(<br />

I really think my time would be better spent doing Elem exp, but I can never find a group there anymore... since everyone is in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still trying to convince more people to do hard adventures with me.  So far I've only done one and it was a total blast.  We had me, bard, shaman, cleric, rogue, wizard and bribed a paladin, ranger, and chanter for buffs before we started.  We had 5 deaths by the time we finished our slaughter mission, including 1 cleric death and we still won with about 5 mins left.  Having a bard for a puller was very nice since the only downtime we had was when someone died or we were on the move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there are a few things you guys are either not aware of or have not considered.<br />
<br />
First of all, the amount of total up time a group has is no where near as high as you think it is. This was discussed countless times over at Graffe's with people claiming 90+% uptime groups that basically never happen. At 70% real uptime, the group has a &quot;fast pull&quot; feel to it, and usually require someone pulling before the current mob dies. The highest up time parse anyone was able to produce where on the order of 80-85% up time and those groups where on an insane pace to keep up with that pull rate. I think if you actually do some parses and calculate your actual uptime, you'll be quite surprised.<br />
<br />
LDoN normal risk adventures are likely to produce the highest up times, and I would guess those will be in the 80-85% range with a high risk adventure doing closer to 60-70% uptime for a very good group. I would be surprised to see any group pull 95% uptime because the most important person in the group wouldn't be able to keep up - the healer. Clerics get less mana regen than any of the INT classes and generally have less mana than INT classes so they generally run out of mana faster.<br />
<br />
Second, sitting is not nearly the problem that some people are making it out to be. On inc everyone is standing anyway, wizards for emergency CC. On multiple pulls I will often snare the pack on inc to keep the warrior from getting worked over by 3+ mobs. This will give the chanter time to get the mess under control without the healer having to blow a wad of mana keeping the tank and puller alive.<br />
<br />
Also, most wizards at this level have well over 6khp and the ones at the top of the game are well over 7khp and pushing 8khp (more than warriors who tanked AoW) plus most will generally have CA/CS and LR/IR so getting agro for a couple of rounds is not a big deal. It's actually better for the wizard to nuke an add to get it off the MT/healer/mezzer so that it can be controlled easier. With a heal over time I can last long enough for the chanter to cast mezz a couple of times in case the first gets resisted. Of course if there is enough room to move around a little, a wizard kiting adds can last as long as necessary to get them under control. If your group is smart you are pulling to the larger rooms anyway so there is generally enough room to kite snareable pretty easily.<br />
<br />
Of course all of these things hurt wizard total damage, but they improve overall group efficiency which is more important. In a fast pull group that only gets 1 or 2 mobs at a time so I don't have to do anything but nuke, pulling down 300-400k damage an hour is not a problem.<br />
<br />
You know what single factor will bring down total damage across the board more than anything else? A hasted, charmed pet. When you have one of these beasts going most of the damage it makes the rest of the group looks like they are slacking majorly. It hard to compete with a pet that's belting out over 700dps.</div></div><hr />

We did time tt last nit with 10 wizards, each was in a group of 5 + bard chaining sos on her.  The highest wizard was 216 dps over a 3 minute fight, which is marginally better than what i do with blade of war not tanking, and he used no concussion, straight chaining the whole time.  If you look at a slaughter of 56 mobs on average and assume they have 25k hps as listed above, you needto deal 1,400,000 damage total to win your adventure.  Now compare that to the 262665 number listed above, and it really is jack shit.  Again assume your cleric and ench is doing negligible dps, so your warrior + 2 others need to deal on average 379,112 dmg each, or 44% more than your so called dps wizard.</div></div><hr />

No, not combined.  I don't remember the total damage numbers.  HOwever, I was tanking and self hasted with monk epic.  I still out damaged those three wizards.  One was within 5%.

I am not saing casters are bad dps for extended periods.  But they can't keep up with melee.  NOR SHOULD THEY.  I do know some things about playing a wizard.

I doesn't matter what their total damage was over time, those Wizards will smoke you on demand. Secondly, because you don't have 100% efficiency in exp groups (nobody does) you cannot really accurately parse a wizards damage as you do - other factors come into play. Thirdly, you have some really lazy fucking wizards. Fourthly, I assume you were doing a normal run with that group, in which case you should have been AEing, in which case, you wouldn't have come anywhere near the DPS of any of those wizards, even the 2 afk guys. Fifthly, you were tanking - nuff said. <br />
<br />
Logs like yours are akin to saying you grouped with 3 rogues and only 1 of them wasn't AFK 50% of the time and the one that wasn't AFK was only backstabbing 50% of the time. They're anecdotal. Of course, I suppose finding a wizard that isn't a lazy sack of good for nothing on experience grinds and knows what they are doing is also pure anecdote.<br />
<br />
What it all comes down to is who you're playing with... If you play with jackasses, the results will be jackasstic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what you're basing your times on but for me this is typical:<br />
<br />
Bard or chanter chain pulls and keeps mobs mezzed in camp at all times until we move.  Average number of mobs killed before we move = about 10.  Time taken to kill those 10 mobs (2-3 pulls)= about 10-13 mins.  Downtime so far = 0 seconds.  Now we move up to where the chanter or bard has the next set of mobs mezzed.  Time taken to move = about 5 seconds.  Repeat 6 times.  Total time = 6x(10-13mins + 5 seconds) = between 60.5 mins and 78.5 mins.  0.5/60.5 = 0.8% downtime.  0.5/78.5=0.6% downtime.  So unless someone dies, typical uptime is about 99%.  On normal missions it's a bit lower because you kill faster so your total time is more like 30 mins instead of 60-80 mins.  So for normal missions uptime = about 98%.</div></div><hr />

If you want high combat time, just run together as a group since everyone has to move eventually anyway, it doesn't make a difference if you move when the mobs aren't here or when the mobs are still there, but that way you never lose any time to pulling (your pulling time is the time you would've needed to traverse through the dungeon), but of course this can be rather dangerous on Hard.<br />
<br />
All charmed pets in LDoN can dual wield.  I saw a Slave Slayer crush and pierce at the same time.  It just doesn't look like they can since they have no weapon graphics.  I think the beholders in Guk are the only one that have weapon wielding graphics out of the pets (the weapons are on the tentacles, hard to see though).  <br />
<br />
Wizards don't do a lot of damage normally in LDoN because I think they want to keep their mana up high for emergencies.  Even if you have unlimited aggro to work with right off the bat, it just doesn't make sense for a wizard to nuke himself OOM in the first 10 minutes.  Or they could be lazy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've started to do some hard missions now with the patch, but most of my time's been on normal.  I'll try to do some additionals parse of caster when some join us.<br />
<br />
Normal missions are a moot point now.  With most maps out, if you take an assassination and choose the right path, any of those mission can be done in 30 mins and you have to wait for refresh.  They are so easy now that I will allow myself to slack a bit (loot some mobs) and look around for a sec or 2 since it really doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
But anyway, as the warrior charger (pulling is outdated imo) I can guarantee you my uptime was pretty close to 100%.  Let's say 95%, 90% at the very, very minimum when we have to move around and choose wrong paths, but like I said happening less and less.  Still speaking about normal missions, I generally don't let enchanter  mez unless we have more then 3 mobs.  It's a waste of mana that they should be using nuking or controlling a pet for add tank, etc.  They can slow mobs sure, this will help the cleric.  The 60+ dmg shield on multiples pulls should make up for the lesser cleric dps and keeping multiple mobs up will make the rain and dot alot more efficient, which basically help everyone.  The best I can see is a bard ae slowing with a 100+ dmg shield on melees.  Over that you have pure ae group but I personnaly find them retarded and hate them (hurray for the 45 min restart timer).<br />
<br />
Now, even thought normal are trivial, this is what class balance are about in eq.  A ranger off tanking with a wizard using rain and a necro doting multiple mobs, a cleric using groups heals and proc hammer, etc.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, kinda rambling there but on to hard missions.<br />
<br />
Of course overall downtime will be greater then on normal which will hurt melee, benefit casters.  You really have an enchanter pull?  How about having the enchanter charm a mob for 700dps and some camp mezzing?  Even on hard we charge 90% of the mobs.  Pulling, like someone said earlier, is only time that could be avoided by charging since everyone has to move soon anyway.<br />
<br />
I think on page 2 there is parse for 262k dmg over something like 1 hour? I'm supposed to be impressed? That's like 73dps.  At 400k over 1 hour we are starting to talk, that's 111 total dps.  When I'm doing a normal mission with standard buffs, I will pull out 140 dps while fighting * 90% of uptime for something like 125dps, 110-115 dps very minimum, not counting dmg shields that need tanks to work correctly.  Did I miss something on those parses?  <br />

STOP right here, you are comparing his HARD adventure damage with your NORMAL adventure. on normal, as Furor said, wizards should be using heavy AEs and blow away everything else.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, I call bullshit. There is no way in hell you have a 98% uptime group, even for a short burst like a 1 hour mission. Let me also quantify that - normal missions don't count. Normal missions are bullshit. I can tank a normal mission. I have done normal missions with all casters. If you want to compare damage in a normal mission, lets talk AE. No melee class even stands a chance. The thread is about high risk level missions, I don't care about how fast you can pull a normal risk mission any more than I care about how fast you can pull Velk spiders or Seb frogs.<br />
<br />
Now compare that to the 262665 number listed above, and it really is jack shit. Again assume your cleric and ench is doing negligible dps, so your warrior + 2 others need to deal on average 379,112 dmg each, or 44% more than your so called dps wizard.Read it again. Charmed+hasted pet accounted for the vast majority of the damage. When you get down to it, the enchanter accounted for bare minimum 30% of the damage. That leaves a whopping 52% of the damage to split up between a warrior, a rogue, a mage, and an overhasted mage pet. Again, we are not concerned with DPS because that is not an accurate measurement of who did how much damage. Total damage over the same period of time is all that matters. If I do 500dps, but only 10k damage and the warriors does 100dps but 300k total damage, who is the better damage dealer? Forget about DPS, it's irrelevant.<br />
<br />
We did time tt last nit with 10 wizards, each was in a group of 5 + bard chaining sos on her. The highest wizard was 216 dps over a 3 minute fight, which is marginally better than what i do with blade of war not tanking, and he used no concussion, straight chaining the whole time. Bullshit again. First of all, you can't chain SoS. You would die about the time you cast the 4th or 5th one. But even if you could, on a single bar of mana with raid mana regen a typical time wizard can cast somewhere around 8 SoS per minute and not go oom in 3 minutes. At that pace of chaining SoS for 3 minutes with an average hit of 4000 damage (20% crits, 30% focus, 20% bard focus) you would crank out 96000 damage in 3 minutes, or about 533 DPS. That is of course not possible due to agro considerations, but 350dps on a time god is not all that hard to do, more if you can concussion pants.<br />
<br />
I do have to agree with Brodda and Timmok, wizards are about as easy as it gets to box. While you probably can't do quite as much damage as single boxing, you can certainly come pretty close, much more so than just about any other class.<br />
<br />
Wizards don't do a lot of damage normally in LDoN because I think they want to keep their mana up high for emergencies. Even if you have unlimited aggro to work with right off the bat, it just doesn't make sense for a wizard to nuke himself OOM in the first 10 minutes. Or they could be lazy. Any wizard not pulling their weight in an LDoN Mission - is exactly as you called it - LAZY. Of course it would be lame to not manage mana, but there is no excuse for needing &quot;emergency mana&quot;. Any wizard with half a brain has the AA skill Exodus - instant cast mana free evac to zone in. As long as Exodus is up, you get a get out of wipe free card so mana conservation for emergencies is lame. In any case, as long as you have more than 10-15% mana that is plenty for some nukes, some snares/roots, or even a conventional evac if the situation is that bad. You can't exactly &quot;burn down&quot; a 25k mob, particularly without getting agro so always having a lot of mana is a waste.<br />
<br />
but of course this can be rather dangerous on Hard. Exactly. No one charges a room full of mobs in high difficulty. You might get lucky once or twice, but having 4 or 5 900 hitters in camp at one time is going to get someone killed sooner than later.<br />
<br />
I think on page 2 there is parse for 262k dmg over something like 1 hour? I'm supposed to be impressed? That's like 73dps. At 400k over 1 hour we are starting to talk, that's 111 total dps. When I'm doing a normal mission with standard buffs, I will pull out 140 dps while fighting * 90% of uptime for something like 125dps, 110-115 dps very minimum, not counting dmg shields that need tanks to work correctly. Did I miss something on those parses? Yeah, DPS doesn't matter because no one was doing damage 100% of the time. Not only that, but a hasted pet did a lot of the damage, further taking the potential total damage of the rest of the group members down from what they needed to put out to complete the mission.<br />
<br />
If you do the math, taking in to account a hasted pet, I would guess enchanter+pet did around 425k damage, the mage+pet did 225k, the warrior around 200-210, and the rogue around 280-300k. The rogue I am sure outdamage me, but then he wasn't on snare duty.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to see the actual log - post it if you got it. Parse DPS for each individual mob and see who comes out on top 1 by 1. See where the wizard lost efficiency and why. I'd like to see just how much that uber wizard is having to hold back because of lack of aggro control. Where was his mana hovering most of the fight? My money is he never went below 40-50%. Was he having to do something else in the fights like CC or snare duty?<br />
<br />
And your normal log results just look gimp, like you're playing in a pickup group or something.</div></div><hr />

I find that this is the biggest problem I have. I usually have to lead off with a couple of Draughts to give the tank some time to get good agro before I can unload with SoS if they do not have top notch agro weapons (BoW+yak pwns). This might be part of why you are seeing lower damage totals, I tend to be picky about who I group with, nothing sucks worse than having 80% mana an entire adventure because the tank can't hold agro.<br />
<br />
105507 wizThat's flat embarassing. I had a 7 minute log where I did 120k damage helping out a Time tier 1 trial that was running behind. Even in a short adventure there would be enough time to med to full and dish out another 120k as long as there are enough mobs to nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the feeling most wizards are more like at 80-90% on most LDoN missions, at least from my adventures.  The only time they actually step up the DPS is if you somehow fall behind.  <br />
<br />
Even with Warrior aggro being inadequate for Hard LDoN, I don't think it's that hard to use up your mana over say 60 minutes.  A lot of time when the mob's on the Enchanter and I can't get it off, I sure hope the Wizard would drop a SoS because the worst that can happen is that it's still on the Enchanter, but at least now it's going to be dead sooner.  Mob on Wizard is certainly better than mob on Enchanter.<br />
<br />
But the whole DPS issue is kind of moot if you have at least one charmable class anyway.  With normal pets doing 400 DPS and hard pets much, much more, I'd say the pet is doing close to 50% of the group's damage to significantly more.  Yes on paper the DPS of your group ought to be more than 400 but when you factor that the pet will never miss a round from any distance/targetting issues, you can pretty much consider the pet to have 100% uptime (provided the charming class is paying attention, of course).</div></div><hr />

I just did 2 normal tonight, the wizard was  sucking kinda, talking on the phone and not being 100%.  You can call that anecdotale, but he still, was never at 100% mana and nuking every fight, just not tring to be the most efficient.<br />

-Warrior (me) : 245k<br />
-The mage is so low even with pet I wont put him here.<br />
-The rogue did 228k in less time thought.  note that Im missing some dmg because they were oor from time to time, feel free to add 10%.<br />
-Wizard did 120k (somewhat sucking).  Time gear and all.<br />
-The uber monk did 285k.  <br />
<br />
According to the wizard he was never fm but hanging pretty high.  Even if you DOUBLE is dmg output he still come out below the monk.  It's not going to happen.<br />

VERY anecdotal, did he sit whenever possible, did he click harvests when they popped? There'S a HUGE difference between focusing on your job as a wizard and &quot;never being FM&quot;<br />

That parse was at maximum efficiency on my part, using the most mana efficient nukes with all the buffs, max ft, every AA and 2 ft over cap, harvests when they pop etc. you know the drill, and I ended up oom on boss in both cases. I also had zero aggro issue with little to no resist due to malos.<br />
<br />
It's just not going to happen in hard adventures, a wizard may come out even, with a bard doing chorus on his ass at all times and quarm shawl but even that's not very likely. Then again like it was mentioned above a wizard will burn shit when needed as well as provide some cc and evacs but that's beside the point here.<br />

<br />
Feels good to be remembered.  That particular parse (about 10 months ago) was at least 93% uptime.  Fighting in HoH with NO elemental gear.  In fact the tank (also me) had ZERO luclin gear, and the cleric was a twink, with a zone as large as HoH.  So don't tell me 93% isn't easy to do.  I still have it if anyone really wants it.<br />
<br />
Wizards go oom over longer periods of time and their damage slows way down.  I know its hard for some of you to believe, but mana is not infinate.<br />
<br />
Brodda's numbers are typical.<br />
<br />
Btw, I parsed a rogue doing 100k in 5 minutes time last night.  And that dps doesn't end when the blue bar hits 0.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wizard dps sucks on long missions. They go oom and thier dps plummets. Melee dps is the way to go.This is what sparked the debate, which is a very different statement. So far, the only thing parses anyone has done (with the exception of Thorbadin's lazy wizard) have shown quite the opposite. Brodda's parses, while surprisingly showing unreal monk damage, still show a considerable amount of damage being done by the wizard.<br />

I still have it if anyone really wants it.I remember your parse, and while it is an interesting point of discussion, this isn't your typical elem or high difficulty LDoN group. The fact that at the wiz/war/cleric are under geared in the parse would also lead to artificially high uptime due to poor DPS. If you really try, you can get really high uptime like that, but I still maintain that just about any typical elem exp group or LDoN high risk adventure are going to have considerably lower uptime. I would like to look at Brodda's parses and see what kind of uptime his groups had.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see Thorbadin parse and see what the big difference is. His warrior and monk damage seem to be what most people would expect, but the mage and wizard are pathetic. There is no excuse particularly for the mage, who can crank out DPS without even having to cast a spell once he buffs his pet.<br />
<br />
Can you post a magelo Brodda? Frankly, I am a bit surprised at how high your damage is. That type of damage would indicate that monks are very capable of rogue-like damage over time and certainly would help justify a monks tanking ability if they indeed are doing that much damage.</div></div><hr />

Someone stated earlier that the hard pets were doing around 600dps, or 30% the groups dps, and im pretty sure they blow that out of the water.. MM/guk/ruj/tak pets can all quad 900-990s, at a very high rate after haste, my guild is time equiped and have done hard ldon runs a good bit, vdd pal/war, dod/ifer rogue, some dots from time equiped necro, and we constantly have the enc charmed pet killing off mobs on double pulls before all 4 of us take down the other.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandor, it totally depends on how subtle your definition of 'pulling your weight' is.<br />
<br />
I think Torrin's point is that in a prolonged experience group, a caster unable to use a horse will start to quickly fall behind a similary geared melee.  The wizard DPS doesn't 'alltogether' suck, but it doesn't average out be anywhere near that of a totally decked out pure melee class.<br />
<br />
I think the difference is that while I am a firm believer in chain pulling and having 90+% uptime, it is usually far too stressing to sustain that when doing LDoN hard missions due to average gear/HP being much lower than Torrin's regular groupmates.<br />
<br />
To borrow a few formula's from high school physics, a wizard's DPS somewhat simplisticly might look like:<br />
<br />
(Mana_pool) * Mana_damage_conversion_rate + mana_regen * mana_damage_conversion_rate * time<br />
<br />
Where as a warrior might look something like weaponDPS * time * uptime <br />
<br />
The point is, that assuming the warrior weaponDPS * uptime is greater than mana_regen * mana_damage_conversion_rate the warrior will eventually overtake the wizard.  Keep in mind as well that a wizard is only hurt by conditions of higher uptime unless he is able to use a horse, due to lower ability to sit down, thus lowered meditation - and I realize this is a simplification but it serves to illustrate the point.<br />
<br />
I think Torrin's choice of words was somewhat controversial, but his point is sound and very important - just most people don't try to reach the % uptime necessary to have melees overtake casters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that Brodda Thep group, 80% of the monk dmg = <br />
314963.2 (1) and 441402.4 (2).  If you compare to the paladin that feel's &quot;somewhat&quot; right.<br />
<br />
Note that in the 2nd parse, a WARRIOR would have outdmg the wizard.  Also note this is note the I'm afk talking on the phone wizard according to his own post.  <br />
<br />
Ok wizard can snare and evac, thats cool.  But you also realise that the warrior/paladin did this kind of dps tanking mobs? An ability infinitly better then evac/snare (albeit different)?<br />
<br />
Again, with the 45 min timer the problem is moot on normal, and the fact  with hard you really want a charmed pet also make make the dps issue somewhat moot for actual gameplay.<br />
<br />
I will still group anyone but it's nice to know that melee now own in those adventures.  I will also try to get more numbers and I encourage others to do so.

Well, I had all the formulas written out but short of it is 87.5% for the first run and 89.5% for the second, which is lower than I posted earlier.  YOu can check this by parsing the log yourself.  But please ignore the last four fights of the second run because we were escorting the rescuee out and had to kill a few stragler mobs.   Even if you count those we still have 85% uptime.<br />

Sure, you could get a 750dps pet with a dual wielding hasted pet.  But no one is going to do that.  Because if you pull three just as a pet breaks you can kiss your ass good bye.  Hell, pull two just as that pet breaks and say good bye.  No mobs NORMALLY dual wield in hard adventures except some named.  You can check my first adventure from the log.  We had a A scion crypt creeper or something like that charmed for nearly the entire duration.  I think it was our second mob in.  It did about 260dps.  This still makes an enchanter the most valuable player in any group, but it isn't needed.  We went through nearly the entire second adventure without charm and it only took 10 more minutes or so.<br />
<br />
People overestimate charmed pet dps far too much.<br />

I will still group anyone but it's nice to know that melee now own in those adventures. I will also try to get more numbers and I encourage others to do so. Btw if anyone can give me a quick way to remove all guild chat from a parse that will make my life easier and I'll post some compresses parse of my adventures.<br />
Casters still bring plenty to the plate.  With fast evacs, snares, roots, fast damage.  Whatever you need.  They don't need to be doing more sustained damage than a melee.   And a mage could probably do near my DPS sustained.  A necro might have trouble due to low fight times, but they also bring a hell of a lot to the plate in undead environs and elsewhere.  And of course enchanters are just grade A with charmed dps and superior crowd control.</div></div><hr />

[B]Well I tried to attach my log but it got ate.  So...  Just going to post some replies then try another reply with the attached log by iteself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I had all the formulas written out but short of it is 87.5% for the first run and 89.5% for the second, which is lower than I posted earlier.  YOu can check this by parsing the log yourself.  But please ignore the last four fights of the second run because we were escorting the rescuee out and had to kill a few stragler mobs.   Even if you count those we still have 85% uptime.<br />
<br />
<br />
HAHA.  If you think I do damage go find a rogue wielding a jagged time blade.  You will cry.<br />
<br />
No, you do in fact do some pretty disgusting damage. I am apparently a little out of touch with monk DPS these days as I haven't cared to parse one in a long time. I also can't check your logs atm since I'm at work, what was the total duration of the logs, respectively?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, you could get a 750dps pet with a dual wielding hasted pet.  But no one is going to do that.  Because if you pull three just as a pet breaks you can kiss your ass good bye.  Hell, pull two just as that pet breaks and say good bye.  No mobs NORMALLY dual wield in hard adventures except some named.  You can check my first adventure from the log.  We had a A scion crypt creeper or something like that charmed for nearly the entire duration.  I think it was our second mob in.  It did about 260dps.  This still makes an enchanter the most valuable player in any group, but it isn't needed.  We went through nearly the entire second adventure without charm and it only took 10 more minutes or so.<br />
<br />
People overestimate charmed pet dps far too much.<br />
<br />
Fraid not man, you are underestimating a charmed pet. Without a charmed pet all of my hard missions double in time, automatically. Multi-mob pulls are really only a problem in Guk as you can actually get a train and sometimes running space is limited so you can get creamed trying to do some CC. Adding a charmed pet on hard is like doubling your group size. I've never done a 15-20 minute hard mission without a charmed pet, don't even know if it would be possible without one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No.  This is undead.  A warrior is unlikely to do more damage than a paladin.<br />

Are you really telling me that by bringing a wizard I'm bringing sub par dps for a &quot;dps class&quot; and I get mana intensive snares and evac?  Are you fucking kidding me? If I was a wizard atm I would start to cry reading this and comfort myself that at least &quot;I&quot; am usefull on raid.<br />

Snare is not a super ability.  ANYONE can snare/root, whatever.  For evac, well it's a cool thing to have, druids like mentionned earlier will do it and provide much more needed habilities and I personnaly will go to any adventures hard or whatever without any evaccer without raising the issue.  <br />

I don't want to turn that into wizards suck, but when I'm picking up a &quot;Dps class&quot; I want a class that will fucking outdmg the MT of the group thanks.<br />

As for charmed pets, i do love to get them in groups, if you have a good enc, and pref a good stunner(good paly), most of the best hard ldon fast runs we do use those 2. You say overestimate, i say underestimate, with charmed pets you dont have to make totally normal groups. We did a hard guk, and went war/war/enc/shaman/+2 clerics. and still won in around 35-40 minutes.. we basicly double tanked all, shaman slowed, 1 cleric was mainly on heal, 2nd cleric was (main job) charmed pet stun(hehe), and patch heal's. Group actully did quite well, charmed pets give you alot more choices to work with when making a group. As in the log above, we decided not to go charmed pet, our dps was great with those 4 melee, and no stun(cleric was on heals of course), so felt that was a better time not to charm~</div></div><hr />

<br />
First adventure was 43:11.  My fight time was 37:45.  My dps was 174dps during that time for a total of 393704.  This was with a charmed pet for the entire duration.  42 mobs were killed in that time.<br />
<br />
Second adventure was 59:51.  My fight time was 51:55.  My dps was 177 for a total of 551753.  40 mobs were killed in that time.<br />

Check the log.  In the first adventure are charmed pet did 500k.  Perhaps more, but since some of the 550k damage posted for that mob type likely came from actual enemies I am going with 500k.  So a whole 25% more dps than me.  Woopty-fucking-do.  It probably could have been quite a bit more.  As it was doing a good 50% more dps than me.  (me at 180 it at 270dps).  But with us moving a lot and the enchanter sometimes forgetting to send it into the fight while mezzes were done, or when charm drops the total damage goes down.  Now, you could give that charmed pet weapons, you could haste that pet.  But you better have a touchy wizard or druid to get your ass out of their fast, or you may be looking at a CR.  There is very little justification to haste the pet when it is easy to finish a hard adventure inside of 45 min just with regular charmed mob and no worries about wiping.  <br />
<br />
EDIT: Btw I just read your response on Monkley Business. The warrior you used on your first set of parses was a complete gimp apparently, way to qualify your posts. At least put up a disclaimer stating that &quot;This warrior was someone's twink and has 32 AA points,&quot; so those reading can have a more firm understanding of what exactly is going on.<br />
Well, the parses I had were to show wizard compared to monk dps.  The guy is well equipped.  It is just that he is working on his offensive AAs since he got back not too long ago.  He is a 10k warrior though.  (or maybe shy 50hp.  I can't remember if he is 50hp over 10k or under.)<br />
<br />
How about this then? A warrior attacking from the back would have outdmg a wizard, the supposed king of dps?<br />
Yes, I think that is warranted.  Wizards are a walking group in the planes.  Go snare a mob and nuke it down.  Do you really think casting classes should outclass all melees in every area of the game?  Caster dominance is just getting nuts.  And I fear tha tif you looked at preelemental caster and melee dps you would likely find that the melee are outclassed at this level of the game too.  Casters typically gain much more from an expansion earlier on than melee due to spells.  I bet casual beasts, mages, necros would easily sustain more dps than casual monks, rogues, or warriors.  <br />
<br />
Casters have a lot more flexibility.  They take less upkeep and can sustain their dps.  I log off my monk to play a wizard during quarm.  Simply because I can do far more damage with the wizard than the monk while dodging each quarm AE.    And yes, I know there are different ways of doing quarm.  The point is that casters are more flexible.  If a caster gets a mob on them, they can run around in circles while the mob chases them and still gain mana to do more damage.  If a melee did the same his total damage would plummet.  <br />
<br />
You know what?  You want to see caster damage?  Get a necro to mindwrack.  You will never have caster mana problems and they can go insane.  Get a bard instead of an enchanter.  Get a SK instead of a pally.  Your mana rate will go through the roof.  Grab a beast for paragon instead of a shaman.  The wizard dps would easily go up 25% just because of the higher mana regen.  That is what is so nice about ccasters.  They are flexible.  Melee are not.</div></div><hr />

For a reality check:<br />
<br />
The first rogue sustained a mere 176 DPS, you pulled off 130 DPS, and the second rogue sustained 124 DPS. Let me try and piece this together to explain what really happened during your run.<br />
<br />
The second rogue woke up 20 mobs into the mission and started running to catch up to your group, he forgot to SoS (because he is a lazy gimp) and made a wrong turn and got creamed, which in turn required the other rogue to stop what he was doing to go and drag his sorry afk ass back to your group where the cleric spent the next 10 minutes asking the dead rogue to 'wake the fuck up and take the res.' Which explains the first rogues piss poor DPS.<br />
<br />
That accurate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you expect them to do 270dps while moving around and not having a mob there 100% of the time? i mean damn its not like theres a mob siting in front of them that they can just beat on forever.(no we didn't pull that fast)</div></div><hr />

Heh, dude, the second rogue with a DoD in MAIN did 124 DPS. Do you understand how that is basically impossible unless he didn't press his backstab button, ever - even THEN, he would/should still break 124 dps.<br />
<br />
The first rogue should be clearing 200 dps with EASE.<br />
<br />
I played a rogue for years, I have a fairly good understanding of what it takes to play the class, I can also tell when they are totally slacking.<br />

<br />
It seem that's it's not the case.  I'm fine with that, I play a melee and it's often good to know that melee are not gimps.  You are right in saying that some casters can go in plane of fire and quad some mobs for insane aa's.  But that's the last expantion, I personnaly don't care about that anymore.<br />

This expantion is about ldon dungeons.  And again I will thank sony for the 45 min minimum, if not for that argument like this would degenerate in insane amount of min-maxing hurting everyone and the 45 min is a barrier to keep this from being too gross.<br />
<br />
Maybe Furor will bring a parse where a wizard outdmg everyone in his group but the point remain that for &quot;any&quot; caster it won't be easy to achieve that.<br />

That's good and all, but this also apply to melee to some extent.  Necro can do atk taps and group lifetaps.  They will also benefit greatly from tanking 2 mobs in camp, which require at least 2 melees (or a pet sometime).  Beastlord can paragon, but paragon help every classes with mana including priests/hybrids and beastlord can cast ferocity on melees, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Who gain more in the long run? Depend but the equation is not as simple as bring x class to the party.<br />
<br />
If casters/wizards aren't performing in your &quot;typical&quot; group for hard or normal where melee are indeed performing in those groups, then caster are not performing in the &quot;real&quot; eq worlds, the worlds that player feel in day to day.<br />

If wizards where the top damage dealers over the long term, then there would be some serious balance issues and everyone would be screaming for a nerf. No one claimed that wizards are the best long term damage dealers, because they are not. Due to mana restrictions, no matter how much mana regen you can get, melees will eventually catch up and pass casters. The point is, that in the real game situations, that point in time usually takes longer than a typical LDoN adventure.<br />
<br />
The shorter the adventure, the less likely the melee are to pass the casters. If adventures lasted 2 hours or longer, you would start to see a much larger difference.<br />
<br />
I think Furor pretty much summed it up the best:<br />
I think the one thing this thread proves is that there are a hell of a lot of lazy fucking players in this world, and they aren't solely confined to the wizard class.<br />
<br />
Also, when you proclaim a class is &quot;king of DPS&quot; you have to quantify what you mean by that statement. If you mean doing the most amount of damage to an end game mob, then yeah, wizards are tops. If you mean doing the most total damage in an 100% uptime exp group for 4 hours, then my money is on the rogues. &quot;King of DPS&quot; is much to broad of a statement for any one class to always the winner, plus if there was only 1 true king of damage, that class would be far too powerful.</div></div><hr />

You need to use a detachable internet penis like I do... then when you check your numbers at the end of a day and see you're averaging 102 dps, you won't cry yourself to sleep. Also for raids the rule of thumb in my guild is that when reporting raid DPS, Furor's DPS is top total damage + 200k, give or take 100k. Everyone else lags way behind. It helps me silence the voices in my head.</div></div><hr />

&quot;artificialy high uptime?&quot;  Uptime is what you WANT.  The group had a monk and a rogue for god's sake.  Mobs died fast.  The fact that my group could sustain 93%+ uptime with that tank and cleric proves that better equipped groups can do it easier.  Shitty pulling robs melee damage.  Better group play makes wizards a less desired class. (in exp groups)  I outdamage all the wizards I group with using a BoW if the missions go beyond 30-35 mins or so-- as long as the puller doesn't suck.<br />
<br />
The measuring stick we should all be using for exp groups is damage per hour with X% combat (up) time, or somthing similar.</div></div><hr />

The measuring stick we should all be using for exp groups is damage per hour with X% combat (up) time, or somthing similar.All you need is total damage per encounter, be it a boss, an exp group, or an LDoN adventure. Uptime is irrelevant because everyone is fighting the same amount of time in the same situation. This works because comparing individuals that are not in the same group can never be an accurate measure becuase no matter how hard you try, the variable will always be different. The comparison always has to be made withing a singular group/raid in order to insure all of the variable are the same so everyone has the same oportunity to do damage.</div></div><hr />

Casters DPS in a fast killing  grp is not as great as casters like to preach and melee like to complain.  Casters DPS does depend a lot on buffs, and if they can use a horse or not. But the question is when you balance the casters against a melee, what numbers do you use, the casters dps from a dungeon or an outside zone.<br />

Uptime is not irrelevant. It is extremely relevant. It has a dramatic impact on melee damage. Who needs a formula. Player01 does X amount of damage, player02 does Y damage. Who ever has the higher number did more damage. Pretty simple really. Uptime is only relevant if you completely disregard kill rate. For the purpose of comparing virtual penises, uptime is very important to melees since uptime = more damage for them. However, in any other situation the most important thing for a group is having the highest possible kill rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Group 1<br />
Takes 120 seconds to kill the mob<br />
Takes 5 seconds to pull a new mob<br />
Uptime is 120 seconds / 125 seconds = 96%<br />
<br />
Group 2<br />
Takes 60 seconds to kill the mob<br />
Takes 20 seconds to pull a new mob<br />
Uptime is 60 seconds / 80 seconds = 75%<br />
<br />
Sure group 1 has a higher uptime but group 2 is the better group.  Group 2 kills a mob every 80 seconds vs group 1 killing a mob every 120 seconds<br />
<br />
Really what you should be looking at isn't UPTIME its &quot;time without a mob in the camp&quot; or &quot;time when melees aren't attacking&quot;.  This time without a mob in the camp is when melees do ZERO dps and casters recharge their DPS MANA bar for free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uptime = more kills.  You can't get less kills with more uptime.  Uptime is defined as the time your melees are swinging at a mob, as opposed to downtime, where you are not attacking a mob.<br />
<br />
Since you were too lazy to read Phantron's reply like I told you, I'll quote it:<br />
<br />
You cannot possibly do less damage given the same group and a higher uptime. The more often you're actually fighting, the more damage the melee are putting in. Given a long enough period, it doesn't really matter if a caster nukes to OOM in 3 minutes and comes back 5 minutes later when he's FM and repeat or you slowly nuke from full to 0 over the period of an hour. You get the exact same damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uptime = more kills.No, more uptime = melees fighting longer. More kills = more kills. You are assuming that more uptime = 100% efficient, which it does not. Maybe the rogue is afk and not there to hit the BS button. Maybe the caster that went oom in 3 minutes was FM for 2 minutes before he started nuking again. Just because your group has a mob it's fighting doesn't mean you are operating at 100% efficiency. You also have to consider the amount of time spent maintaining the higher uptime. If your puller spends enough time pulling, you could end up with a slower kill rate due to the loss in damage. There are dozens of variables that can affect your kill rate and your uptime.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way. A good AE group has uptime on the order of say 20% at best. Yet that group can kill more mobs in an hour than the best group ever that always has multiple mobs mezzed in camp and 100% uptime. The number of mobs you kill in the same period of time is all that matters. That is just one simple way a lower uptime group can have a faster kill rate.<br />
<br />
In a perfect world where everyone plays at 100% efficiency all the time, then more uptime would mean more kills, but there are so many factors that can change a groups efficiency that you can't use uptime as a measure of group efficiency, you have to use kill rate.<br />
<br />
Sulvar summed it up best, read his post again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two sources for losing DPS to maintain high uptime.  First, the puller might need to be out pulling so often that you're basically losing his DPS to have high uptime.  This is more typical in XP groups.  In LDoN this can be circumvented by just running to mobs as a group instead of pulling them, and due to the pathing in LDoN pulling isn't always very meaningful anyway.<br />
<br />
Second, let's say you have 4 mobs in camp, that'd certainly give you 100% uptime until they're all dead.  However, during this time you need to expand additional mana to keep them under control, whether it's more heals, more mez, or even people dying.  Although on normal you can often simply tank them for a negligible expense of mana, on a Hard mission it is certainly does not make sense to bring more mobs in at once just so you can always be meleeing.  <br />
<br />
But if neither of the two are happening, there's no way more uptime can be less DPS.  The amount of total damage a caster does is fixed for the duration of the adventure assuming it lasts at least long enough for the caster to eventually run out of mana.  Any extra damage your melee can do is extra damage that you didn't have before.  For example suppose we always have one mob in camp at all times.  There is no way this can be less efficient than not having one mob in camp at all times, assuming the cost (i.e. loss of DPS) to maintain the flow of mob is negligible, and it usually is.  It is irrelevent what the wizard is doing in either of those two scenarios.  His total damage still remains the same.  However, the melees in the group will do significantly more damage over the course of the adventure if you always have a mob in camp versus not.<br />
<br />
Even if you want to say your mana doesn't run to 0, more uptime still can't be worse.  As long as you're not fighting so slowly you can med to FM, if a wizard can get in say 500 nukes with 50% uptime, there's no reason why you can't unload at least 500 nukes with 100% uptime.  At worst, you can just space them out exactly the same way you were able to with 50% uptime, and potentially you can nuke more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, more uptime = melees fighting longer <br />
<br />
Melee fighting longer = more kills.<br />
<br />
The lost dps from the puller isn't bad.  Because the alternative is EVERYONE not meleeing, which will always be more lost damage, unless you have ZERO melee (or very close to zero) other than the puller, including pets.  On top of that, we often have non-dps classes pulling.  Having the tank pull should be a last resort.<br />
<br />
Saying an AoE group can kill the same amount of mobs in 20% of the time, and therefore less uptime is better is not an argument.  Those wizards would be putting out enormous amounts of damage compared to the other group.  They get more kills because thier damage is higher, not because of up or downtime.  I have logs of my wizard doing 60k damage in one cast.  That doesn't mean anything.<br />
<br />
If your casters are letting themselves FM, then they suck ass.  You'd have to be WAY below &quot;100% efficient&quot; to let yourself FM after the first few minutess of a mission.  If you want to use extremely poor play as an excuse for class balance, well then go ahead I suppose.<br />
<br />
As for AFK melees, every single melee would have to AFK during the entire extra uptime to make that extra uptime to not be beneficial.  Even then, you wouldn't get less kills.  You would have the same kills.  Making the cleric OOM would just decrease your uptime in the first place.<br />
<br />
And Phant, I agree with everything you've said except for one little thing:<br />
<br />
However, during this time you need to expand additional mana to keep them under control, whether it's more heals, more mez, or even people dying <br />
<br />
If this were to happen, you would be decreasing your uptime in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did a few normal (sue me) last night.  I told everyone I was parsing them and to not suck.  Cleric/Druid + 4 melee on first group.  Thing of note is the druid charmed a wolf in ruj but did very low nuking.  The pet was doing around 160 fighting dps including druid haste buff.  +Some nuking, minimum healing and dmg shield, that's pretty good.  We all know that charmed pet are good thought.<br />
<br />
Second group we had a mage instead of a druid.  Not the most uber mage in term of equipement, but pretty good and I told him specifically that the honor of the casting classes depended on his dps (heh).  So he tried real hard.   Mobs were dying insanely fast and it was very difficult for him to nuke the same mob twice.  We did a 60 assassination in 20 min (1 mob each 20 sec).<br />
<br />
Counting pet/nuke, the mage came out at around the dps of the warrior tanking most of the time (me).  Adding estimate dps from the dmg shield,  it was even, sometime a bit in favor of the mage.  The semi uber rogue always came out higher then my by a decent margin.  The uber monk was highest dmg dealer by a small dmg margin over rogue or about equal depending on the run and the parse.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty confident that an uber rogue would beat an uber monk is term of dps at this point, but I'm not sure exactly what was the monk problems earlier, but one with a Staff of Transometing certainly doesn't suck.<br />
<br />
The mage damage was disapointing.  But I'll try to get more parse to confirm that and with other persons.  Note that I'm also not the super uber warrior.  I'm still shy of some vengeance, not all offensive aa max, I'm using a BoW and not a 65/38 vanazir and don't have quarm earing.<br />
<br />
The most interesting thing happening was with the cleric.  Since the first adventure we did he only managed something like 37k, he was pissed.  I think he did 90k the 2nd one and his best run he did 100k.  That's around 10k meleeing (using time rathelike staff with a mana boost proc) and 90k from nuke alone (note : without letting anyone die too, kinda important!).  I think the best dmg dealer on the 100k run was the rogue at 170k.  <br />
Your typical semi decent cleric will probably do around 20-30k max on a normal run.  The conclusion to this at least for normal difficulty is that by far, the best damage gain a group can do is by telling the cleric to stop sucking and to get on with the program.  That mean no ch whenever possible, fast cast heal, divine arb and let everyone regen, and nuke, nuke nuke, etc.<br />

Anyway, continuing on the subject of dmg, I did some raid parsing of phase 4 yesterday.<br />
<br />
Tallon/vallon are kinda hard to parse, but saryn/tt were good ones.  <br />
<br />
Numbers for a mob like tt were like 25k for the melee that suck, 28-31k for the warrior ranger that don't suck.  On a side note I've never seen a ranger not using a bow marginally higher then a warrior, what's up with that? I thought these guys could do dmg?  I'll come back on that.  The so so wizards were around 35-40dmg, some mages nukes only were around 30+ pets.  The high wizards were at around 46-49k, we had 1 uber monk using SoT at 49.8k (without a bard), a rogue at 50k (with a bard) and we had 1 wizard at 59k (no real clue why he was that higher).<br />
<br />
Not all hybrids seem to be going full mana burn on those fights and just keep meleing which would explain some non stellar results.<br />
<br />
This to me keep confirming the uberness of the staff of transcendance.  In fact if wizards aren't trying really hard the monk will nearly always come out #1 atm.<br />

Warriors with good weapons always come out pretty well, just not really out of the pack.<br />

Actually you would need at least 4 mobs for Jyll's to be more efficient in terms of mana per damage.   I believe sony limited the spell levels of PB aoes to make them more resisted.  However LDoN aoe usually will increase melee dps as well, with higher uptime.  Jyll's is a waste of time unless you are pulling mobs by the truck load. On a normal risk mission a smart wiz would be using Pillar of XXX on 3-4 pulls. Much more efficient and way better damage, plus the added advantage that its targeted so you don't have to stand in the pack of mobs to blast them as well as having considerably less agro.<br />

Draughts are for wizards who don't have elemental gloves and SoS.  Draught dps is so pathetic, you could chain draughts and not out dps the higher end dps classes.  Not to mention you spend so much time standing using them that you miss enough meditative ticks to blow the mana efficientcy.<br />
<br />
The numbers may favor pillars, but being able to use them is a whole other matter.  You simply will not be able to use them all the time due to the small radius.  Granted they are the best to use with 3-4 mobs in camp.  Jyll's is better with more.  My groups try to aim for at least 6 mobs when we want to AoE.<br />
<br />
As for parsing TT, I don't like to parse on her due to people switching off her to kill the trash spawns.  Phase 3 bosses, CT, and Bertox are my measuring sticks.  But for exp groups anyway, my monk friend with a Vallon stick and a Quarm hammer pulls around 240-250 dps.  My rogue friend with an Inno poker does 300 consistantly. (with a bard)</div></div><hr />

<br />
btw Wandor, it was Thorbadin who is in Triton :)<br />

anyways, Pillars dont work, radius too small. on so many mobs you might consider Rain spells, huge radius, I always get all 4 hits.</div></div><hr />

Draughts are for wizards who don't have elemental gloves and SoS. Draught dps is so pathetic,When SoS is getting resisted, it doesn't do much for DPS now does it? Draughts are good for a bit over 200DPS with decent focus and they land a lot easier than SoS does. Not to mention, when mobs are dying fast, some times you don't have time to cast SoS. Every wizard with SoS+elem gloves still uses draughts. SoS is clearly the better DPS spell of course, but it has its downsides as well. Not really sure how you consider 200dps pathetic, seems like a lot better than 0 to me.<br />
<br />
A couple other FYI -<br />
Jyll's radius - 25<br />
rains - 25<br />
pillars - 15<br />
<br />
If you are pulling less than 6 mobs at a time, then jyll's is a waste. Rains are ass IMO, 22% built in resists kills efficiency. I can work with the smaller radius, if we are pulling 3-4 at a time, just pick a nice hallway to pull to, problem solved.</div></div><hr />

If your casters are getting resisted that badly, then why would I chose them over melee?  The post that sparked this entire mess of a thread was &quot;get melee over casters.&quot;<br />
<br />
In LDoN missions, and every other exp spot in the game I've ever been in, using SoS (or Agnarr's/Meteor when vs. fire resistant mobs) is always better than draughts.  I know you're not killing mobs in 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Every wizard with SoS+elem gloves still uses draughts. <br />
<br />
Not true.  If I deem a mob too resistant, (which is always a raid mob) I will use lures.  I'm not the only wizard who does, either.<br />
<br />
and Trondir, the mana you lose from non-meditative ticks by using the temperate flux staff would blow any additional damage given to you from -6 resist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway in a raid situation you'll almost never beat a Wizard.  I can post the hundreds of parses I've done if you'd like, but it's always been Wizards, Rogues, Monks, Mages, Rangers top to bottom pretty much.  Keep in mind our Wizards almost never use a Bard either.  It's my opinion that a Bard is better spent with melee because that overhaste will do more for than then the extra damage to our nukes will do for us.<br />
<br />
In LDoN situations you'll be hard-pressed to outdamage a Wizard in normal difficulty.  That parse you posted is just plain sad and an embarassment to my class, Thorb. :p  I don't know who that was but I'd wager he was busy doing some non-game related things because there is no way he was trying or even partially trying and ended up that low. ;)  In normal missions with only C5 on it's very rare I find myself medding.  95% uptime, even on normal, is a pipedream.<br />
<br />
In hard missions I'll bet pure DPS melee will outdamage a Wizard quite easily provided that group doesn't have a Bard.  If the group does have a Bard though it's a whole new ball game.  Not sure how many hard missions you've done, but I would wager that most hard groups don't have even 70% uptime because of the fact that you can't pull 3+ mobs.<br />
<br />
Mind you, a NToV / VT-level Wizard will probably be pushed from top a lot.  An Elemental / Time-level Wizard has no excuse though.<br />
<br />
So yeah, a good Wizard doesn't suck in normal or hard adventures.  A good Wizard also offers much more than simply DPS to a group (for example, I've basically never had a mob gate or CH itself or another mob in my groups... and I stun, among other things), you need to remember that too.<br />
<br />
Edit: BTW, I use primarily draughts as my nuke of choice, but I also cast stuns, SoS, IM, and make good use of rains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no such thing as an &quot;instant cast&quot; in everquest.  The latency to your client machine prevents you from spaming any instant cast more than a certain amount of clicks over time.  On top of that, add some more delay from the time you client allows you to cast a spell from the time you actually hit the button.  The problem gets worse if you stand up soely to use your stick, then sit back down instead of using it before a cast.  Its a small amount of time, but -6 is a small amount of resist adjust.<br />
<br />
&quot;seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some wizard do a parse of a 45 minute high risk slaughter with a bard and prove to me that you can outdamage a time dagger rogue that isn't playing like shit, using draughts.  I'd love to see that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure you could add at least 25% to that mage dmg, I'll try to have another good one.  This would put mage in a much better dps position.  Would they outdmg the famous super monk or the uber rogue?  My take is no at this point (the mages in question disagree), but would probably be close.  I'll try to get a parse of that.<br />
<br />
As for our wizards, our last clearing on the good parses I got show that wizard can indeed outdamage everyone else.  They just need to try harder maybe.  And on TT dps classes aren't on adds, that parse for us is 100% good.<br />

<br />
Some wizard do a parse of a 45 minute high risk slaughter with a bard and prove to me that you can outdamage a time dagger rogue that isn't playing like shit, using draughts. I'd love to see that.I didn't say that now did I? The discussion drifted to the value of innate wizard resist check bonuses as compared to other caster classes. In that discussion you can't ignore the use of draughts, which still get heavy use by all wizard due to their huge resist bonus. There is also a place to use lures - PoEb comes to mind - and again, while SoS is the far superior spell, lures will out DPS every other spell in the game when there are big time resist problems.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the conclusion that has been drawn over and over again, in LDoN hard missions - the ones that elem+ people are interested in - a wizard is a viable choice for a DPS class when choosing a group. Some monks and some rogues will do more damage in a long adventure, just as wizards will have the advantage on shorter missions.<br />
<br />
And as Furor so eloquently put it, lazy people play all classes and can fuck it up no matter how uber they are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was the first level 60 and 65 wizard on my server.  I am fully aware of wizard resistances, spells, etc.  I would also love for wizards to be the king ding-a-lings of damage, but thats just not what I, and the others who posted parses here, are seeing for exp situations.<br />
<br />
Can one of the top wizards send me, or post a parse of wizard damage on a high risk LDoN mission that even approaches the damage done by my rogue, without necros sitting there feeding them?  I would love to see it.  No sarcasm.<br />
<br />
One of my better parses:<br />
<br />
3112 seconds (51:52)<br />
<br />
warrior:  430,591 damage,  47:28 duration,  151 dps<br />
rogue: 732,377 damage,  40:37 duration,  300 dps<br />
<br />
Inno dagger/solusek poker rogue.  Had a bard.  Had ranger buffs most of the mission.  No beastlord buffs.  Shaman haste.  Bard was puller, so can't guarantee we had rizlona on all the time, but with 300 dps, I know it was close at least.  As you can see, she afked a bit.  I didn't tell her to play her best or say I would post it somewhere.  It was an average mission.<br />
<br />
This rogue also consistantly about ties our wizards in damage on gods as well.  Frankly I don't think it is fair that rogues can do wizard level burst dps all the time with far less aggro, while wizards run into the mana limit.  Not that wizards arn't fantastic on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goladus</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Torrin, if it is the Torrin I think of has been posting a very long time on Graffe, and I remember he made half the wizards on the board shut up after he posted a 3 hour log of a group of his in HoH where a rogue outdamaged his own 65 wizard with FT 15.Yeah and he did it chain pulling with a monk, who managed to be in combat something like 35-45% of the time.  It was a low-geared monk with crap gear so that strategy was best for him.  If it was a well geared monk, that strategy would have been sacrificed a lot of monk damage for the high warrior vs. wizard figure.</div></div><hr />

Mage dps is a kinda screwy thing in xp groups, it will vary from mage to mage depending on the situation the group is in and the choices the mage has made with specialization and aas.<br />
<br />
Also was the magician asked to debuff?  If he was, and didn't have the VT debuff item, malosinia would probably take a good chunk of mana that would have otherwise be spent nuking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just run some numbers if you don't believe me, and about mage damage, it is almost always under estimated because pet procs not being picked up by parsers which for mages acount for at least 15 dps or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw that monk wasn't shit geared.  He had some VT pieces and a cursed fang.  Regardless, the monk could not outdamage a warrior and rogue combined, therefore sacraficing his damage to get a constant uptime can only lead to more kills over time.  He was also pulling from very far away (HoH is a large zone) so the parse showed what could be done with unfavorable pulling conditions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was impressive to be sure, but it most certianly didn't &quot;shut the wizards up&quot; like you claimed.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
To clarify a bit..<br />
<br />
-Higher Uptime increases melee end output, true.<br />
<br />
-But higher uptime also increases mob output correspondingly, increasing maintenance costs.  As mobs do less damage, all support classes will have to spend less mana on support, and will be able to spend more mana dealing damage.<br />
<br />
-On TOP of that, Torrin sacrificed melee damage to increase the melee damage of the other group two members. <br />
<br />
This clearly leads to, at best, diminishing returns as you approach maximum uptime.</div></div><hr />

These numbers puzzle me. If you have the log, can you check how many mobs you killed? <br />
<br />
If I recall correctly it was mentioned somewhere earlier that hard mission mobs have roughly 25k hp. So if we assume you killed 60 mobs in the above mission, then you and the rogue account for 77% of the damage just between the two of you. This seem a very high number, which is why I wonder what the rest of the group was doing?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Torrin, you might find this suprising, but I agree with you. After a multitude of parses, I have come to basically the same conclusion that you have. While wizards CAN do a pretty significant amount of damage in an LDoN mission, melees pull away at an alarming rate. As you have pointed out, due to mana regen restriction, wizards are limited to a set amount of damage in a given period of time, while melees are only restricted by the amount of uptime in the same period. At around the 80-85% uptime mark, monks and rogues will catch and pass wizards, at 90-95% warriors and knights do the same. Now this is not really a problem, because wizards are supposed to be tops in burst damage, but lag behind in damage over time, that's the price we pay for being tied to a mana bar.<br />
<br />
However, as you have also pointed out, rogues are now approaching wizard burst damage even in short god fights, what used to be the exclusive domain of wizards. I am ok with sharing the burst damage crown with rogues as they are basically our melee counterparts, but in return we should have a way to increase our damage over time. Of course this is a discussion for the wizard boards so I'll leave out the details.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The maintenance for high uptime is pretty minimal.  No matter how often you're fighting a mob, the total amount of time you're spent fighting them is still the same.  So mobs do not do more DPS just because you're fighting them more often.  Unless you're doing stuff like pull 4 mobs at once and then call this '100% uptime', there's really not much sacrificed.  For example even though your monk is not doing damage 30% of the time, it's really a minimal DPS loss.  If he stayed and did damage for the other 30% of the time, he'd still have to spend the same amount of time after the mob is dead to fetch the next one.  So, you're expected to miss his DPS for the duration of the pull anyway regardless of when he goes out to make the pull.  Assuming the monk doesn't go so fast that you end up having to mez/offtank an extra before the first one dies, the pulling time cannot be considered a maintenance cost for uptime because the monk needed that much time to pull anyway.  <br />
<br />
Now, one way you can avoid this is if your group always run from mob to mob.  Then you can say that the monk pulling is a cost, because he could've just run together with your group (running time cannot be avoided anyway so might as well use it for pulling).  But this only works on Normal IMO.  Hard is a bit too risky for the group to just charge into a room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the cleric nukes instead of heals: the mob will die sooner than it would have otherwise.  The mob will do less damage so the cleric wouldn't have to spend the mana healing.  This goes for any caster who can choose to do something defensive to prolong the fight (heal, slow, stun) instead of something offensive to shorten the fight(nuke, DoT).  <br />

Now before you guys get all incredulous with &quot;omg nuking cleric&quot; stuff, I'm not saying that high uptime groups won't usually result in better performance, just that you guys are looking at it way too narrowly.  &quot;Maintenence is minimal&quot; is something you can actually get a reasonable number for, if you wanted to, and I don't see those anywhere, all I see are assumptions and damage total comparisons.</div></div><hr />

You are saying shamans and clerics nuking instead of slowing and healing, and pulling slower results in the same or more kills over time?<br />

If my cleric never goes OOM, why should I slow pulls down?</div></div><hr />

Ok, so tell me how priests nuking instead of slowing and healing leads to less &quot;maintenance cost&quot;?<br />
<br />
The only difference between my 95% uptime group and a 50% uptime group is the monk went off to pull before mobs died.  Some people seem to think we pull 6 mobs and kill them rathe-style or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suppose for a moment that you could have a warrior/wizard pair kill 10 mobs in 5 minutes, then would have to rest for 5 minutes to regenerate health and mana.  Or, you could have a warrior cleric pair take 10 minutes to kill those 10 mobs.  The damage you sacrifice replacing the wizard with the cleric is the &quot;maintenance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now in practice, using the healing method will generally wind up being more effecient, but what you're doing is completely ruling it out as a choice entirely.  You're assuming that a cleric is a given, unalterable part of a group and is useful for nothing but healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you are getting at is kill rate Goladus and the unfortunate fact is that melee DPS is scaling up considerably as uptime increases, and the benefits of keeping uptime at 90%+ far outweight the gains of slowing pulls to keep mana up. As long as the theoretical damage cap for casters is considerably lower than the theoretical damage a melee can do in the same period of time, increasing uptime and adding melees will be a better option.</div></div><hr />

How is not healing the tank and letting him die even an option?  You think any tank's regen or self healing abilities are sufficient enough to remove all healers with dps classes to make for a higher kill rate?  I can assure you if this were the case, priest classes would be revolting and switching classes in droves.<br />
<br />
The only possible scenario where higher uptime would be bad is an all-caster group with no pets.  I'd like to see that group beat a hard ldon dungeon faster than a traditional tank/healer/dps group.</div></div><hr />

I'm not exactly disputing this, just disagreeing with the broad conclusions being made on narrow assumptions.  I'm not saying that the gains of 90% uptime don't &quot;far outweigh&quot; the benefits of dumping mana into damage to kill a mob faster.  I'm only asking &quot;how far&quot; do those benefits go?  I guess it's kind of hard to explain since you guys seem to keep assuming that I'm automatically disagreeing with every possible point you're making :\</div></div><hr />

The assumption is that they are directly related...  More damage per hour, less time spent in the mission and more time counting up how much xp/loot/pionts you've gotten Exactly. The higher your DPH is, the faster you can kill, the faster you can get a new adventure. Recovery time is larely irrelevant because you can easily med to full in the time it takes the group leader to gate back to camp, get an adventure, and run back to the zone in.</div></div><hr />

All you're doing now is fuddling with semantics.<br />
<br />
And this is all under the assumption that winning is assured.  When the outcome of the encounter is in question different rules would apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The -10 resist adjust wizards get is nothing <br />
I believe you are slightly uninformed reguarding the resist factors that goes into a wizzys nuking ability.  one of the primary advantages for being a sucky arse wizzy without a burnout 5 pet is this little spell<br />
<br />
Allegiant Familiar  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3264&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
notice the 3rd listed effect<br />
&quot;Increase Effective Casting Level by 9&quot;<br />
<br />
that means at level 65, you are &quot;effectively&quot; nuking as a level 74 player.  I don't remember the specifics, but I believe each &quot;casting level&quot; is translated to around 8 resists?(need to do some digging to see if that is the correct number, but I think it is.  if any PvP server casters/player can confirm this for me that would be great)  <br />
so with a 9 effective casting levels advantage, a wizzy is casting with an INNATE resist adjustment of (9x8=72) or -72 resist check vs the mob you are killing with ANY spell the wizzy is casting on it.  no mage or druid will ever come close to the %dmg landed when it comes to nukes because wizzys give up a great deal of utility/pet dps to gain this advantage.  <br />
<br />
I'm somewhat disappointed that wandor didnt catch this one either, but while it is true that -10 resist adjustment is crap, I certinly would not say the same for a -72 innate adjust in addition to the -10 adjustment on Tears of Marr(which would be my weapon of choice when I play my wizzy in normal)  <br />
<br />
personally, I have a hard time keeping up on mana when I play wizzy, but he's really shitty dressed:p with only FT6 and 320int buffed(/cry)  he just isnt built to be in hard yet:D  anyway, I personally have to go with the melee camp here because personally I think it's really stupid that FT is only capped at 15:( and no horse basiclly means there isnt a snowball's chance in hell that I can sustain 2 SoS on every mob in a group with any kind of decent kill/pull rate going.</div></div><hr />

I suspect they don't work on familiars either, though I certainly could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I fully agree the extra casting levels are an advantage worth noting, I am very certain that 1 casting level does not translate into -8 resist, or anywhere near it.  If that were the case, then the brilliance of ro items from VT (+20 casting levels) would be EXTREMELY noticeable, and would be the #1 item for every caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never owned any of the brilliance of ro items so can not offer any comment as to the effectiveness of them in reguards to the resist augments.   the -8 resist number is result of a fairly lengthy discussion back when I was on TZ(pvp server) when you can be ganked by someone 8 levels above you and how much each levels translated to resist factors.  a melee should always keep 200+ MR because once rooted/snared, you are as good as dead since you wont stand much of a chance vs someone who just rooted you(time to burn that thurg potion:D)  if anyone from a PvP server can remember the discussion or offer some comment reguarding this please feel free.   Also, if any of your guildies have the brilliance of ro items, you may want to ask them to do a quick and dirty parse in their &quot;nuking&quot; ability with and without it to check on how significant resist augments are on them.  I think you will find that it is fairly significant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These spell casting raise levels affect casting SKILLS, like evocation. So you get less fizzles. it has nothing to do with resists</div></div><hr />
