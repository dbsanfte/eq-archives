/shrug, I'll worry about it when I see some hard data that shows this to indeed be the case.  afaik nobody's there yet.  until then, im have a great time playing the game.  This issue doesnt get in the way of that one bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-23-2005, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue is that we don't understand how natural sta works, Haass.

<br />
I understand where you're coming from, Haass, but EQ, and other games like it, have shown us that a detailed understanding of how the game mechanics work is a useful bit of knowledge.<br />
<br />
Thats said, I think the natural hitpoint increases when leveling have something to do with the natural sta increases upon leveling. I'll get back to specifics once I work it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I say that you start worrying about things like a stat cap when and if there is one.  Right now, all I see is a bunch of speculation that we could be broken somewhere down the line, when for all you know, we're not.<br />
<br />
Right now, stamina works like it's supposed to.  I gain HP when I level, I gain HP when I put on more stamina gear.  What you guys are doing is taking a couple data points from a set, and then drawing a conclusion based upon extrapolating that data.  It's poor scientific method, that's really what pisses me off here.<br />
<br />
If you want to collect a bunch of data, analyze it, and then provide a conclusion based upon that data, you need more than levels 1-3 of the Rogue class to form that conclusion.  Otherwise, it's just useless speculation.</div></div><hr />

I can't find it, but I looked for the 30ish page thread on the Blizzard board about this.  Base stats are effectively meaningless, as you actually have two STA values. One on your gear, and that gives you HP.  You have base STA, and that gives you nothing.  Or, level by level, it's kludged to give you exactly the same HP you would get if you levelled up without gaining any STA points.  It means, among other things, that a mage with the same STA as a warrior will have more HP than the tank, as the mage's base HP will be lower.  But a warrior is gonna have more STA gear than the mage, and so this doesn't come up.<br />
<br />
A few posts pointed out that, with this model, you could die from having your STA debuffed, by losing more HP than you had from STA.  I couldn't see any means to debuff that much STA, tho.  The one thing no-one seemed sure of through the whole thread was whether a buff that gave you a % boost on your STA would give you a direct bump in HP, or act only on the item STA points.  One post said that at some point in the game, there weren't any statistic increases on level ups, but there were HP increases.  When stat gains were folded in, they tweaked the math so that the final gains (HP and Mana) remained consistent.  I dunno, wasn't there.  It's all hearsay, and so use it wisely and remember I guarantee nuffin.<br />
<br />
I think it's a stupid design choice, the kind I'd have been stripped down for when I was programming.  But yar,  it's kludgy, it's also par for the course.  There are numerous small details like that in the game, stuff that's half implemented or broken at the fine print level.  Not game breaking or such, but disappointing in the context of what is otherwise a smoothly designed game.   One more dumbass choice you put up with cuz most of the game works.  Shore, it rankles the hell outta me - but that's largely because it's a stark contrast to most of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">01-23-2005, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, if other stats like str and agi don't work the same way (i.e. are actually useful), we are actually disadvantaged compared to another class that tends to get less stam but more of other stats that might actually be useful. Other base stats might be just as useless, but we don't know because Blizz won't give us a straight answer on how it works. Not only that, but it is evident from the Community Rep responses that they don't understand how the stats work either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sta increase from level up is meaningless.  This is easily verifiable.  That said you seem to gain more HP per level anyway and presumably Warrior gets more HP per level than other classes, so even if the sta does work the relative scale wouldn't change (mobs will probably do slightly more damage to compensate slightly more HPs).<br />
<br />
Given that you can actually see what your DPS/crit %/AC/etc if a stat cap exists it'd be very easy to verify.  This isn't like EQ where you see your str go from 200 to 250 but you really have no idea if that actually did anything without extensive parsing.  In WoW if your str goes from 200 to 250 you'll see your DPS display go up by 5 or whatever.  And if you can't trust what the mouseover tells you then as far you're concerned maybe the HP you see on yourself is a lie too.<br />
<br />
The only stat I'm guessing that might be capped is agility, because it currently takes a constant amount of agility to increase avoidance so in theory you can eventually dodge 100% and be more or less unkillable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, as my easily reproducable evidence got more or less ignored in favor of speculative FUD, let me put some actual numbers to it for you.<br />
<br />
Level 56 tauren warrior : 104 stamina 2395 hp ( 2281 ex bonus )<br />
<br />
Level 56 troll warrior : 103 stamina 2271 hp<br />
<br />
Level 56 tauren shaman : 90 stamina 1924 hp ( 1832 ex bonus )<br />
<br />
Level 55 tauren druid : 66 stamina 1820 hp ( 1733 ex bonus )<br />
<br />
Level 55 undead mage : 43 stamina 1400 hp.<br />
<br />
Now would anyone *really* like to continue to protest that stamina does nothing, mages have more hp, warriors are screwed, blizzard is lying to us ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except that we get much more stamina than anyone  else for leveling. <br />
<br />
And I think the fractional stm theory is wrong. Just dinged 48th. <br />
<br />
47th 195 stm 2705 HP<br />
48th 197 stm 2771 HP (level up message was 2 stm and 66 HP).<br />
49th 188 stm 2839 HP (level up message was 2 stm and 68 HP).<br />
<br />
That does not fit the math of parcial stamina.<br />
<br />
That's a good start, but doesn't mean a lot unless you provide naked hp and stamina. <br />
<br />
I am not sure what you mean by 'the math of partial stamina' either, what did you believe that example disproves ?</div></div><hr />

level - hitpoints (increase) @ stamina (increase)<br />
1 - 55 @ 21<br />
2 - 72 (+17) @ 22 (+1)<br />
3 - 89 (+17) @ 22 (+0)<br />
<br />
27 - 575 @ 40<br />
28 - 605 (+30) @ 41 (+1)<br />

These are natural (naked, unbuffed, etc) stats only.</div></div><hr />

Ah, so we get to the meat of it. If working with incomplete data and forming a hypothosis, testing it, rinse and repeat isn't the scientific method, then quite frankly, I don't know what is. I can't think of many situations outside college classrooms where data is always complete and consistant, and follows logicly from one conclusion to the next. Real problems are messy.<br />

If you don't care about knowing how natural stamina works in WoW, then by all means, feel free to just pass this thread along and go about your business.</div></div><hr />

You argue with Velk's post above (which is what I planned on doing after I got off work this week).  Starting to feel dumb now?<br />

Bravo Velk.  Someone actually fucking does some work and shuts the idiots up.</div></div><hr />

Or are you just conveniently ignoring it due to a memory of EQ warriors having the highest hp in the game and you think that's just how it should be?</div></div><hr />

And HP are a shitty measure of &quot;ability to last&quot; as everyone else has methods to escape additionally Paladins have to be killed at least 3 times for whathever number of hitpoints they have. <br />
<br />
HP is going to be one  of the major factors for warriors we are the extreme case of trading HP for damage. I know that I don't nearly try and solo the stuff that other classes can and do easily. And that seems to be a general case and not just me being bad at soloing.</div></div><hr />
