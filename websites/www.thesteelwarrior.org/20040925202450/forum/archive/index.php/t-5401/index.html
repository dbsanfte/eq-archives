<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakgumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I could have sworn that i saw a thread either here or at the SafeHouse with parses showing how many HPs the 9 major Gods/mobs in PoTime have.  However, I can't for the life of me find it again.  Would somebody please either post their findings or point me in the direction of the original post?<br />
<br />
thx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kakgumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i aug'd it with a +10 int aug and use it to help my Int for tradeskills.  It was going to rot in P3 otherwise ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Someone posted a log of parses on Gods and listed HPs, most gods were between 1 to 2 million HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kakgumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yea...i recall that Tallos was right at 1.4 and Vallon near or just above 1.5  but was wanting something a bit more definitive than my poor memory ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">DoD is actually very nice for some gods where you simply can not afford the mistake of getting agro. Even though its a poker, its a nice ratio and the proc will keep your non-tanking tanks from over-agroing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sowy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DoD is nice for ppl who don't like the phase 2her :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From what I can tell, phase 4 gods have 1 million and phase 5 gods have 1.5 million.  But heres the thing, they all regen, so depending on how fast you kill them, you'll have to do more damage to them.<br />
<br />
With regen and DoT damage not visible, its difficult to say for certain how much hp they have though.<br />
<br />
edit: mental note: post when not half asleep</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You mean phase4 and 5, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">DoD roxorz~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kakgumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yes, the Phase 4 and Phase 5 god mobs.<br />
<br />
Excellent point that you made on mob regen and the  inability to see DoT damage in the parses skeqing the data Torrin.  Thanks for bringing that up, i'll make sure to take it into consideration.<br />
<br />
I think i've resigned myself to loading up EQ Companion or something similar on the alt computer for a few weeks and gathering some data myself as we go through our clearing.  Will return and post my findings as I get them generated.<br />
