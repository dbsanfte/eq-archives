<br />
at least that's what most people will say, your mileage may vary</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reason for me: <br />
- Red epic has less hitpoints<br />
- Red epic, if resisted causes little to no agro<br />
- Red epic, if not resisted is over time, not snap agro<br />
- Red epic is slower then either weapon<br />
- Droga weapons produce immediate snap agro<br />
- Droga weapons produce more DPS<br />
<br />
I about cried when I bagged my red epic for a 6-10 hr camped weapon but I have no agro issues were and with whom I hunt with using these two weapons.  <br />
<br />
These opinions are my views only and may not be the views of others.  There seems to be one consitence here &quot;everyone has a different opinion on everything&quot;.  Use what works best for you, try different combinations.  Mobs that you fight, friends that you fight with are different then others.  Your situation may be different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, unless you can afford to buy a BoC+SoD then the best agro set up you can get pre-EB is Sword of the Bloodsworn + Copper Hammer of Striking. I regularly participate in late night raids to farm all kinds of armor and gear and I bring my 59 SotB+CHoS weilding warrior with us for the additional DPS all the time. I have found that I often have to bag the droga weapons in favor of a Dragonrib Club + Shortblade of Lightning due to pulling agro when I get procs. The warriors that usually tank are weilding weapons like BoC, Greatstaff of the 4 winds, Greatblade of Storms, and a couple of them use red epics offhand. In some cases, the only way to shake agro has been to turn off attack and back out of melee range. Considering my warrior is only 59 with no AAs, I must say that his ablility to hold agro with these weapons is very good. I don't think you will be disappointed.</div></div><hr />

The proc rate was next to nothing.  CHoS worked well for me in offhand until i got a better. <br />
<br />
Personally i'd go CHoS main / Red epic off.  <br />
