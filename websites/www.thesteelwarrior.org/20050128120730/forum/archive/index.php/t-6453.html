I included 102 AA, which by the time you get to this many LDON points, you would easily have that many. I also bumped the charm bonus to 200% on the augment side, to reflect the number of completions that this process would take.<br />
<br />
The AA were spent on:<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
Physical Enhancement 1<br />
Planar Power 5<br />
Planar Durability 3<br />
Sturdiness 5<br />

Did I miss any, other than STA upgrades, that would increase HP?<br />

Also you can upgrade all those 30 hp yellowish magnetite of vitality augs to 40 hp Glowing sapphire of courage, and put 20 hp/mana augs in the place of where you have plain +7 stat augs on lots of the other slots.</div></div><hr />

He used the old pre-nerf Royal Attendant armor that has two type-2 slots.  You can't build that magelo anymore.<br />
<br />
In addition to what Argin listed, you can add the 85 hp boots from hard Mistmoore (aug with Solid Coal of Prowess for 125 hp), the 90 hp necklace from Rujark, 85 hp veng2 shoulders from Mistmoore, and there's a haste cloak from Miragul too.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't call that approximately elemental.  More like VT gear with much worse AC.  And that's if you didn't aug your VT stuff.<br />
<br />
This (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=619288&amp;alt=163866) is an elemental geared warrior.  Put augments in the elemental stuff and it's not even close.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To push the limit up a little more of whats possible, even if not at all likely, you can put +15 hp augs in all those crappy type1 slots, if you could ever do enough hard to see that many drop.  AC won't really get anywhere above 1600, so that will remain a big gap between a LDoN war and a VT+ one, but you can push the attack slightly higher and get at least vengeance 21 if you collect all the vengeance and aura of ____ augs, I think all of them are lore though im not sure about the aura of courage one at the moment (the ldon magelo above had vengeance 16.)<br />
<br />
*edit - Also, I think it's fair to call that approximately EP, Wandors example has a war in full raex -BP and almost every other slot has some of the nicer EP drops, I got the impression that the poster was talking about the average EP warrior, not one who had been there for months and and exhausted pre-Time upgrades.  Still, even a half geared EP warrior will get the same hp with a lot more AC more easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wish it would have done this a while back :(  I spent a long ass time creating a profile of what I'd like to get, only to find out later that Magelo was letting me put Lore augs all over.  Had to trash the whole thing after all that work.<br />
<br />
Good to know I can at least go ahead and do it over again now, without worry.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, as I saw to my great dismay, the +15 HP augs that drop in hard adventures are slot 7, not slot all.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

Run 3 and Regen 3 ?<br />

My guild is close to finishing RZ encounter, we're all almost flagged for sol ro fight now so we're ..i.. to VT and the time to get the entire guild flagged.  <br />

even if VT &gt; LDoN you can't knock the potential at least = )<br />

One of the nicest parts about the LDoN armor is you can put effects on it, and warriors just don't get as much out of the effects as the other classes. <br />
<br />
However, the place where you're going to love having multiple type 1 slots is when you farm the cragbeast in tipt. All of a sudden those slots pay off big time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im still going to contend that a maxed out ldon charachter would be about equal to a normal VT/EP toon hp wise but less AC.  Here's what you get if you go straight for HP, has some serious stat problems but theres lots of slots where you could drop 5 or 10 hp and get stats evened out.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=984015<br />
<br />
Notice the charm only has stats from adventurer charm, no PoP flags at all (dont know whats up with magelo and charm endurance.)  Also added in food and drink, since it's sorta silly not to.<br />
<br />
This comes out to 312 more hp and 337 less AC than Brutal's magelo which has 6 VT items and 2 EP items.  Hp wise, this is about equal to replacing three of Brutal's worst slots with Raex (bracer +90 hp, gloves +80 hp, boots +80 hp = 250 hp, + 16.5% = 291) which would make 6 VT and 5 EP items.  So just hp wise, i dont see how you can say a maxed out ldon war isn't roughly equal to a VT/EP war.  Of couse, when you add in the Raex the AC gap widens a ton, but i wasnt talking hp anyway :p</div></div><hr />

Hehe, I'm not sure what the point of this argument is, but my guild leader is a better example of a warrior in full VT gear.  <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6362<br />
<br />
He has one elemental item, but elmental gloves are only 30 hp more than VT gloves.  If he bought sturdiness 5 he would have 7552 unbuffed hps, and room for 2 40 hp augs and quite a few smaller hp augments.  Subtract 30 hps for the elmental gloves and he is still well ahead of the best possible LDoN warrior in hps and the AC isn't even close.  And even he doesn't have the best possible VT gear (although pretty darn close).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats exactly my point, you're saying an averagly equipped VT/VT with some EP geared warrior has a few hundred more hp than a maxed out ldon warrior if they buy sturdiness 5.  Thats the point, most EP/VT warrior dont have everything, and most of them don't have sturdiness 5.  No one is saying that you cant get better from VT and EPs, just that if you got all you could get out of LDoN, you'd be about on par hp wise with your average EP joe.   What im not sure of is why people want to argue every which way they can that 7.5k unbuffed somehow isnt about where many EP geared warriors are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While in theory an LDoN warrior would be able to come close in HP to that of a VT/elementally equipped one, it's only going to be a tiny handful of cases where that ever does happen.  The LDoN-equipped magelo you posted, Argin, is pretty much max for LDoN.  That magelo, without taking into account the weapons *better agro weapons can be purchases with the pp you make from your LDoN runs and selling drops*, or the attack augments, cost over 40 000 AP.  I don't think there are more than a handful of people, if that, who have that many AP on most servers.  Currently, on my server, the only people who COULD have that many AP *those on the leaderboard with over 400 wins, assuming all their wins are hard* are in elemental/time guilds already, so for the most part will have better gear.  I guess my argument is this; anyone who has the kind of time/dedication to get that many AP, will already be playing at a higher level than LDoN, and will most likely already be in VT/elemental planes or higher.  Also, whoever is going to be playing that much already, will also have Sturdiness 5, so that cancels your argument out there.  While theoretically a max LDoN warrior could come close to a VT/Elemental warrior, it's not really going to be happening.  The only way I can really see it happening, is if in say a year or 2, a casual player who has kept grinding away at LDoN's, and has finally reached the level of that max magelo.  At that point, they'll be near a current VT/Elementally equipped player, but not for long once the 2nd player keeps advancing.</div></div><hr />

And it's not just weapons that a person who did LDoN that much would replace, plenty of the other items can be upgraded by bazaar items, HoRZ being one of the most obvious upgrades.  <br />
<br />
Btw Zito, i dont see your point about sturdiness 5.  Even if someone playing LDoN that much is likely to be in a EP guild, that doesnt mean that most EP wars in fact have sturdiness 5.  I think its obvious that if you did all that LDoN and were in EPs that you'd come out better equipped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't say that every server's leaderboard is the same, but on D Ro, the leaders are from raiding guilds, usually elemental/time guilds.  Simply because those are the people who play the most, and who have the best gear to ensure the most wins, as well as generally being better players.  There are a handful of non-guilded, or very casually guilded players on the leader board, but not very many.  Of those, I'm fairly sure the vast majority of their wins are on regular setting, so they'll take longer yet to get their points.<br />
<br />
My point about sturdiness is that most elemental warriors do have sturdiness 5, and those that don't, will have it long before an LDoN warrior has 40 000 AP.  I brought up that point as you said most don't.  However, of all the elementally flagged warriors I know, all either already have it, or are working on it.<br />
<br />
So yes, theoretically, it's possible that a maxed-out LDoN warrior will come within a few hundred HP of a VT/elemental warrior, *disregarding AC/saves/stats*, but, theoretically, it's also possible to make a Yugo faster than a Ferrari.  But that's something you won't see very often either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can check My Magelo Link if you want, it has mostly LDON armor and some buyable War Gear. Compared to the Magelos you guys have posted, looks like I need some more Work....<br />

If anyone wants to give some Equipment advice, I am all ears...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Albyen, besides upgrading your rings, with either steel rings of earthen resilience or hard ldon drops, and your shoulders with horn spiked shoulders or hard ldon drop, looks like you just need to start auging, you could replace your gauntlets with RA too but i'd aug the RA armor you have 1st.  It looks like you need to fix which type of armor you have in your magelo, all your pieces are pre-nerf pieces, which isnt really possible unless you got like 9k AP before the nerf, which was pretty soon after LDoN came out.   Just start slapping 40 hp augs in your armor as you get points.   You can replace helm with HoRZ too since you dont need RA helm to put haste aug in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">albyen</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oooops Lol Yeah Need to change that, my armor isn't the prenerf.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">albyen</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and something that bothers me is the Fact that RA really doesn't have much Dex on it without augging it. I would really like to get my dex up to the point to where it can be 305 even if there isn't a shaman in my group or one available to buff. So If I have to go with BST buffs or with only Virt or some config like that,  I can still get a decent proc rate going....<br />
<br />
I really Wanna aug with 40hps augs but not sure what I should exactly do about my low dex.... guess I will work it out but would be nice to use as many slots as possible for hp augs...</div></div><hr />

I would say, get your stamina to 305 through augments.  The other three melee stats can all be kept at 305 through a single buff - Ferine Avatar.  If you need to use a buff icon for your stats, then you might as well make the most of it.</div></div><hr />
