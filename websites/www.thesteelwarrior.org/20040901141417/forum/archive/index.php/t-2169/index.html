<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aluamilli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is planning a Royals Run this weekend. My question is, does the queen always drop the blade or is it uncommon/rare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Always</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know she didnt used to drop it every time but this may have been changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Recently someone reported it not dropping once.  It used to be a fairly rare drop, but now it's very rare to have it not drop.  So most likely you'll get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When epics first came out, it was a rare drop. Something like 1 in 10. A LONG time ago, it was patched to drop every time. I have yet to hear of her not dropping it since patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aluamilli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Queen Raid Failed... Miserably... 2 Wipes, 5 hours of raiding and/or Corpse Running. Was an awful night.<br />
<br />
To start off we didn't have a CotH Mage. Then we had a lag during the crawl who brought back a huge train. Once that corpse run was complete we started again. We made it a fair way in and then a mage who was non-KoS offered to help.<br />
<br />
We set up a CotH to the safe stairs. Once we all got there we cleared the 6 initial MoBs. Cleared the Library, made our way downstairs. Cleared the Downstairs mobs and then proceeded to pick the lock on the door with the pit trap. Lock picked, entered the room 3 MoBs. Killed one, then someone fell in the pit. Helloooo Overking!! BLAM all dead.<br />
<br />
20 Somethin Coffins Later we called it a night.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any strategy you can offer for this raid? Or, do you have a post/link I can follow to read for myself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Queen strategy is stick ma and fire pets on it. rest use ranged attacks. Think she gates also so fight her in her room.<br />
<br />
As far as for agroing overking through the trap... Myabe have bard songs off when going over the pit and have everyone dmf and tell them 3 times there is a pit there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aluamilli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">*Sigh* <br />
<br />
We didn't even make it to the Queen. The Pit trap was like Gandalf Screaming &quot;YOU SHALL NOT PASSSSSS!!!!&quot;. Once we did that Corpse Summoning we called it a night. <br />
<br />
My question is, does anyone know a better/easier way to get to the Queen other than summoning to the &quot;Safe Stairs&quot;. Is there another spot to summon too? Possibly the Secret Passage, or somewhere closer to the Queen's Chambers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Charadok strategy...<br />
kill mobs till you get to named... What kinda of strategy are you looking for? You cant kill a charadokai sniffler or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If one has a non kos mage and rogue and has some key classes with a lot of guts you can summon to the hall way above the king and queen (after the pit trap and false wall).  One raid I attended there, we had a mage CoTH a chanter in, followed by cleric, followed by me (MA).  There were 3 mobs in hall iirc.  Chanter has to mez quickly, followed by cleric to heal/root.  Then the best tank (just a stalling action til damage arrives) you have for the raid then damage dealers (wizzies&lt;snare&gt; then rogues).  After you clear out the hall you are fairly safe here plus you avoid the pit trap that kills many raids.  Just be careful though of respawn in the hallway for when you are clearing king/queen rooms.<br />
<br />
Prior to CoTH you want to buff to the hilt and rune the chanter/cleric/ma.  This strat requires a gutsy chanter and cleric but can be done.  It also requires that you let no runners escape or you have a whole world of hurt incoming.  Root em if you need or have wizzies/druids snare.  It isn't a bad idea in my opinion for MA to pop defensive/evasive upon being coth'd in to minimize healing mana from cleric until the damage dealers arrive.<br />
<br />
Also, and I can't emphasize this enough,  SNARE/ROOT so you have no runners.  Do this early, do it often.  If you have to rez a druid/wizzy from an early snare it is much easier than summoning the raid from having the library and side mobs add at a bad time.  The mobs run and fast.  My queen blade came when she dropped with just her feet sticking through the library door.  The raid wiped but I was able to get back and get coth'd down to loot blade.  I died almost immediately upon clicking yes though on the no drop item.  But the coffins were worth it as it was my last piece.<br />
<br />
One last item, have entire raid shrunk before the CoTH as the hallway is narrow and make sure casters stick their butts to the walls so melee can get to the mobs.  This strat was quite a rush for me, I can't imagine what it was like for the chanter and cleric, heheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aluamilli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually was looking for somethin like what Fried posted.<br />
<br />
Thanks much :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Chardok royals is a hard raid for people who aren't simply using gear/levels from other expansions to power through it.<br />
<br />
I disagree with Casai's queen fight strat, too. Some one should run in, get aggro, spin the queen around, and then everyone blast away from the rear, since her AE is directional. She has relatively few hps, but high dps, and needs to die fast. Probably easiest to rush her in her room, with chanters mezzing the guards asap. Maybe we do that because we never have a bunch of fire pets hanging around.<br />
<br />
The CoH thing works okay I guess, but I think there's something satisfying in fighting down and clearing through library. People really just need to pay attention though, to avoid the pit, etc. Levitate helps with that, but really, people just have to pay attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Every time i've done Chardok Royals, we did it this way.  6-8 ppl are the CoH team, 1 non-KOS to call what gets pulled next and how many are inc. Kill all the way to the beginning of the castle, then CoH the whole crew in.  Kill mobs that have spawned, then AE until you get into the library.  Pulls after that consist of 5-6 mobs at a time.  Watch mob pushing and make sure you stay away from the walls because it WILL aggro the king room below. Clear the bottom of library and get everyone DMF or levitation. Pull the rooms after the library then we move into the that area, taking the platform on the left as you enter in. Clean up some wondering mobs, then start pullling the king room to that spot.<br />
Have non-KOS person spam hail the king, as a warrior pulls just about everything else. (i've used defensive on this pull so i can make it back to the party alive still. eheh). Pull the king and whatever is left in his room, and kill him (fire resists against him). Move into the king room. rebuff and kill respawns. Everyone stays in the king pit area.  Have a suicide SK or Pally or whatever pull the whole queen room into the hallway, then FD or die. Have non-KOS person spam hail the queen to keep her there alone while the rest of her friends go back to the room. MA pulls queen to top of king room pit steps when it's clear for a single pull.  Everyone hops out of king pit, melee range behind the queen, and blows all offensive discs, full nukage right away. enchanters handle any spawns that occur, pallys stun, lifeburn / manaburn, full dps.  Cheal cycle shouldn't be needed if you have a half decent tank (over 6k raid buffed). The key is the quickness because she does a nasty ae dot that'll wipe you if you take too long.  If fight lasts more than 60 seconds, a good chance you'll wipe.  Queen fight should take around 15-20 seconds.  At this point you can stay in king room and clear spawns and wait for another King to spawn (2hr timer if i'm not mistaken). Or just TL out of there.<br />
<br />
I've been on about 20 Chardok raids that were done this way, and I've lead the last 12 of them.  Only wiped occurred when we pulled the Queen for the first time, didn't kill her quick enough so her AE wiped us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tug was dead on about the way down and the queen fight.  The key to chardok is AE.  AE stun and AE nuke, if you have 2 chanters its cake.  We always fight down with AE only takes what 20 mins to get to bridge then 20 more to get to lib.  Our guild and ones we work with have lost a lot of 65's to uber guilds and are having to equip new members with epics so we do all 3 royals every trip.  We do queen just like Tug said, I rush her in her room turn her and then everyone else ae's, nukes and melee.  Did her once with the non-kos but seems like a lot of extra work. Sometimes if were short on time we drop to kings room via the trap.  One thing you must do for both the King and Queen is to have them targeted before you enter the room.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">to avoid aggroing king do not lev hug the left side of door if someone falls in let them die and get rogue or invis caster to get them rarely does  amob see invis in his room although sometimes they do. the trao is only on the right side of the door and as long as you are on the left side you will not fall in and no way to aggro king as mobs do not aggro through walls in chardok. with DMF or lev and going over the trap there is always the chance of proximity aggro (small yes but a chance).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Selaradrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">this si the strat we use to do the royals.  pull king room up the ramp to the hallway, kill there.  when just king and his 2 gurads in that little pit, charge into the room go straight for the king right there. ( this way he doesnt gate) have chanters mez the 2 guards.  kill king, kill guards. then heal and med up.<br />
<br />
while medding/rebuffing have everyone down in that little hole where the king was.  have monk go tag the queen and run up the ramp back to the hall where he FD's.  faction ally person spam hails the queen to hold her there. ( she is the quest mob for spirit wracked cords so this works)  her guards will give up and head back to the queen room leaving her all alone.  MA runs up starts tanking ( making sure she is facing the ramp and hallway so her back is to the raid force) and calls the assist.  everyone goes full out offensive disc and nukes. she drops in 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When i did queen, we just rushed her room with all melees, then after the AE was done all casters, pushed queen into wall where she wouldn't cast and mezzed the 6ish adds.<br />
<br />
she was dead within 15 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hm. I have always just cleared down to the royals.  Usually with AE.<br />
<br />
The raids I've been on have always pulled King to the hallway corner right after the false wall.  Sometimes its been intentional and sometimes its been accidental (i.e., someone aggroed him early and we were all, like, well fuck it).  <br />
<br />
Then the pull team takes a few of the mobs from the Queen's room to the hallway.  When the pullers have cleared as much as necessary we always rush the Queen.  Tanks push her to the back corner, casters stay near the entry wall, and chanters lock down adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Did go there last night and well that pit trap got us to :) 3 deaths and rest got out.<br />
<br />
Hated being the only necro around, casting single target dmf on 19 people is not my idea of fun :eek: at least raid window makes targetting easy</div></div><hr />
