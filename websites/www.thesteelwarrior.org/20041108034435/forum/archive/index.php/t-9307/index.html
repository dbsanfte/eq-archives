<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is more of a getting a general idea of you the reader of this troll's ramblings.<br />
<br />
Before the OoW expansion, and the increasing of level cap I maintained 2 toons.<br />
One being the 65 troll warrior, the other being a 65 dwarf cleric.  Everything was peachy with the Cleric.  Has HoV, MGB, SCR3+Shawl.  To be honest the cleric was my primary.  Just found the path to a warrior to be more fun.  Rather watch a mob's HP go down than staring at my group's HP.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, before the drool hits the keyboard this is where I am stuck.  With the OoW expanison and push to 70 leaves the new cleric HP buff avail.  By now you maybe asking, why the hell do you care?  Not like you can buff your warrior with it.  They're both on the same account.<br />
<br />
As it stands currently in my guild my alt toon cleric, is the highest one in the guild.  Our guild has been a downward spiral (no NIN comments please) and has lost a good chunk of members.  The only other cleric's close to me are in the beta testing of EQ2.  Not seen very often on-line.  Yet I am not the primary warrior in the guild.<br />
<br />
So now you can see a bit of being leaned on for the cleric.  What I ask is if you were in the same perdicament, what path would you take?</div></div><hr />

I'm going to make a wild guess and figure people would choose the warrior.  Maybe its time for a new guild?</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's time for WoW (www.worldofwarcraft.com)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its never time for WOW.  Resist the urge.  Its going to suck just like every other MMORPG other then Final Fantasy has.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've looked into the idea of going to WoW.  When I do play EQ its generally with my wife as well.  Had to work the wife faction from Scowling to Indifferent.  Pain in the butt quest.  Anyhow I brought up the idea of moving to WoW.  Went over like a lead balloon.<br />
<br />
The new guild idea - Yeah, I've gone into that phase as well.  At one point in time I became utterly frustrated with EQ and my playing style.  Here I sit with several expansions that I have never seen the end content of.<br />
<br />
Velious - Sleeper's Tomb<br />
Luclin - Vex Thal<br />
PoP - Plane of Time<br />
<br />
The list goes on.  A bit of relax came when a good chunk of smaller guilds amassed to make a pick-up raid channel.  Wasn't for this channel I wouldn't be 3 hits away from being flagged for Sol Ro Tower and Elem Planes Access.  I'm full on with the understanding I'll never see Plane of Time.  Granted I hate it within every inch of my bones, but I have to face the facts.<br />
<br />
1. I can't devote enough time to a raiding guild.  Especially when I am becomming a RL father in less than 2 month's.<br />
<br />
2. The guild I am in that I helped create still holds the core original founders.  Not found very often in many guilds, and we've been around since the Vaz server was born.  Well few month's after.<br />
<br />
All in all it comes down to what do I enjoy more.  Slaughtering mobs with grim abandon, and wearing their heads as a hat or staring at a health bar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The good news is that whatever you decide about EQ, it will look a lot less important in &lt;60 days than it does now.<br />
Grats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your situation sounds a lot like mine (down to the wife not wanting to move to another game and all). This might not be an option for you, but I just 2 box (well, actually, 3 box). A lot of the time, both warrior and cleric are pretty simple classes, and playing 2 helps keep me interested. It's great to be able to log and be guaranteed that you will be able to at least do something rather than sit around LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I gotta agree with Brabble...my son is 3 weeks old today and, well, EQ is a game. that's it...warrior, cleric, paladin, necromancer....bleh who cares.<br />
<br />
it's so trivial and nonsensical it's hilarious. just do what is fun. believe me, like brabble said, in a few weeks your questions won't even be on the radar.<br />
<br />
just have fun and enjoy life. don't sweat the details.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
As a father of three who was a raider before first child, left the raiding guild after second, and started a character who could Feign Death after the third, I would suggest playing the warrior.  You seem to enjoy the warrior more from your post.<br />
<br />
As others have also suggested, once the baby is around you will be paying much more attention to your new child that you won't miss EQ.  <br />
<br />
After a few months, you will be fresh and ready to play again.  Also, more of your guild clerics will level up and you can play your warrior. <br />
<br />
In the mean time, make a character who can solo or FD for those emergency diaper changes. :eek: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fuck eq2, fuck wow, play the toon that makes you happy and you have fun with..Soon they will all be coming back anyway. ~~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Koss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Forced to play a char you're unhappy with will only breed resentment and soon you'll find yourself either 1) logging your warr or 2) not logging on.<br />
<br />
I'd play the warrior and let the guild deal with filling in the clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Play what you enjoy more.  You are paying for your subscirption, not your guild.  <br />
I also dual box a warrior and cleric.  However, the guild and alliance I am in know that I vastly prefer my warrior.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to see many good comments about FF from those that have tried it. I have seen a lot leave EQ for it, and so far most have come back, some in a matter of days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Woodelfwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">FF - Online sucks due to there not being a true english server and the fact that everyone looks the same at that level weapons armor everything and no armor dye limits things. the way the class system is done imbalances the game and there is really no true pet class only a class with a charm that dies when it breaks.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW - will be big because it is blizzard , from what i have heard / seen about it looks lame. i dont dig the graphics and i dont dig the evil cant group with good races. altho i will say i do think they got a better quest system then everquest seen from screen shots and friends talking about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ2 - heard nothing about it besides that the newest patch screwed things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Move one do a different account and 2box  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Getting to ST would not be that hard.  Neither would NToV.  However, VT is one of the largest time sinks on EQ.  As others said, being a dad will pretty much make playing moot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Got VT shards 2 boxing cleric/warrior for my then twink cleric within 2 days on vacation.<br />
Its not that hard nowadays that ME is usually empty and the rest of the camps are not that hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhh Final Fantasy sucked too...I'm still undecided on WoW, of course I only did the stress test so I would probably need more time to form an opinion.  It was tons of fun, but I have lots of playability concerns over the long term.</div></div><hr />
