Seriously, Fix =/= Overpower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think they would never implement such a complex fix to our class.  It has to be simple.<br />
<br />
We should have more HP's to set us apart as a tanking class.  A 10% increase would be sufficient<br />
<br />
We should have a better hit rate, by default, because we are masters of melee combat.  A 5% increase would be sufficient.<br />
<br />
We should retain our rage when switching stances without having to waste talent points to do so, or at least 25% of our rage by default.   Remove tactical mastery and add another useful talent.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you have some very good other ideas to improve some talents.  Defiance and anticipation should be improved.  I think the other talents are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anticipation is generally crap anyway, especially versus other warriors. Gimme a raw HP boost talent.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery is fine as a talent. You don't really need to switch between stances until you can get TM anyway.<br />
<br />
Removal or at least a tweak of the dual wield hit penalty would rule a lot. So would a longer duration on Battle Shout, but that's more of a laziness thing.<br />
<br />
Warriors are pretty awesome as is; we're not the strongest in PvP but we can be very useful if played properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about replacing Anticipation with a Hardiness talent?<br />
<br />
Hardiness (Prot): Requires level 10<br />
Increases your base hitpoints by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10%.<br />
<br />
That would put warriors ahead of Paladins in hitpoints, but require some work from them, not just a given innate attribute.  Or, increase HP gained from stamina for warriors from 10 to 11 per point?  Instead of getting 3000hp from 300sta, a warrior would recieve 3300hp.  That is a 10% increase for a decent 60 War.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">straight HP boost. may as well leave stamina alone because warriors with like tyrant's or ornate mithril would not see a large benefit and will still have fewer HP than warriors with more stamina related gear.</div></div><hr />

gotta disagree with you wholeheartedly here.  I think forcing folks to spend talents on TM is a talent sink, especially with a 5 point in arms pre-req.  Talents are supposed to enchance your character.  Without the TM talent you have no way to snare when you're in def.  which is something I find myself switching into battle stance constantly to do.  I also switch in to battle from def for overpower hits.  Being able to switch stances on the fly is pretty pointless if you cant do anything with it when you switch.  Especially when you factor in all the hoops we gotta jump through to get rage anyway.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see the warrior by default able to switch stances w/o being penalized the way they are without talents right now (as in you loose all your rage; therefore, abilities).  I'd like to see something like TM enhance an already innate ability to switch stances and be able to perform abilities.<br />
<br />
p.s. what does =/= mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you need rage right after you switch stances and don't have TM, you can always pop Bloodrage. In most situations you will have enough healing to offset the small HP loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that small HP loss gets pretty big as you level up.  Its % based, not a flat number =(  And its only usable every 30sec.  That works for those once in a while situations, but I can easily have 3 runners or have overpower come up 3 times in 30 seconds.  The ability to switch to battle and pop em with snare or overpower is pretty basic imo if they're gonna let us switch the way the do.<br />
<br />
I think it would make more sence to give all warriors the ability to retain 10 rage across stances, move the TM talent to the first row so we can spend 3 points on that instead of imp. rend if we want, and make it more like this:<br />
Rank 1: retain an additional 10 rage when switching stances<br />
Rank 2: retain an additional 15 rage when switching stances<br />
Rank 3: retain an additional 20 rage when switching stances<br />
<br />
making it so a warrior with TM maxed keeps 30 rage where folks with no talents only get 10 rage. Something to this effect would be more in-line with the idea that talents are an enchancment rather than a completly new set of abilities (which is what TM pretty much is in its current state, a new ability more than an enhancement).   Make it so we can use abilities that cost 10 rage or less by default but make us sink points into talents if we want to be able to do more after a stance switch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they should make it so that priests have to be in healing stance to heal and in shadow stance to cast shadow spells, but when they change stances they have to lose all their mana, unless they spend 10 talent points, then they can retain 25% of their mana when they change stances!<br />
<br />
That is basically in effect what bliz has done to warriors.  I understand there is not a direct correlation between mana and rage but there is no logical reason for us to lose all rage when changing stances especially given the fact we are unpowered as is.  Giving us the ability to retain rage while changing stances would not overpower us, in fact it would help bring us more in line with other classes.  If out of combat for a duration we still lose all our rage, we still have to build it up in combat!  Merely allowing us to retain some or all of our rage naturally is a logical change.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know how Bloodrage works :D I still use it when I need it, which is practically never now.<br />
<br />
I do see some of y'all's points about rage. retaining 10 rage for free while shifting stances would still allow us to keep 35 rage total with TM5. that's more than enough for most anything you need.<br />
<br />
yes we are a little underpowered compared to other classes, but I don't think twiddling with rage during stance shift is the way to bring us up, even we even really need it. Battlegrounds will be a huge test.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have played a druid to 23 so I have toyed with the caster/bear/cat switching.  Caster to cat:  The druid retains all his mana pool and infact regenerates mana while in form (although its hidden til you switch back to caster).  While a cat he gains energy like a rogue would, 20/tick.   Caster to bear:  The druid retains/regenerates his mana pool (hidden again though).  He must build rage as a bear tho to use what few skills are available to him in bear form.  While in form, the druid cannot use spells such as heal/nuke/root.  There is a seperate &quot;pool&quot; of skills/talents available for each form.  If you think its hard to gain rage as a warrior, you should try it as a Druid, its nearly impossible since the damage done is determined by his level and strength alone.  In no way does the damage on his equiped weapon translate while in form.  So, in short, yes druids retain mana even after shapeshifting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good - this is available anyway but is a pain to set up, there is no real reason for this other than poor UI design. On the other hand, as the ability is available anyway it doesn't *really* make any difference in balance, only in the perception thereof.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tactical Supremacy:  Requires level 35<br />
   You gain the ability to use all skills in Battle Stance.<br />
<br />
<br />
... words fail me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle Shout:  Increase duration to at least 5min.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why ? What problem is this addressing ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Impale (Arms):  Requires 3 points in Deep Wounds.<br />
   Critical Strike damage done by abilities increased by 20, 40%.<br />
<br />
Two-Hand Spec (Arms):  Requires 15 points in Arms Talents.<br />
   Increases damage done with Two-Hand weapons by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10%.<br />
<br />
Cruelty (Fury):<br />
   Chance to score a critical hit with melee weapons increased by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is presumably to address a perceived lack of dps - if this is the case, why is it tied to talents ? Also, increasing the max crit is a bad idea for PVP. <br />
<br />
<br />
One-Hand Spec (Prot):  Requires 10 points in Protection Talents.<br />
   Increases your damage with one-hand weapons by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's at the top of the tree for a reason - so you can't combine it with sword mastery  etc. It also *is*, 2/4/6/8/10% already anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparantly I need to explain why these things are bad.<br />
<br />
Enable weapon set cycling via hotkey and tabs in inventory. Up to 3 sets.  <br />
<br />
Right clicking weapons to Equip them is too much hassle?  Come on now, the most you'd EVER have to do is manually remove your shield in a weapon swap, and that's only if you're going to DW from Sword/Board, and you might as well just go to 2h if you're going to do that and bypass it all.  This is seriously not an issue at all, and I'd prefer they work on about 1000 other tweaks before they bother with this one since weapon swapping is already 10x faster in this game than any other I've played.<br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive: You absorb 20% of any damage taken, but deal 15% less damage while in stance. <br />
<br />
This would make it so there is a bonus for being in Defensive, and there would never be any reason to use Battle.  There's a reason that there's different stances, and it's because there are different situations for using them.  Defensive is perfectly fine as is, and does not need an upgrade like this.  Ditto with the Berseker change.  It makes both of them MORE useful than battle in all circumstances, and that's not how they're supposed to be.  <br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery: Requires level 25<br />
You retain up to 35 rage points when you change stances. <br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason for a 35 rage number at all, other than for the mortal strike freaks. This is frivilous.  The way the class is set up is to encourage you to pick a stance and use it for awhile. <br />
<br />
 Tactical Supremacy: Requires level 35 <br />
<br />
Retarded beyond belief.  See above.  You're not supposed to have all skills available all the time.  I realize some people have been playing with cheat codes on for all these years, but as I said before, Balance =/= overpowering a class.<br />
<br />
Battle Shout: Increase duration to at least 5min. <br />
<br />
Battle shout is already the best damage per rage point ability we have, especially in groups of 5.  It doesn't need a buff.<br />
<br />
The rest of your talent suggestions are basically completely ridiculous, and it's clear that you gave no thought at all to them other than &quot;WE NEED MORE DAMAGE!&quot;<br />
<br />
You do understand that the damage you deal generates rage right?  And by dealing the fuckin insane amount of damage that you'd want, we'd have infinite rage right?  And you do realize that the game is designed around us NOT having infinite rage?  <br />
<br />
There are things that need a slight tweak in this game.  None of the things that you listed are in that category.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrmmm, this is a lil bizzar.  I dont see Haass' last post when I view this thread but when I hit reply it is there... =\<br />

Get cosmos with its /equip and /unequip commands and macro them.  Works MUCH better than trying to use your mouse.<br />
The way the class is set up is to encourage you to pick a stance and use it for awhile.<br />
Hmmm, not right now it aint.  If that really were the case there would be a forced cooldown between stance changes.  Instead we have this notion that you can change stances instantly, but it makes you completly 100% calm.  Uhhh.. yea.. right.. sure.<br />
I really don't see the reason to naturally allow rage to be kept.<br />
And I really dont see any reason we should loose it all for changing the way we stand.<br />
<br />
I can understand that they might want us to pick a stance and use it.  If they really meant it, there would be a cooldown after you switched.  Instead we have this talent point sink called Tatical Mastery.  Its annoying, but hey, its one fun ass game.  I'll play it either way =)<br />
Also, increasing the max crit is a bad idea for PVP.<br />
huh? How is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I woudl do.<br />
<br />
1) QUick swap weapon set up's....agree with 3.  1h / Shield, dual wield, 2h.  While not necessarily needed, it's DEFENITELY a nicety I'd like to see implemented.<br />
<br />
2) Get rid of Tactical mastery ... replace with another aggro attack similiar to sundar, and just keep rage between stances.<br />
<br />
3) Increase our innate DPS.  Either through the damage we produce per hit, or an increased hit percentage ... we miss to much IMO (woudl prefer the latter actually).<br />
<br />
4) Get rid of the 20% threat penalty from battle stance.  This &quot;middle ground&quot; stance should NOT have a aggro penalty.  This would make Berserker stance ...20% penalty.  battle 0% penalty.  Defensive 20% bonus.<br />
<br />
5) Add a &quot;increased HP&quot; talent at like 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%.  TO help increase the &quot;gap&quot; between us and other classes(read Paly) a lil.  If they are gonna make Paladin's a TRUE hydra calss, i.e. useful heal's, they can heal themselves or others WHILE TANKING .... then the gap in HP to begin with need's to be larger.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO, that is all they need to do to fix us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what makes me cry with warriors is that we have too much talents. ok some are designed not to have all of them (specialisations : you take one or two but not all of them of course).<br />
but look at the mage talent tree : it perfect, you can max any of the trees (magic, cold, fire) and you still have some point left for a minor second mastery/specialisation.<br />
but for warrior you need 55 for maximazing furry, or 49 for full defence built, or 58 for full battle build (actually only 38 if you consider you can't specialise in two weapons).<br />
some talents are almost a must have : we can't tank without rage thus increasing crit% helps us alot in all stance, switch stance without to much loss is a must for adaptability, and the list goes on.<br />
a good way to help us would be to:<br />
1. put a little cooldown in stance switching.<br />
2. allows 4 rage per 10 lvl above the stance lvl to be kept when exiting this stance. Thus a lvl 60 warrior would keep 28 rage when quiting battle stance, 20 when quiting defencive stance, and 12 rage when quiting Berzerker stance.<br />
3. and maybe reworking a bit the bonus/malus of each stances. essentially on the def/off ratio and on the rage generation. something along the line : def generate rage more from domage receive and less from domage done (the better tank you are, the more angry you get when someone strikes trough your defence); oppositly a berzerker would have not feel the domage thus decreasing his dafence and having no rage from it, while being fullfiled in his opponent blood making him more starving for more.</div></div><hr />

We said it was superior to EQ, and it is, in literally every way.   You may not be playing WoW now, but you will be when SoE gets done taking ideas and patching EQ to &quot;WoWQuest&quot;</div></div><hr />

Its not perfect but its still more enjoyable than EQ to some of us. I spent 5 1/2 years playing my warrior without being able to accomplish anything on my own, having to rely on a group if not a guild to support me in everything I wanted to do to improve my character. Even with some of the class balance issues, I can still solo; I can still tradeskill to create some top notch gear to use; I can still log in and do something productive with an hr. There are some negatives, because nothing is perfect, but its still enough of an improvement that my EQ warrior is now retired.<br />
<br />
Now if you want to keep fighting the class balance war with the same people, almost 6 years after release, as well as deal with the game imposed cockblocks that EQ has, feel free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I WOW at lvl 32, a good portion of my gear is self made.  I can work traaeskill's pretty easily without a 50% failure rate, or 100 successes in a row before I get a skill up.  THen I can sell the gear to a vendor for profit, OR depending on the item, sell it to plyers for REAL profit. <br />
<br />
In WoW Item's drop from soloing, or in group that I can actualy use at my lvl, in EQ this only started happening with OoW, and then rarely.  I WoW, quest's give out either great gear, or Juicy xp ... or both ... in EQ in 4 years, I could coun the number of Quests I have done that didn't have to do with progression or an expansions &quot;quest armor&quot; on one hand...cause they were simply not worth it.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not saying that WoW is perfect ... not at all, what i am saying is that it is 100% mor balanced in the classes than EQ ever was ... it just need's some tweaking to make it better, especially in PVP...this is an area that most EQ player's never bothered to look at as they didn't play on a PVP server, and who the hell cared about Dueling.  If PVP had been as big a part of the game in EQ as it is in WoW ... I can guarentee you the warrior class in EQ woudl have been almost nonexistent ... no one would play one.  YOu'd have one or two per guild TOP'S...and that woudl be just for MT-ing the raid mobs.....would prol been a part time hydra even, and only pulled out when needed.</div></div><hr />

EQ PvP was pure ass.  That there were even PvP servers made me laugh.  While WoW warriors may not be the offensive powerhouses folks want them to be, they are quite viable in PvP.  We've got more tools to mess up the others guys game than you can shake a stick at AND we can still deal some really wicked damage.<br />
<br />
Its gonna be real intersting to see the battlegrounds and if its gonna be totally raid, group, or 1v1 oriented.  I'm hoping the warrior class is gonna shine in the group PvP setting there.  I think they do pretty damn good already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Balance is only a perception.<br />
<br />
For soloing people are satisfied that they can solo, even though it is certainly not balanced.<br />
<br />
For grouping, the game is easy enough that you can get away with stuff like having no healer and a pet tank through an instance.  So for the most part people are happy too.<br />
<br />
For PvP, Blizzard knows very well that an extremely imbalanced PvP game is balanced from their previous experiences in RTS games, because the overpowered people will do everything they can to squash opposition so they can continue to enjoy being overpowered.  For example you see alliance clearly has an advatage PvP (have more people), and clearly some classe are harder to kill in PvP than others, but that's okay because the side that's powerful is the majority (at least relative to the weaker side) who will drown out legitmate concerns anyway.<br />
<br />
It is not that WoW is balanced, it is just not relevant to most of what you're doing, especialy for PvP.  It hardly matters if you're an overpowered class when you're ganked 3 to 1 anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right clicking weapons to Equip them is too much hassle?  Come on now, the most you'd EVER have to do is manually remove your shield in a weapon swap, and that's only if you're going to DW from Sword/Board, and you might as well just go to 2h if you're going to do that and bypass it all.  This is seriously not an issue at all, and I'd prefer they work on about 1000 other tweaks before they bother with this one since weapon swapping is already 10x faster in this game than any other I've played.<br />
<br />
I guess you've never played Diablo 2, a Blizzard game.  This doesn't just benefit warriors.  It would benefit  any char that needs to change weapons depending on the situation.  One shouldn't need to spend hours setting up macros to switch weps, or constantly have a bag open while in combat.  That just doesn't make sense, a fighter rifling through bags in combat searching for a wep while he's taking a beating from a monster.<br />
<br />
This would make it so there is a bonus for being in Defensive, and there would never be any reason to use Battle.  There's a reason that there's different stances, and it's because there are different situations for using them.  Defensive is perfectly fine as is, and does not need an upgrade like this.  Ditto with the Berseker change.  It makes both of them MORE useful than battle in all circumstances, and that's not how they're supposed to be.  <br />
<br />
 I disagree, since one can't use many abilities in defensive, including POTIONS, I don't see many solo or PvP warriors running around constantly in defensive.  All I would propose is a buff to these stances to make them more situational.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason for a 35 rage number at all, other than for the mortal strike freaks. This is frivilous.  The way the class is set up is to encourage you to pick a stance and use it for awhile. <br />
<br />
 In no way do I see that Bliz intended for warriors to chose a stance and use it 99% of the time.  The change would remove the penalty for the player to actually use his head and adapt his fighting to the situation.  Currently, without TM talent, a warrior might as well just stay in Battle and autoattack.  Any attempt to adapt just puts him farther behind the situation.  The 35 rage is indeed for MS, the ONLY decent Teir7 talent at a warriors disposal.<br />
<br />
Retarded beyond belief.  See above.  You're not supposed to have all skills available all the time.  I realize some people have been playing with cheat codes on for all these years, but as I said before, Balance =/= overpowering a class.<br />
<br />
 How is giving a player a more enjoyable, but less effective way to play his complex char retarded?  One may coast through the game in battle with this change, but in no way would he be as effective as a player who utilized all 3 stances.  This would also promote the changes to DEF and BER stances.  Give the player choices and reward him for making them.<br />
<br />
Battle shout is already the best damage per rage point ability we have, especially in groups of 5.  It doesn't need a buff.<br />
<br />
So, you think it's okay for Paladins to cast a 5min buff whenever they want , in combat or not, without a single talent spent.  But, warriors are required to use 20 rage points every 2min or less to achieve a similar effect.  Rage is almost our only way of tuanting and increasing DPS, why should be sacrifice a chunk nearly every battle?  I just want it brought more in line with similar buffs.<br />
<br />
The rest of your talent suggestions are basically completely ridiculous, and it's clear that you gave no thought at all to them other than &quot;WE NEED MORE DAMAGE!&quot;<br />
<br />
You do understand that the damage you deal generates rage right?  And by dealing the fuckin insane amount of damage that you'd want, we'd have infinite rage right?  And you do realize that the game is designed around us NOT having infinite rage? <br />
<br />
You're right!  That's why I offered suggestions for ungimping Anticipation and widening the gap between warrior and paladin hitpoints.  Warriors in any RPG are supposed to be the masters of armed combat.  I want the warriors put ahead of the other fighters in terms of weapon mastery.  That's not to say warriors should out DPS rogues.  Rogue abilities with their weapons should always outdamage warriors due to the sacrifice in mitigation and defence they suffer.  As for rage, I don't see why Blizzard couldn't scale down rage numbers to account for the increase in warrior DPS.<br />
<br />
There are things that need a slight tweak in this game.  None of the things that you listed are in that category.<br />
<br />
You're entitled to your own opinion.  I hope talking to yourself never gets old.  Thanks for the clarification though.  Your first responce was less than helpful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that you lose all your rage is the intent.  If they wanted you to be able to use all abilities all the time, it wouldn't happen.  They encourage you to play smart and figure out what you're going to need beforehand.  Once you learn that, you are old enough to unlock TM and get 3 or 5 ranks to handle your situations better if you prefer to spend points on it.  Once again, god mode isn't how this is gonna work.<br />
<br />
 How is giving a player a more enjoyable, but less effective way to play his complex char retarded? <br />
<br />
What you're asking for isn't less effective, it's &quot;I'm too lazy to switch stances when I need certain abilities.&quot;  This is a men from the boys type thing and it exists in all blizzard games.  You can do things the easy way and get by for the beginning of the game, but later on you're going to need to learn how to do more complicated things or you're not going to progress.  All of my mobs in instances end up hamstrung, even tho I prefer to be in defensive for the aggro generation.  How do I do it?  Well, by golly, it must be fucking magic.<br />
<br />

<br />
Mental note...paladins are not warriors.  The warrior's augment to his group is by being a leader IN BATTLE.<br />
<br />
That being said, it's not hard to pop bloodrage every 2 minutes and have your  20 rage to shout.   I guess that never occured to you either.  Don't try to tell me it's inneffective either...you're either in a group where there is enough healing to use it, or you're soloing and you can easily make up for the 10 seconds it takes to use it by slapping a bandage on as soon as you hit bloodrage.  I'm starting to see why you think you need all these improvements.</div></div><hr />

But here's another solution for it involving cosmos, put your sword/board set up in and type /saveset 1, then make a hotkey that says /loadset 1 and everytime you hit that hotkey you'll load your sword/board set up, do the same for your dw/2hand set up or whatever else blows your skirt up.  <br />
Hope that helped a bit, Aka</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now whether they've time to implement every thing that 'would be nice' is another question entirely.  Until they do just use Cosmos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some good points made regarding being willing to use all the abilities that Warriors bring to the table and that sometimes is going to require stance changes.  I see some problems with this though in that if you're in a group where you need lots of aggro control, that means you need lots of rage to dump onto mobs.  And losing rage switching stances makes it more difficult to hold that aggro.  It's teeter tater kind of thing, which is not something required by the other classes to a high degree, that I've seen.  So it appears to me that playing a Warrior well in an instance requires an even higher level of skill, ability to anticipate, knowledge of the class' capabilities than is required for any of the other classes.  Which means to me that when I'm in an instance I'm working my ass off all the time while my group may be in cruise mode.<br />
<br />
My Warrior is now level 51.  I spend perhaps 15% of my time in instances, maybe 5% or 10% in small groups outside of instances, and the rest solo.  And I'm finding it harder and harder to solo effectively as I level.  It seems that the Warrior class becomes less effective solo as it levels rather than more.  I'm finding that the AH doesn't offer any more significant improvements and that the flow of gear begins to slow to a trickle past level 50.  And I'm finding that the quests get harder to do alone with a higher precentage of them being elite quests that are typically in an instance.<br />
<br />
So, I'm about ready to table my Warrior indefinitely, because the class doesn't support the majority of my playing time well at all.  If I were spending more like 80% of my time in instances perhaps I'd feel better about the class as a whole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, now that I've played the warrior for a while...the other classes just don't seem that involved and immersive.  I get so bored with them, since on my warrior I've got all these abilities I can do and I have to trade off since I only have so much rage.<br />
<br />
I've tried the Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Mage, and Hunter so far (and a tiny bit if Warlock).  All of them bore me so much I end up deleting them...except the Hunter.  The Hunter seems to be closest to the level of interaction I have with the Warrior, so I'll be working along that as an alt until further notice.  I might try Priest or Shaman soon, and see how they are, but I'm not getting my hopes up.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is a side effect of my time as a (Battle) Cleric in EQ, and classes just completely bore me unless I keep track of lots of stuff at once (which I have to as a warrior, but not so much with other classes).<br />

<br />
I don't object so much to the idea that in an instance I'm going to have to be on my toes even more than anyone else in the group.  While I can find it aggravating at times, I could live with it.  What I object to the most with the class is the apparent reduction in the ability to successfully and enjoyably solo as you level.  Quests slow way down and unless you're grinding on things that are substantially below your level, risks go way up.  No emergency escape abilities beyond retaliation, which is certainly not a guarantee of survival if you get an add and has way too long a refresh timer to really be that useful.  No inherant movement rate increase, unlike most every other class.   And nothing else in the way of really useful solo skills beyond something like hamstring.  The class seems very weak in the ways I spend the majority of my time.</div></div><hr />

I'd be happy with a warrior only improved hitrate, as we'd be generating rage and doing a wee bit more damage than before, which would help out a LOT in our ability to keep and maintain agro. I wouldn't want much more than that, as the job of keeping agro on the warrior is not the warriors job alone.<br />
<br />
Having some weapon-based, non-talent improvements would make me pretty happy as well. I'd like it to actually be a choice between say, an axe and a mace, other than &quot;ok, this one has +10 AGI, but the other has 1-2 more DPS...&quot;. I realize that there are arms talents, but its touted that we are the master of weaponry and arms, and even a slight enhancement for varying weapon types would make things a little more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">01-16-2005, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats probably a little overkill.  The main thing Wow warriors hurt somewhat bad in right now is PvE solo.  We handle adds rather poorly, and can't do elites anything near how the other classes can from our lack of healing and our lack of burst damage.<br />
<br />
However, as I'm learning, post 40 anyways (Where mobs actually hit hard enough to scratch the paint on my armor), in instances warriors dominate.  This is coming from a 49 protection specc'd (the really underpowered as the numbers go) war.  I find in most cases lately I have near limitless rage, and at least decent damage output, particularly if I can get a couple of mobs to hit.  <br />
<br />
War is an extremely busy class in WoW to be really effective at.  It's almost EQ bardlike now that I think about it.  I can tank 3-4 mobs without too much difficulty, but it requires a fair amount of target switching and skills unloaded on them.<br />
<br />
Just tonight we were splitting up some giants in maraudon,  the pally (47) and a rogue (48) paired off on the one giant while I took the other.  By the time they finished it off, I had nearly had the one half dead solo.  I suspect I could've done better if I wasn't defensive spec.   Thats a pretty good testament to sunder armor, and our general overall effectiveness.<br />
<br />
As far as changes go, I would like to see an Acc + talent put in, and thunderclap revamped (Talent) slightly as far as either its' damage, or it's slow duration is concerned.  Tactical mastery could go away, but it's a good predecessor to anger management, which while underwhelming in itself, produces 1 rage ~ 3 sec in combat.  It also keeps a good amount of diversity in the arms tree.<br />
<br />
The general suggested changes seem to be way overpowering to war would be able to do, particularly one specc'd arms or fury.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really think that Tactical Mastery should be a skill and not a talent.  At Rank 5, level (checks ass for a number) ... 50, lessay, you can retain 25 Rage when shifting stances, if yer willing to dump the gold down.  Just moving that out of the Talent tree would go a long way towards buffing up the class without putting us up over the moon.  Putting an Accuracy Talent in place of it works well, or a Dual Weilding one.  Talents should be useful, not necessary.<br />
<br />
Move Flurry up a tier in the tree, or improve it.  A Shaman can learn it 10 levels earlier for 10 less points invested than a Warrior.  I guess all that time learning magic spells gives them an edge in combat ... or ... eh ... well, wtf to that.  It's not as if we get a powerful Warrior variant, it's the same useful but middlin' party trick.<br />
<br />
That's what they make alts for, Glatius. No class in this game is perfect, and the system seems very generous on allowing you to have alts.That quote reads like so :: Who cares if the warrior class is flawed?  Other classes are working fine, play one of those.  Bring your warrior out to play when someone needs you.<br />

From the WoW General Screeching boards ::<br />
What I can tell you is this. I can tell you we sent a slew of compiled Warrior concerns to the development team. I can tell you they agree that Warriors are not performing as well as they should be in various situations. I can tell you they're doing what they can to remedy those issues with the class. This doesn't say *working as intended* to me.<br />
<br />
Yar, it's a good class, it's usually fun to play, but we have leap more hoops te be effective than others do to excel.  We're screwed as main tanks if the group doesn't co-operate.  We hit brick walls before other classes, and have hurdles that other classes don't. Holding aggro in a group?  Remember to credit your group.  We should be dancing like this to be superb - not to be effective.<br />
<br />
Oh, and cycling through weapon setups with a button push, or per stance is glorious compared to the ol' right click to equip.  Stance Sets (http://capnbry.net/wow/) apparently has a bug with cycling past a two-handed weapon, but I like it.  Peeling WeaponSets out of Cosmos works well too.</div></div><hr />

Well it was a particularly bad night, I was a bit outta sorts but overall my sentiment is as I wrote it.  I don't think it'd take much to redress the issues with the warrior class, either.  My warrior is certainly workable, I'm just not so sure it's working properly.  Which of course may be due to all the gnomish engineering I glued to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My warrior is certainly workable, I'm just not so sure it's working properly. <br />
<br />
I think rage is the key.  A mage or a warlock knows for a fact exactly how much mana they have to work with.  The same holds true for a priest, shaman, or druid.  A rogue gets a set amount of energy and his energy refreshes at a pretty steady rate.  A hunter has more mana than he knows what to do with and non-stop firing won't deplete it.  The warrior on the other hand starts with very minimal rage and has to seriously work at generating it and at saving it.  Wait too long between pulls?  Sorry, rage goes bye bye.  Want to hold aggro?   Good bye rage, forget about doing pretty much anything else.  And so on.<br />
<br />
Rage, how it's generated and used, needs a serious adjustment.  There may still be room for a modification or two after that, but rage mods would be a big step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

Whoa, maybe you need to step back and reread what you quoted.  You obviously completely misread it.  In fact, looking at your reaction, I would have no clue you even read what you quoted.  It sounds more like your personal comment rather than a reaction to what I said.  Just how do you translate &quot;No class is perfect&quot; to &quot;Other classes are working fine, play one of those&quot;?  I'm not even sure if you translated through Japanese, to Korean, to French, Spanish, then German and then back to English you could come to that conclusion.<br />
<br />
No class in this game is perfect.  That's entirely true.  Each class has their flaws, their problems, their weaknesses.  Have you forgotten just how much this game encourages alts?  Between the mail system and rested experience, it's very feasible to play an alt that is also just as fun as the main without giving up on the main at all.<br />
<br />
My whole statement was for Glatius' comment that he's not finding the class as much fun as he did before.  Every game gets repetitive, especially when you stick to only one character your entire time.  He doesn't have to play a warrior, no one's making him, and I was simply saying that when one class starts frustrating you, playing an alt to get a totally different experience is a rather fun thing to do.</div></div><hr />

I didn't think you meant it the way I read it, I wasn't just blowing smoke up yer ... hey hey!  You quoted that line, and I'm certain that you read it.  Cuz I've read many of yer posts, and yer no dummy.  But both of those paragraphs were equally significant, parts of a whole thought, with the second split off to further emphasize it's content.  You're right, it did sound like a personal reaction - it was a personal reaction.  My quoted paragraph there was the big highlighter to indicate that.<br />
<br />
To fully lay the thing out, just so's I can be on the record.  The comment in question wasn't a reaction to *No class in this game has blue suede shoes*.  It was a reaction to a warrior expressing that he no longer finds the class suitable, and the proffered response *That's what they make alts for ...*.  That triggered the reflexive interpretation *Other classes are working fine, play one of those.*, which I framed in the rhetoric of days gone by, from other class bawl outs.  <br />
<br />
Because *Comments like that remind me of bad days. It's not your fault, but I'm retching and I wanted to share.*.  In other words, old familiar bells are ringing in my ears (thru the tinnitus), and I am having an adverse personal reaction.  Which had nothing to do with you directly, it wasn't yer fault.  Just a resonance thing.<br />
<br />
I was reasonably certain you didn't mean it the way it hit, as certain as I can be on winter nights, when my physic powers are quescient.  And so I added that other paragraph I was talking about earlier, to make that perfectly clear.  At least, such was my intent.  Coulda but didna do it better. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought long and hard about even posting on this thread.  I don't know if Warriors are broken.  I honestly have no problem soloing (equal to or +1 to 2 level mobs higher) or grouping.  We could use some tweaks I believe.  Warriors were insanely powerful in Beta, then they reduced us a lot, I think we just need a middle ground.  <br />
<br />
I don't know.  I seriously don't see, at least at level 51 with limited PvP and raiding at this point, how/where we're broken that much.  Maybe my perspective will change once I start doing those more.  The biggest problem I see with a lot of Warriors I group with is that they don't use all their abilities/stances to their advantage.  They may spam thunderclap (worthless mostly imo), or heroic, and maybe a rend, but that's it.  Completely underutilizing the class.  <br />
<br />
Sure Pallys can survive a lot longer than us.  As it should be.  But really they do not have great dps.  I've seen Pallys survive some incredible things, but they're oom and almost dead when they do.  <br />
<br />
I was fighting Ogres in Burning Steps (50-53, I'm 51), and averaging about 150 DPS, with some spike over 200.  I even took on two level 51 mobs at once (not intentionally!, and one was a caster which helped) at once and lived without blowing any timed discs.  No it wasn't easy, but if Warriors were truly gimped or sucked, there's no way I'd be able to do any of that.  And my gear is nothing special,  best thing I have is my Truesilver champ which I made myself.  <br />
<br />
Sure escapability can be an issue.  Few things you do here though.  First careful with pulls, if you get two mobs, just run.  90% of the time I can outrun a bad pull.  If I get aggro that I don't want, I either use a potion, time disc, or I just hamstring both of them and run. (pulls or aggro of 3 or more equal to or higher level mobs will usually kill any class, maybe not a pally but most others) If you have piercing howl (I know its talents to get it etc.), that's a great escape ability.  And also when I solo I'm always panning the camera around watching for roamers etc.  If I see one heading in my direction I'll start to back up and manuever my mob and myself so it doesn't aggro.  <br />
<br />
Again, not ranting at anyone, and not saying we don't need loving cause we do.  But I honestly don't think Warriors suck nearly as much as lots are saying.  (God the Blizzard boards are a pit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're still thinking of this game like EQ where even beating one mob of your level is an accomplishment.  In WoW half of the class are expected to beat 3 mobs 2 levels higher than they are without breaking a sweat.  Ever done any of those escort quests that the game expects you to protect some NPC from 3-4 NPCs that are the same level as you?  Those quests aren't elite because certain classes can do that with ease (and some can't, but that's balance for you).<br />
<br />
What you don't realize in your example is that just about every other class can either:<br />
<br />
1.  Win trivially<br />
2.  Escape trivially<br />
<br />
And some can do both... and just about everyone does more DPS than you to boot.<br />
<br />
Now how often are you going to try to fight 3 mobs 2 levels higher than you just because you can?  Not very often, but it says a lot about class balance.  There seems to be a long time perpetuated myth from the EQ days that someone who solos well doesn't group well when nothing can be further from the truth, with the sole exception being the EQ Warrior.</div></div><hr />

At lvl 42 having no trouble soloing elites give or take a lvl or two around me. All it takes is a bandage maybe a meal after the fight and I can go for hours.... Retaliation/Sweeping Strikes/Cleave make multi mob pulls or 2-4 doable if you don't panic.... potions in combat make surviving bad pulls alot easier.... hamstring/piercing howl when you need to run.... And if you die... so what no penalty and 30 sec-1 min run to your corpse... my god all of these make WoW incredibly warrior friendly compared to what EQ gave us. Would love to see Flurry a tier up in the talents but hey cant have my cake and eat it too. Not to mention a warrior in PvP is viable in WoW so many skills to use against every type of class. Heck even Rogues with their dps cant take an equal lvl warrior all the time. And Casters can't root and nuke us down like they could in EQ (Ornate Mithril Boots and Pummel are useful against this). Fear a hunters pet with intimidating shout and hamstring him and hes yours all night long. I'm just saying if you make use of the many skills and talents a warrior was given in WoW you can do so much. And most of the suggestions of talents were rediculously overpowered....weapon swapping made to a quick key is nice, but not a major issue, I would rather Blizzard spent time on more pressing concerns like Server stability. Just my 2cp<br />

Agreeing to the post 2 up......</div></div><hr />

I dont see that expectation, or even that ability, at higher levels.  Maybe at lower levels but thats kinda moot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly don't either.  Anywhere I need to beat multiple mobs=to or higher than my level is a group situation.  Beating one mob my level or even a level higher is trivial to me.  In instances sure I'm expected to tank multiple mobs.  But in WoW the non-elite quests are 90% soloable for me.</div></div><hr />

There are players who can do this , but they're gonna be at the edge of death when they finish.  They're gonna have to be very well geared and propely spec'd for it as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted, a lot of people seem to even forget how to solo in a group setting.  You'll see casters perfectly willing to tank a mob that no one else is on to the death without even trying to run (not that it'd help, but it'd at least slow down the inevitable).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior soloing is not one of our finer aspects.  I find it generally annoying that any other class can pretty much blow through whatever we're doing in half the time, and typically has less downtime to boot. (Possible exception of priests and druids.)  A little more damage in this reguard would be nice, but then I'm protection specc'd so I really can't griep.<br />
<br />
No class however, is strengthened as much in a group setting as warriors are.  Their soloing ability helps, but war w/wo groups isn't even a worthwhile comparison in our effectiveness between the 2.</div></div><hr />

I did the Kodo Caravan quest in Desolace when it was orange to me.  I was 36 or 37 I think, and it spawned mobs that were 38-40.<br />

So everybody else can solo easier than a warrior.  None of em can truely take the hits we can.  Its a trade off.  Sounds like they got it right to me frankly.<br />

I'm very happy they made their &quot;awesome&quot; changes.  The warrior in closed beta didnt sound like any kind of mmo warrior.  Sounded more like a first person shooter than a dice game.  I love all the resentment folks in general harbor for this change.  Like its their game and the people who design/code it are morons who hate the class (not picking on you in particular seveirn).  Blizzard went from being the percieved saviour of the mmo world to being the devil in one change.  Folks didnt even try it out, they just bitched.  Yea, I'm glad they're willing to do unpopular things that benifit the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
We did get a bit of a buff last time around. Even though they botched it somewhat with the client side bug with intercept, we still got buffed with the bloodrage &amp; intercept changes.  All the Mortal Strike little Conan's bleed like a stuck pig over the MS &quot;nerf&quot; (even though only a few weapons truely got nerfed) and barely acknowledged the buff we got.  Actually, I think MS got buffed in that round too by making it so if you missed a MS you only got charged 5 rage instead of the full 30.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, most of these lil pricks seem to be giving up and rerolling as a combat rogue or a paladin.  Just fine by me.</div></div><hr />

Its not just the solo part.  How many of you folks play on a pvp server?  Being able to handle multible mobs is a testament on how you handle being ganked.  When you are roaming the country side as your warrior, are there classes you do NOT go near, because you are sure it would entitle death?  For me the priest class and shamens seem to do the trick, I usually don't attack them first.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Its because they have multiple lives, have utility enough to handle me and whatever they are fighting, and woop my butt in good time.  I'm only lvl 50 so I haven't seen the end end game yet.  I ganked an undead priest in darkshire the other day and he didn't put up a fight.  When he did fight back, he landed 2 spells on me (instants mind you) that did close to 600 damage after the ticks.  Btw, he's lvl 34.<br />
<br />
If he was anywhere near my lvl, I would have been dead.  Warriors in pvp are pretty horrible and the lack of being able to solo multiple mobs just proves this.  We have only one life, and you had better reduce their life to zero in 10-20 secs or else its over.  The other classes have utilities and healing powers that grant them many lives.  For our lack of healing, we should definately be tougher or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, warriors get their asses handed to them 1v1 and if you play on a PvP server I suggest you hunt in packs, not solo.  In PvP I've found the warrior class most effective as a spoiler type, charging in and screwing up the other teams game plan, than some kind of walking nuclear bomb that folks thought they we're entilted to.  <br />

We die a lot in PvE.  We die alot in PvP.  We drink and we die and continue to drink.  Ahh, such is the way of the warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you make it so a mob does less than 1/6 of a warrior's HP's in the time it takes to kill said mob, then there has to be a drastic scaling in things that are meant to be raid or group targets, otherwise it wouldn't even be fun.  It would just be a straight mow down of everything in sight with a warrior and anyone who could cast a heal spell.<br />
<br />
Unless you've got any bright ideas on how you can change this simple fact without completely redesigning every instance and elite encounter in the game in a manner that you really don't want them to change them in, then I suggest you either decide to be a warrior, or decide to be a shaman or a paladin.</div></div><hr />

------------------------------------ <br />
<br />
Welcome to the forums. I know there is a lot of various discussions and questions going around today so I am hoping to consolidate them somewhat. <br />
<br />
Class questions/suggestions <br />
Regarding class balance issues, we have asked the dev team to look further into the following. Please be aware that any proposed changes take time to occur, which is why the discussions have been so many, and the feedback not as many. <br />
<br />
Hit/miss ratio concerns - Some players say they miss all the time. Some players say they miss in succession some of the time. We are trying to determine what exactly the problem is. Please remember, unless your weapon skill is maxed out for your current level, misses will be an issue. We are investigating why players who are maxed out on weapon skill are still missing. <br />
<br />
Warriors - We are aware of many players who say the warrior is lacking utility. We picked out the most well-developed thoughts on this matter from the player base and have presented them to the dev team for their analysis. <br />
<br />
Warlocks - As with the Warrior class, the most well-developed concerns regarding the Warlock class have been made aware of the dev team. <br />
<br />
If you have questions outside of these 4 points (this is the extent of info we have right now, but that might change through the course of the day), please feel free to ask them here. <br />
<br />
[Language mod] <br />
We have brought up this issue, but it must first be investigated. <br />
<br />
[Realm/Login] <br />
All levels of the organization are working to address this. I would like to stress that real progress is being made on the issue behind the scenes, and again, we are all fans of the game and want as much to rid of these problems as much as our players. I know the perception is contrary to that, but there aren't enough words to express how much dedication, from the president on down, is going into resolving these issues. <br />
<br />
[Mage] <br />
Water - I will ask for some feedback, not sure why there wouldn't be higher end water. <br />
Arcane Missle - I believe QA is still looking into this matter. <br />
<br />
[Character migration] <br />
We plan to offer a 1 time migration from high population realms to low peopulation realms to ease the overcrowding. It is currently undergoing implementation/testing. More details to follow.</div></div><hr />

Then I hit lvl 30 and it was all over.  Once you get berserk its over.  If you are in Fury stance, you can break their fear with berserk.  That and they can't cast it on you again for a bit allows you to intercept back and finish them off.  With reckless or the glimmering mithril trinket, they can't really do much to you anymore.<br />

Get cosmos with its /equip and /unequip commands and macro them.  Works MUCH better than trying to use your mouse.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, not right now it aint.  If that really were the case there would be a forced cooldown between stance changes.  Instead we have this notion that you can change stances instantly, but it makes you completly 100% calm.  Uhhh.. yea.. right.. sure.<br />
<br />
And I really dont see any reason we should loose it all for changing the way we stand.<br />
<br />
I can understand that they might want us to pick a stance and use it.  If they really meant it, there would be a cooldown after you switched.  Instead we have this talent point sink called Tatical Mastery.  Its annoying, but hey, its one fun ass game.  I'll play it either way =)<br />
<br />
huh? How is that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Totally agree. And for the record, CRIT is one of our best friends in PVP and PVE even. Not to mention it activates a couple of our most useful skills? Ever hear of Flurry or Deep Wounds?</div></div><hr />
