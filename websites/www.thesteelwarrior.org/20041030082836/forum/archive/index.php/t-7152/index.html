i am lvl 37 and use architeps scepter for my a1hand blunt and i have like 10k if i need upgrades. i could also sell my ceremonial iksar chestplate if it isnt worth having. i also dont have a 2hs weapon. if u guys have any suggestions it would help. anyt help is appriciated. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">upgrade one of the rings with a 6/65 ring. one of your earrings needs upgrade. where is your helmet? one of your bracers could probably stand an upgrade. the whole upgrade project should get you considerable improvement for even a few kpp.<br />
<br />
at your level and equipment budget i would stress ac hp and sta. 1sta is worth about 6hp and 1ac is worth 6-10 ac at your level. maybe less at higher level but by those levels you will be replacing them again.<br />
<br />
sell the sotbs and buy it back in your 50s. you are way to far below the rec level for that. the iksar bp which doesnt show in your magelo is still probably useful at your level in spite of its poor stats but unless you solo alot id say you are giving up a lot of purchasing power to keep it.</div></div><hr />
