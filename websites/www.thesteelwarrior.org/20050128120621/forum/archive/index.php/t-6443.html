That said, how the hell did you end up with a loss?  I've ended adventures due to server downs, crashes (a few as a result of trying to Earthshaker/Ramp some of them) and server crashes.  I didn't notice any of them as being &quot;losses&quot; anyhow.<br />

Its more of the princple as the loss was not on any part my fault.  If they can do this, the what next?  Unexpected unretreivable item losses when servers go down?

if you didn't know pre-start they should at least rewind your toon to a save previous to you starting your mission. i don't think it'd be a big deal.</div></div><hr />

I really don't think that SoE will equate taking an LDoN loss (which means nothing) to losing all your gear.</div></div><hr />

With 54 wins you're nowhere near showing up on the leaderboard, so you're the only one that's gonna see that 1 in the loss column anyhow, and you know it wasn't your fault.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That happens. And has been happening for a lot longer than LDoN ever existed.<br />
<br />
The worst part is ... these days, good luck finding a GM to replace your lost gear.<br />
<br />
Anyways ... I have I think 6 LDoN losses right now. 3 are due to similar things ... completely not my fault. I don't really care. In fact this is the first time I've mentioned it. I only mention it in an effort to let you know you're not alone out there. Many of us have had losses in LDoN due to bugs, crashes, patches, whatever. <br />
<br />
You won't get your record restored. But eh, I wouldn't worry about it. If you're upset about your winning percentage going down for statistics reasons, 54-1 is still much better than most people out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While it does suck to have your record tarnished by a server outage, yesterday there were some clear warning signs of an emergency patch. Most of the zones had little to no mobs in them (first clue), there were pink spell icons (second clue), and the sky was really fubar (third and final clue). For me anyway, 3 things like that...no way I was going to do LDON until it was fixed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry to hear about the loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever loot something shortly before servers go down? Yep, the loot poofs sometimes, and 99% of the time you'll never see shit from a GM about getting it back. Especially if they roll the server back enough, can lose things up to 1 or 2 hours prior to servers going down, if you're in game when it goes down rather than actually sitting and camping.  Has been happening a while too, I remember years ago having about half of an NToV raid worth of loot poof when the server crashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what do you expect SoE to do?  Rewind everyones character that was in an LDoN on every server or remove the loss from every character that lost due to the server outage?  Do you expect them to take the time for everyone who lost due to the server outage to confirm that they all actually lost the mission during the time the server went down?  Of course they have to confirm the time you lost or everyone would be clammoring to have a loss taken off their record.  Then if they do it for one person, of course they have to do it for all.  They have to have a policy, and the policy of not taking away the loss just makes the most sense.<br />
<br />
I can see how it would suck to have a perfect record tarnished, but I still think that you just need to suck it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i still cant figure out how the server knows you lost if the server crashed. you shouldnt be credited with a loss until you actually lose. talk about getting back what you would have lost to a crash from a gm. ldon losses are &quot;given back to us&quot; without even needing a gm's assistance and like i said i still cant figure out how the server knows we lost if the server crashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't think of it that way....  You're right, if the server crashes, why does it credit you with a loss?  It must have a record of your adventure and then when it comes back up the time on that record of your adventure has expired so it credits you with a loss, or something along those lines.  It should not do that...  if the server goes down I think all adventures should be cleared out so that you don't end up with a win or a loss.  Either that or just give everyone who got kicked out a win.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
An easy way would be simply making a note of the time when you start the adventure, and then if you're still active in an adventure it checks again. If it's beyond the allowed time, it marks you with a loss, regardless of if that's 1 minute or 8 hours past. Could be some other way, but that's one simple method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I am about 30 and 10.  Most of the losses have been close and have been collections, lost a couple rescues I think also.  But 95% of the time we do it with 4, War, Shm, Clr, Ench, so our DPS is kind of low...  But we've only had one wipe in the past 30 adventures or so.  The room looked ok, could only see one mob, so didn't consider pacifying, stepped into the room and along comes the other five mobs sitting next to the door.  Six freaking mobs in one pull...  ouch.  I hate it when they put tons of mobs right on the sides of the entrance to a room so when you step in the whole room aggros.</div></div><hr />

Oh goody.  Perhaps I didn't post very clearly but I mean that my guildmates and I all have left on quite a number of adventurers because we all found something else to do that was more interesting.  Most of the crew I do LDoNs with have between 150 and 300 wins, one more here and there isn't exactly going to make or break anything.</div></div><hr />

The unexpected patch on 3/30, which on Quellious was only announced 15 minutes ahead of time, caused me to lose the adventure I was currently in, as well a spoil my perfect 54-0 record.  I have looked on the offical EQ forum and ask around in the game, the general consensus is that my loss is irrevisable.  I have so far sent a petition in game and a e-mail to the contact GM link at the official website.

<br />
And yes I am the type of person that will leave an LDON if my guild says &quot;we are raiding here: please hustle!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would take unnessecary CPU cycles and resources to have a running counter created and ticking away for every character in LDoN to not do it this way.  Save the date to your characters record in the database, then check it against the current date and time.  If the current date and time subtracted by the stored date and time is greater than 90 minutes, you've lost.</div></div><hr />
