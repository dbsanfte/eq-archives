<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aratus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't look like you're doing bad at all for a level 60, non-ND3 warrior. Some more HP's would be a plus for a safety in PoP though. <br />
<br />
Your equipment is pretty good for your level, just work on the ND's when you can. Some upgrades to what you have: <br />
<br />
Tracking Wolf Collar/Clattering Bone Necklace. Both of these are dirt cheap an' much better overall to that Mithril Torque. You might want to invest in a Darkmetal Visor, or better depending on how much cash you want to fork over.<br />
<br />
Grab some plate gaunts from ToV if you can. An' replace the cloak with Iksar Hide Cape/Hierophant's Cloak/Or any other high HP's cloak.<br />
<br />
You can upgrade your shoulders with Draconic Pauldrons too. You have some Myrmidon armor so I'm assuming you're on CoV faction.<br />
<br />
Replace the Nightmare Bow eventually too... it's a nice bow and all but light on the HP's.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I don't see much of a problem. The upgrades I mentioned above would only run you about 10k or so, and they'd probably take you past 4k HP's. Well, that's all I know. &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />
