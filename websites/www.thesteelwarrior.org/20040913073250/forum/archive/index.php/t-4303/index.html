<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">LoL. Best quote yet from Furor's writing on Worlds of Warcraft:<br />
<br />
&quot;Taunt in the World of Warcraft requires the use of Rage, has no effective Cooldown or refresh, and adds/builds up hate towards the Warrior instead of the train wreck which is taunt in Everquest. Speaking of Everquest, EQ Warriors should pay close attention here, if you're playing World of Warcraft, you will encounter a strange and new sensation while playing the Warrior. Once the initial shock wears off, you will realize that when you press 'Taunt' it actually taunts your opponent – it does not fail and end up doing absolutely nothing – it is always building up hate, so long as you have the necessary amount of Rage built up to make use of the ability. It's like reinventing the wheel, or as I like to call it, COMMON SENSE.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd ask if Sony were paying attention, but I think they're too busy &quot;looking into&quot; possible good ideas on how to maybe help melee classes sometime in the next 3 to 4 months, if time and mana permits.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My good friend just downloaded and started playing the external alpha last night.  He immediately gives me a call, and suddenly I didnt have any desire to play EQ.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From the FoH front page - Furor's full description of WoW's take on..<br />
<br />
The Warrior<br />
<br />
Where to even begin? As many of you know, this is the class I play and have played for the past 5 years in Everquest. Comparing the two Warrior classes, Everquest versus the World of Warcraft, is like comparing your skinny cousin with the bad acne to Superman. World of Warcraft has a definitive advantage over Everquest, in that the classes are not as watered down and diluted, allowing for much more power to be allotted to individual classes. Sure there is another Tank class (The Paladin and to a lesser degree the Shaman and Druids can do some light tanking, but I digress) but he does not totally usurp the Warrior class, and in Warcraft our friend the Warrior is pissed off and packing something I like to call 'the pain.'<br />
<br />
The Warrior is a class with depth. Aside from being a master of weaponry and armor, they are able to fight in three distinct stances (I was told that this may very well change, either reducing the number of stances or increasing them - it's in Alpha still people!). Additionally, a warriors special abilities come from two pools. <br />
<br />
First are the abilities the warrior may draw upon from becoming enraged, known as gaining 'Rage.' Gaining Rage is essentially the reverse of the Spellcaster's mana bar which exists in Everquest and other MMORGs. A warrior starts at zero Rage and gains Rage totally dependant upon the stance they are in and the actions they take while in the stance (more on this to come). Rage decays when the Warrior is not in battle, resetting to zero when the Warrior is at peace (think Hulk).<br />
<br />
The second pool with which they draw their power from are their shouts. As a warrior levels and gains power, they also gain the ability to perform shouts. Shouts can have various effects on the warrior, their group, or on the enemies they fight. One shout may increase the overall damage of your party, bolstering their spirits and weapon speed, while another shout may cause the warrior's targets to flee (something that could be very useful to the soloing warrior who gets more than he can handle while adventuring). No, you will not be able to 'twist' shouts - these are not Everquest Bards.<br />
<br />
Naturally the warrior gets a taunt ability. Taunt in the World of Warcraft requires the use of Rage, has no effective Cooldown or refresh, and adds/builds up hate towards the Warrior instead of the train wreck which is taunt in Everquest. Speaking of Everquest, EQ Warriors should pay close attention here, if you're playing World of Warcraft, you will encounter a strange and new sensation while playing the Warrior. Once the initial shock wears off, you will realize that when you press 'Taunt' it actually taunts your opponent – it does not fail and end up doing absolutely nothing – it is always building up hate, so long as you have the necessary amount of Rage built up to make use of the ability. It's like reinventing the wheel, or as I like to call it, COMMON SENSE. Certainly high DPS classes can overaggro if they are not careful, but the World of Warcraft warrior is well equipped to deal with the absent minded mages and rogues of the gameworld. Hallelujah!<br />
<br />
Stances<br />
<br />
The Battle Stance: When taking a Battle Stance, the warrior is a balanced fighting machine. In this stance, the warrior gains Rage from taking damage/hits and dishing out damage. As the Rage bar builds up, the warrior is able to perform special moves and abilities which cost a certain amount of Rage. Intrigued? You should be. These abilities are many, and can range from a simple extra attack at early levels, such as kick, to as Tigole said, 'AE Whoopass' which is the Whirlwind ability, gained later on in the Warrior's life. A side note here, in Warcraft you won't ever have 5 mobs messed/crowd controlled in your camp in a normal adventure group. The warrior is meant to dish out the AE damage, taunts, shouts; trying to keep some control of the chaos which will inevitably find you and your friends. Which stance you use will be totally dependant on the situation. With all that said, the Battle Stance is something Warriors will probably use most often when soloing.<br />
<br />
The Defensive Stance: If you're going to be tanking in your group or raid, you're going to want to be in this stance. While in the Defensive Stance, the Warrior gains Rage from taking hits. With that built up Rage, they are able to perform various abilities that bolster their defenses. Some of these abilities substantially reduce the damage taken by the Warrior, while others empower the Warrior's shield with various attacks and strikes that can cripple their enemies.<br />
<br />
The Berserker Stance: My personal favorite and one that probably most closely resembles my style of play. In the Berserker Stance, the Warrior gains Rage from dishing out damage. As the Rage builds up, the warrior is able to unleash devastating attacks upon his opponents. The aforementioned Whirlwind being one of those abilities, Cleave being another, which allows the warrior to exert such force upon their enemy that their weapon hits and damages the poor bastard standing next to the recipient of the Cleave. The saying, &quot;I'm gonna hit you so hard your baby's mamma gonna feel it,&quot; comes to mind... To the Warrior in a Berserker Stance that's not an empty threat, that's a promise. Believe it...<br />
<br />
With all of these abilities and powers, and from what was shown to me in gameplay, the Warrior will be an amazing and fun class to play. Definitely another class which I will use to kill you with... <br />
<br />
I've only barely scratched the surface of what the Warrior can do in World of Warcraft, but I am quite certain it's more than 'press 'a' to attack, 'taunt,' and '/disc defensive,' for their 3 minutes of glory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If they remain unchanged i would expect 'Battle stance' to be the 'compromise' stance with many sources of rage giving you access to lots of medium power abilities etc. and 'good' but not extreme durability in a fight.<br />
<br />
'Defensive stance' would probably make you extremely durable compared with other characters, a rock that mobs can beat on ineffectually for long periods of time, it's trade of would likely be less versatility at least partially due to the fact that you have to get the mob beating on you in the first place or you cannot garner rage to taunt/do special defensive options with. <br />
<br />
'Berserker Stance' is obviously for when you don't care about defence you just want all out attack. You don't get rage for being hit, but the rage abilities open to you will be the most damaging, you can affect multiple opponents, and just basically have fun mowing down the opposition in a DPS frenzy.<br />
<br />
IF they pull it off,  sounds damn interesting. As does the inherent promise that combats will not be devolved into the boring 'pull one mob, whittle it down with massively superior firepower, rinse and repeat' exercises that is so often found in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell Effects are so much more important than game mechanics or content, especially since we all have them turned on.... /snicker<br />
<br />
This truly shows how much Sony listens to their player base.  I guess i can finally stop /feedback Change your Damn spell effects... What The Fuck!???!??!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;no sony is making new fucking spell effects, go to test and /testbuffme 25&quot;<br />
<br />
You've got to be fucking kidding me.  Do they not realize that anyone that participates in a raid (or groups with a beastlord with the ridiculous pet proc effects) turns that shit off anyway?  Just how damned far out of touch with their player base are the devs anyway?.....<br />
Me:  Hi I'm Earth, have we met?<br />
Devs: I don't think soo.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the worst thing is, its all HUGE spell effects, they cover huge areas, any MGB is gona crash people, altho i will admit it looks like professional fireworks, its really cool &lt;grumble&gt; damn the shiny things<br />
<br />
cast any spell that ups agility, and you can get a flaming monk shadowboxing in front of ya, use a bramblecoat, a thisle plant grows around you, use lightning? lighning strikes, i does look cool but not at all what i want</div></div><hr />

Lets wait what Absor promised us at the end of this month, and we'll know if they want all warriors to migrate to Wow or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well then they should be upgrading the graphics on all weapons and armour that warriors use.  That way I can stare at my toon thinking &quot;Damn, I look good&quot; and forget that I have no purpose in the game.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds kinda cool... not like it's going to make me want to try WoW any more than I already do, but still one more reason to buy the thing on opening day. And hey, with Blizzard making it, buying it on opening day might not mean beta testing it!<br />
<br />
As far as EQ warriors, fuck it. I cancelled my 3 accounts a week ago, already got rid of the cleric account ($$$, woot) and debating whether to give warrior away or reactivate later if warriors get fixed. Of course, the only way that'll happen is when WoW - competition - comes out, and they realize that now that people have options, they should be listened to. By then it'll be too late for me I reckon :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Beta hasn't started yet, and knowing Blizzard, I'm thinking 3rd or probably 4th quarter next year.  I keep saying it, and I'll keep saying it, WoW has the potential to blow every existing MMORPG out of the water.  The more I hear, the more I'm convinced it just might do that.  I'm definitely going to try it.  I'm hoping to get in on the beta, but I usually don't have much luck with such things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">EQ, WoW, Sigil....</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is, we like the game because it annoys and challenges us. Games that don't taunt us lose their glitter quickly.<br />
<br />
The biggest challenge is to remove the stupid stuff (think spellbook until level 35) and leave in the annoyances that improve the game (fizzles, Feigns that fail, missing that &quot;Enrage&quot; message&quot;) etc</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ahz I think you are very wrong. I for one was playing EQ because after 200 days played(that just for one of the characters) I was so attached to my online identity that quiting is very damn hard. I forget last time I trully thought EQ was fun. All this competition for mobs and beeing that raiding system still has a lot left to be desired from. Combine that with the fact warriors have almost no skills to use to benefit their group other then taunt(which is another painfull issue)... blah blah blah<br />
<br />
The only thing that keeps EQ together are the ppl who are already hooked and have made friends with one another. EQ was fun to play when it came out when there was a sense of adventure in exploering new unknown dungeons. What it is now for most part is ppl trying to level twinks to 65+ton aa asap and get them the best gear. There is not much fun in that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Inkudu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Grass is always greener...<br />
<br />
Seen this time and time again. Obviously, do what is most enjoyable (you are the one paying for the online service after all... or is it mommy?). But don't kid yourselves into thinking that once you've taken the time to parse the numbers and run various tests that you won't find something to complain about. It is the nature of these games.<br />
<br />
I just hope that whatever game I move to still has corpse recovery and trains. Funny as it sounds, I like the challenge of the game. Lewt is so much more rewarding when you had to struggle for it.<br />
<br />
Good luck in whatever you guys decide to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I still have fun in EQ, but than again I am not in a raiding guild and don't have to worry about things you guys do.  The only thing I regret is not being able to see the things you guys did, suchs as Rallos Zek the warlord, Quarm,  Sleeper, VP, VT, SSRA, and god knows what else but that is ok raiding is not my thing.  I enjoy EQ more with my beastlord than my warrior sad to say but only because I am not dependant on anyone else but me.</div></div><hr />
