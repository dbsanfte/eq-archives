any suggestions? <br />

would it be worth spending the points on an anger2/3 aug for a velium gemmed 1 hander?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No..Its not worth it.  As a warrior you want Agro.  That SoBS Auged with anger 3 will work wonders for agro.  You will lose a proc if you use the velium weapon (If its what Im thinking of, the weapon with a slot 4 and slot 7).  Also, weapons are not the items to worry about hps, saves, or what not on them.  All you care about is agro.<br />
<br />
Also, not knowing how you intend to get weapons limits what I can suggest to you.  If you can do the BoT Bosses then the Great Blade of Storms is a much better choice than the Velium weapons.<br />

I did some parse to see if there was interesting to use another offhand when i am grouping or boxing. The weapons i checked offhand were BoC and CHSD. My result are following, unbuffed, 36% haste item using GM trophy in primary, front fight vs Exterminator VIII in Akanon :<br />
BoC offhand (15/20) -&gt; 40dps<br />
CHSD offhand (13/19) -&gt; 35dps<br />
<br />
I had all AA improving secondary damage cept for Sinister Strikes. Now that i do, i will go and check the differences.<br />
<br />
I hope this will help u in ur choice.<br />
