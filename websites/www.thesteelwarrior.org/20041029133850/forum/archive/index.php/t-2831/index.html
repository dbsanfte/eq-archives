<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am asking for ideas as to where? Open to any ideas<br />
<br />
Seems The Hole has come to a crawl xp wise and without a porter I cannot go beyond the drop off.<br />
<br />
PoJ doesn't seem to be much better but my experience there has been burdened by the deaths<br />
<br />
PoI seems to take forever to kill a mob but much safer that PoJ<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try nurga out.  The exp seems pretty good, and the drops arent half bad.  <br />
Also Veksar is nice.  Just stick to the gobs at the zone in.  Ive made a lot of exp and decent money there.  Im duoing a cleric/war as well and even though Im a bit higher level than you, 56/59, I dont think you will have any problems.  There are 2 named gobs that pop as well that have nice loot.  One of them, A bloodgill warlord, drops the bloodgill hide gloves and the soulshard earring.  Both of which would be good cleric items if you dont have better already.<br />
And of course Seb is great if you havent tried it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I should of included the magelos please see below for them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">duo or 2 box?  If true Duo, the cleric needs to be on the ball but Nurga is doable (&lt;3 runners).  If you are 2 boxing, the group will last until the first broken root then you can practice rezzing.<br />
<br />
Veskar is good though, no runners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok so I meant 2-box</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Still need to make the trip to Nurga but tonight tried out Veksar just at entrance and it seems easy enough with better xp than the Hole.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kannan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes Nurga is good even at 56 i was getting decent xp off the lightblues did 3 points of aa in 2 days about 4-6 hrs a day and my cleric went from 55 to 56 as well after 56 xp gets slow but i was just there to check it out and look to see what drops was not expecting to get decent xp and great aa xp.<br />
at yer lvl dulak would be good xp as well as CoM while farming there 3 hrs a day for last 2 days i made 4 blues of regular xp at 56 so guessing 50 and 54 would be good xp.<br />
<br />
Oh ya i 2 box warr and cleric both now 56 its rough on mobs that run so I would try out CoM have not had any runners there.<br />
