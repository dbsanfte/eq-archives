<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nettor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im a level 33 wood elf warrior with 31k in the bank. im looking for some new weapons and armor. here is my equipment.<br />

<br />
i dont have my ac and atk in there correctly yet but any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>pisco_ssour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm, ok... well thats not a bad start but what u really have to do is lvl so that u can get some good stuff and get the stats, so i suggest 2x silver chitin wristband 2x fire velium wedding ring, basically just some hp gear that has no req or atleast 1 that ur at or have surpassed. btw, buying a horse was a waste of money... get up bag of platinum or w/e it is for it and sell it back to the stables guy with as much cha as possible. u can also take alook at my magelo if u need some help. a month ago i was at lvl 59 with 3k hp and now i've went up 1k. u can also take alook at the tread i started a while ago: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6653 it was concerning lvl 60 i think but even fro that there r some tips to see where u should be at. GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nettor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i didnt buy the horse.my jackass friend did i was asleep and had a trader on in bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lol, sell that horse back ASAP. There's a turn in quest for it so you can get back some of your money. Get a different primary weapon, that one sucks really bad until you get up higher, then it'll only just suck. Get a Sword of the Bloodsworn and a Frostbringer for levels 40 until 50, when you should get a Copper Hammer of Striking to replace the Frostbringer. For now, just look in the bazaar for a weapon with a better ratio than that Defenders Lightblade. 13/34 is just bad; the Centi shortsword would be alot better primary.<br />
<br />
  For your armor: 6hp = 1ac = 2 sta for now, 6hp = 1ac = 1sta for later. Don't worry too much about str, dex, agi, wis, int or resists. Just search the bazaar for upgrades, keeping in mind recommended levels. 6ac 65hp rings are really good for cheap with no recommended level, for example. Just budget yourself and upgrade everything you can.<br />
<br />
 You don't have haste, get a haste item. There's nothing that'll improve your damage and aggro more than haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">get some crustacean shell or crafter armor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ragulog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is my warrior twink around that level, might help you get some ideas<br />

Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I second the motion that you should use something other than the Lightblade. If the recomended stat indications are correct, then you'd be far better off switching the centi to your main hand and getting any number of weapons for your offhand. Heh, a centi hammer would be faster and hit harder at your level.<br />
If I had the plat you have and was in your position, I'd strongly consider buying a haste item; if you aim for a 31% haste or 36% haste item, it would do you for a very long time, and it will improve every weapon you have as you upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nettor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">alright ive gotten some new stuff and its in the magelo link. i cant decide on some new weapons. ive narrowed it down to: sword of the bloodsworn, copper hammer of striking, or blackened acrylia blade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sword of the bloodsworn and copper hammer of striking will last you the longest if you are going to spend a chunk of plat on weapons, otherwise grab a frostbringer and use that until you can afford the above combo.<br />
<br />
I think you're biggest concern now is getting a haste item,  a soulscream belt will last you until you're raiding, otherwise an RBG would be a good option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nettor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">im more worried about weapons and armor, haste isnt at the top of my list even though it probably should be lol. most good haste weapons are out of my price ranger anyway. i only have 31k and i was planning on getting the copper hammer and the bloodsworn<br />
i was thinking about getting a dented kunzar war helm too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">soulscream belt is where it's at</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ditch the Gothic steel legs for crusty<br />
If you want cheap argo weapons then buy a Barnicle Axe and Sword of the Bloodwhatchamaever...<br />
<br />
Get some Orc fang earings to replace the forrest loop<br />
<br />
Get a decent haste item<br />
<br />
Ya can prob afford a Helm of the Raldukan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nettor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i went ahead and added the bloodsworn and blackened acrylia in.<br />
i was thinking of getting some death embracers stuff from ldons. opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>pisco_ssour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hmm, i wouldn't recommended doing that. with all the money u have u should just lvl up so u can buy some good bazzar gear. if you wanna get some ldon gear get the BEST ldon armor ( sadly enough i forget the name)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">blackened acrylia is a ranger sword, you want stun/snare/hate/slow procs for aggro<br />
<br />
best armor is the royal attendant of sand in tak or the rage armor at all camps for 1495 per piece.</div></div><hr />
