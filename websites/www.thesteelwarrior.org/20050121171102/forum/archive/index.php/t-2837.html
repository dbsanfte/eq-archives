Better still when I wrote customer service a letter detailing the very reasons I did so. Needless to say I went for the wallet and not the brains. And it will truely be sad if the absence of twenty-two bucks from Sony's bottom line gets a reply to my letter when countless other /feedbacks and letters went unheard. <br />
<br />
Of course with myself and other warriors not getting LDoN its only going to make hybrids more popular tanks in that expansion. <br />

/sigh<br />

Someone get me a beer :mad:</div></div><hr />

I'll drink to that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, not much of a bright side, but still...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope everyone who consideres doing this is also using /feedback every time they log on. SOE pays a lot more attention to that than to message boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was discussing this very thing with a friend this morning and we came to the joking, if not frightening conclusion, that Sony is preparing for all the warriors leaving for games like WoW by making them obsolete. Logic like that would be so believable from a big company like Sony. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good, happy to hear it.  If more people thought like this instead of SOLELY crying on a messageboard or sending feedbacks in game, we'd have a better game. <br />
<br />
This will be 2nd expansion in a row I don't own, x2 accounts.  As soon as they prove they give a flying fuck about their game instead of their wallets, then maybe i'll reconsider that stance.  If you want things to change, you are completely 100% wrong that feedback and message boards do anything compared to 24.95 that you're not paying them.  If everyone who had a bitch in the war room or the outhouse didn't buy LDoN, then that would be one helluva start to sending them a message.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, most people are too weak to manage something like that, they'll bitch here, but they'll run right out to the store on release day and get it anyway, thus perpetuating the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll see who eats crow in a few weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think these peoples reaction has anything to do with the quality or lack thereof of the next expansion Fulorian.<br />
<br />
Still considering wether to cut off my nose to spite my own face (so to speak) here, one things sure though, SoE's track record and the way they appear to do business has less than impressed me, I will definately not be buying any further of their products unrelated to EQ1, no matter how good they may be, indeed if anything has the parent companies tag I look twice these days. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I catch myself offering alternatives to their products a lot lately. IE) monitors, tapes, cd's, cameras, etc.. Bought the kids an X-box although they wanted a Playstation. It might not matter to them but... /shrugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is going to be a huge joke , heck they add a zone to solb , and .... FORGET TO PUT IN AN ENTRANCE. Now how the hell do they expect to get 48 or whatever dungeons working properly . They are going to be poorly thought out bug infested and unplayable for a few months after release , while we test LDON for them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think them not getting a few peoples 20$ will make a big difference. Now if *alot* of people cancelled their ACCOUNTS, that would keep a much larger profit from them. And that will happen soon enough. WoW, FFXI, and other games are coming out, and lots of people can't wait to switch to them. I am getting LDoN just like i got every other expansion the day it came out. I like expansions and revamps and such...i thought LOY zones were great. The quests sucked, as usually, but the zones were nice. Veksar was lots of fun for a while, but it gets a bit messy in a few places. Revamps to zones like Droga gave me a chance to go back to some zones i haven't visited in a very long time, and get some nice exp and loot while i'm at it. Anyway...yeah, i am getting LDoN, but i'll be done soon, and already looking forward to it. Sony can *not* create interesting, epic, and actually solvable quests, cool graphics, exciting combat, well balanced classes, and games for just fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Allow me to make it very clear that I do not play EQ anymore for content.  I'm fed up with SoE, i'm fed up with their bug infested game, I'm fed up with their inability to balance content and classes, i'm fed up with their &quot;Customizable&quot; UI that I have to &quot;re-customize&quot; every goddamned patch.  I'm fed up with their ridiculous excuse for customer service.  I do not play EQ to pad sony's wallet.  Hence the fact that I won't be buying expansions.<br />
<br />
I play EQ for one simple reason....the people that I have met along the way.  And all the people I play with are playing for the same reason...because it kills the time until a company who knows how to make a fuckin game releases WoW.  At that time, I won't be playing EQ, and I won't be looking back, and I don't think i'm alone here.</div></div><hr />

 I started my warrior 3 years ago,when we actually still had some purpose and a role in the game.While I had some real good times,met some real good people,I have come to realize the game is no longer fun for me.Sitting with the LFG tag on for hours on end trying to get some exp,being spanked by green cons,and being asked if Im taunting by people in a pick-up group has lost it's luster for me.<br />
 I wish all of you who are sticking by their warriors all the best,and hope some changes come soon,but for me,I am laying down my weapons and moving on.<br />

<br />
My attitude might change in a few months, but in the meantime I don't foresee paying for something I won't use much (or even at all).</div></div><hr />
