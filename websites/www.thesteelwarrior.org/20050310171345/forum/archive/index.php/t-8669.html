I play a 43 warrior boxed with a 65 druid, and altho I can still get some stuff to upgrade, I think a guild would help.<br />
<br />
I play on Morell Thule and would like to know if anyone here knows of any decent lower guilds that would be benificial to my cause. I also have a few RL friends that play on Luclin and say that their guild needs tanks. Should I go spend the 50$ to transfer my warrior to Luclin?? These are questions that I hope you folk can help with.</div></div><hr />

It is a pretty good server, got like 9-10 guilds in EP's+ right now, and only 1 currently doing VT (mine). We also have an open raid channel that is actually pretty impressive (well when the Bard Mortensen isn't leading the raids they are). There are quite a few guilds that would be in your range. If you want to get some info on the server go to www.eqluclin.com. Pretty nice server in general, but they do love their drama. <br />

Then you could decide which guild you wanted to join from the offers you got.  That's wishful thinking, though.</div></div><hr />
