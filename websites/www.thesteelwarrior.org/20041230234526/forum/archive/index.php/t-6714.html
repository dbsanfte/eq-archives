it cant be used on inc, i dont feel its designed for that, incite works well for inc agro<br />
it cant be used while Def or SW - cant be used while another skill is activated.<br />
<br />
in a situational crunch, I would think is when it could be of any use what-so-ever, but with it not avail when another disc is activated, i find it is totally useless.<br />

It would be nice to have this and incite avail during some bouncing agro (mindwipe) on Planes Bosses for instance.<br />

am i missing some usefulness of this skill?</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Click Spirit of Rage<br />
-Incite<br />
-Click off Spirit of Rage<br />
<br />
-Wait for mob to get in melee range<br />
<br />
-Click Furious<br />
-Furious ends, click Defensive or Evasive, depending on the mob<br />
<br />
I've done this and it seems to work pretty well.  Then again, agreeing with you, just standard Incite+Furious tends to be a good enough edge for starting a boss encounter.</div></div><hr />

I've screwed around with it using it if I see DI firing on an MT to up my aggro before I need to tank (if Fortitude is up as well.)  I could see a use in an xp situation where a resisted slow or two and you wanting to get aggro back fast...  But I haven't used it as such myself that way...  Mostly I think it's useless but maybe just because I haven't adjusted for it yet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only place I see it useful is a mob that lives longer than defensive, and has some decrease MT aggro effect.  I don't see it useful on mem wipe mobs, since it would only work once then next wipe it'd be like you never used it.  I never really use it, because anything that is important enough to need more aggro, I also need to use some defensive disc, and very little lives long anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it in XP groups when the crap hits the fan and incite and AE taunt are down.<br />

Has to be a dire emergency though</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a lot of ifs/ands ...  I think I've used it once, to see if I noticed the *bump*.  I don't remember noticing tho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. When i duo in earth and pull 2 or 3 (if forti isn't up)<br />
2. Bossmobs after defense wore off AND agro is not trivial.<br />
3. uhm.... can't remember any other use right now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudana</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks guys and gals, good replies.<br />
<br />
end result...pretty much useless as I thought :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarvok</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it when in LDoN groups and there is a multi pull, the xtra attack and hate generated helps kill mobs faster and wake the next from mez with no problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only use I've found is on MT encounters when:<br />
<br />
1. def has worn off and I'm already tanking<br />
2. mob enrage is coming up<br />
Then I click this before the enrage (4-5 pct above)to try to build additional agro with it.<br />
<br />
Really isn't a very useful disc...I'm nowhere quick enough with my fingers to trust using this, then furious on tank switches...its just easier to use AE taunt.</div></div><hr />
