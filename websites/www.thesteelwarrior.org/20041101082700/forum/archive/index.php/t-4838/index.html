<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carnatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I read the threads about weapon procs and what not indicating that normally weapons proc twice per minute in primary and once in secondary.  <br />
My question is does this still pertain to weapons that have a proc and are augmented with a second proc from LDON?<br />
<br />
For that matter has anyone done the parses for LDON procs?  Are they in line with the regular weapon procs?<br />
<br />
What about spell procs like the palys get?  Anyone know if they have the same proccing behavior?<br />
<br />
Sorry if these are stupid questions... I am at work and have only minimal time to search forums...<br />
<br />
Oh, here is a comment  for everyone to slam... :)  I have never parsed it, but I swear I have never had a lifetap weapon that procced for shit in all the years I have played... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Augmented procs have the same proc rate, 2 mainhand, 1 offhand. People have parsed it. Icon based procs (Pally procs, warrior clicky Call of XXXX) proc the same rate as well as I recall.</div></div><hr />
