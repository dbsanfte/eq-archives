<br />
So for example serpent bite proc (100 Lifetap)<br />
crits for 133 - and heals for 133 too<br />

Guess is duration has to be instant to be able to crit with a proc</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a little off.<br />
<br />
frosty should not be crittable, due to leaving the debuff on the mob, and your FG, if the proc is 166 normally, should crit at a max of 332, as ingenuity 3 does a max of double damage on a crit. Frosty, if it were crittable, shouldf crit at 120 a pop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ing2 will give you crits for 250, Ing3 crits for 300.<br />
<br />
Ing is really good for lifetaps, cause not only do you do extra damage for the lifetap, you do extra healing... and more hate, as well.</div></div><hr />

Ingenuity at level 3 will only double the damage.  That makes it 320hp.  Even the 166hp base you said would only make it 332hp after crit...would some Improved Damage focus effect be taking effect (although I don't know if they can effect a FG's proc)?</div></div><hr />

improved damage doesn't effect procs. <br />
<br />
 Almost. Imp Dmg doesn't effect procs UNLESS it's a spell you get for your class. Example: SK's get the bonus on procs from Heavy Bludgeoner(Siphon Life, lvl51 spell for them).</div></div><hr />

Gotta wonder why something with just DD and a hate proc would leave an icon.. Seems kinda dumb the way they have it set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because it didn't used to add hate.  It was a debuff IIRC when epics came out in kunark.  Only later was the hate portion added and the duration was never removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ANY PROC THAT DOESNT LEAVE AN ICON WILL CRITIC  <br />
<br />
Icon = debuff of any type or dot (aka the proc has a duration message)<br />
<br />
Yes Dain &amp; LDoN will critic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what emilia posted is correct. If your proc leaves any type of debuff icon, it will not crit even if it has a dd portion.<br />
<br />
For example, i used an obsidian scimitar of war. It's a 30dd + small ac debuff. never ONCE did i see it critical, but my jagged shard of frozen flame would crit for 300 and the LDoN augment Rujarkian Bile would crit for 250.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone else, someone possibly as knowledgable as Emilia, said that if the proc had a duration, it may not be suitable for the AA.  <br />
Well, the stun on the Axe has a 1/2 second duration<br />
1: Stun(0.50 sec)<br />
<br />
This is at odds with casting time, so I thought some clarification  was in order.  Hey look, I can use big letters, also!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duration = Icon.<br />
<br />
Duration /= You are stunned!<br />
<br />
.5 second stun, half hour stun..don't fuckin matter.  If it doesn't leave an icon on you, it can crit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Used to debuff AC/atk, I guess the question should be why didn't they change it to instant when they changed the debuff to a hate proc.. Maybe someone should bring it to their attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was &quot;POSSIBLY&quot; left that way for two reasons:<br />
<br />
1- Because they were lazy and it wasn't BROKE perse, so there was no need to fix it. <br />
<br />
2- It was intended to be left that way.<br />
<br />
I lean towards reason 1, due to experience playing this game leads me to be pessimistic when considering how the developers do things in EQ.<br />
<br />
BUT ... understand that it really should NOT be messed with at this point, or that if it was reason 2, here's WHY:<br />
<br />
When it's resisted, it still retains the RESIST HATE of a DEBUFF proc.<br />
<br />
Which means, it's STILL useful hate when it's resisted.<br />
<br />
And it gets resisted a LOT.<br />
<br />
So to &quot;fix&quot; this would actually BREAK it, making the weapon even worse at doing what it's designed to do.<br />
<br />
So, would you rather break the red epic for thousands of warriors so that the few can feel justified in spending ONE AA point on an AA that they really only got as a toy ... OR would you rather just wait until you get a weapon with an actual DD or lifetap proc and enjoy your AA then, leaving those who use the red epic in peace?<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
EDIT: Added the word &quot;possibly&quot; because the way I originally wrote that sentence it read like I knew what I was talking about. Obviously I don't. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't personally noticed getting any significiant hate when the 2h or 1h epic proc is resisted.  I get tons when it isn't resisted.</div></div><hr />

But I still drew the aggro off of the people I needed to get it from (the slower, the healer, even the rogue who was trying to keep the aggro by not evading in our little &quot;game&quot;).</div></div><hr />
