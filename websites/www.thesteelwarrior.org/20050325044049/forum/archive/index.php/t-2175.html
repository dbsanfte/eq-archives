It seems to me that there are more and more of the around lately.  Rogue and Monks usually aren't too bad, its the casters because they die in 1-2 rounds of hits. :p<br />
<br />
So what do you guys normally do when you run into a caster that overnukes, nukes/snares too early, or chain nukes till they are oom?  Do you send a /tell to them and let em know whats up?  Do you /group yell at em to stop it?  Or do you let em die a bit, hoping that they learn their lesson (fun but evil :D )??  <br />
<br />
I guess my real question is If we let em die, do we make the warrior class and ourselves look bad?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course that is the root of almost all our problems.<br />
<br />
I know I along with most here in bigger guilds etc, dont have much problems with aggro or groupie aggro because we have people who have playyed a long time and know what to do.<br />
<br />
The problem is that EQ has catered to the people who buy yesterday and want to raid Tier 3 tommorrow. <br />
<br />
You can level a character up so fast, there is no longer any heartache in dying. So many people go from 1-50 with never really getting a group.<br />
<br />
That when they do, they find paladins allow them to play the same way in a group that they did when they were PL-soloing...<br />
<br />
And that is a major contributing factor to why pally aggro is unbalanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You let your cleric let them die.<br />
<br />
when playing my cleric.. I have let people die.  I usually tell them in group.  Look i cant afford to waste mana on you any more.. dont take any hits. <br />
<br />
Better for them to die than for your entire group to die.  <br />
Strangly enough people tend to back off mobs when they are at or below 1 bubble of health.<br />

<br />
1-2 hits would take bout half their life off.  They dont usually make it if I dont /shield them or the cleric fast heals em.  The crappy thing is that some people keep doing it again and again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes because other than AE taunt there isn't much I can do anyway (shield really doesn't keep them alive against hard hitting mobs).</div></div><hr />

If you are grouped with a bunch of ignorant people, I would suggest going and grabbing another group. If it is only one person not knowing what they are doing, let em die. Normally after a couple deaths they will either adjust how they play or leave. If they leave and you're in a pickup group, do /ooc Group looking for nuker that has a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let them die. People need to learn that agro control is NOT making the mob turn on you and letting the tank get it back. Agro control is NOT GETTING HIT in the first place. Everyone needs to learn this - including warriors, you can't be MT all the time. Anyone who does not understand this needs to learn. If it's someone you know, tell them. If it's some idiot that trains the zone every time he leaves BoT, let him die, repeatedly, until they back off or leave.</div></div><hr />

I remind them that it is terribly inefficient to be healing the non-MA, and that them getting hit will slow down the group's xp - even if they don't die in the process. I've even gone so far as to cry &quot;LOM&quot; and &quot;mana break&quot; after a fight if a non-MA had to be healed a bit to make my point, even if I'm not LOM &lt;snicker&gt;. Hopin they'll get the point!</div></div><hr />

My best friends in this tend to be rogues, who get annoyed having to chase around getting to the mobs back every pull because one caster cannot watch agro.<br />
<br />
Agro control is NOT GETTING HIT in the first place. Everyone needs to learn this  <br />
<br />
Slowers might possibly be the exception here.  I have grouped with many shaman who know they are going to grab agro by slowing early, position themselves next to the mob to make regaining agro easy, and heal themselves.  I have no problem with that situation, as the earlier the mob is slowed, the less dangerous it is for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Also, I try to save all others for the first few times.  If these are people that you don't know, then they don't know what your aggro is like.  Give them a bit of time to learn what they can or can't do with you.  If they continue to keep over aggroing, then yeah let them die.</div></div><hr />

How to deal with aggro hogs on raids, in order:<br />
<br />
1). ask them nicely in tells to control their aggro<br />
2). tell them in tells to control their aggro<br />
3). tell them to control their aggro in raid channel/GC<br />
4). berate them publically for not controlling their aggro<br />
<br />
and then<br />
<br />
5). Don't just let them die, help them out;<br />
-bribe sks or chanters to cast HV them<br />
-tell their healer to use only slow dot heals on them (best is to have a shammy use topor if they are melee types, or 15/tick regen if they are casters).<br />
-subtly move the mob closer to them during fights, to increase prox aggro they get<br />
-move to max melee range on the mob you are MTing<br />
-ask your clerics to delay rezzing them, and your buffers to delay buffing them (esp haste for melee, or crack for casters).<br />
<br />
6). If all else fails, have a taxi caster group with em and &quot;accidentally&quot; egress them to zone.  Repeatedly if they somehow manage to get back to the raid.<br />
<br />
Even the densest ones will eventually get the hint.  Most of the above is in jest, but you'd be amazed what a little behavior modification therapy can accomplish.  I boxed a chanter once, and had a great deal of fun HVing the folks that kept insisting on pingponging mobs and stealing aggro. ;)<br />

<br />
There's a dude in my guild who's relatively a noob with 2 boxing, he had his druid's assist hotkey set up to assist me and snare.  Snaring mobs before I get them slowed is gonna get ya killed, and oh did he die, many, many times.  When a mob turns off me because of shit like that, I dont taunt, I dont' waste my AE taunt.  If the BoC and SoD bring it back, great, but I ain't gonna exert extra effort to remedy a situation brought about by poor judgement.<br />
<br />
Think he rezzed himself with his necro 3 times one nite before I told him to change his hotkey.</div></div><hr />

So take the time to tell them you're main tank and you take the damage, you keep the aggro, and so forth. Besides, downtime sucks.</div></div><hr />

We only had an enchanter to slow because we couldnt find a shammy on.  Well the ench would slow on inc, without me calling assist or even allowing me to hit it once or twice.  Mob kept going to her, over and over again.  Also she kept going oom and we had to wait till she medded up (cleric was 90m)  :confused: <br />
<br />
We all asked her to wait about 10 secs after we engaged to land the slow and she did agrre on that.  During the fight, the mob would keep going back to her for some reason.  We finally figured out that she was chain nuking the mob.  Now the group was mainly melee heavy so our dps melee was was pretty damn good (monk and rogue).  Anyways, cleric decided to stop healing her and she died a few times.<br />
<br />
She got so pissed, was asking me why I didnt get it off her and I basically asked her if she just got the character or bought it.  She got pissed and left and we got a shammy.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion if anyone but the MA or the slower gets agro then they did something wrong.  Everyone is going to get agro sometimes but the ones that get it every pull are wasting more mana on heals than they are worth as well as wasting dps the melee could be doing while they are chasing the mob instead.<br />
<br />
One of the best quotes I've seen is from a cleric on my server &quot;Heals take mana but clicks are free.&quot;  <br />
<br />
First time a nuker takes agro I'll assume it was a mistake that could happen to anyone (crit nuke early in the fight where a normal nuke would have been fine, etc).  Second time I wonder.  Third time I tell them I don't have mana to be healing them so please watch thier agro.  Fourth time I tell them if agro keeps pinging like that we'll need med breaks.  Fifth time I don't say anything but I start looking for someone to replace me cause I want out of that group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhagulim</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately many people see aggro control as the concern of the MT only.  If you lose aggro to them - it's your fault, not theirs, and if you try telling them to control their aggro they're likely to at least in their heart continue to blame you.  I often lose aggro at the start of a fight to a slow or cripple if I haven't had an early proc, which more frequently than I'd like results in the caster's death.  Since many are used to dealing with pally and SKs as MT, they don't understand why you're losing aggro and tend to think you're a poor player.  The only sure protection I know of against losing aggro early is to call the assist after you've had a proc, which may take some time and tax the healer's mana.  Beyond that, just be sure you have the slower /shielded and have the healer buff him as much as possible - carry peridots for that purpose.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, this is what I find to be true most of the time when I'm not grouped with guildmates or friends.  Too many lazy, ignorant players out there don't want to put the time and effort into learning how to play their char.  Sometimes, even the healer....  I use the infamous excuse &quot;My guild needs me&quot; and bail when I get in groups like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I've found snare + slow to be pretty effective early in the fight if done right.  Ranger pulls, snares just before mob reaches camp.  Shaman/chanter slows before it gets to camp.  I taunt and attack before mob is in range of anyone else.  Mob can't reach anyone else so it turns to me.  Works especially well if the GAR then steps back and uses his bow instead of meleeing.</div></div><hr />

Sure i will lose agro sometimes.  But eventually, that person who wants to show off they can agro better is gonna die a few times, if not disband (or get disbanded) for not getting heals.  Cant have mana wasted on others who are not tanking if you want non stop chain pulls in xp groups. As Remf da Troll said,  if telling kindly to stop getting agro wont work, then tell in group.  after that its up to you to disband if group doesnt support you or disband the agroer.  <br />
<br />
Also, a simple stun isnt gonna get agro to the paladin, nor is 2, or 3 or 4 (catch my drift?) ... it has to be combined with meleeing and taunting, and even then its probably not enough to take/keep agro from fast dual wielding warrior whos taunting, specially one who has agro weapons.  Anyway, just trying to get these rumors/myths out of the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This discussion confuses me a bit, primarily because of the suggestion that the warrior has control over whether the overaggroer lives or dies.<br />
<br />
I just don't see that, myself.  I don't think warriors have the power to make that decision, because the real truth is that in an undisciplined group, warriors have little to no control over who's being thumped and who gets healed in any case.<br />
<br />
Nor do I expect warriors to make that decision.  I expect the warrior to do his or her best to build and maintain aggro at all times, and to use taunt, AE taunt, and /shield wherever these are called for.<br />
<br />
You see, it's about trust.  I heal warriors because I trust them to taunt the angry critter off me afterwards.  The same rules apply to nukers and snarers and light melees:  we are all entitled to expect that you as a warrior will do your best to hold aggro at all times.<br />
<br />
If I think a warrior is deliberately betraying that trust, then that warrior can no longer trust me to heal them.  The fifteen minutes he spends waiting for his corpse to arrive in the graveyard will give him plenty of time to think about trust.<br />
<br />
If you are having trouble holding aggro off overenthusiastic casters or light melee, don't try to be the chooser of the slain.  Just ask your cleric to keep the critter rooted.  It's a lot less drama to do that and we all end up having more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a step back and look at this statement.  warriors, whose job it is to take the beating, who in fact take pride in taking that beating well, have no controll(ok, have limited control to be accurate) over who is taking the beating.  The simple truth tho is that those people who cannot allow a warrior to do their job are almost without exception the first ones to blame it on the warrior.  'Are you taunting?'  So now you can see where our frustration comes from.<br />

We should also be able to trust casters to manage their agro.  It is a basic game skill, and by a certain point they should have mastered it.  We should be able to trust that people are going to know their role, the same as we know ours.  <br />

We have far more control over it than you think.  See, we got lots of little toys we can use to grab aggro...whether we use them is up to one person -- us.<br />
<br />
Druid snares immediately and mob goes over and pummel the shit out of him?  I can get it off him.  Do I WANT to more than once?  Not really.  <br />
<br />
See, I have a trust issue with people in this game too..and that's because i've been cost time that i'm PAYING for in this game by people who aren't very good at playing the game.  It's been over 3 years since my last pickup group, I'm absolutely not kidding.  I have no desire to log on for maybe 4 hours, and then spend an hour of that time doing a fuckin CR because someone had to be a dipshit.  I would like to trust that people are going to actually be good at playing this game, and not waste my time.  The reality is that situation doesn't always happen, so i've stopped doing pickup groups altogether.  If you're not playing the game well, you're wasting MY time, and at that point, you're no longer worthy of my trust.</div></div><hr />

I do see that, Redhenna.  But see it from the pickup group druid's point of view.<br />

That druid may well know very little about warrior equipment and techniques.  She's just come from a group with a different tank, and that previous tank generated a different amount of aggro, particularly if they're a knight or a very uber warrior; and maybe she had a few snare resists which wiped the group, so she might well be very concerned to ensure that snare lands.<br />
<br />
So she's got into one set of habits which it takes her time to unlearn.  In the meantime, the warrior decides she's overaggroing and stops bothering to taunt.<br />
<br />
How is that helpful?  Why not just keep the critter rooted and let everyone do their job?<br />
<br />
Haass, I speak as I see... and what I see is warriors in pickup groups having very little control over who has aggro.  You may be different; but from your post, I don't think you see many pickup group warriors, and I'm not sure you know how much trouble some of them quite genuinely experience controlling critter placement and behaviour.<br />
<br />
Rodney, thanks for that advice... up until you set me straight, I'd thought that it was my job to keep the whole group alive.  In future, if I don't think you're doing your best to hold aggro, then I'll certainly make sure that you stay alive anyway.  Let the evaccers die, I say!  And I sure would hate to be disbanded from a group where the tank declined to try to hold aggro, that would hurt me a lot.</div></div><hr />

This is utter bullshit. See, I play a caster as my main so I am probably more well versed in the art of agro control than my warrior counterparts here. If the druid is too stupid to figure out that snaring on inc with the current tank, then that druid should die if they continue to do it every single pull. No one ever said let someone die if they over agro once. This is about people who are chronic over agroers. These are the knights who are stunning and taunting, the druids who snare on inc then nuke hard, the wizards who chain nuke and don't use concussion.<br />
<br />
The basic problem of a warrior tanking in an exp group is that everyone in the group CAN out agro them if the so CHOOSE. If I WANT agro (cheal's not going to land in time, cleric is taking a beating, etc) then I can get it, but obviously I would prefer the warrior take the agro and get all the healing since it's more mana efficient.<br />
<br />
Some times over agro cant be helped. No one is suggesting that everyone who overagro's should be left to die. It's the people won't let the warrior do his job that should be left to die. It doesn't take much time to figure out where the agro line is. Find it and stay near it, but don't cross it if it can be helped.</div></div><hr />

I play healer and a warrior a good 50% of time in last 3 months I am the ONLY healer. I tell them outright if they tank they die. 600 mana CH and 500 mana quick heals can oom a druid pretty damn quick. I am not a shity healer thats not why they would die. Hell I am able to keep pop mob charming chanters alive as well as Casai and shammy as needed, but if they dont know jack shit about agro... aka 80% of the ppl from BoT. They will die AE taunt takes 15 min to recycle if they out agro more then once in that time frame /wave. Start looking for a res. <br />
<br />
Hell with my agro knowledge I can nuke and heal and snare without getting splatered by unslowed mobs. They can too if they took time to learn how to fucking play.</div></div><hr />

Its sad to say but its usually the soloing classes (druids and necros) that come to mind.  I play a druid, and I have played with druids that are so much better than clerics so I know its not all of them.  I also know a necro in RL that can crowd control like the best of em.  But the majority of classes I have come across in a group that know jack about keeping themselves safely away from mobs are druids and necros.<br />
<br />
If you solo'ed most of your life, its not gonna matter how hard u nuke.  You nuke and dot on inc because thats the way u solo.  You take that way of playing and use it in a group and you get fried, esp on mobs that hit for a quarter of ure health.  And a lot of the PoP tier 3 zones u cant run around and kite stuff.<br />
<br />
Basic funtionality of a group is that a Tank takes all the hits, slower slows the mob so tank doesnt get beat up too hard, and cleric CH's (or heals) that tank so he can do his job.  No one else should even get hit the whole time.  If you DO get hit, u're doing something wrong and you should tune it down a bit.  That doesnt mean you should hold back, but time ure casts and such.  Wiz's usually wait and nuke a lot more when the mob is lower than 50%-60% of health.  Reason they dont do it in the beginning, is that they would die simple as that.<br />
<br />
Also if you are snaring, snare it near when they start to run.  Snaring on inc usually ends up that yo are dead.  It's not that hard really.</div></div><hr />

Cleric still might heal them, also taunt was shown to have, I believe, a 65% chance of working.  So even if we try to save them, we can't always do it.  But we do have control over aetaunt, though it has a 15 min refresh.  Accidents happen, sometimes good people over aggro, and there is no problem with taunting off of them.  But then there are the chronic over aggroers.  Especially the ones who say things like the infamous - &quot;Are you taunting?&quot;.  After leveling a warrior for 65 levels, and a good number of aa, I've seen too many of those people.  And frankly, as a warrior, you get sick and tired of morons who can't control aggro and keep harrassing you because you don't have aggro lock like a knight.  It's annoying, stressful, and pisses you off.  For those types of people, I forget what button taunt is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ideally, I'd prefer it if clerics were only healing me, and let the replenishment do the rest.  If you're only healing the tank, we're moving at our maximum efficiency rate, because I take the hits best, and the mana is best spent healing the person who can take the least damage from a mob hitting them.<br />
<br />
If there is too much other healing go on, clerics run OOM and then everyone sits around waiting on cleric mana.  That's not the efficient way to play.  Heal me.  If anyone else is getting hit (exception of slower, who should be standing next to me) on a regular basis, then they are doing something wrong, and wasting time.  There is no argument against that point.  In the best running group you have one person taking damage, so you just use one heal to keep them going and don't have to dump 600 mana for a patch heal here and there to keep the rest of the gimps alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhagulim</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am personally not comfortable with letting anyone die, regardless of how poorly they may be playing their class.  To return to the druid example - if the druid is snaring on the pull or over-nuking and taking aggro, I first send a tell saying, &quot;It would help me if you would. . . &quot; and explain the problem.  If it continues, I'll say it again in group.  If you say this nicely and are careful not to sound as though you're scolding him, this will take care of the problem virtually every time.  I find it particularly helpful to first cast blame on yourself, letting him know that your aggro control could use improvement, and then asking if he would help you to better do your job.  This prevents him from becoming defensive and resenting your comments.  <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that EVERYONE makes mistakes, and what keeps this game bearable is that others are willing to help cover for them.  When a chanter, cleric, etc. saves my ass, I remember that and look for him again, and I'm sure it's the same way him if I do the same.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Root does not always work<br />
<br />
Indeed.  Root fails to control aggro under three circumstances:<br />
<br />
1.  Unrootable critters (duh).  Personally I do not group with warriors I don't know when facing unrootable critters, and if we meet unrootable critters I tend to suggest that we move.<br />
<br />
2.  When people stand closer to the critter than the warrior.  Those people should have the realities of how root works explained to them; if they persist in standing too close after being told clearly how it works, then I have to agree that they do not deserve healing.  It's rare but not unknown to meet someone that clueless, and their deaths are just evolution in action.<br />
<br />
(An exception is warriors who stand at extreme melee range.  Yes, there really are level 65 Marshalls who do this.)<br />
<br />
3.  When you get one of those situations where root just doesn't stick and you need to keep rerooting.  Fortunately, most exp groups contain several people who can root; most clerics and slowers keep root up at all times when grouped with a warrior, in my experience.  This only really gets out of hand when we have a persistent overnuker who keeps breaking root when the critter's still at 80% health and being debuffed.<br />
<br />
The problem there is that the overnuker usually isn't killing himself.  Most of the time, he's killing the slower, the snarer, or the healer.  So the warrior getting all pissy and letting people die is being part of the problem rather than part of the solution.<br />
<br />
Ultimately under these circumstances you just have to give the overnuker responsibility for keeping the critter rooted.  (Unless it's a mage; but mages aren't the usual culprits for overnuking.)  Since most overnuking is down to pure boredom, doing that tends to solve both the aggro problems that the overnuker is causing and the boredom itself.<br />
<br />
Root isn't the ultimate cure for all pickup group warrior ills; but it is a powerful aggro control tool which is all too frequently ignored.</div></div><hr />

Enough said. Root sucks ass. Plz dont root my mobs k? Thank you Exactly.  Shadowfrost, you need to learn a little something about root as well. I am assuming you are not award of this fact otherwise you would not lean on root for agro control. You only list 3 ways root can fail, but there are some important additions you should know about -<br />
<br />
1. 2x saves to break root - even if you successfully land a root, the mob gets to save against the root every tick. Some times root last 1 tick, sometimes root last 10 ticks. More importantly, EVERY time a mob takes damage, whether it's a nuke, a DoT, or a sword swinging, the mob gets an additional chance to break root. So if you are rooting a mob that a tank is beating on, you are only wasting mana at best, and adding to the agro problem at worst. The only time you should be rooting a mob is when you have no other form of crowd control. The mob you are rooting should not be taking damage to maximize the duration of the root.<br />
<br />
2. Summoning mobs - don't EVER root a summoning mob that has taken damage. The minute you root a summoner, you can just about guarantee that the mob will start to summon anyone who is out of melee range and doing damage.<br />
<br />
3. Rooted mobs don't run - in the unlikely case that root does last, a mob that would normally flee on low health will stand and fight if it is rooted. Again, a waste of mana if a mob pummels your tank for an extra 2k damage beacuse it didnt flee the last 10% of it's health.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love root and I always have it up when I group, but root is better used for crowd control than as an agro control tool - it has too many down sides for that.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, just trying to get these rumors/myths out of the way.&quot;&quot;<br />

<br />
However, I believe you are mistaken about DoT's and melee damage giving a root break check.  Melee can break root only through a procced nuke.<br />
<br />
Summoning mobs require that the summoned person steps back smartly.  The mob will indeed continue to summon, but the summoned person stands a fair chance of not being hit at all if they're acceptably quick off the mark; and being summoned without being hit isn't usually a problem.<br />
<br />
Sylas, I hear what you're saying with this:<br />
<br />
Root is a bandaid that doesn't actually fix aggro control (or teach people who do not understand aggro control), It just allows for gimps to continue to be gimps.<br />
<br />
But try this sentence for size:<br />
<br />
&quot;Using a knight to tank instead of a warrior is a bandaid that doesn't actually fix aggro control (or teach people who do not understand aggro control), It just allows for gimps to continue to be gimps.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, I realize that I've stretched that analogy too far to bear close analysis.  I'll explain why I felt that I could do so.<br />
<br />
This thread wouldn't be remotely so angry if it wasn't for the fact that many players have grown very accustomed to knights tanking.  Having a knight tanking indisputably allows sloppy aggro control habits to form.<br />
<br />
I see this thread as an expression of warrior frustration at players who do not possess the necessary aggro control skills for grouping with a warrior.<br />
<br />
Bear with me for a moment, please!  I realize that I'm a non-warrior espousing an unpopular viewpoint on a warrior-specific board.  I accept that this thread is, at least for some of the posters, a way of letting off some steam - or even perhaps a bit of a rant.  Humour me as I go slightly off the topic for a moment in order to make a point -  I'm trying to approach what I see as the cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
I'm a cleric who plays unusual hours by most American standards.  That means that I find myself all too frequently being the person who's forming pickup groups.  Even though I'm guilded, I've gained rather more than 150aa in pickup groups to date.<br />
<br />
Well, when I'm forming a group I generally start with the slower.  Once I have a slower, I'll hunt for the other four pretty much at random; optimally I'm looking for three damage dealers and a tank.<br />
<br />
Typically, if it's a shaman or beastlord slower, they don't care whether it's a warrior or a knight tanking.  Some enchanters do show a marked preference for knights, but most of them aren't too fussed either.  But a lot of damage dealers will piss and moan if I pick a warrior to tank.<br />
<br />
Before I read this thread, I used to sneer at those damage dealers.  Now I'm not so sure.  What I see here is that some of the warriors seem to be quite seriously refusing to help people who get aggro.<br />
<br />
The truth is that there's an awful lot of &quot;My way or the highway&quot; in the words of many of the posters here.  I see a presumption that the warrior can kick out group members at will, and has the unquestioned right to the sole attentions of the healer, and an assumption that it's perfectly okay to let people die.<br />
<br />
Raiding attitudes, without a doubt.  On a raid, those presumptions are correct, and a certain amount of attitude is a desirable thing in a raid's main tank.<br />
<br />
But, pickup groups aren't the same, are they?  You can bet that most of those damage dealers wouldn't be dying if they had a pally tanking; so the lesson they learn isn't, &quot;Control your aggro or you get killed.&quot;  From what I see, the lesson they actually appear to be learning is, &quot;Group with a knight or you get killed.&quot;  Or even, &quot;Group with a warrior, and you'll be insulted and humiliated after you get killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
When you're out in a group of strangers, I urge you to leaving the raiding attitudes (dare I say, ego) behind.<br />
<br />
I do understand the objections to keeping the critter rooted.<br />
<br />
But, ladies and gentlemen, there are times when my spell is a more effective way of keeping the mob attacking the tank than your taunt skill.<br />
<br />
This fact sucks.  It is ridiculous that a level 4 cleric spell is more use than a level 65 warrior's taunt key.  It is utterly insane that SoE have allowed this situation to persist for so long.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I'm sorry to say that from my point of view as someone who forms a lot of pickup groups and frequently has a choice of tanks, it is precisely that: a fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadowfrost, I agree with you on the root for aggro control topic.  It is sad that it often works better than the taunt key, and something does need to be done about it.  But back to the original topic.  I dont know about everyone else here, but I don't typically allow anyone in my group to die if I can avoid it.  There are exceptions to that rule however.  If, after I have noted that someone has poor aggro management skills, and I have explained in detail exactly what they need to do in order to work with me on aggro, if they still insist on overaggroing I let them tank.  If they're wearing a robe and get ripped to shreds, hey, I asked them nicely to change their style of play and they ignored me, they get what they get.  Also, in many cases, other melee's for some sick reason see aggro as an extension of their penis.  Meaning that they intentionally pull aggro off me just to prove they can do it.  A prime example was a group I was in a couple of nights ago.  I'm a 57 warrior using a GSoT in xp groups. I was grouped with a 59 bst and a 53 warrior whose weapon setup didnt compare to mine.  Both of them constantly pulled aggro off me all night (the warrior was obviously ninja taunting), until, towards the end of the night, our healer (a shaman friend of mine) announced that he was OOM when we had an add's health down to about 80%.  Suddenly, the mob was glued to me, and stayed on me for the entire fight without me ever hitting the taunt key.  I had been bitching about aggro in tells to the shaman the whole night, so he and I both found this situation hilarious.  Basically, as soon as it looked dicey, everyone dumped aggro onto me, so they knew how to do it, they had just, up until that time refused to.  But anyway, the fact of the matter is, even though knights are a better (or at least more reliable) xp tank due to better aggro; anyone who refuses to manage their aggro when a warrior is tanking, even after it's been clearly explained how to do so, deserves to get beaten into a little robed grease spot.  (oh and dont get me started on how many people get offended that the big stupid meat shield is presumptuous enough to tell them how to play their high-and-mighty, ubercomplicated class) Of course, the overaggroer dying doesnt teach them the lesson it should, wich is &quot;watch your damned aggro&quot;.  Instead, it teaches them that no matter how ignorant or lazy they are, a knight can tank for them.<br />

Everyone knows our fuckin class is broke, it's plastered all over every class board in EQ.

I think you are reading too much into it.  I rarely if ever do not do everything I can to regain agro, but every so often you will get some one who just makes my job as a tank incredibly difficult.  These are the people who have no horse/drogmer, stand way back, nuke hard and heavy, get agro, run around, and then do it again the next pull, and the next and the next.  At 65 there is simply no excuse for this.  Almost everyone here said that first you talk to the person, try and work out a solution.  Sadly, this is often not enough.  As my level of frustration rises(chasing mobs all over hell, while listening to coruses of 'are you taunting?', you need better weapons' and 'Told you we should have waited for a pally' tends to make your grouping situation unpleasant), I will hit a point where I will decide it is just not worth it any more, and I will stand back and shoot arrows at the mob while the caster runs around.  I have done this maybe 5 times in 65 levels and 70 aa's.  Does this make me a bad person?</div></div><hr />

100% absolutely not true. If this where the case then I would never get summoned on any rootable mob.</div></div><hr />

You either had a fast root break or the mob simply hasn't updated its status.  Mobs do not react to everything immediately and it wouldn't make sense for the game to check every mob's status every second anyway.  Rooting is guaranteed to get you aggro off if you're not in melee range.  If it does not, that means there should be times where I see a caster get summoned by a rooted mob, back out, and then the mob does not attack anyone because it's still aggro on the caster he cannot reach, similar to exploiting perma-rooted mobs by building excess aggro and having the tank keep on walk backwards.  Yet this situation never happens.  You can never get enough aggro to make a rooted mob go after you while rooted, if you're outside of melee range.  You can be at low HP aggro and root a mob and it will stop trying to attack you, and low HP aggro is far stronger than any kind of aggro you can get in an XP group.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you are understanding how summoning mobs work, in conjunction with Root.<br />
<br />
Summoning Mobs will summon whoever is at the top of their hate list once they have been damaged to a certain point.  Most creatures start summoning at 98 or 97%, but some can summon at 1 point of damage taken.  They can summon every server side tick, or 6 seconds.  A Summoning mob will not summon the person on top of the hate list if they are already within immediate melee range.<br />
<br />
Root does not make any adjustments to the hate list.  All root does it make the mob attack the closest person via proximity.  If a chain nuking Wizard is at the top of the hate list of a non summoning mob by a good amount, and the mob is rooted, the mob will begin to beat on whoever is closest.  After root breaks, if the wizard is still #1 on the list, the mob will immediately go back to chasing the wizard around.<br />
<br />
On a summoning mob, if the same chain nuking wizard is on top of the hate list, and the mob gets rooted, it will begin to attack whoever is closest via proximity, but will summon the wizard every 6 seconds, melee him until he runs his fingle wiggling ass out of proximity range (just farther than the closest PC), and then begin to hit whoever is closest again.</div></div><hr />

Necros are the bane of my life - especailly one who refuses to go and spend any points in SCS as he thinks it will screw his agro kiting. Let em die I say.  <br />
<br />
The worst thing about necros is you can't let them die, they just FD.  I have grouped with a necro a couple times lately that ping-pongs the mob every fight, but doesn't see a problem because he FD's and taps back his health afterward.  Pretty damn annoying for me and all the melees to have to chase the mob around every fight though.</div></div><hr />

I ussually get some rogue yellin at me to keep up my aggro cause he's gettin womped. Ussually this is when I try to explain aggro control (in a nice way) is everybodies responsibility. If his backstabbin is out Dps'in me then of course he's gonna draw aggro and i tell em to turn att off for a couple sec's, hehe sometimes they listen and sometimes they leave, oh well<br />

Therein lies the problem.  People actually think it's the tanks responsibility to keep aggro, when in reality it's the rest of the groups responsibility to make sure the tank keeps it.</div></div><hr />
