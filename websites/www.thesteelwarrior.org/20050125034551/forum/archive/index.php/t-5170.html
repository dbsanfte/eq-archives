<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had done 10 Mistmores(not a fan but can always get a Adventure group for there) and was wondering if there was anything I could spend my points on. So I see this &quot;Gaurd II&quot; augment.Thinking it was a regular rune Im like &quot;cool&quot; so I got it and Augd my offhand.<br />
I soon learned it was more like a BoV type rune,absorbing a small portion of each hit , not full hits.<br />
It procs regularly and if I look at my buff screen during a fight its usually up.<br />
I was wondering if theres any information as far as how much of a % or how actual damage each version of Gaurd Augments absorbs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lucy has an entry for it...but I can't link from work.<br />
<br />
I had Guard 2 on a weap for awhile...its very handy if you don't have a Vie cleric around.  Never parsed it so can't tell you objectively the damage reduction...it did seem that the procs kept ahead of its destruction (full def aas in LDoN though for the most part).<br />
<br />
I have since sold that weapon but am planning in the future in modding an already EB procing weap with Guard 3 to have another ultility option.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it's 5% damage mitigation, up to a maximum of 500 damage. I also have a Guard 2 proc weapon (the dropped one from Mistmoore), and it procs enough that you really dont need to worry about the maximum damage it absorps - it'll be up constantly if you mainhand it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to Lucy, the Guard line is 5% mitigation, for 50, 100, 150, and 200 points of damage, total.<br />
<br />
Guard I (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4384&amp;source=Live)<br />
Guard II (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4385&amp;source=Live)<br />
Guard III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4386&amp;source=Live)<br />
Guard IV (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4387&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
Compare to Bulwark of Vie, which is 10% mitigation for 1600 points of damage, total.<br />
<br />
Bulwark of Vie (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4091&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
It's not formatted prettily, but basically the 2nd number is % reduction, and the final number is total HP absorbed.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what the first number is.<br />
<br />
Spells with effect #162 absorb normal damage, and effect #161 absorb magical damage (from procs or nukes)<br />
<br />
Bulwark of Alendar (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4076&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
This is a very nice buff.  It stacks with the spellshield line, and can really change an encounter dramatically.<br />
<br />
For example, Emperor Ssraeshza, has an unresistable 4000 DD proc (does a few other things too, but the DD is what we care about)<br />
<br />
 Bulwark of Alendar absorbs 20% of this, or 800 points, making it a 3200 DD, and Spellshield then absorbs 700 of it, making it a 2500 DD.  Because it absorbs 1600 damage total, your Enchie only has to cast it on you every other proc, which is possible even if the enchie is on Mez duty.<br />
<br />
In this fight, taking the 4000pt proc and making it a 2500pt proc makes healing on the MA substantially easier.  It is much less likely for the MA to die if he happens to be at &quot;low health&quot; when the proc goes off.  In fact, it almost trivializes the encounter.</div></div><hr />

Never parsed it, but it seemed to help a little bit on mobs, and I'll take every edge I can get in mitigation.</div></div><hr />
