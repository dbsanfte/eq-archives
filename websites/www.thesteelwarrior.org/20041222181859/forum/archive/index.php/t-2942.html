I play with misses off so I'm not sure, I just know that as i got better at 2hb, I hit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ATK is 2 components, weapon skill and raw ATK.<br />
<br />
Weapon skill = 1hb, 2hs, piercing, etc., has an effect on average hit and accuracy.<br />
<br />
Raw ATK = Affects average hit. More raw ATK pushes your average hit from low/medium to medium/high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also ups your max damage<br />
<br />
ways to increase it<br />
skill,str, worn attack (vengence,  avatar spell) capped at +250, spells like spirit of bih'li, call/mark of predator, speed of valon, bard songs, yalp no know spell cap iirc.<br />
<br />
effect is you hit more for a higher average damage.<br />
<br />
the basic genral stuff</div></div><hr />

 More raw ATK pushes your average hit from low/medium to medium/high <br />
<br />
That's what happens....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i believe ppl use to claim 15% extra dmg with avatar up. becomes significant as you increase the dps of all your melee by that on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">worn attack (vengence, avatar spell) capped at +250 <br />
<br />
Shaman cast avatar doesn't count toward the cap. Weapon proc avatar does count.<br />
<br />
Warriors receive an atk bonus - for example, where a Necro would get 10 displayed atk out of an AoB item such as spirit wracked cords, a warrior would get a hair over 13 displayed atk from the same item.<br />
<br />
A 'standard' formula is that each additional 10atk will provide a 0.7% to 1.0% melee dps increase. Not foolproof, but seems to hold pretty true.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. it's 4am so if that came out scrambled, sry</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont believe there is any truth to this.<br />
I have never hit for more than 321 with a regular hit, 528 crit with my Blade of War regardless of having Avatar or any other attack buff. Thats held true with my attack  ranging from 1560ish with no buffs all the way to over 2000 with max attack buffs and bard songs.<br />
<br />
Edited because grammar &gt; me at 8am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the extra dmg is from hitting for higher dmg more often. in other words, you will hit for 321 more often. it simply scales your hits up, max hit stays the same.<br />
<br />
dmg table before attack buffs<br />
<br />
300 - 15%<br />
250 - 20%<br />
200 - 30%<br />
150 - 20%<br />
100 - 15%<br />
<br />
more attack would shift the dmg like this<br />
<br />
300 - 20%<br />
250 - 30%<br />
200 - 35%<br />
150 - 10%<br />
100 - 5%</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laricon</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the information. It seems that using items with Vengance might be worthwile since it stacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now when you say that raising attack does not increase your max hit with a weapon, are you talking about a max possible hit the weapon can do? I still don't do a ton of raiding, and am definately not in the high end game. My normal attack rating unbuffed is only 1115. With self clickies I'm usually at about 1150-1160 range. When I'm in a raid, I'm up around 1330 or so (Still no Avatar Shaman and we're just starting HoT raids, so no primal/prismatic). I've noticed my max hit with a windblade go from the high 290s for duo group with Cleric to 323 in a raid, so maybe I'm just low enough to still see a benefit from attack buffs, but I definately see oneas far as max hit goes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">max hit does not change, u will never hit higher than 323 with your windblade without a crit. you will however hit for 323 more often with more attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hit percentage is fixed, pretty much.  Pure melee (Warrior, Rogue, Monk) and I guess anything else with a 250 weapon skill (Rangers, Beastlords using H2H) tend to connect ~65% of the time from the rear, around ~60% from the front.  Hybrids (Knights) hit about ~60% of the time from the rear and about ~55% from the front.  Pets, which are level 60, also connect at a ~60% rate from the rear and ~55% from the front.  <br />
<br />
Mind you, these are all taken at level 65 and can vary depending on mob level.  Hitting from the front can also vary depending on a mob's active defense skills.  These numbers seem to remain consistant with several diferent high level mobs:  Vindi (70), King Tormax (70), Acidic Mass (65), THO (63), and the Tower Lords (67?), so I assume it true for most all mobs as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strength will increase your max hit.  (your max hit with 200 strength will not be the same as your max hit with 305 strength).<br />
<br />
Raw attack will increase your average hit as decribed by Ludor.</div></div><hr />
