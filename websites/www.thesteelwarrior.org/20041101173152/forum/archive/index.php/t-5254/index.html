<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do anger procs go off more often than normal procs? <br />
<br />
I'm planning on upgrading my weapons through LDoN and I need to know if it's really worth getting Anger aug over stun+dd, or even just DD. Has anyone done some testing of this? I'm sorry if it's already around here somewhere, it's getting late and searching for anger brings up way too much stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Goes off at the standard 2 procs per min in main hand, 1 in offhand.  But yes it is worth it over stun proc, and much more worth it than a dd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say that anger 3 procs have an edge over the Ykesha procs, probably not by too much though. The proc rate is definitely the same. If you can get people doing Guk missions, the Ykesha procs are cheaper (highest is 760 vs 1150 for anger 3). If you're maximizing aggro, get anger 3. If you want a combo of more aggro and DPS, get ykesha. If you don't want ANY added aggro for your weapons but want more DPS, get a DD or lifetap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, I wasn't looking to save up for anger 3 anyway, I think I'll check out the ykesha augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malikae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have anger II augs on both my weapons, and they both proc way more than any other sword proc i have ever had. I've not done or seen parsers, but they pop all the time. <br />
<br />
And, there is no doubt, no question, that for a warrior, the anger aug is KING over the DD proc. Anger is 100% UNRESISTABLE. DD procs, ARE resistable. What would you rather have if you are fighting a named, or god like mob? They are likely to resist DD procs, not to mention they are already immune to stun procs (like every single mob I EVER fight is immune to my stun proc on my Great Blade of Storms). <br />
<br />
95% of the time one of my anger procs goes off, agro is mine, period. Goes off twice, i'm putting my feet up, 'cause that mob isnt going anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stun procs, even when resisted, generate huge aggro.  That's why your local ebat pally can taunt off of you any place, any time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malikae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do stun procs generate the same agro from mobs that IMMUNE to stuns as anger procs? No way. You're local ebay pallys stuns are not the same as proc generated stuns. Anger owns. When you're level 65, every mob you fight is immune to stuns on weapons. I'll take the 400 instant unresistable agro anyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're local ebay pallys stuns are not the same as proc generated stuns <br />
<br />
Yes they are.<br />
<br />
Stun always generates the same amount of aggro.  Whether it lands, is resisted, or the mob is immune.  It's all the same aggro.  From the debates when Anger 3 only gave 300 hate, people would say that Stun was above it, which was the case.  I'd say it's between 350 and 450 hate from both those and related threads, and my experience.  But Anger 3's 600 hate is definately worth the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I do beleive that is 600 agro now, as the proc were doubled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have Anger3 on my BoW.<br />
<br />
Both can be insanely streaky, but overall i would say the proc rate seems to be the same.<br />
And its quite regular (All parses show 2 Procs Per Minute).<br />
<br />
 Do stun procs generate the same agro from mobs that IMMUNE to stuns as anger procs? No way <br />
<br />
I have Ykesha on one of my weapons. <br />
I draw agro on some Plane of Time gods with stun procs.<br />
And trust me, these are 100% totaly immune to a gimp Stun/55.<br />
<br />
Yes Stuns DO Generate as much agro as Anger, even if they<br />
are resisted (that is how EQ works my friend).<br />
<br />
However, stuns do not generate the same agro as all Anger.<br />
You cant compare Ykesha with Anger3 or Anger4 or Anger10.<br />
<br />
However you can Compare Ykesha (resisted or not, immune or not) to probably Anger1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">do beleive that is 600 agro now, as the proc were doubled <br />
<br />
Aye, I was talking about the amount of hate I thought Ykesha gave.  Anger 3 is 600, and completely worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">how much is anger 2? (hate) <br />

<br />
but maybe it's not that way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anger 1/2/3 is 200/400/600 hate per proc.<br />
<br />
Two anger 2 procs would generate ~ three procs per minute (two mainhand and one offhand) at 400 hate per, or 1200 hate per minute from the augments. One anger 3 proc generates ~ two procs per minute at 600 hate per, or 1200 hate per minute from augment. It's the same hate per minute, but the more even distribution of procs from the two augments would generally be better. Personally, I'm all about saving up for anger 3 augments because it makes for 1 much better weapon rather than 2 somewhat better weapons.<br />

But once you are at the top of the list, stuns and DD are worth more.How do you figure? Hate stacks no matter where you are on the list. Taunt is the only thing that is useless if you first on the agro list. Go read the rooted mob thread. You can stand there and chain incite on a rooted mob for 5 minutes then tank with no fear of losing agro without ever swinging your weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Why go for second best?<br />
<br />
Same reason people dont waste 40hp augs on ornate slots when they are in the elementals. When you know an upgrade is likely to come your way soon, you dont blow 1k+ adv points when 500 will do almost as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Like many people, I aug'd my BoW with force of ykesha in the first weeks of LDoN, before they allowed anger3 to go on 2h.

Not a day. . .not a single raid. . .not a single adventure. . .not a single mob has gone by that I have regretted it.<br />
<br />
The increase in aggro from ykesha to anger3 far excedes the 1 or 2 dps you gain from the DD procs (even with ingenuity3).<br />

If you arent getting any other weapons, just use Reaver for DPS and put Anger III on GSOT for MAing :)<br />

<br />
Anger 3 on an agro weapon (a weapon that already has a stun or enraging blow proc) better than ANY agro weapon without an agro augment on it.  PERIOD.<br />
<br />
If you are low enough that you think the 500 extra points on anger 3 is a lot, then you need anger 3.  Because when you are in elementals, getting 500 points with Hard LDON isnt that hard.  But if you are at the point where you have a copper hammer of striking as your agro weapon, or you have a greatstaff of thunder and thats your agro weapon, then getting anger 3 will bring a diminsion of agro to your game that you will never regret.<br />
<br />
Anger 3 is like run speed 3.  No one who has posted here has said, man, i regret putting anger 3 on my agro weapon.  Just like no one has said, man, those points in run speed 3 were a waste.<br />
Think about that.<br />
For a yak aug, you at most are getting 5 DPS.  And good agro.  But is your job to get agro, or is your job to do dps?  Agro &gt; DPS.<br />
If you hold agro better, your group can do more damage.  So, yes, you are giving up 5 dps, but thats to allow FIVE other people to do more dps in a group, or to allow up to SEVENTY ONE other people to do more dps in a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the LDoN weapons are nice, but they have the disadvantage of not having an innate proc. A decent non LDoN with an aggro proc + A3 will be better for aggro than an LDoN weapon with A3. If you want to build a decent DPS weapon for when you aren't the MT use an LDoN weapon, if yu want the mother of all aggro weapons put A3 on weapon that has an aggro proc built in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I couldn't justify the additional 500 points for 200 more points of hate. I couldn't. So I &quot;settled&quot; for anger2 on my BoC. Now that I'm approaching my first piece of RA armor (sleeves, upgrade over Myrmidon) and being able to afford at least the 40hp aug on it at the same time, I'm thankful that I saved the points...<br />
somewhat.<br />
<br />
After reading the valid points made here, I have to wonder if I didn't shortchange myself. The BoC grabs aggro like crazy (AP mace offhand, which can't be aug'd, sadly, and I probably won't swap it out), but would I see much of a difference blasting the 510 points I already spent (10! adventures!) to get the Real Deal Anger 3?<br />
<br />
Probably not.<br />
<br />
But you can bet that if I ever decide to use my GSot4W instead of my BoC, it's getting A3. I don't doubt that at all. I can't imagine why I would switch, but if I did...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">510 points I already spent (10! adventures!)  <br />
<br />
BAH, do the high adventures.  There so much more fun.  A BoC on a normal with anger2 seems like such a waste (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Interesting things to ponder:<br />
<br />
It's been said here that a stun is ~300 agro.  300 from the stun plus the dd which presumably adds agro makes Ykesha the better deal over Anger 2 for the same points.<br />
<br />
Do we get less agro from our off-hand procs?  I know we've determined that swing/dps agro from off hand is much, much lower, but does that apply to proc agro as well?  If so, do we not want a different proc in our off hand so that we can judge how much agro we have before we get an Anger proc from off hand and think we have good agro?<br />
<br />
My suggestion for people at my level or below (pre-VT and pre-Sol Ro) is to get Ykesha for 2-handers for extra DPS and get Anger 3 for 1-handers for when you absolutely need agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My suggestion is use a known aggro weapon when you need aggro and use a dps weapon when you need dps. Now that totally depends on your lvl of play, but don't go halfway on something or you will always end up unhappy. For my lvl aggro weapons are GSoT or the Droga weapons. If I am not MT then it is a pure dps weapon, like War Marshall's. <br />
<br />
Using an aggro weapon when not MA is asking for trouble. Our class is based on equipment, we all know it. Don't hinder yourself by trying for a weapon for all occasions, instead pick 2 or 3 which work best in the situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aggro is the same, just the proc rate is decreased. Before I got a BoW, I was using a Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled, with a BoC off hand. When my BoC proc'd, I had an EB proc worth of aggro.</div></div><hr />

I can comment on the mad researcher club (15/20, 75hp other stats).<br />
<br />
I bought this because at the time I felt:<br />
<br />
1. I couldnt get a BoC via raid<br />
2. I didnt want to spend 400k on a BoC<br />
3. I saw it as long term off hand weapon should I get my hands on a nice double proc main hand (BoC/GBoS/etc all).<br />
<br />
Currently I have anger 3 on and like it alot.  I'm about 100 LDoN pts from making it 17/20.  I use it with a CHSD mod'd with anger 2 and find that it really is a nice weap.  <br />
<br />
Anyway I guess I'd advocate it or the D Guk sword if you play EQ alot (I averaged 2 wins a night most of Sept/Oct) but don't hang out with uber raiders.</div></div><hr />
