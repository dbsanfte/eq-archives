<br />
I've been reading some disconcerting things about AE Taunt being loopy and unreliable.  I just finished ND3 and was about to save up for it.  But with that as well as the new aggro abilities, should I continue along this path or go for PD or CS/CA?  My time in-game isn't as extensive as it used to be, so I'd like some input so I can put the effort into the best possible direction... AA's don't come as fast to me as most. :)<br />
<br />
If it helps, I mostly just do LDoN adventures with a regular group, and I am usually MT for my guild (Vindi, Xana, PoS named giants etc.)  <br />

Its really worth it and will make a big difference in most situations where you need agro fast.  It hardly ever fails for me except on really big mobs and I think that is because its hard to tell if I am next to the mob's center or not if it is extremely large or one of those bouncy demon or pheonix mobs like in plane of fire.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE Taunt is of more value than anything else you could possibly use those 5 points on.  No other ability has saved my group(and therefore myself as well) more often than that one.  Once you have it, you will wonder how you lived without it so long.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just realize that it wont save someone that has low health aggro.  I can recall many times i hit AET when the cleric was at 30 percent life and the mob didnt turn until the cleric was dead.  As main tank AET is the most useful tool you'll ever have, especially when the first ch hits and the mob looks away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Augustus</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get AET? Yes. Definitely. VERY useful tool.<br />

That's another command all together, /shield :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just remember that in some of the dungeons, you migh generate aggro through a wall and bring on more than you expected.  The skill is definitely worth the 5 AAs, but you have to keep in mind your surroundings when using it.  Definitely useful in saving your shaman, chanter, or cleric.  Also EXTREMELY useful for transitioning aggro to the next tank, or gaining aggro if the MT goes down, etc.</div></div><hr />

Don't underestimate AET! It's that good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hahaha yeah except shield would have killed the cleric anyway and since i group with 2 clerics plus in PoF /shield wouldnt have saved her.</div></div><hr />

The only people with those issues are at the REALLY high end of the game.  Since you're just getting AA 18 right now, I can make a wager that you're not there yet.    I've never had AE taunt fail, ever, you have nothing to worry about unless you're fighting huge modeled gods + bosses.</div></div><hr />

It won't work if someone has low HP aggro either.  It's still BY FAR the best warrior AA in the game though.  Get it.  You'll wonder how you got by without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that, but I also don't feel the need to repeat it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
for bad pulls when you need to buy time for evac/mez or whatever, AE taunt and either riposte or fortitude disc can really make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">THere are tiems however you DON&quot;T want to use AE taunt.  Use it wisely heh.<br />
<br />
One time in particualr that I can think of where you WOULDN'T want to ae taunt is teh PoI dragon.  If you are close enough to the Gnome, then if you AE taunt to grab Control of xanamech back .... you just went on the Hate list of the gnome and bugged teh event and those needing teh Factory Flag are not likely to get it(trust me on this heh).<br />
<br />
AE Taunt is definitely one of teh best AA's Warriors get.....but learn when to use it and when not to use it.</div></div><hr />
