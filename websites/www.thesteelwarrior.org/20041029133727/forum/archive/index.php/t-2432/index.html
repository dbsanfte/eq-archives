<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has finally graduated from Kael and has moved onto HoT.  That might not seem so impressive, but for us it's a step in the right direction.  Our first shot at HoT we wiped 3 times without killing anything.  Our 2nd shot we did better, got several pulls in before we wiped.  Our main problem seems to be when the suckers gate and summon.  Pallys/clerics had stun up, but no dice.   Since I was MT on the first try, and ST on the second try, I'm really tired of being told my corpse is under a dragon and we're going to have to have a necro summon me.  Any suggestions as to how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">enchanters mana sieve gaters, they're immune to stun and its much more difficult to push mobs to interupt them, so its pretty much your only shot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As mentioned, mana sieve the gaters... and also have your nukers ready to nuke hard right at the end.  Sudden death is a guaranteed way to stop a gate :)<br />
<br />
One thing is that you have to make sure people are assisting and on the same mob when you have multiples in camp.  If 1/3 of the raid is attacking the non-gating mob (that should only have an offtank on it) then the lowered DPS on the main mob (the gater) will give it more of a chance to successfully gate.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, HoT is where you learn to raid.  You have to deal with gaters, some decent DPS output, adds, and AEs.  And like you mentioned, you'll also learn to recover from a wipe.  The ability to do a quick CR and get back to raiding (rather than have a wipe end the night) is an important element of raiding.<br />
<br />
Congrats on moving in to HoT.  Before you know it you'll be trying your hand at flurry drakes in North. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try to get the dragons to summon you, apparently that drains them of mana (Ive been told).  I usually tell the guild to nuke at 15%.  We have a few nice nukers so the mobs are usually dead before gate lands.  It's a big pain when they do gate and bring you with them.  Know your way around so you can run back to the force.  Also clear the roamers b4 you move to avoid multiple pulls.  You can fight singles all the way thru (cept for named ones)</div></div><hr />

Cast as needed on cleric/druid mobs and scoop up phat loots and move on to the next one. I can't see any reason at all why a mob should gate on you if you make sure the chanters know what they need to be doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Torment of Argli &gt; HoT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sword of the Bloodsworn proc actually interrupts gate in HoT (but not NToV). I equip that mainhand in HoT.<br />
<br />
Melees should all be on the same side and pushing like heck as soon as a casting mob is under 20%.<br />
<br />
Nuke like mad under 10%.<br />
<br />
Seive as much as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In addition to the other suggestions given - learn which mobs gate and which mobs don't. Try to make sure you pull gating mobs last so that when they do actually gate they don't summon you into an area with adds around. Also, if you think there will be a wipe from a gater, get people to camp out immediately. Only having a few corpses to drag or summon instead of a complete wipe can save a good 30 minutes of CRing, ressing, and rebuffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crayno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Best solution for gaters IMO:<br />
Make sure you have another mob near,they won't gate then.<br />
Soooo,lets say you have 2 white(gating)wurms down the first ramp.<br />
Pull1 ,beat it down to 10-20%,depending dps/raidsize.<br />
Pull another mob(other white wurm might heal the first so preferable a non healing mob) near the 1st,1st mob will not gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if possible need to familiarize your raid with the area, have everyone jump down and look around after u cleared it out some. generally if a mob gates, i run over where it spawned and just pull it back. in a pinch i would even pull hehe, the right side isnt that hard.<br />
<br />
to stop gate, need to malo/tash/sini then torment of argli/ wondering mind/ theft of thought/ mana sieve.<br />
<br />
generally 2 enchanters can stop gate unless you got really high dps and you can kill before gate anyways.<br />
<br />
<br />
with ornate and deity class armor though, are ppl really using HoT to gear up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Blue and white mobs gate.  I've found the best way to stop gaters is for casters to hold their nukes at 25%, then nuke in concert at 18% or so.  This way you get a wave of nukes that all land together, killing the mob before it even starts to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shimmer drakes gate too, even tho they are magic immune.  That just means you can't use Torment on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On/Off topic. Mage in our guild complains that in HoT most everything is resisted a great deal of time from him, guess it is the mostly fire based spells. What should a mage be doing in HoT, I dont know that class at all and would like to get him more useful than the normal, need a stick and coth the late guys.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

A Rogue or two with SoS can make CRs very easy in HoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was playing a mage when we 1st started doing hot, after the 3rd trip, I leveled my warrior &amp; cleric instead.  I played a wide variety of classes in hot &amp; I can say for sure that being a mage there is among the least enjoyable classes to play from the perspective of feeling useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Tell them to get /pet hold, he'll be plenty useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">that sounds made up =\<br />
<br />
So I will ignore it.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not at all, Haass is right. Pets are a problem in ToV because the AEs trigger their early aggro, mess up positioning, etc. But with pet hold, pets can be used much more reliably. A good pet caster prepared to immediately lean on his /pet back off key could get by, but a few slip ups is enough for many raids to just say no pets. /pet hold certainly helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What sounds made up?  /pet hold?<br />
<br />
He's talking about the pet discipline AA.  With that AA, mages can actually use their pets in HoT without having them charge around screwing things up every time they get hit by an AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's most definitely not made up.  People in ToV with me aren't allowed to use pets unless they have the pet discipline AA.  I'm not gonna screw around with pets getting an AE and attacking before i'm ready to position things, and i'm guessing that your mages are feeling useless because of a similar problem.  Mages would be particularly useful because they can summon a pet that is immune/pretty freaking resistant to any particular AE there.<br />
<br />
It also may not be very glamourous, but mages should also be doing Mala/Malosinia too if they're having difficulty landing nukes.  The extra debuff helps everyone.  Basically they just need to be 60+ and have the AA's they should have and they'll be plenty useful enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Have taken my mage to HoT a couple times.  /pet hold is mandotory(as mentioned) if you want to use your pet.  Outside of the red mobs, did not have too  much trouble sticking nukes, and even the red ones could land some magic based nukes.  I also volunteered as part of the debuff team, sticking Mala on incoming.  I weas only mage there when I went, so was also busy making rods.  It certainly to me is not nearly as fun as tanking the mobs, but I did keep busy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  In May 2000, there was no such things as diety class armor.  My god is Mithaneil Marr, which I picked for some wierd ROLE PLAYING reason, not because of what armour I could wear, which wasn't even around back then.  I've put too much time and effort into my warrior to reroll her.  You might also want to consider the fact that not everybody has 80Kpp (think that was the price for the plate GLOVES on my server) to spend on an ornate armour mold.  As a 63 warrior, I'm never asked to go to BoT unless it is as a charity case, and it's never in the camps with ornate.  My guild is just now getting to the point where we are all mid to high 50's and low 60's, even a couple of 65's.  We are in a position to do HoT, not BoT as a guild.  Not everybody is in the same position you are in.  My mother always said something about making an Ass of U and Me when you assume something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">In May 2000, there was no such things as diety class armor <br />
<br />
A lot of us are in that boat.  I curse being agnostic now, but it was widely accepted when I started that it was the best choice.  As far as using HoT to gear up, I might add that it is also a good place to learn additional raiding skills while gearing up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My guild and Alliance is going to make it's first stab at HoT Wed as well, and even more than armor drops I'm looking forward to getting a chance to test in actual situations all the advice and tactics mentioned. Going to enjoy getting a practical education to go along with the book one already given here. <br />
<br />
Best of luck Mvreena</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Practice pushing.  All melee and pets on one side, and the MA on the other.  Pets that are controlled correctly (with pet AA's), push quite a bit.  Make sure pet classes place their pets correctly on the mob and not just some arbitrary place.   Usually behind pushing is more efficient in HoT halls (because of space), and side pushing if you're in the &quot;pit&quot; or in Doze's room.<br />
<br />
In my experience, we had a 61 BST pet did insane pushing.  He'd just wait until mob was at 25%, then casted pet.  Damn thing interrupted gating like 95% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">ok didnt know it was an aa skill, he doesnt have it so it doesnt matter anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">HoT should always be on a smaller guilds menu. An uber sent of 60s (and probably an average set of 65ths) can one group there. It teaches good raiding skills and co-ordination.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that HoT gear is CHEAP, epseically when compaired to Cultural/Ornate. And there are SS peices that I don't see trading out--BP and gloves at least, for any cultrual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Anulien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">In addition to gating mobs, another tactic used is keeping them somewhat close to their spawn point.  HoT is very easy to pull and position mobs.  Many times things can even be engaged where they stand as your healers hide around a nearby corner.  If a mob does not travel far from its spawn it will not gate.  Somewhat tricky if you get white wurm spawns at the entrance, but if you position them against the wall at the top of the stairs they will not gate.  The downside of the positioning at the entrance is if you are too close to the stairs you will get wandering adds, if you are too far then there is a chance the mob will try and gate.<br />
<br />
Also, white wurms cast cold based AE.  Red cast fire based ae.  Some white wurms will try and heal and sometimes strip buffs from a single target.  All white wurms will try and gate.  All red wurms will enrage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Stommper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just to add my guild's first experience in HoT this week, we also wiped on our first attempt (white wurm just inside HoT)....it gated. Our MA noticed that cornering the wurm in the same corner as a firepot did not work well, had trouble seeing target sometimes. I also think that the wurm can channel a gate easier if in the corner...no push. After our CR, we tried again, this time positioning the mob on the wall between the stairs and the corner (like someone mentioned above) and it was then a trivial kill...nukers burned it down at 20%, as well as lots of push...no prob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Enchanters work ALOT better than wizards burning down. Depending on your dps and the amount of enchanters you have, wait til engage until mob is at 80-90% hp. This gives plenty of time to mana drain and make sure he doesnt gate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they are level 63 they can use Torment of Scio instead. It's a better HP/mana DoT.<br />
<br />
Also, you can add Scryer's Trespass (52) - the new LoY upgrade to Wandering Mind - to the list. In all honesty, I would be tempted to replace Torment with Scryer's Trespass. <br />
<br />
Torment of Argli -700 mana over 2 mins<br />
Torment of Scio -900 mana over 2 mins<br />
<br />
Scryer's Trespass mana taps 500 mana over 1 min with a -500 resist adjustment.<br />
<br />
If the enchanter ToTs and Scryer's all mobs they will be stealing 900 mana, 6 mana sieves worth (- 2,220 mana or -3,120 mana total) and still be FM to start nuking at the end of the fight.</div></div><hr />
