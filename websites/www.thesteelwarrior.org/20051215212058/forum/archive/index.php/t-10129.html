<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing EQ2 since release, and while its a good game, I still have my memories from the WoW stress test which keep haunting me.<br />
<br />
How's the game coming along so far? I'm looking for opinions from active WoW players. This isn't the outhouse, so try and keep the EQ2 vs EQ vs WoW stuff to a minimum. I'm interesting in your like and dislikes about the game. so really, anything not specificly class related is game.<br />
<br />
I've had plenty of time to play EQ2, and while I tihnk its a good game, I remember my time in beta with WoW. Maybe it was just the &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase, but I just remember that game kicking ass. I had similar hopes for EQ2, but the game changes so much post 20, that I'm not sure this is the game I want to play. For reference, heres a few things to keep in mind that I don't like about EQ2. I've played a hunter to 22 or so in beta, pre-talents and EQ2 and WoW play very similarly up to that point. I'm just wondering if WoW takes the same direction at the higher levels as EQ2 does.<br />
<br />
So, here's my biggests concerns with EQ2, mostly post level 20:<br />
<br />
1. Soloing is insanely difficult. Solo encounters are few, and the xp rewards are nearly non-existant. It was possible before to solo green and blue group encounters for nice, but not stellar xp, however they patched it so that a)group mobs are much more difficult and b) what was blue before (and a very tough battle mind you) is now green or grey.<br />
<br />
2. Quests aren't all that great, granted the xp is much better than EQ quest xp was, but you have to drag a full group along to complete even the easiest ones. Quests rarely use solo encounter mobs as objectives, even though they easily could. What happens is that the quest turns green before I am even able to complete it for lack of groups to drag along for the quest.<br />
<br />
3. There is essentially only 4 classes, so all the sub-classes kinda run together within the same archetype.<br />
<br />
4. You can't help other players without them giving up all rewards for the encounter. I can't even taunt a mob off a dying noob unless the break the encounter.<br />
<br />
5. Travel is a pain in the ass. I spend more time running from group to group than actually getting xp most days.<br />
<br />
6. I feel like I have to level up so I can do what i really want to do...quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know that many of you haven't played EQ2 so you may not understand all that I was talking about, but really I'd just like to hear how the game is after you've gained a few levels. Does it change much after 20, 30, 40? I've been raiding, to try and garner some excitement out of EQ2, but I'm beginning to think that either I'm just in a really bad level range or the game is going in a dirrection that I don't agree with. I like to group, occasionally, but I can't stand being forced to. In EQ2 I have to be grouped for 90% of the quests that I've come across, and I've done over 175 different quests last I checked. Does soling change significantly in WoW as you level is up, is my main concern, though I would like to hear any of your opinions, good and bad, about the game right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing WoW since release, and I'm having a blast.  I'm trying to remember how I felt about EQ when it came out, and I think I've gotten more of a &quot;wow&quot; factor from WoW then I did with EQ.  (and I really liked EQ when it came out)<br />
<br />
My main character in WoW is a hunter (32), and I've also got a warlock (16) and mage (6).<br />
<br />
A few thoughts on WoW:<br />
<br />
1.  Xp is faster when soloing, although a fast group can do ok - especially in instanced dungeons.  <br />
<br />
2.  I haven't worried about xp...I have to much fun just playing the game and I know eventually I'll hit 60 and raiding and such.<br />
<br />
3.  I miss having a chat window for each person I'm talking to...on the whole, most people seem less chatty then in EQ.  (probably due to the next 2 points)<br />
<br />
4.  The pace of the game is much faster then EQ.  By faster I mean mobs spawn quickly so there is no such thing as camping.  Also, quests are generally small/short, so I go in, do the quest, then run back to the NPC to find out what they want next.  <br />
<br />
5.  Related to #4, there is almost no downtime for things like regenning hp and mana.  (as an example, on the Blizzard boards I read a post about a high level mage whining because it took 24 seconds to go from no to full mana  :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
6.  The quests are well thought out and tie into the lore of the game.  Also, it's pretty obvious what the quest giver wants, and roughly how to find it.  (although actually accomplishing the task can be difficult)<br />
<br />
7.  Very little death penalty - you lose a little time and some durability on items.  This makes me much more likely to experiment and see what I can do as opposed to being super cautious because if I die I lose 2 hours (or more  ;) ) of xp.<br />
<br />
8.  It's a new game and there is downtime as they work out the kinks.  I think they've extended the trial period by 3 or 4 days to compensate the players.  My total down time is probably less than 10 hours - of course this will vary significantly depending on when people like to play...I don't usually get in until 8 or 9 PM EST, and by then any issues are normally resolved.<br />
<br />
9.  I've also run into a few bugs (got a problem with stabled pets atm), but nothing I can't work around, and not significantly different from EQ today.<br />
<br />
10.  Travel is slower then with port stones in EQ, but I don't mind it because of the transport methods.  (boats, zeps, bats, wyverns)  Once you open up the flight paths, travel isn't really an issue - again, not for me because the method is very cool, and has a good immersion factor.<br />
<br />
11.  I can't define exactly why, but I like tradeskilling in WoW - and I hated it in EQ.  Maybe it's because I can make items that are generally as good or better then what I see as drops from mobs?<br />
<br />
If you liked beta, my recommendation is to give it shot...the first month is free, so you'd only be out the purchase price if you decide it's not for you...and you can get to higher levels in a month to see what that aspect of the game is like - if you want to concentrate on levelling (or just play one toon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW still rocks.  Im a 42 Human Warrior named Lore and Im kicking butt.<br />
<br />
1) Once you hit lvl 40, its just amazing.  You get a horse to travel around in, very fast and very awsome.  I got MS (Mortal Strike) which bumped up my dps a LOT.  I was able to take on same lvl elites solo.  We get plate armor, which is a huge increase of AC and stats.<br />
<br />
2) Tradeskills are nice, Im wearing a LOT of stuff that I made (Blacksmith).  The economy is good too, player made stuff is used a LOT.<br />
<br />
3) You can solo or group, up to you.  I usually only group for elite quests or instances, makes them a whole deal faster.<br />
<br />
4) Not sure how you are in PvP, but its awsome.  Ive been ganked a few times, have ganked others, its all in good fun.  As long as you dont take it personally, its very exciting and rewarding to kill the opposing faction.  I dont attack all the Horde I see, have actually saved some.<br />
<br />
5) Though Im about 18 lvls from the lvl cap, theres SOOO much more game I havn't seen and need to explore.  Once I finish that, they should have put in the Battlegrounds and other stuff like Hero classes.  <br />
<br />
All in all, its the best game Ive played in a long long long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slam your head in the car door repeatedly like Homer did to Barney in that Simpsons episode for knowing full well that EQ2 was gonna suck, WoW was gonna be better, and still purchasing that fine product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's rather amusing to me is every single one of your eq2 concerns were concerns that I had in eq2's beta...and they have not gotten any better.<br />
<br />
My concerns for wow have not yet been proven true or false and even if they are true the game is just plain FUN...something eq2's creators forgot about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a level 45 Warrior in WOW currently.  And while much of what other people have said is true, I find that as a Warrior it is not as true for my character.<br />
<br />
1.  Soloing is doable, but fraught with difficulties.  Warriors miss enough that occassionally an even con will kick the crap out of me when normally I would own it.  While some classes can easily solo mobs that are two or three levels higher, as a Warrior I'm very much limited to no more than two levels higher and then with a fair amount of risk.  If I should get an add, usually I'm toast unless I have retaliation available and that's on a 30 minute timer.  And casters are a serious problem.  Shamans and Warlocks can put a serious hurt on me even when a level or two lower.<br />
<br />
2.  For the mount that a poster above was ranting about, I'll have to scrape together something like 100g, so I've been told.  And at 45 the most I've seen at one time is about 25g.  The constant need for gear upgrades and money spent on smithing means that getting that kind of gold together isn't going to happen for a level or two.  Meanwhile, unlike Paladins who basically just talk to an NPC at 40 to receive a mount or Warlocks who have a fairly easy quest to get a mount, I'm walking.   Which means just traveling from one place to another takes a pretty long time, particularly as places to hunt get further and further apart.<br />
<br />
3.  Down time is a problem with the Warrior class.  I'm basically bandaging or eating after every single battle when soloing, to regen health.  While it is far far better than EQ, that still means that I'm usually stuck in place unable to move for 10-30 seconds after every fight.  Previously I could bandage on the run so I could at least be moving, getting to safety, or scouting for my next target while I regened health.  But a recent patch has made it so that you have to be standing still to bandage, which causes me to stand around more.  Yes, it's better than EQ, no it's not as good as for say a hunter.  I play a 21 Hunter as well, and down time for him is perhaps every 5th or 6th mob, if that.<br />
<br />
4.  I can't fight elites solo.  Pretty much any elite that is still green it going to beat the crap out of me.  If they're 6 or so levels lower than me, I will probably win, but it's almost like fighting an even con.  And any closer in levels and the risk goes up significantly.  A 0 to -2 elite will own the crap out of me, period, end of story.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I pretty much endorse and agree with what most people have said about the game. It's an excellent game.  In many ways better than the EQ I remember.  And one that will probably hold my interest for a long long time.  I just hope they make a few adjustments to Warriors at some point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed, I can usually solo elites up to a level below me or so as well, at level 42.  However, that being said, elites also have a wide range of cons.  Some elites are damn easy for their level, others are pretty difficult.  A good example of an easy elite was Besseleth the spider in Stonetalon Mtns.  She was 21 or 22 I think, I solod her at 20 and it was quite easy.  Now, at 42, there are some 36-37 ogre elites in Alterac Mtns, that I have a tough time fighting.  At the same time, there is a 42 tiger in Stranglethorn that isn't very difficult.  Same as before, undercons and overcons abound.<br />
<br />
For myself, when I'm tired of questing and such and just feel like some mindless grinding, I've found that the fastest route of exp is going after mobs 2-4 levels below me.  The reduced exp is more than made up for by the fact that I have no downtime.<br />

<br />
Obviously you're doing something I'm not.  Perhaps if you'd care to give some examples of the elites you're talking about.  Because I'm talking about things like the elite trolls in the highlands and the orcs in the alterac mountains.  What elites are you finding to be so easy and what tactics do you use that seem to make them so?  Because as it stands, elites beat the crap out of me.  So please, enlighten me.  I'm listening.</div></div><hr />

/shrug.  I use the very &quot;1337&quot; strat of running up, yelling &quot;BOOO!!&quot;, and smacking the stuffing out of whatever.  Check first for nearby adds obviously, then just run up and do your thing.  For myself, I start with charge, then sunder armour till I have at least 3 in, then any debuffs/stuns I can use, depending on what's available and rage.  If I can I also use rend.  I always make sure all my self-buffs are ok and not going to run out (AC, sta, sta/spirit from food, agi, sharpening/weightstones on weps, etc).  By the time your HP hits the 60 percent mark, you'll know if you have a shot of beating the mob or not, and that's usually enough time to bail if you don't.<br />
<br />
Also, I like to take my healing potion early in the fight.  That way, if the fight drags on longer than you expected, and you get an add near the end, or shortly after, there's a good chance you'll be able to take another potion if needed, instead of getting whacked by an add because cooldown from taking a potion later in the fight hadn't expired yet.<br />

Do you find one does more damage than the other?  And are you specialized in protection or DPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using duel wield or 2handed weapons?  Do you find one does more damage than the other?  And are you specialized in protection or DPS?<br />
<br />
I use a 2H weapon, not because I inherently think it's any better than dual-wield or 1H and shield, but simply because it's what I prefer, and as well because it was the best weapon setup I was able to find.  I used my talents to build what I considered to be a soloing warrior, as that's how I like to play.  The majority are in defensive, with the rest in arms, and none in fury. By that, I took any talent that I thought would help me to solo, as opposed to being in a group.  For example, I don't have the defensive talents to build agro while in def stance, or improved bloodrage, etc.<br />
<br />
-edit- I just logged in to note, and my talent build is; in Arms; Deflection 5/5, Improved Charge 1/2, Tactical Mastery 2/5.  In Defensive, it is; Anticipation 5/5, Shield Specialization 5/5, Toughness 5/5, Iron Will 4/5, Improved Revenge 3/3, Concussion Blow 1/1, and Improved Shield Bash 2/2.<br />
<br />
 Also, I just finished the mithril order quests for blacksmithing, and the reward for that is a trinket that summons a very nice purple/epic 1H mace, which lasts for 1 hour with a 3 hour cooldown.  As a result, I picked up a shield in the AH, and am going to be trying out that combo as well, to see how that compares to using the 2H'r.  On a side note... does anyone know of a way, using macros, to switch from a 2H weapon to 1H + shield?  I had read on a WoW board somewhere, where some guy had mentioned he could do this without the screwing around of equipping and un-equipping while fighting. However, I can't find the post where I read that anymore, and can't find any other info about that.<br />

<br />
that's all there is to it.  Going from 2h to dual wield or sword and board to dual wield is a little more involved, but not much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And with the lastest patch any caster upto level +2 should be meat. I actaully perfer fighting casters (or warrior mobs :-/). For casters get into Beserker and heve pummel. Caster DPS sucks in melee and the have crappy armor. Just interrupt their casting with pummel (you should stop about 1/2 their spells). That makes casters toast.<br />
<br />
What is geting to me is the training cost. 42 got me 2 new skills at 3g92 EACH. <br />
<br />
And I ambegining to  find the need to really have a real cooking and fishing skill. Thought eating humaniods still helps.</div></div><hr />
