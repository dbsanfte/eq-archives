I have 2 aa's so far and think i made a mistake with the first one and put it into Bindwound and second one in run speed. Should i continue on this path or should i change my plan? I have been informed that Ac and Hp are hte most important and thne next is str and sta is this correct? Also any other help on how to make my char a better war would be greatly appriciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Library forum there are a lot of good threads with basic information.<br />
<br />
ND3 is an abbreviation for Natural Durability 3, and PE is for Physical Enhancement.  Both of them are AA abilities.  THIS LINK (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=88) has information explaining all the AA abilities.<br />
<br />
As for your current choices - most people think that runspeed 3 is the best three points you can spend out of the 6 required in the general category.  You'll never, ever outgrow being able to move faster.  So that point is well spent.  I would follow it up with another 2 points in run speed.  The point in first aid really isn't a bad thing if you solo and use bandages to heal up to minimize downtime.  I think the only real mistake you can make with the 6 general points is to not get run3.<br />
<br />
AC and HP are what warriors are all about - so you have that right.  Stamina is important because stamina = HP.  Strength really doesn't do much for you.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

I'm a newly minted Warlord myself. When I hit 55 I diverted all my exp to AA only long enough to get run 3 because I did a lot of my exping in dungeons at that time, and it still is very handy in Kael, Seb, Droga and the like. Once I got run 3 I put all my exp back into leveling experience<br />
<br />
Ac and HP definately, followed by stamina for sure. After stamina opinions start to vary. I get less +agi stats from my gear than any other melee stat personally, but adding dex has a small effect on how often your weapons will proc for sure, and I think also how often you will critical hit or crippling blow<br />
<br />
ND3 is the third level of Natural Durability:<br />
<br />
Name: Improved Natural Durability <br />
Level Requirement: 55 <br />
Ability Type: Passive <br />
Max Training: 3 Levels <br />
Point Cost: Level 1: 2 points<br />
Level 2: 4 points<br />
Level 3: 6 points <br />
Description: This spell increases the hitpoints of a player by a base percentage.<br />
The first point increases their hitpoints by 2%, the second by 5%, and the third by 10%.<br />
This impacts the players base hitpoints (determined by class, level and stamina).<br />
<br />
PE is Physical Enhancement:<br />
<br />
Name: Physical Enhancement <br />
Level Requirement: 59 <br />
Ability Type: Passive <br />
Max Training: 1 Levels <br />
Point Cost: 5 <br />
Description: This ability adds an additional 2% to the Natural Durability, Combat Agility and Combat Stability archetypes.<br />
There is no pre-requisite that these archetypes be trained in, however the greatest effectiveness is achieved from doing so. It is believed that you need at least 1 point in an archetype to get the 2% increase in it (i.e. you would get no benefit in Natural Durability if you only had points in Combat Agility and Stability).<br />
<br />
I don't know what happend to the Library Forum on the list of forums, but at least when I looked it wasn't listed on the page anymore, but go to the dropdown box labeled Forum Jump and you can find the Library there. That's a great place where a ton of  frequently asked questions can be answered at your fingertips<br />
<br />
Welcome and good luck</div></div><hr />
