<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Should I spend like 80% of my dkp on the Aten neck? If I do, what should I get for Haste replacement?<br />
<br />
I like the 41% haste on the PoI neck but... it has only 8ac 50hp. I know sooner or later I will get it replaced but should I replace it now??<br />
<br />
If I really get the aten neck, I will need to buy a droppable haste item. Any suggestion of a good haste item? I am thinking the Soulscream belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aten or Xenamech neck!? Go with a Cord of Midnight and GET THAT ATEN NECK!! Hell go for NO haste and GET THAT ATEN NECK!!<br />
<br />
I think you get where I'm going here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild always skip the named that drop Cord of Midnight.. even one may drop.. I will not have the DKP to buy it assuming I go for the aten neck..<br />
<br />
really? Aten neck worth it even I have to go for NO haste??<br />
<br />
Enlighten me please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well the effect on that neck is 8hp/8mana per tick regen AND 8HP DS...an 8 hit point damage shield at all times taking up no buff slots, plus the 8hp regen is fully worth not having any haste for a bit.<br />
<br />
You can always get haste from easily camped mobs..such as that soulscream belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's also +20atk.<br />
<br />
Aten neck is just that good. If you have a chance to get it, get it. You probably won't ever replace it. I know folks in Quarm farming guilds who won't replace theirs.<br />
<br />
Haste can be obtained in various places. You don't need Cord of Midnight, although TVXs can be killed with a really small force, are on a shorter respawn than the rest of VT, and I've seen Cord drop randomly from Eoms (not just TVXs), as can any TVX loot drop rarely from random Eoms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You won't replace AHR neck until PoTime. If you can get it, do so. It really is that good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GET IT! It has 35 AC, sv20 to all and 125hp not to mention atk up, DS, HP/mana regen. Even in PoTime Aten neck is better than most of PoTime necks. GET IT!!!!! even it means u have no haste.<br />
<br />
Edit: ATEN NECK IS JUST THAT GOOD! U WILL NEVER WANNA REPLACE IT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cord of Midnight can also drop (rarely) from Eom's.<br />
<br />
But yeah, go for the Aten neck!<br />
<br />
You can build your own haste item with LDoN points if you wish also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm.... I can't decide... I am hoping Aten will drop the mask also. If thats so, I will not hesitate to spend my DKP on it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">AHR BP, neck and mask are the best of each type until Time. Get any of them and you'll be happy forever, basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rather have gloves over the neck, as gloves rarity &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ahr necklace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">dunno what most your melee are wearing for haste, but we did the front TVX twins on most our VT runs till recently. they have 3 haste items on their loot table. guild should really consider doing them if haste is an issue for many ppl.<br />
<br />
haste in PoP consists of the poi neck, MM belt(large loot table, doesnt drop much), and PoE ring bracers and 1 set of shoulders off the rock ring.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt just throw away your poi neck so wrecklessly till i had another 40 or 32+ haste item you are happy with.<br />
<br />
the neck off magmatron isnt that rare btw, and you can 40 augment it unlike the aten neck. they are about equivalent imo, esp considering the augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tricsun-Drinal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally i'm using the Envenomed Moccasins from Emp, cause, well, belt of mastery &gt; Cord of Midnight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>victatious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hehe im using the belt that drops off of named seehorse in CS 34% but i use clicky haste on ornate guants as well most of the time if no haster<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, um, just got mine tonight, won't EVER EVER EVER EVER be replacing it, sorry but 8DS worn just OWNS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't forget AoMist haste ring, and Fennin script shoes, not counting time or LDoN augments. Earth bracers or Cord of Midnight are better warrior long-term haste items than Xanamech neck IMO.  Same for TVX Gorget, though you can't really use that if you get Aten neck.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, I'd say it's rarer than Earth bracer or Cord of Midnight (and Gorget too). And... I dunno, 8 regen + 8 worn DS + 35ac (20 more AC than Magmaton neck) + 20 to all resists + 15 all stats... I don't think they're all that even from a warrior perspective, personally. Magmaton neck is nice for sure, but it doesn't measure up. And you can only 20hp augment Magmaton neck, actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd slap MM 10ac aug on Magma neck before the 20hp/mana aug. At 25ac 135hp it comes a lot closer to AHR neck than 15ac 155hp. In my eyes anyways. Hell even if you could 40hp aug it I might still go with the AC.</div></div><hr />
