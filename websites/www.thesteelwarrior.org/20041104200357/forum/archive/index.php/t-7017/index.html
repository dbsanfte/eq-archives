<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hunky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.. new to the site.. thought I might as well ask and get some fellow warrior insight on my gear. Atm its mainly ornate and bazaar stuff as I haven't gotten much of a raid upgrade in sometime. I'm EP flagged, raid with dkp system and i'm wondering what i should be mainly shooting for. For weapons right now i use Copper hammer and bloodsworn both ang2 auged for aggro, and Axe of Kromzek Kings (old school) for my dps and 2 handed tank weapon.<br />

thanks for any suggestions and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BoW if they are not awarded.  or the haste bracer from PoE ring or even SeWS if that is an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd suggest Sol Ro for selling ornate if there's stuff you want to buy. You should also try to camp the pieces for PoE rings, those would be a significant upgrade for ya. Are you using tribute haste? If not, you should start or get one of the raid drops. Upgrading your shoulders should be a primary concern, Puresteel Mantle being the holy grail of warrior shoulders. Otherwise, get molds. Lots of them. The helm would be probably the biggest upgrade, but any of them would be pretty huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hunky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank ya guys for the tips, ill definatley try out sol ro, and save for the haste bracer. My brother is 250 everything so i should have thought of those rings, /nod. Also, would the ornate greatblade from general druav in doomfire  (35/23 170htp etc) be a good 2hander to get while I save for a bow or sews maybe? Ive heard some shifty things about the dmg bonus you get from it though. Only reason I ask, is it would be very little dkp and looks like it would preform well for aggro, esspecially with an anger aug. But I dont know, never used it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anything will do ok for aggro with anger 3, but that is NOT an aggro sword. It's ok DPS at best. It's not even in the same league as a BoW or SEWS, and it probably wouldn't outperform your current setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BoW , then either haste bracer or haste shoulders from earth (could try and get that haste cloak from fire with an XP group) then Raex<br />
<br />
edit - if a BoW / SEWS is well out of your range then maybe that taunting blow 2hs from Sol Ro? (drops on the way to Dresolik) its no BoW by any means, but better than the ornate greatblade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hunky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll check that one out.. thanks )</div></div><hr />
