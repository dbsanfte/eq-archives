<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if there has been any discussion about which is the best droppable haste item for a high lvl warrior.<br />
<br />
When I say best item, I don't mean the one with the highest amount of haste, that I can check in the hastecompendium or using magello. Instead I am wondering which gives you the best haste without sacrificing hp/ac.<br />
<br />
For instace if I go with a ccom, I can't use a Helmet of rallos zek at the same time but I can pick a good belt/back item. If I pick a ccw or a  cof I can use the helmet of rz but loose a good belt choice instead.<br />
<br />
With LDoN there are some new haste options, I know atleast there is a earring and I belvive there is a necklace out there, what about these, arn't moste of these no drop?<br />
<br />
Some of you will scream haste augment on any normal good item, but if you read back, i am looking for a droppable item. All my LDoN time now goes into pouring points towards the BP from nro.<br />
<br />
Any comments would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree - absolutely great job with the parses here, truly helpful reading them.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if it can be calculated explicitely, but I am not sure that assuming a 4% riposte mod, and a 3,000 hitting mob that 50 ac/200 HP gained from dual wield doesn't outweigh the probability of a stray riposte hitting you.<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to simulate with a simple C++ routine, however, I don't think there is enough data to calculate N (1-20) from a mob as a function of AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cloack of Flames,  and/or if you are very lucky &amp; rich Dozerak (MQable)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL who think Mearis was posting in another topic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Scalecracker (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27949) <br />

Droppable 41% haste in your range slot, 100hps, 33ac.  Pretty rare, as it drops off Ring of Fear in CT which noone ever seems to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good suggestion by Draganetti.  Let me add the Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying too; I can only think of the Dozekar haste bracelet and the Ring of Fear range item as better pre-VT haste items than the gauntlets, although I am probably forgetting some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kremib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got this belt the other night in Veksar. Pretty easy mob and decent stats for a 50's Warrior.<br />

Was wondering if there has been any discussion about which is the best droppable haste item for a high lvl warrior. Draganetti has it right, the best tradeable is whithout a doubt Scalecracker, but good luck ever finding one for sale anywhere. Your 2 best options for tradeable haste are Belt of Raging Nature and Cloak of Flames. With the belt, you give up a little HP and a good amount AC, with the CoF you give up a good amount of HP and a little AC.</div></div><hr />
