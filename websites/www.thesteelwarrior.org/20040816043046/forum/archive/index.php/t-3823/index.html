<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadostar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the last 5 days, I've been lurking the boards at TSW, PON, and Shadowknights.org.  I've seen alot of good ideas. I've seen alot of bad ideas. I've also seen a whole lot of ranting ....<br />
<br />
What alot of people seem to be missing is the point of what this is all about.  PEOPLE (and I'm talking a good chunk of the EQ populas) for the most part, do not want warriors (of thier current level) tanking for them in groups. It started with PoP zones, but has moved to many of the old world and other expanson zones. <br />
<br />
Guess one of the things that set me off some, as I've seen posters say on this and other boards, is that warriors just don't know how to use the Taunt button the correct way. So I've give you a example of how I use it, and the results I've seen many times. This is also why warriors are not that welcome in xp groups any more :<br />
<br />
-Get picked up to tank for a group in POI, at the GY<br />
I pull mob with arrow (most the time, I am puller, rare to have a dedicated puller in pickup xp groups other than the tank)<br />
-Run back to camp, if there is time, get off another arrow at the mob on it's way in. <br />
-turn on auto attack, just as it's about to hit me<br />
-2 secs in, Chanter casts slow, sometimes even before mob is at camp, Chanter is hitting the slow icon<br />
-Mob turns on the Chanter, haveing resisted the slow, I hit taunt...but mob is already out of range of it, heading to the chanter, that is stationed on the otherside of the GY<br />
-I follow mob in, and beat on it's back the whole way, waiting for Taunt to gray back in.<br />
-Taunt comes back up after it's 6 seconds, but mob has already turned back to me, becuase said chanter is now a puddle of goo at it's feet<br />
-Kill mob, Chater comes back, or is rezzed back<br />
-Listen to the gripping of said chanter on my ability to hold argo<br />
-repeat <br />
<br />
  This also heappeans to the poor chanter that knows what he/she is doing and is standing next to me when they cast slow. Seems mobs one round under 55 chanters here easlily (and lets face it, 55 chanters can get groups in other zones with better xp, makes me wonder what I'm doing tanking here at 59th).Chanter goes splat even before my screen shows that the mob is facing away from me.<br />
<br />
After repeated treatment like this from the mobs here, said chanter swears off ever haveing a warrior tank xp groups again.<br />
<br />
  And you can replace Chanter with class of your choice, with cast spell of your choice, I've seen it all.<br />
<br />
  And another thing I'm tired of is seeing &quot;Well, all our guild tanks have BoC(or even BoW) with Anger III aug added, and they have no problem keeping argo&quot;.  Well, hate to tell you, but not every warrior out there has a BoC. I myself am useing Swrod of the Bloodsworn in primary, with Snowchipper in off hand.  Last time I saw a BoC for sale in bazaar, it was going for 450k.....Sorry, I'm not made of that kinda cash. And that isn't a too high price on my server (Therris Thule). I have yet to see one listed below 425k, and It's rare to even see one for sale at all.  And right now, I'd settle for the Anger II , or even the Anger I aug, if I can ever get the points for it, that is...seems the fear of warriors has spread to LDoN as well.  LDon has helped alittle though, seems there is a higher demand for a tank, any tank now with it out...So my avg LFG time is starting to hit under the 2 hour mark. Yes, I'm not a prime time player, I can't, I work nights.  I've even been complimented on my argo skills...by knights...so I have some idea on what I'm doing, I think. (and I'm talking 65th level knights, I can name names, but there is only one that seems to think it's funny, the rest seem to be holding back the cures alot of times).<br />
<br />
In my view there really isn't alot wrong with warrior argo....but it can be better, I think. Alot of the problem seems to be that people have gotten lazy because of the argo capabilities of knights, and this isn't a knock against knights. I don't believe that any type of nerf is the solution.<br />
I wonder if there is any real solution to this problem at all, other than changeing the mind set of the avg. player. <br />
<br />
  The way I see it, right now, I'm probably never going to be that Warrior that gets to go toe to toe with some major baddie and click the defensive button. <br />
<br />
  Lets look at the future, as I see it. Say warriors get a new thingie(aa, skill, anything else), and are able to acheive first contact argo lock. What will become of knights...they will be put back in the spot were I am today. Lets face it, your avg. pick up group doesn't care about anything else other than, can it tank the mobs, and keep me safe from death....nothing else matters to them.  <br />
<br />
  And I have yet to be asked AC/HP from a group before I join, and it's rare that even the cleric will ask after I join, I'm just another meat shield for them. Someone to be placed between them, and the nasty mobs....so they can xp at a awsome rate.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading this, and sorry for any spelling/grammer errors in this text. And sorry for a post as winded as this one.<br />

Glory and Honor, my friends :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Replace &quot;lazy&quot; with &quot;3 times more efficient&quot;.</div></div><hr />

....<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway. The problem is not, if playing correctly, the warrior's fault. I have my good and bad days. Sometimes I get aggro on inc and hold it, sometimes I never get it. Dependence on a RNG is like that.<br />
<br />
For the record I do have a BoW, I also have a Bloodfrenzy, Aegis of the Earth, Stone Etched Mallet, and am borrowing a guildmate's Clade of Carnage, due to my poor aggro holding on boss encounters. Some nights it works for me, others it does not.<br />
<br />
In exp groups it isn't always so bad, less people = less possiblity of someone overaggroing. But I still have to hit taunt a few times to get it off someone at times. Simply put, Taunt is a broken skill. I don't mash, but expecting it to work every time you press it because a mob turned off you is folly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dual weild a GBoS and a CHoS which are better agro weapons than many warriors have.  Both weapons have force shock as proc.  If my proc goes off just one time before the slow I usually own agro.  If it doesn't go off before slow lands I always have to taunt as the mob heads for the slower.  About half the time taunt works first time, but sometimes I miss up to 3 or more taunts in a row.  If that happens, I usually have to use AE taunt before the slower gets low health agro and is beyond helping.  Even though the slowers in my groups very rarely die, this is just wrong that Sony has allowed this problem to continue to happen for so long.</div></div><hr />
