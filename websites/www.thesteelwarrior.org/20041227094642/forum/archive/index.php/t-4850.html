He had to just sit in the background and do nothing but /attack on, because all his discs except offensive, were stuck at 19 hour reset timers.  He waited for 5+ hours for a GM to fix it, but never got one :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try 24(!) hrs for each timer and for incite. Both yesterday and today. /bug and /reported, hope they fix this soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bibi</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm  u may want to check your window's system clock.<br />
<br />
My clock was 24hours ahead, so my disc reuse time was 24hours.<br />
After i changed it back, everything works fine now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">went into control panel and to the date/time selection. it showed the clock was right on. so i went into DOS window and typed &quot;date&quot; and &quot;time&quot; and it showed the time exactly correct. so apparently this isnt going to solve everyone's problem :(<br />
<br />
on a bright note on one of the other threads there was word that it will be fixed in tuesday's patch. ill just say &quot;i hope so&quot; and leave it at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I noticed the opposite effect last night.  Every timer I saw was running way too fast (my defensive reset in about 4 minutes).  Also, I /dueled to go pull something out of the bank and the rez timer dropped from 7 minutes to 15 seconds in about 3 minutes real time.  Was really odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">after sunday's patch my discipline timers seem to be fixed. notice i started this thread without the expected &quot;woot&quot;. im wondering if i was cured of my &quot;cold&quot; and another warrior came down with it in my place or if its really fixed. so it would be good to pose the question .. as of AFTER the sunday 12/21/03 patch is anyone else still bugged on this?</div></div><hr />

This is the only place it has happened to me and last happened 26 Dec.... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zordian</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My timers are still all goofed up.  Last I tried.. still had to wait 23 hours 45 minutes to use Incite.  Does sony actually even care?  or was this ust another lame piece of computer workshop code they put in just to say they did something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few days ago I was zoning from butcherblock into greater faydark and I had about 60 % endurance before I zoned, and 100 % after...</div></div><hr />

<br />
rysingsun1 when u open a DOS windows and type Time i think u got the Time from windows and not the Bios one. As if i m right, the DOS windows u open is emulated by windows itself.<br />
<br />
To modify your BIOS clock u need to enter in the bios setup. Power on your computer then hit &quot;DEL&quot; key (this key most of the time) u should see a message like &quot;Entering setup...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Good luck all.</div></div><hr />
