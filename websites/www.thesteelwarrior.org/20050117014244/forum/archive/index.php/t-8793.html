Ive been doing a bunch of ldons in BB but havent seen any of the hate augs drop and everyone keeps mentioning Anger III, but I havent seen that at all.  What are some good augs I can get, and which areas should I do ldons in?  Ive got like 80 pts in BB but I keep checking the vendors there and I dont see anything remotely resembling anger augs.. Well, thats about it.. I really apprciate the help, its beena a while since Ive posted here.</div></div><hr />

You can pick up an Anger I or II aug for less points there as well.  You won't find any dropped agro augs in any of the camps.<br />

Ive been doing the BB ldons and was allways hoping to get some nice anger augs, but didnt have a clue that you bought them, and that they didnt drop.  After posting this I came accross this website. http://www.rpgexpert.com/330.html and it had a complete listing.  Well, I have no points in EC but as of now I guess Im going to be doing hte EF camps.  Aggro has become something of a sore point with me and nothing irks me more then having a ranger or rogue steal aggro..Sooner or later Im gonna start scrapping with mobs that rampage and god help the rogue who steals aggro when that happens..he he..I cant wait for that...Well, I gotta go, thanks again for the help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/snicker<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though, sell that PIECE OF SHIT and buy a real aggro weapon  :D .  Greatstaff of thunder is a great start, although simply buying a Sword of the bloodsworn to go with your CHoS may be ideal.<br />
<br />
SBoD sucks ass.  It is vendor fodder and only good for selling to high level wizards who want to make twinkey warriors and don't know better.<br />
<br />
Get some levels and get some anger/yak augments from everfrost/guk.  Your best buy will probably be the 500pt yak aug (100dd + stun) and the 700 pt yak aug (125 + stun).  If you just plain need &quot;the best&quot;  i suppose you can grind out 2400 points for 2 anger 3's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, hate to say it but they should pass out sterilization kits when you buy your SBoD so that people who use them dont make little warriors who will think that the SBoD is anything but a total peice of crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, the SPoD and some other gear was a gift/hand me down, from my cousin.  I serriously dont see why you think its that bad..Its pretty quick, has some nice buffs, including a +20 to AC.  If I can slap a good aug on it, wouldnt it be a great weapon to go along with my SoBS and CHoS?  Ive seen it go for over 100k, but honestly, it seems allmost comparable..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not comparable in terms of aggro and you suggested you wanted to improve in that particualr area.Lot's of threads here about weapons you can look through.SBOD is a joke on this board cuz wars buy it for a lot of pp for all the wrong reasons.You want weapons with good innate aggro procs first that you can add augs to to create dual aggro proc weapons.<br />
<br />
My friend tanked in ep's with dps weapons including SPOD with anger 3 on them and did fine.However, his aggro was always less than mine significantly.If you want good aggro read these boards and pick aggro weapons.GSOT is good and ridiculously cheap.The CHOS and SOTB are better and probably much cheaper tgeather than the SPOD alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavelloc</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its good for dps but as a war you need to worry about agro more, a chos or sotb will beat out a sbod hands down with the stun proc and a anger 3 aug in it, the gsot will beat it out also for agro, you can keep the sbod when you raid with a guild to dps if you dont tank but as for tanking you want agro over dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I had to do some research because I think the SBoD is getting a bum rap and this is what I came up with..<br />
<br />
SBoD<br />
ATK/DLY 19 DMG 14<br />
STR+15 DEX+15 HP+90 AC+20<br />
SV VS COLS +15<br />
<br />
CHoS<br />
ATK/DLY 20 DMG 13<br />
STR+8 DEX+4 AGL+4 HP+65<br />
MANA (??who cares) SV VS FIRE and COLD +5<br />
Force Shock Proc<br />
<br />
SoBS<br />
ATK/DLY 19 DMG 12<br />
DEX+4 STA+8 AGL+4 HP+55<br />
Planar Strike<br />
     Ok, other then the proc effect that the other two have, and by far the CHoS has the best, the Planar Strike seems to get resisted all the time, they are very similar weapons, but the SBoD has a 20 point AC increase and better HP's.  I truely think its getting a bad rap.  I think it will be even better once I get a good aug on it and slap it in my secondary slot and keep the CHoS in the primary..Atleast untill I can get a BoC.  Please, explain to me why its such a crappy weapon..Im not trying to be a pain or smart ass, I just dont see why some people think its sooo shitty.<br />
     Also I wanted to ass this..The knock back/stun of the hammer is nice but it can cause some real problems if you keep knocking the mob back toward other mobs..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one said SBoD is a bad weapon, they just said it sucks for agro. If youre having problems with agro that 20ac and hp boost doesnt really mean anything is their point, unless you can transfer it to those rogues and rangers that are getting beat on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, other then the proc effect that the other two have...<br />
<br />
But that's the point that is most important, and you seem to be dismissing it like it doesn't matter.  The other two have procs which produce more aggro and the SBoD does not.  The AC and HPs on the SBoD don't mean crap if you aren't the one getting hit.  Sure, you can aug the SBoD but 2 procs is still &gt; 1.  At the least do yourself a favor and use the hammer in primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll notice that there are required levels on the Anger augments.  So, you'll need to reach the minimum level first.<br />
<br />
And take the advice of the many previous posters and get rid of that crappy Sbod.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go stand on a more sensible side of the mob so it gets pushed in another direction. Not directed at you personal but god I hate melee that just stand on one side and push the mob all over creation.</div></div><hr />

Simple question: Are you using Incite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really are set on keeping the SBoD (against all advice you have asked for and gotten, hehe), at least move it to offhand. Your agro will increase a bit. Also, make sure you put your first aug on the hammer and keep it mainhand. Dont get tempted by the more impressive, yet less meaningful stats and keep the SBoD in your mainhand should you decide to keep it.<br />
<br />
Also, tag with an arrow on incoming whenever possible, use taunt when you lose agro (don't spam it), Incite/berate/bellow is your friend (not sure which you have at level 52), stand as close to the mob as you can get and still hit, and lastly don't get worried about talking to your group about managing their agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">search the boards (since im too lazy to find it for you) and locate a few good discussions  on the split blade. i had a split blade through most of my 50s and then i sold it for agro weapons. this is my take on it (and most here will agree) ...<br />
<br />
its a fine soloing weapon. its even good for doubling up with a cleric. but its not good for tanking in typical groups.  yes the 20ac on it is good but... your slower will have to wait longer to slow the mob so all the mitigation (what is it one percent?) that you get from it is lost several times over by the excess damage you take waiting for the mob to be slowed. and that mob wont be slowed for a while once your slower learns that he must wait to slow to avoid getting whacked. your enchanter will wait to tash too and your nukers will wait to nuke. some of them will despair that the waiting means they cannot make use of their manna pool. mobs will ping pong and the cleric will waste healing manna and the excess heals may lead to the cleric gaining agro too. all and all a frustrating situation for the whole group.<br />
<br />
all good warriors learn that an agro proc is not enough. FOUR agro procs is the standard. and with a split blade you automatically are limited to three. and until you get your agro proc augments you are limited to a rather scary ONE proc (!). i know it hurts to lose the 20ac. i know you love the 14/19 stat on it.<br />
<br />
even with four procs a necro stacking dots can gain agro at will. even with four procs a beastlord slowing on incoming will get hit frequently. most consider it a worthwhile tradeoff because they mitigate decently. even with four procs a cleric will find himself rooting mobs to keep them off him if 3 or more mobs come in on the pull. but it sure beats what you go through with say 2 procs. like most warriors with good agro ive had many compliments that i keep agro &quot;pretty decently&quot;. its a compliment that when you get it you will forget about the lost dps of the split blade (which by the way isnt much better than a copper hammer on account of the lack of 179dd stun proc that the hammer has - its debatable if it is any better at all).<br />
<br />
dont let others get you down by making fun of your split blade. i used one for a long time. i know the letdown of selling it. i DID like the 120k it fetched me. but you CAN still sell it for 100k or more on most servers. it might plummet in price after oow depending what drops in that expansion. sell it while you can. it is THE favorite weapon of many plat buying twinks who equip their warriors before they learn the class.<br />
<br />
no mention here of the horn of hsagra and its 35ac. it was painful for me to sell that too. hsagra is one of the preeminent low level twink weapons by the way since last i checked it had no level requirement. but it like the split blade it is missing the all important proc.<br />
<br />
another word on procing weapons. not all procs produce big agro. dd procs dont produce much. the copper hammer is loved because its stun/dd proc DOES produce good agro even if resisted.<br />
<br />
for the price you get for your split blade you have a good chance of picking up a helm of rallos zek and that will get you back all the stats you lost on your split blade and it will make it easier to stomach. if your split blade is a gift and the gifter would be insulted by you selling it show him the stats on the helm and try to convince him its a more than worthy trade of resources to sell the split blade and buy the helm.<br />
<br />
hang tough. dont let the mockers turn you stubborn. you need the agro procs. you will need them more and more as your level goes up and mobs can kill your casters before anyone can even get them rooted. and good luck.</div></div><hr />

as you stated in the first part of your your first post, sbod is not bad for dps but if you want agro then go with the suggestions we made, if you are having trouble with taking the advice we gave ya then need to ask yourself this &quot;do you want to dps or do you want agro?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah man, move that shit blade of destruction to offhand at least...but, hell, to bad it was a gift from a friend/cousin of yours. you could buy some massive upgrades from selling it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with all here and say the SBoD is great for looking good and MAY be good DPS but since you are a warrior DPS is not your primary concern....aggro is. Your job is to get it, keep it and let the mob hit one person. DPS in a group for the warrior is secondary.... if everyone in your group is getting the snot whooped out of them will increase med time for the healers and decrease XP regardless of how much DPS you are adding.<br />
<br />
The Gold Standard for aggro until you're raiding mobs for something better is the Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn. These weapons, with some skill at taunting, will carry you through nicely. Add anger augments to them as you can. Both of these weapons proc and yes will sometimes be resisted. Resisted procs DO add aggro. (ie: Think about a caster casting a slow that is resisted.) <br />
<br />
Stay close to the mob when ya fight...get in their face so to speak. Do NOT repeatedly mash the taunt button if you already have aggro...if you do, odds are when someone else gets aggro, you will have to wait until it refreshes to taunt (which can seem like an eternity). Notice what the people in your group are doing to catch aggro ..... is the ranger snaring at 95%? is the necro slapping on 3 consecutive DoTs? is the caster slowing and then sitting down prompty (my personal favorite)? Ask them in a tell politely to alter their behavior...&quot;I notice you're getting slapped around alot. I am doing everything I can to keep the aggro. Do you think maybe you could snare a bit later?&quot; Rogues can EVADE and sometimes have to due to their DPS. If you are doing everything you can (have the right weapons combo, taunting at appropriate times, staying tight to the mobs) to keep your aggro and you're convinced that there is nothing you can do to improve the situation (including sending tells to the repeated offender), let the group know you are doing everything in your power to hold aggro. Shortly after this point, I tend to &quot;lose&quot; my taunt button when aggro is snagged by the same person again. I tend to find it right before they have low HP aggro... but if it's a really bad day that person seems to run out of HPs before I can find it again. The &quot;Returning to Home Point&quot; message seems to serve as the only heads up that some will listen to and most often their behavior will be altered upon their return to the group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One factor that may make some of this advice seem strange to you is that at level 52 your Dex is reading 126. That's fair dex for your level, but as your level/gear/AAs get higher, procs will become more and more obviously important, and you will find that the best dps options available to you simply don't keep up with the dps aggro that other classes can put out if they don't throttle back their damage.<br />
You dex influences the rate at which you proc, in other words, and at low levels and low dex you might have to wait a bit for the proc to happen. But as you advance, you'll have no dps option available to you that will reliably hold aggro. <br />
This, coupled with the going price of your weapon, is why people are telling you to sell it and buy the much cheaper Great Staff of Thunder and the droga weapon.<br />
If I were you I'd find out whether or not your cousin would be offended if you sold the weapon. If not, sell it and buy the others.<br />
If it would bother him (or her) then return the weapon as soon as you can equip a Great Staff of Thunder, and save up for a droga weapon (or, if you have enough to buy the sword, buy it now and return your cousin's gear).<br />
If a rogue swipes your aggro, taunt mob; on taunt failure, immediately /shield rogue. Sometimes that helps to pop the mob back onto you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I took your advice and put the SBoD on my trader and its up for sale now for 100k, which seems like a ton of loot. Currently Im running with my CHoS in primary, and the SoBS in my secondary.  Aggro doenst seem to be a problem unless Im grouped with Sk's who use the voice of doom or whatever its called..Maybe darkness..Then its touch and go.  I grouped with a BST this morning who I believe had two ChoS and keeping aggro from himi was a major pain in the ass.. Incredibly so.  As for gear, I dont think I can find better armor unless I save up for a few months and farm my shammy like mad and get some ornate.  Helanic seems to be my best option right now and its ok.  Fully buffed I top out at around 6k hp and 1220 AC.  I got a good look at the BoC and all I could say was WoW!  Thats an agro machine..Its going for 450k on my server!  450K! amazing...truely amazing..I went and tried to talk to the ornate guy, to do the quests just to see what I needed and he wouldnt give me the time of day, couple that with that crazy unicorn in Lfay would called me a talking piece of refuse and I was in a foul mood.. So, one last question..What about using 2 ChOS...would that work well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavelloc</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">chos is lore so the bst was using something else that had the same graphic on it but the ornate guy will not give you the time of day till you hit 55 and nothing will change that. BoC is great for agro, heck i spent 370k for mine instead of waiting for it because i dont have patients for it but look into the str of elements quest to upgrade your shoulders and that will hel, also look into the tribute guys and you can add 150hp and 50 ac that way but everything will go up as you lvl and get your AAs<br />

as for the sk, have em cast the agro buff on you to help out some</div></div><hr />

I had a few choice words with the sk, who as it turned out was very receptive to my plight. he he..The is a 1hb out there, Starts with a D..something like Detorxy Flint forged cudgel..Its not ver fast, but not slow either, and has a 400-600+ proc..Not too shabby..I wish I had the link for it..Anyways..Im hopeing the Drog combo works out..

edit (slight derail):  That other hammer you talked about is probably the quest hammer you get out of Natimbi. Really easy quest if you have any inclination to do it, and not terrible at all because you can get the 4 quest pieces off of good exp mobs for mid 50's group. Plus the restless souls drop an aug, and there are some other misc loots out of Natimbi.<br />

<br />
as for agro do what i do, shoot an arrow in coming and step up turn autoattack on right as he is about to get to you and then hit taunt and then incite orwhatever agro item you have and you should have agro set from there and just need to hit taunt if you lose agro and incite as needed, mashing looks like its doing something but its just makin your hand hurt and using up endurance that is not needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need to correct you there Mavelloc...<br />
<br />
Proc rate is constant. If you are hasted your proc/swing ratio drops. If you are slowed it will go up. <br />
<br />
Agro seems large a funtion of damage and damage bonus per swing. So at least potentially slower weapons can do more agro. It would certainly explain why the WMBS is so good at holding agro. (Best DB/delay ratio possible.)</div></div><hr />
