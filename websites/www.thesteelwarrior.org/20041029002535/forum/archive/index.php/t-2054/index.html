<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mahulk Keras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So recently people made parse of BoW proc rate and we discovered that BoW was procing as much as BoC (2 procs / min in average).<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that 2handers were procing more than 1handers since they have to compensate for not having a second weapon that can proc (ie Dual Wielding EB weapons).<br />
<br />
Now if what I thought was true BoW is sucking for proc. And that would mean also that most of the agro you get from BoW would come from the massive damage it outputs. Of course EB helps also on long fights (Xegony) when the MT has a lot of time to built agro.<br />
<br />
So is BoW proc rate really that low or is my thinking wrong on 1hander vs. 2hander proc rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They don't proc more, they proc the same amount over a period of time. ie: BoC mainhand + Non-EB offhand you'd get the same amount of procs over 1 hr constant fighting as you would with a single BoW.<br />
<br />
If things were &quot;equal&quot; a BoW would proc less than a boc - considering it swings less times in the same period of time. Since it procs the same, that shows the compensation</div></div><hr />
