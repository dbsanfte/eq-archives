<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey i got a brand new idea that will make plate tanks stack, be effective and will also bring some new fun to being a enchanter<br />
<br />
how about the ability to imbue a tanks wepoans? all tanks pallys included. example<br />
<br />
there is a cleric a shaman a enchanter a pally a sk and a warrior lfg<br />
<br />
now the cleric/shaman/chanter want a tank, and a damage caster and prolly anything else, just not another tank<br />
<br />
now the could get the pally to start off with, that makes 4, now they dont want another tank, they want a dmg caster and a bard prolly. <br />
<br />
here is were my idea comes in, new enchanter line<br />
imbue cold, level 50<br />
imbue fire level 50<br />
imbue disease level 50<br />
imbue vampire recourse level 50<br />
imbue power of the mind theif level 50<br />
<br />
imbue bitter cold 62<br />
imbue blade inferno 62<br />
imbue fettid rot 62<br />
imbue bile of the great bat 62<br />
imbue blade of the mind reaper 62<br />
<br />
this would mean instead of leaving 2 holes in the group while they sit on their butts and wait for the ideal group, they can make a group with whats there,<br />
the warrior could have a cold proc, pally could do fire, SK could get vampire recourse, this would mean small group heals from the SK, and making the pally and warrior effective dmg dealers enough to stack, this means that having 3 tanks in a group is no longer stupid (notice i stayed off poison, thats a rogues job) this could be a enchanter spell ( ive heard from many people that its hard to get a chanter up from 30-60, after that its easyer) or the life tap and disease could be given to a necro(who also have trouble getting groups) <br />
<br />
this would make alot of classes &quot;stack&quot; well togeather, also making enchanters and necro's more group friendly. one thing tho is there would have to be a long recast on these so that you cant have 5 warriors with small group heal life taps and 1 necro. <br />
<br />
im still not sure where im going with this idea but i think it could turn into something really cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So new enchanter spells to fix tank balance ?<br />
<br />
As it stands SK's can already buff themselves with either a lifetap or a mana tap proc (the lifetap one can be further enhanced with AAs), and enchanters already have a spell to buff any class with ATK and a lifetap proc - Night's Dark Terror.<br />
<br />
In the situation you described above I think most groups once sorted with a tank + slower + healer would grab the remaining plate melee to fill the spots if there was no DPS lfg cos most people will take a non-ideal group over no XP, and if there is DPS LFG then no amount of adding DPS type buffs to tanks is going to make them more desireable unless you are really trying to bend poor monks and rogues over a barrel.  If you want to make plate melee desireable DPS alternatives (any more than they already are) then I'm sure the DPS classes will probably want better mitigation or avoidance in return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i mean on the mana steal and HP steal line that it affects the group, much like that one necro spell, this also allows a warrior and a sk/pally to provide mana and hp like a bard does, takes 2 to do the job of 1, which i think is balance, it wont fix class balance but it will make plate tanks easy to stack, which is something they all lack Vs. casters<br />
<br />
-- <br />
<br />
and as for monks and rogues, i didnt have ideas for them at the time but i just got one<br />
<br />
distilled poison level 50 (add's a poison to a rogues blade)<br />
fettid posion 62 (disease and poison double proc added to a already poisoned blade, also rogue only) being rogue only it can have increased DPS and maybe a mod to back stab<br />
<br />
for monks, <br />
<br />
pulsing flame 50<br />
aura of flame 62<br />
cold flux 50<br />
aura of chill 62<br />
<br />
these lines add differnt amounts of cold or fire dmg, i made both elements because there will be times when one or the other is useless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also the fact that proc's can be added to any wepoan would mean that they could use more wepoans than the all to common combo's, also this means any 50 plus tank would be able to take agro as needed, while the dmg classes could do dmg with out getting killed, the proc for the tank types could be set up to work like the blade dance from the bard spell and the major DPS classes could have reverse dmg shields that do more dmg as they hit the mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why make that an enchanter line of spells? You could make them potions or, to throw rogues a bone, poisons to be applied to weapons.<br />
<br />
Edit: Questions require question marks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe they could be be made by shaman's, then the potion is enchanted by a chanter, then a rogue gets a skill that allows them to apply it on others wepoans, that would be really cool<br />
<br />
rogue_01 says &quot;let me see that sword for a second&quot;<br />
bad_ass_dps wepoan bursts into flame<br />
rogue_01 says &quot;try stickin that into a goblin, should give ya that extra punch, and fry it for lunch! har har har&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the Apply Poison skill would have to become targetable. Not only are there a sickening number of No Drop weapons, but the &quot;Let me see that sword for a second&quot; line offers WAY too many chances for someone to get scammed.<br />
<br />
They are rogues, after all. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think that this idea is really nice, but I would prefer to have some Items drop which have Procbuffs on them. ( like Aten gloves ... ).<br />
<br />
Thinking of <br />
<br />
Globe of hate ( used out of Inventory ) <br />
Procing rate like the 56th Cleric summoned Hammer <br />
Procing a 50  or 75 unresitable Hate<br />
<br />
Globe of FirePain (used out of Inventory )<br />
Procing rate like the Bloodfrenzy<br />
Procing a 150 DD firebased <br />
<br />
Globe of FrostPain (same als Firepain coldbased )<br />
<br />
Globe of the Executioneer<br />
Normal Procing Rate<br />
Procing an unresistable 325 DD <br />
<br />
Mabe some smaller Form of this with 75 DD or 25 (35 ) hate.<br />
<br />
Small form dropping from Velious and SoL Bosses.<br />
greater Form dropping from VT and PoP Bosses<br />
<br />
All this stuff is only useable by Warriors.<br />
<br />
You could so get Hate in a steady stream or a bit extra damage or some really nice damageprocs.<br />
<br />
This stuff would not stack with each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i ment it as apply poison type set up(targetable), and id want it to be EXTREMELY cheap to do so warriors dont have to pay out the ass to get some of it, id say rogues because it would bring them importance and utility outside of corpse runs, this would make me think of getting a rogue in my group more often, plus if a ogre tried it they would get themselves hurt lmao</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shmashed</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">some ogres are intellectuals however<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, do you find it just sad that warriors like myself spend so much time thinking up stuff liek this that is useless and will never be put in the game?  Not trying to offend you for coming up with the thought though, ive spent time trying to think up a solution as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So in order to fix the fact that warriors aren't a DPS class you want to make them one with an enchanter line of spells.  Brilliant.  Are we going to add a line of enchanter spells to let monks and rogues tank as well as warriors, or shall we just kill those two classes and force everyone to play an enchanter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our aggro getting fixed is thinking so far out of the box that this doesn't seem all that strange, really. It almost looks like something that the devs would really put into the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you increase all melee dmg ability 20% it still means the one that started out at 50% is gona be behind the one that started out 80%, who knows? it could have differnt effects on each class.<br />
<br />
im just saying casters stack, melee's dont, maybe we should find a solution to that, its a problem up there with agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaza</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, many enchanters have been discussing things like this for a while.  While it may not be 'the fix', it would be movement in the proper direction, and we all know how much SOE likes class interdependance.<br />
<br />
We already do this, in a limited way, with Boon of the Garou, Tricksters Augmentation and Night's Dark Terror.  Adding more short duration targettable melee buffs+procs to the enchanter line without illusion components would A) Make enchanters stack better both on raids and in groups and B) Help address issues with pure melee classes.<br />
<br />
I can already give a warrior a rather serious +aggro proc with Tricksters Augmentation in zones where lev is not disabled.  Add more spells, perhaps ones with different resists and different +hate and +dam amounts, maybe even some with short stuns or taps both self and group.  Spread them out across the levels between Boon and NDT and to 65 *shrug*<br />
<br />
This can help deal with the itemization problems 'Oh, you want to use a +dps weapon instead of a +aggro weapon?  NP, I'll just keep +Hate Proc Buff65 up on you so you'll still get the aggro of the BoC while wielding a better DPS combo' or 'Hey, you got some awesome +aggro weapons, lemme hit ya with Dam_Proc_Buff65 so you'll also be dishing out some nice DPS in the bargain!'<br />
<br />
Sure it would also help knights, but it would, relatively, help warriors much more and help close the gap between knight aggro and warrior aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I'm saying that if rogues still do significantly more damage than warriors, warriors won't get any DPS slots they don't today, and if rogues don't do any more damage than warriors you've killed the class (or monks or rangers).<br />
<br />
Unless you kill the DPS classes, warriors will not contribute anything more than sub-par DPS - maybe less sub-par but still sub-par.<br />
<br />
And I think we're all too dependant on enchanters as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this make any sense whatsoever<br />
<br />
If your giving these spells to enchanters who are slowers.. how would it make slowers not needed? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that one is building off the idea of having rogues being able to give others procs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wanlor</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Kilaara has a good idea -- why not make an item (made from a tradeskill of some sort) that is NODROP , and is warrior only that has a right click from the inventory that adds a proc to your weapons... May not be the BEST solution to aggro , but it also would not unbalance anything IMO, warriors would have the agro they want + more DPS (??????)</div></div><hr />
