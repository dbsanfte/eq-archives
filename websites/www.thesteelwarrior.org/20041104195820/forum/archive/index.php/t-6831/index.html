<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wasn't sure which area to post this in since it deals with a few topics, I'm sorry if this thread is poorly placed:<br />
<br />
I noticed in The Library section, a thread concerning the hate concentration concerning the maximum potential damage per swing of your main hand weapon, if one is using a weapon without a proc.<br />
<br />
Now, prior to the damage cap being removed as a level seven iksar warrior, I have two weapons accessibile to me for the time being: Swiftblade of Zek or a Wurmslayer coupled with a Lodizel Shell Shield, until I can dual wield. <br />
<br />
If the thread concerning hate is correct, then in theory the Wurmslayer would be the better choice of holding aggro (with a 34% haste item.) However, the Swiftblade is less than half the delay of the Wurmslayer. Since I'm taking many more swings per battle with the Swiftblade, would the hate generated be superior to that of the Wurmslayer, prior to the damage cap being removed?<br />
<br />
What about after the damage cap is being removed, would the same weapon out of the two be superior? Which should I use when I can dual wield?<br />
<br />
Finally, one last question. My haste item is the Seahorse belt. I do know that worn, non-click haste items do not stack with eachother. However, if I were to use a Velium Swiftblade in my primary hand (is that even wise?) would the 41% haste of the Velium Swiftblade override the belt's haste?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help in advance, as I try to build my army  of weaponry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">arf arf<br />
<br />
I can't answer all of that, but your best (highest) worn haste wins - and so, as you say, your higher haste item would override the lower.</div></div><hr />

Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Other things to consider at level 7 is skilling up. You would typically want the faster swing weapons in all types to gain the most skill points as you are levelling.<br />
Additionally it is important to look at the weight of a weapon until you get stamina over 100. Under that skill level you will suffer greatly using the wurmslayer which is extremely heavy.<br />

Is this still an issue, now that the Stamina bar is the Endurance bar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At level 7 your damage is capped, so you would be much better off using the faster weapon until at least 20.  You will do great with either weapon from 30-40ish, but I would use the swiftblade just for the hit points.  That weapon is overpowered enough for your level that you shouldn't really need to worry about aggro at all hehe.<br />
<br />
Naralli makes a good point about skillups.  Get one weapon of each skill type and juggle them when you can to try to keep your skills moving.  With the speed of leveling these days, you won't be able to max them all every level, but max as many as you can, and get everything to at least 100ish so when you hit your 40s it's not so painful to catch them all up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Everything sounds great so far. I'm debating putting a velium swiftblade in primary for dual wielding just for the added haste, until level 27 where I'll put a wakizashi in my offhand.<br />
<br />
For other tools of the trade, I have the 2hb stormwood bow, a blackened acrylia greatsword, and the velium 2hpiercer that looks like the lance from the ring war.<br />
<br />
I'm well open to other great suggestions : )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hate becomes an analytical issue once you have a damage bonus.  The more &quot;damage bonus per second&quot; a weapon dishes out, the more natural hate it produces.  That's the gist of the theory that you read in the library, anyway.<br />
<br />
At levels 27 and below you do not have a damage bonus, and at levels 50 and below you do not get a special 2-hander bonus.  So your only concern should be DPS right now, and procs once you have some available to you.<br />
<br />
Revisit the aggro issue when you reach your 40's and most weapons start proccing for you, and then revisit it again at level 51 when your 2-hander bonus kicks in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm debating putting a velium swiftblade in primary for dual wielding just for the added haste, until level 27 where I'll put a wakizashi in my offhand. <br />
<br />
If you're gonna use a piece of crap like the velium swiftblade, put it in your offhand.  No reason to waste your primary hand wielding that hunk of crap when you could just put it in your offhand where NOTHING is going to perform well until closer to 50.  You can't double attack with your offhand until somewhere in your 30's...I forget whether the actual skill level is 150 or 200 or what, but it's something like that.<br />
<br />
Also, it need to be restated, for everyone reading this thread.  Yeah, I know the majority of you hate me and just skip my drivel, but if you read nothing else on this board, read this :<br />
<br />
A lot of the people here are concerned about aggro.  These people are mostly level 65, and we're tanking mobs that can one round our caster friends.  Aggro is a primary concern for us.<br />
<br />
If you are under level 50, there's a very good chance that you're not tanking anything that can do any serious damage to a caster.  You don't need to be concerned with your aggro abilities AT ALL until somewhere in your 50's.  Seems like there's a new thread every day with someone asking about his level 10 warrior and what aggro procs he can use or how he can generate aggro.  Man, when I was 10, I had a 10/35 sword with no stats and no proc and I was fucking badass.  You're gonna be fine as long as you've got a weapon and you're swinging it, so don't sweat it, and honestly, don't worry about it until WAY later in life.  You'll be happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">arf arf<br />
<br />
Velium Swiftblade, at 41% haste, isn't worth the expense - as Haass sez, it's crap ratio.  Especially if you're wearing a Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24753).  I took a little peek at the bazaar just now, and noticed that the Velium Swiftblade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31208) is *not* showing as a 41% haste item, but a 36% haste item. (I'd always thought it was 41% .. mebbe it got a stealth nerf at some point).  Gaining 7% worn haste for such a horrid ratio, even if it is in the offhand, is a bad trade off, and for 2% it's horrible.  Get a Centi Shortsword or some such instead, and maintain your DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Had no idea about the haste reduction on Velium Swiftblade, so either way it's really a moot point.<br />
<br />
I just want to have an optimal setup that will carry me for a long time, and also utilize the skills I'll be using at higher levels. I already have a bag with different stuff that will proc as I go up in levels, Wakizashi, Venomous Axe, Frostbringer, but for now it's all about me working those skills and figuring out what will work best now, and later. I know that I'm going to stick with this, so I figure the earlier I know, the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Velium Swiftblade was always 36%</div></div><hr />

<br />
D'oh! I hate to learn that I've been storing misinformation as fact!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Haass replied about the velium swift blase being a bad choice for mainhand because of ratio, which is true if youre at a level where ratio matters, but that sort of misses the point of the question since the warrior in question is level seven, he said these are the only available weapons, and it's actually a more complicated question than just looking at the ratio. <br />
<br />
That said, at level seven it shouldn't really matter, by the time you mainhand the wurmy and put a wakazashi offhand when it procs you'll still be a long ways away from having agro issues like casters chain nuking.   So it's kind of an academic question on how the small levels of early game agro work, if agro is connected to the potential damage of the weapon or to the capped potential damage.   At low levels, I think actual DPS is going to be more important than agro based on DPS, so all you have to so is see if the average hit on your wakazashi divided by delay when mainhanded is better or worse than the wurmy.   <br />
<br />
Of course this is all based on the assumption that you only have those two weapons; since haste doesn't stack you should just sell the velium swiftblade (or scrounge up a couple 100pp) and buy pretty much anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">After reading all of the advice given so far, I've filled a satchel with the following weapons.<br />
<br />
a) I sold the Velium Swiftblade.<br />
b) I carry:<br />
Jade Mace<br />
Crystalline Spider Fang<br />
Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies<br />
Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood<br />
Wurmslayer<br />
Stormwood Battle Staff<br />
Centi Warsword<br />
Etched Velium Lance<br />
Polished Shai'Din Naginata<br />
Blackened Arcylia Greatsword<br />
Swiftblaze of Zek<br />
Frostbrinber<br />
Greatsword of the Bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
The simple weapons, aka Jade Mace, Stormwood Battle Staff, Etched Velium Lance, Polished Shai'Din Naginata, Blackened Acrylia Greatsword, Crystalline Spider Fang are for skill ups. The proccing weapons like Waki, Venomous Axe, Frostbringer, Greatsword of the Bloodsworn are for aggro procs as I move up in levels. The Centi and Wurmslayer I'm not really sure what to do with, I currently wield the Centi with the Swiftblade of Zek for some pretty nice dmg.<br />
<br />
I picked up most of those weapons after reading all the suggestions here and trying to figure out what would be pretty moderate ways of adding to my arsenal. Plus, since I'm an iksar, I'm carrying a lot so I don't have to run back and forth to a bank.<br />
<br />
Thanke for all the advice, I hope it all keeps me well &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats not true at all haass. i enjoy reading your posts. i find you very knowledgeable and thats mostly what im here for anyway besides just shooting my own mouth off.<br />
<br />
velium swiftblade: ahhh the good ol swiftblade. i give them to my pets all the time if they can duel weild :)<br />
<br />
the haste (/tangent .. thought it was 36%) does not stack with other worn haste items. if you dont have a worn haste you can put it in your secondary up through your 30s or so and not suffer too much from that ghastly damage rating since you wont hit much with secondary anyway. but after that it has GOT to go. give it to me! sell it to me! sometimes my pets die and i say bye bye to my swiftblade :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">agreed. agro is not important at low level. matter of fact if the assists get hit occasionally then they have a fighting chance at reaching 50 with a defense higher than (30).  my baby chanter likes to pull with slow because he WANTS to get hit a little to keep his own defense stat climbing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well so far, I'm up to level 20. Trying to take it easy and not grind too hard so I can enjoy the earlier levels and also raise up my weapon skills to max, so myself with my Shaman partner have visited places such as Field of Bone, Kurns Tower, then straight to Estate of Unrest. The experience goes at a nice pace, so I have time to max my offense defense taunt kick and almost every weapon skill every level.<br />
<br />
Right now I have my Swiftblade of Zek in my Primary, and the Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies in my Offhand. The Swiftblade does indeed keep great aggro through sheer DPS, but I haven't gotten to fully test out the Wakizashi. Previously I had been wielding a Centi Longsword, which was also riding out nicely.<br />
<br />
I replaced the Crystalline Spider Fang for Cresent Blades of Luclin, just for the skill ups. It's faster, and piercing seems to go up quicker using the latter of the two.<br />
<br />
I'm trying now to look towards the higher levels and finalize a weapons setup until I (if ever) start raiding. I hope to find a nice guild on Prexus that is really just beginning Velious content and raid through the progression like it was originally designed. I hope I can find something like that anyway.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice, if anything else comes to mind I constantly am checking this thread to gain more insight &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">With the weapons you have, I'd definitely go with SBoZ and Frostbringer.   The Wakazashi just isn't that great of a weapon compared to what else you have available, an 81 DD in your offhand is practically nothing and the ratio is about on par with fine steel.  I'd sick with SBoZ and Frosy til you get a better weapon and only use any of those other weapons you mentioned if you want to practice weapons skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">sboz should get you pretty decent aggro through the lower levels, it's pretty decent for damage until you get high enough that recommended level items aren't crazy capped for you anymore.  Frostbringer is absolutely excellent aggro as well until you're 60ish or higher where casters start getting heavy nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Klomck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I pretty much agree with ya Haass. <br />
also, the way i understand the way worn haste works (it shows L1 to L36 on lucy) is that you will only be at the % that is your lvl. IE, FBSS isnt 21% until lvl 21. this could be all wrong, but its the way I've always understood it.<br />
 the damage cap for 2 hand weapons goes away at 20. the damage cap for 1 hand weapons doesnt go away until 30. use the fastest weapons you have. a really fast weapon (regardless of dmg) would be *my* option for the off-hand, as your DW skill will go up much faster, and double attack will go up a little faster too. <br />
try to keep ALL your combat skills up as you lvl. make priorities though, in case you have to leave a few behind for lvling fast. hand to hand and throwing are probably the bottom of the list. 1hb, 1hs, 2hb, 2hs are top. next down is archery and peirceing. slam/bash is quite important, but dont forget kick, as it starts to score stuns in your 50s. <br />
bah, im rambling now... sorry =)) GL with yer warrior. if i had it to do all over again, I'd still have made a warrior!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Klomck, your rambling provides good insights for me, so no need to be sorry for it =p Actually, I appreciate the lengthier posts because right now I'm just trying to learn as much as I can.<br />
<br />
I don't intend on ever having to level fast, I'm purposely taking things slowly and enjoying the game. On top of that, the Iksar experience penalty is keeping me from surging ahead too quickly anyway. Most of the levels I've gone through have left me wishing I had more time in that level to work with my weapons. At level 22 now, my 1hs 1hb 1hp are all at 110. Archery is in the 30s, I never pull without an arrow, I have hunter's barbs and the Trailblazer bow equipped at all times (as well as way too many damned purified crystals). Unfortunately, because I work so hard with the other skills, my 2hb is 0 and my 2hs is only 46.<br />
<br />
But I'm levelling in South Karana at the moment, and thoroughly enjoying killing aviaks. Although the deep red avocets give me a little downtime, forcing me to use my 1hs also, and the wandering cyclops would have handed my ass to me save for a ranger that happened to run by and chloroplast me at that very moment (yay thanks Luving lol).  I'll try the Frostbringer, I just wish it had some stats on it. Usually I dual wield with the Centi because at least it has 8 stamina, which give me a small amount of extra HP. The Frosty won't proc until I'm level 40 either, bah =/<br />
<br />
When I am working with a weapon skill though, I usually offhand the Swiftblade of Zek to keep the extra HPs, and mainhand whatever I'm working on. At 20 I made sure to get my first Provoke type discipline, so that helps while my shaman partner tries to slow.<br />
<br />
I work with kick all the time, since I can't bash without a shield. It's like at 109 I think lol.<br />
<br />
So far so good though. I don't know how fast the haste is working, it doesn't work like normal recommended level items have 2 sets of stats displayed. <br />
<br />
The Wakizashi doesn't proc that much in my offhand anyway, so it's just as well that I get rid of it.</div></div><hr />

sometimes my pets die and i say bye bye to my swiftblade<br />
Going VERY off-topic ... how do you get stuff back from your pets, whether they live or die, anywho?<br />
<br />
The rest of you, as you were: discussing the levelling of a good warrior. To wit -  my understanding has been that if you were wearing a haste item that offereed (f'rinstanc) 36% haste, you got 36% haste regardless of  your level, but that the total haste your character could have was limited (tho generously) by your level.  There's a good looking guide to hase (http://www.eqdiva.com/EQ/Guide.aspx?id=9&amp;ForumID=132) on EQDiva.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I would assume he's an enchanter, and kills his pets when they get to low % in health. Then just loot the weapons and switch to another full HP pet. That way he gets full experience from killing his ex-pet, without the charm-pet -experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I always read Haass posts with interest.<br />
It looks to me like you have plenty of weapon for the job at your level. Use your bow, taunt, provoke and /shield properly and your lack of aggro should never be the primary cause of a group member's death.<br />
Any first-character warrior who reads this should note what Haass said about the weapon he had. Centi Short Swords even today will do very nicely until you are 40ish; if you don't have Uber weapon #64, don't worry.<br />
There are two main adavantages in holding aggro before level 50: first, your group will expect you to; second, you should be the most efficient person in your group at damage mitigation. The second factor here is important in experience groups, because the faster you kill stuff the better off the group is. All groups will have some sort of bottleneck; sometimes it's the respawn rate at certain camps, but most often the bottleneck is healer mana. <br />
Well-equipt monks, rangers and rogues can gank your aggro, but if they do, they will ultimately slow down your group's experience, because they take more healer mana than you do. You have to do what you can to keep the mob's attention, but other classes have to figure out how to do max damage while riding under your hate, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Like Doggabone said, the haste an item gives doesn't have anything to do with your character's level.  Items have a &quot;level&quot; that is static and is used for determining this haste, lucy includes this in the item's info (for example, go to lucy.allakhazam.com and look up cloak of flames, if you click on the raw data there's a field called &quot;level&quot;, which is 35 for CoF, haste is item level +1.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Haste does scale with level up to the level that matches the %haste you have on your item.  Put a cloak of flames on a level 1 and he will attack at the same speed he does without it.  <br />
<br />
While most people are right about the swiftblade in general, in your 20s and early 30s dual wield skill is low enough that you very rarely swing with your offhand, so at those levels the haste on the swiftblade might be worth it.  It is crap at higher levels though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">arf arf<br />
<br />
I Hadn't thought of charmed pets, thanks fer the heads up.<br />
<br />
I'ma have to just parse a level 1 toon one day to satisfy my curiosity - I'm unable to find an incontrovertible proof one way or t'other (and too many good opinions on each side).  But, scaling being the case, by the time you really want that haste yer gonna be past that item's haste anyway, I s'pose.  Do what yer like, and if you have more plat than you know what to do with, send me a /tell.  <br />
<br />
And specifically to Celeritum, yer well set IMO.  You'll have ample opportunities in the middle levels to catch up the lapsed melee skills - taking 2HB from 0 to 200 took me three nights XP'ing with a shammy in tow. But keep up the good work with them, it's certainly much easier to have as many caught up as possible, at all times. You can practice bash by quickly dropping your shield into your offhand slot when the Bash key comes up again (Ruatha, or Ghetto Bash)  - I did it bunches in my 50's till I maxxed bash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Forgive me, I can't help ya with most your questions there as I haven't been a warrior too long... But I do know a good bit about skill capping so I thought I'd throw this in incase it can be of some use to ya:<br />
<br />
I am a sadistic SOB, and I have long since decided that my first 25 levels or so of every character are going to be complete and utter hell so that my next 40 levels or so will go by smoothly...<br />
<br />
Therefor, I'm a capping whore.  I lug around a backpack full of the lowest delay weapons for each type that I can find... if it has really low DPS like a shovel, then all the better.  I buy an IoS and a dex buff off a shaman (not HoS!  Infusion of spirit, and a single target dex buff... it'll net ya 50 more dex.  And if your really concerned about the other stats, ask for a single target one of those too, and ask for altuna.  You'll net more of every stat, and more hps out of the deal than a HoS will give ya... you just have to donate a little more) and pull only dk blue con mobs to keep the exp low.  Coupled with the low dps attached to my skillup weapons, I can cap all my weap skills at a pretty low level.<br />
<br />
I just pick one weapon and kill fast to level 7, then throw on my buffs and my crappy fast weaps and start capping... By level 10 you'll have them all capped (and if you cap bash/slam, start kicking... might as well =P) since you get alot of swings in for less exp.  Once your all caught up, use your crappy weaps to cap to the next level, then switch to your best combo and grind out a level.<br />
<br />
Sadly, with today's quick leveling I still got my warrior to 25 in 2 days, and have every single combat skill capped.  After the levels start getting longer you can just start switching in good weapons in place of your skillup weapons, and still cap everything each level. <br />
<br />
Anyway, enough rambling... to help ya a little more directly, pick up a shovel to cap your 2hb (7dmg, 27 delay if memory serves me) and a WMBS for your 2hs (the level restriction will lower your damage quite a bit, but its fast as all hell, so for skilling up it's priceless.  And always pull with a bow for the love of god...  It's good extra agro while waiting for the mob to get back to camp, and it's easier... plus if you get good at understanding pathing, you can pull singles with a bow that you just can't with proximity agro.<br />
<br />
If after all that (or if you've leveled fast without doing any of that) you still have alot of weap skills uncapped, there's two ways to go.  One is nag one of your shaman guildies to help ya out:<br />
if you duel a pet class, you can recieve skillups off fighting their pet.  Since shaman's pets hit like a poodle, they make perfect fighting dummies. (and if defense isn't capped, the shaman can give dogdog two rusty weaps to make it duel weild, haste it, and haste it again with pet haste... You'll cap defense really fast)  Now, have the shaman IoS and dex buff ya, Haste ya, and just heal you or dogdog when either of your hps get low.  Sidenote:  if you use this meathod, it's really helpful to have fast, low damage weaps as dogdog doesn't have all that many hps.<br />

Or, you can head on down to the painel, down right next to the entrance to the warrens... There stands a npc who is Drk blue all the way up to 40 something, and who hits at only 18 per pop.  He's also got a ton of HPs, so he'll last a good time (and if you kill him he's an 8 minute respawn.)  He's non-KoS, but when you hit him he'll start off the fight with a 400hp harm touch.  After the HT is gone, he can't really do much damage to anyone.   The best part about this guy is that your right next to the zoneline, so if the HT is alot of hps for ya, just zone over, med back up, and go back fighting... he won't be able to HT ya again.  Also, if you don't want to wait for respawn, just stop fighting him when he's close to death, zone, zone back, and he's most likely healed by then (or just wait a bit for him to heal up if not).<br />

Anyway, sorry to ramble so much.  Hope all that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Brutall, are you sure about your claim that a level one character won't get any haste (or only 1% haste) from an item?  I've never heard this before, and pretty sure it's wrong.  To check I did a quick 2 minute parse with a level one cleric wielding a 50 delay Bloodforge Hammer.  Without haste, just as expected, he had 24 attacks in 2 minutes.   With a Sash of the Dragonborn (24% haste), he made 27 attacks in 2 minutes.   I know it's not much of a parse, and with 24% haste you should actually expect 29 attacks, but the level 1 cleric swung noticeably faster with the haste belt (and by noticeable I mean that i was running a clock in the background just so i could tell when two minutes were up, whats nice about a 50 delay weapon is the cleric took a swing every 5-second &quot;number&quot; (1,2,3 etc) of the clock, with the haste belt the cleric kept swinging earlier and earlier before the clock reached another &quot;number&quot; until he got an extra attack.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I've been working my weapon skills etc, tried to slow down my experience a bit so I could get more skills per level. At level 22 right now, and I have a new question...<br />
<br />
I read a lot of the forums here, and one of the big concerns to some people seems to be which hand you are wielding what kind of weapon. Now I read the analysis of dual wielding, but it leads me to this: let's say you have a weapon with a great proc for aggro in your mainhand, but it is 1 or 2 delay slower than the other weapon you are dualwielding, with a semi-okay proc. (Not using any specific weapons, in order to generalize this question) if you took a 14/21 with a pure aggro proc, and a 13/20 with a dd+stun proc, which would you mainhand? If neither had procs I'd assume you would mainhand the 13/20, but do the procs change things?<br />
<br />
Sorry if that's a bit unintelligable, I'm a bit tired =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">&lt;&lt;Going VERY off-topic ... how do you get stuff back from your pets, whether they live or die, anywho?&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
yeah .. sorry about getting us so off topic like that ... but since you ask ...<br />
<br />
summoned pets you cant get your weapon back. only charmed pets. i was refering to my druid. if the pet is killed by another mob it poofs. if its dispelled and killed by a player it can be looted.<br />
<br />
didnt mean to get so off topic. ill try not to do it again :)<br />
<br />
its refreshing to see a young warrior who is enjoying the lower levels rather than under constant stress to level as we all occasionally group with people who will rant and disband if they arent making the kills fast enough because they will never be satisfied till they reach a higher level of uberness only to find when they finally get there that they still arent happy where they are and they are still stressing over how much exp they get. another reason to enjoy the game where you are is because once you get into your 50s your level progression will drop off sharply. you will then be forced to slug it out for extended sessions if you want to see rapid gains. it will be a greater shock if youve rammed your level up to 50 really quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I just enjoy it. It's really fun to me, and if it's fun I don't see why I should even consider rushing it. But what is important to me is making sure I get these things right early, so that later on while some warriors are just beginning to figure out how these things work, I'll be working on finessing what I already know  :)</div></div><hr />
