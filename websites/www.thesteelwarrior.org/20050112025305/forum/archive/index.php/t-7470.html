<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rakaul</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.  Any recommendations on holding agro against rangers, or anyone else for that matter, that are also using the same weapons?   I've also noticed that proc rate is so erradict on the sotb.  Sometimes it will proc 4 times a fight and others not once.  I've honestly used the greatsword of the bloodsworn some to hold agro since that proc acrimony seems to do fairly well but I've never heard people mention it has an agro weapon.  Everyone touts the sobs and chos(this isn't procing yet since I am 49) but when everybody and their mother is using the same weapons it seems like a pissing contest.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  I have a feeling everyones going to tell me to just do EF until I can get an anger aug?  :(<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

The more procs you have, the better. The cheapest Ykesha augment is 510 points, a match for anger 2, so you can go to Guk if you want. One both your weapons start proccing, it'll help alot. The fact is that ANY class that wants your aggro can take it. This will always be true, no matter what level you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When other people are using high aggro weapons and they are not the MT, then you can do a couple things: 1) ask them to swap out their weapon for a more appropriate one or 2) tell the healer to let them die if they get aggro.<br />
<br />
Since rangers die quickly, you will soon have aggro back on you where it belongs :)</div></div><hr />

You have to work with me. Though, since insite (if not longer) that has been less of an issue. <br />
<br />
What often carries more weight is when the healer says stop stealing agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the statement about telling the group. If I'm grouping with a time geared monk or ranger I flat out say to watch agro because my weapons are not the best. But in most cases their ac/hp are higher than mine so it's not a really big deal :P</div></div><hr />

Thanks.<br />
Have a heart to heart chat with your cleric and let the aggro thief die.  Make a hotbutton with &quot;/g HARDEEHARRR!  Silly root muncher! Charles Darwin says HI!&quot;  and press it whenever the ranger dies.  <br />
<br />
I'm level 65, have an Anger auged SoD and a BoC.  Not the best aggro around, but certainly respectable.  My housemate has a level 65 wizard.  Most days I can make him amanage mana, as opposed to aggro.  But when he says 'screw my mana bar', reaches into the back pack and pulls out the Big Dark Can of Firey Whoopass, he's taking aggro, and that is just that.  (Well, ok, I hold it when its the end of a long raid fight.  But in groups I mean) <br />
<br />
Its a fact of life that just about any class can catch aggro off you if they have their heads up their ass.  Most players with an IQ of over 12 realize this and chill out a bit so they don't.  It's our job to maximize the amount of aggro we do create so they have to chill as little s possible.  Sounds like you're keeping up your end of the bargain.</div></div><hr />

I'm a 65 and have really good gear and weapons.  I'm mainhanding a sotb with Anger 2 and offhanding a BoC ( will soon swap once I get Anger 3 on BoC). Also WA 1.<br />
<br />
If I'm in a group of people who know their class and play their roles, I don't even need to taunt.  If I'm in a group with some Ebay'd chanters or Beastlords that just enjoy stealing my aggro, they will.  All I can do is save my taunt to snap it back.  <br />

They need to make more WAR only weapons available at all stages of the game.<br />

I really like option 2 here.</div></div><hr />

Generally if they're stealing aggro, its because they don't understand the whole tank tanks, and no one steals aggro system.  Its best to explain to them briefly how it works, and if they don't jolt or wave u off, next time they get aggro stop attacking, and just watch him, hopefully the healer will waste a noticable amount of mana and scream at the new paper tank.  I can honestly say I used to play a ranger, and I never realized that i was stealing aggro cuz my spell proc/weapon procs had DD stuns(Flux Axe from Fear ruled), and I thought the warrior just sucked.  I learned later of course how it works and rarely took aggro, everyone has/had to learn, so why not try to help if he's ignorant to the fact.</div></div><hr />

Yeah.  I suppose I should give them the benefit of the doubt and tell them all.  I've done this in the past, some listen, some say they know, and others just cop an attitude which then pisses me off.  <br />
<br />
I guess its similar to the wrong person breaking mezzes.  They need to be informed and what they do with that is up to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apokolipse</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel any good player who understands the game should be able to fill what needs the group has.  I've been in groups where a pally or SK join us for dps ( what a joke, I know) but I was higher level and had more AC and HP so I was still supposed to tank.  They would steal aggro on each pull , sometimes before I even engaged.  Eventually I would tell them to tank because &quot; I know how to get aggro, and how to NOT get aggro.  With my 2h slash I can add some dps and never get hit.  If I whack a crit for 715 with my windblade using fellstrike, sometimes I'll get the mobs attention.  If that happens I simply back up or stop attacking for a second, once the mobs back on the MT I start swinging again.  It's not rocket science people.  Rangers have jolt and if that doesn't work, stop attacking for a sec.  Don't stand there till you die and then blame your tank.  And I agree, if you're not tanking don't show up using droga weapons.  That's just stupid.<br />

I was designated Main Tank and he was sending me tells claiming that he took agro from me ( i guess he was proud ). I simply replied saying &quot;Great for you! Now I need you to show me how skilled you are at NOT taking agro&quot;.<br />
The next time he took agro from me he died and quickly.  I seem to have cured him.<br />
