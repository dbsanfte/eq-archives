<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kharrior</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was fortunate to win the shim from an open Xanamech raid this weekend and I'm trying to decide how to augment it.  I'm not in a high end guild so I'm pretty certain this will be a life-time haste item for my warrior. <br />
<br />
My original plan was to purchase the +10 AC aug in BB but many people have said that's not the right way to go.  My thought was that the extra 10 AC would work since pretty much every other stat can be maxxed out on other gear.  The only other way I can think of to go would be direct HP.<br />
<br />
Is my thinking flawed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jateki</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10AC on your neck item sounds good to me. You'll gain 16AC for 510 points. Your only other vendor option would be 20hp/mana augment for 1150 and I would rather have the AC myself. But I feel that 16AC is much better than 23HP. Or taking it even farther, I feel 80AC is much better than 116HP is the 5 potential slots.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. Peace-</div></div><hr />
