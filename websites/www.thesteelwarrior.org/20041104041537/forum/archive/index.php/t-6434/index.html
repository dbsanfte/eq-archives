<br />
minor dd + an ac debuffer<br />
300?<br />
400?<br />
500?<br />
<br />
the stats alone make it great for an offhand weapon ... just need to know before i seriously take a shot at bidding for it via the ol' guild.<br />
<br />
its possible for us to 1group the encounter .. in which case i might not have to bid on it persay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can say anything too, doesn't make it true.  AC debuffs generally make for some decent hate, and the fact that the proc rate is slightly higher on the scim probably makes it pretty good if you don't have a high caliber weapon like the Blade of Carnage or Greatblade of Storms creating your aggro for you.<br />
<br />
And since you have a GBoS, and augmented no less, with a Copper Hammer to match, I probably wouldn't burn points on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It may just be a quirk of my guild, but we never put much stock in the anger value of this proc.  This weapon has worse DPS and worse aggro than a Great Blade of Storms (which is also 1-groupable and respawns very quickly), and only slightly better stats.<br />
<br />
When our warriors wanted 1-hand weapons to augment with Anger 3 and we had no luck getting Enraging Blow, we looked at weapons that have better ratio and hit points: Jiva's sword (also 1-groupable), Bertox's fist, Agnarr's sword, and SolRo's knife.<br />
<br />
If you like the VZ weapon as a non-DKP option, then I suggest camping your pet sword (if you're flagged), as it is approximately equivalent.</div></div><hr />

Q. Since when is 15/19 (0.789) a worse ratio than 14/18 (0.777)?<br />
A. Since 1+1=5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">14/18 in primary handily outdamages 15/19 in primary due to dmg bonus.<br />
<br />
i guess now and then the laws of arithmetic are bogus eh?<br />
<br />
15/19 is a better offhand weapon than 14/18 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used the OSoW for awhile and I think people are giving it a bad rap.<br />
<br />
Basically it's like a souped-up Frostbringer.  The ratio, enhanced proc mod, and stats make it a very good choice for tank without 2 EB's or an EB/stun combo.  I would rate its aggro only marginally above the CHoS but it's stats and added dps blow the CHoS away.<br />
<br />
I used to mainhand BoC w/anger3 and OSoW offhand.  I noticed many times in xp groups that an early proc from the scimmy would let me hold aggro through shaman slow.  No proc would almost always get a summon or ping pong.<br />
<br />
Everyone basically says get EB or stun, but folks who played back in velious will tell you, back then slow and debuff proc were king (Unless you were getting Gaudralek's out of NToV).  Just because the debuff proc is out of fashion don't let it fool you.  I'd hate to see a rogue or ranger wielding this before a tank without a decent offhander.  They drool at the stats I but guarantee you the proc will give them trouble.<br />
<br />
But back to your question..I'd rate the aggro of the proc to around 300-400.  It's similar to red epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have this item in my mainhand with Anger3 and use a BoC in my offhand with Anger3. And I have WA5. I proc a lot.<br />
<br />
This item also has a plus 25percent to the proc rate, above the normal &quot;2 procs per minute&quot;.<br />
<br />
Don't undervalue this item.<br />
<br />
I would rate the anger value higher then 400 but that just sheer speculation, I suppose I should parse them someday....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have an OSoW in primary, with anger 2, and an un-auged CHSD in offhand. I also have WA3. Tanking ldon hards, solro, mting raids, etc i have very very few problems with aggro. If i recall correctly, slows were parsed to be approx 700 hate. If someone else pulls a mob, and i tag with an arrow, and then get 1 OSoW proc, along with an incite, I keep aggro through slow. Therefore I would have to say the proc is ~300-400 aggro. Or more. It really works well, and I have no regrets getting it. Now I just need a real EB weapon to mainhand, and I'll be good for a long time.</div></div><hr />

Handily? Bullshit.<br />
<br />
Damage bonus on 1/10 of a second does not make that big of a difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, it does and does not handily outdamage 15/19....<br />
<br />
The longer you parse the further the 14/18 will pull away from the 15/19.<br />
<br />
So in context of the thread, which seems to be focusing on the aggro it generates from fight to fight, and most importantly the aggro it produces at the start of a fight.  A 15/19 and 14/18 are pretty much the same since the 15/19 starts as better dmg and slowly the 14/18 outdamages it as the fight goes on.<br />
<br />
Next what matters in comparing the two weapons is the proc rate of which (actual weapon stats being equal) the 15/19 has the edge.  If you also consider the increased proc rate this particular 15/19 has it definately procs more then the 14/18.<br />
<br />
And the  final thing to compare when determing which actually produces more aggro is the amount of hate produced by the actual proc.  In this case I feel confident that the GBoS has the edge.<br />
<br />
so if i were to compare these 2 weapons...<br />
<br />
15/19 slightly less damage per fight, procs more, but a little less aggro per proc -- Also considerably better stats/saves/Hp<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
14/18 slightly more damage per fight, procs less, but more aggro per proc -- Stats/Saves/Hp are &quot;ok&quot;<br />
<br />
As a disclaimer, I don't know for fact if the OSoW proc is less aggro, I am assuming it from what I know in the years I have been playing this game. This is only my opinion of the two weapons.  If you don't like it, write your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well in a paraser that works off the log that doesn't go below 10 delay the 15 damage weapon will win. but not by much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">actually im not sure how far the GBoS would pull ahead of the OSoW, am i the only one realizing that AC debuff from the sword would increase its dps?<br />
<br />
and im almost positive that the AC debuff will beat the dps of greatblade of storms, gold runed mithril knife, and jagged shard of frozen flame for overall aggro<br />
<br />
the tanks in my guild who use it dont have much problem with aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So in context of the thread, which seems to be focusing on the aggro it generates from fight to fight, and most importantly the aggro it produces at the start of a fight.

<br />
Where the fuck did you come up with this?<br />
<br />
If weapon 1 produces say 50DPS, and weapon 2 produces 48 DPS, Weapon 1 will always, at every point in the fight except for maybe some gay opening round half tick bullshit that you wanna spout, outdamage weapon 2.<br />
<br />
I'm telling you that 1 delay does not overcome 1 extra damage on a weapon, thereby making it a better weapon.  14/18 certainly does not &quot;handily&quot; outdamage 15/19, in fact, I would say that the best term you could put between the 2 would be a &quot;slight&quot; advantage, and I'd give the advantage to the Scimitar on ratio alone.<br />
<br />
Now, when you count proc damage, then it might tip the scales a tad the other way, but since the difference in proc DPS between the 2 weapons is less than 5, I wouldn't consider either weapon to be significantly better than the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Where the fuck did you come up with this? <br />
<br />
GBoS = 2.277 Efficiency<br />
OSoW = 2.263<br />
<br />
GBoS is better DPS, you were confusing us talking about average damage per hit versus DPS which are related concepts but not the same thing at all. Basically if the GBoS does an average of 96 dmg a round and OSoW does 100 a round the OSoW does more dmg on avg in the first round but during the fight due to the increased speed of the GBoS it will make up the difference and pass the OSoW.<br />
<br />
I may be wrong on that, but I do believe the efficiency formula has a direct correlation to DPS.  That's &quot;where the fuck I came up with it&quot;, I am pretty sure thats correct, but if not I am sure someone will post....<br />
<br />
As to the person who mentioned the AC debuff on the OSoW.  It has been shown in several parses...and unless I missed something is still generally accepted.. that AC only matters in increments of 100 and the OSoW debuff is only a 6 point debuff.  <br />
<br />
Knowing how modular the game would have to be for its size its a fairly safe assumption that AC works the same for NPC's as it does for PC's. However it would be interesting to see some parses of that 6 points, to see if it makes a differance as I would bet most mobs have an even AC value. And if it did make a difference it would be more prevalent in melee heavy groups especially a group with 2 or more rogues =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">From here: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=965&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
That AC debuff also has a DD involved, albeit a small one.  The above poster didn't mean the extra damage came from melee damage from the AC debuff, but rather from the DD on &quot;Obsidian Shatter&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yea the fact that the proc is basically useless as far effective DD or debuff (30 pt DD, 6 AC debuff=gimp) further leads me to believe it was mainly put on there as an aggro generation tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have a Gleaming Obsidian Shard, which is pretty much the same thing.  I noticed right off when I got it, that the proc rate was just insane.  It wasn't until Lucy added the proc-rate info that I discovered why.  125%  Not quite as much as Bloodfrenzy, but still respectable.<br />
<br />
The debuff and DD component are linked, so it doesn't work with ingenuity.  Resists don't seem to matter either.  It still ticks off PoFire/SolRo mobs.<br />
<br />
Of the two weapons (scimitar and blade of storms), I hate to say it, but I think the GBoS is more suited to a ranger, and the OSoW is more suited to a warrior.  Rangers that I've seen with the scimitar usually end up dead pretty quick.  They can downright screw up a raid on mobs like Raex, Druav, RZ, Ginto, etc.  It's definitely not uncommon to get 3-5 procs within rapid succession with ambidex/ferocity 3 and 305 dex.  I haven't tried it with WA yet.<br />
<br />
On the DPS note, GBoS definitely has the OSoW beat.  Toss in ingenuity and the gap widens even more.<br />
<br />
The AC debuff component, I haven't seen to have any noticeable effect.  PoP mobs have fairly low AC anyway, but I have used it on high AC Luclin mobs with no noticeable effect aside from 30dd and aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that is what the above poster meant, then the GBoS is definately better since its proc is a 179DD with 0 sec stun.<br />

 <br />
<br />
Okay, new question, how the fuck did you come up with this number?<br />
<br />
Because 15/19 is a better ratio than 14/18, and I can fucking promise that 15/19 MELEE outdamages 14/18, because I know for a fact that 13/20 outdamages 12/19 and it's the same deal.<br />
<br />
Proc damage is a different story, and I'm not doubting that OVERALL, on low MR mobs, the GBoS is going to outdamage the scimitar, but I'm telling you that whatever math you used to determine that 14/18 outdamages a 15/19 is using some really funny equations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Tamener's numbers are clearly modals, i.e. (2*Dmg+DB)/delay.  The lower delay of GBOS outweighs its lower damage value, as reflected in Tamener's modal numbers.  This matches what I've seen in parses.  14/18 slightly outdamages 15/19.<br />
<br />
By comparison, 12/19 and 13/20 do indeed have approximately identical modals at level 65, and 13/20 was superior at level 60 when our damage bonus was 11, so Haass's statement is also accurate.<br />
<br />
14/18 &gt; 15/19<br />
12/19 = 13/20</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">&quot;Okay, new question, how the fuck did you come up with this number?<br />

<br />
<br />
14 times 2 plus dmg bonus + 1 divided by delay<br />
<br />
15 times 2 plus dmg bonus + 1 divided by delay<br />
<br />
the dmg bonus is what makes it the better dps weapon.  <br />
<br />
base dmg is more important the higher you get in levels, as the mod strays from the cookie cutter &quot;times 2&quot;.  remember when you had your uber 5 dmg 23 delay weapons back in the day?  the max hit was 11 .... dmg x2 + 1 ... works like that all the way up, except with higher attack, str, and levels, the &quot;2&quot; gradually gets bigger.<br />
<br />
i'm not sure the exact &quot;mod&quot; on weapons for a lv 65 is but unless its 5x or higher, the added dmg bonuses from the extra swings will let the GBoS outdamage the OSoW every time... and thats not counting procs.<br />
<br />
you cant just say 14/18= .778 and 15/19= .789, because youre losing sight of the fact that you get more dmg bonus off an 18 delay than a 19 delay.<br />
<br />
correct me if im wrong plz</div></div><hr />

12/19 = 13/20<br />
<br />
<br />
I think its clear that the discussion was assuming level 65.  That said, yes you are correct once the dmg bonus is lowered to 11, a ratio comparison becomes a valid DPS comparison, not quite the same but close enough.<br />
