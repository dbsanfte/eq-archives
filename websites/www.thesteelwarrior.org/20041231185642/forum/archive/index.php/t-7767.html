I am sure there are some kind of test on this and if you know of any can you point them out but in highend tanking how much AC are you will to give up to gain X HPs and vise versa. I am personally a little torn now over these 2 face pieces. Flawless Steel Mask (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23025) or Eroded Royal Face Mask (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24176). I have always gone for the highest possible Hp so I replaced my Flawless Steel Mask as soon as I got the eroded one but getting into Tipt and areas like that now I am wondering what is better 35HP or 10AC. Just looking for opinions or facts prefered about HP vs AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until the AC cap was lifted with PoP, I was strictly hitpoints.  Then after finding out it had been raised from 1250, I had a hell of alot of catching up to do.  AC &gt; HP.  Definately go with the 20ac mask.  You're not at the point where AC gives diminishing returns, it'll just keep giving and giving.  I normally group with 1 cleric.. and thats it, I'm fortunate enough to have a set group, and he can tell when I don't even have an AC buff before I do.  I'm even at the point now where I'll downgrade my hitpoints for more AC.  Whats 100hp vs 100ac when a mob hits for 3k?  The 100hp in reality isn't going to do jack, but the 100ac will shine so bright...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was the AC cap lifted the game through?  Or just PoP zones and above?  Meaning, does my AC mean what it says when I enter a Velious zone?  Or do I essentually become a 1250AC tank while in the zones, even though it reads higher?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That really depends on what youre doing, If the mob doubles for 3k a hit, and you have 5950 hp, that 100 hp will probably increase your chance of surviving more than 100 AC.  There's not going to be an absolute ratio to go by, you'll want to make sure you have a certain minimum of both, depending on what you're doing.    The Flawless Steel Mask is definitely the one to go with though.<br />
<br />
To Torrk:  There wasn't any change made to older expansion mobs and AC, any cap that was in velious is still there, but I think people have done tests more recently showing that you continue to get gains on mitigation from AC in velious well past 1300/1250/whaetever cap you've heard.   More AC will help you anywhere, it's just a question of how early the returns diminish to being not so useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While in theory your numbers are correct. Reality is different.<br />
<br />
100hp will reduce to absolute zero the chance to get 1 rounded IF full HP at the start of the round.<br />
<br />
100 ac will have a huge impact on mitigation, thus while it will not prevent one rounding.<br />
Will drastically reduce the chances of it happening.<br />
And above all, will reduce the chances of getting 2 or 3 bad rounds in sequence.<br />
<br />
Thats why you need both :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
diffrence in AC = 726<br />
diffrence in DPS taken = 35.42<br />
<br />
amout of ac per dps removed = 20.49<br />
<br />
this is only one parse, but in this one case 20ac = 20hp for 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
assuming a 1 minute parse, 20ac = 60hp (most combats are 1 min max for top end groups)<br />
<br />
for a raid named, say, xegony 20ac = 40*60=2400hp (40 minutes of tanking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cant reason in raw values for DPS because it is a variable, while AC is fixed.<br />
Or in HP per AC per Minute. (To evaluate survivability rates)<br />
<br />
The way i see it :<br />
1200 to 1900 ac = 20% DPS reduction on the test mob.<br />
700ac = 20% DPS reduction , assuming its a linear function ...<br />
100ac = 2.5% DPS reduction<br />
<br />
(That make WoG &amp; CoR a 2% DPS reducer which is huge)<br />
This is very very similar to the results posted by Solinar at the start of PoP in Sol Ro Tower.<br />
<br />
People think &quot;One Rounded&quot; but its the most flawed &amp; stupid concept ever.<br />
Its almost impossible for most raid boses to kill you with 4 max hits in a row.<br />
What gets you killed is a bad series of 8-12 swings, which is 3 or 4 rounds.<br />
(Thats assuming healers didnt do anything wrong)<br />
<br />
As for AC vs HP dilema here is what i haved used for a long time : &quot;Fake HP conversion&quot;<br />
Lets say you buff up to 2000ac 10000hp.<br />
And assuming the linearity of AC gains, 100ac = 2.5% DPS reduction.<br />
Going to 2100ac , is like gaining 2.5% x 10000 = 250hp.<br />
<br />
That essentially means, that every HP you have becomes more valuable as you increase AC.<br />
Because since you will get hit for less, you wont need as many hp to survive.<br />
<br />
Get a 0ac 50000hp warrior to tank Jihru 1.0 with 2 clerics.<br />
He will die, because he's going to be &quot;Over DPSed&quot;<br />
<br />
Get a 3000ac 8000hp warrior to tank Jihru 1.0 with 2 clerics.<br />
He will live, because he wont be &quot;Over DPSed&quot; any more.<br />
<br />
Of course these are extreme examples, but they are easy to understand.<br />
Essentially you need both. I'm an AC &amp; Shielding freak.<br />
<br />
Why ? <br />
Because if i take 1 less point of dmg, thats 1 less point of dmg that needs to be healed.<br />
And 1 less hp i will be missing at the start of the next round.<br />
Of course i need HP, because when i run out .. i'm dead</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To make it simpler.....<br />
<br />
You can only be healed for X hp / second.<br />
<br />
If at any moment, the DPS you take is higher than X, you will die.<br />
Because you WILL run out of HP sooner or later, even if you have 20K.<br />
<br />
Once you have reached a point where you take less than X DPS / second.<br />
You have 2 choices :<br />
- Full HP, to make sure you have a bigger HP pool when things go bad<br />
- Full AC, to reduce the DPS taken even more, so you are less dependant on heals.<br />
<br />
I chose AC,  Divine Intervention is here to cover up the &quot;Oh shit ran out of HP&quot; situations.<br />
And does a very good job.<br />
<br />
Ps : Otheuym start saving up for LDoN MM 510 points, 10 Ac augment.<br />
Wait for the 8th July patch, and put 10ac on every slot. The gain will be noticable.</div></div><hr />

I think you're taking me a little too literally, the given example was some abstract mystery mob that hits for 3k on an equally unknown target, and I was simply giving a counter example of where AC &gt; HP (with whatever conversion rate you might want to use) isn't always the case. <br />
<br />
People think &quot;One Rounded&quot; but its the most flawed &amp; stupid concept ever.<br />
Its almost impossible for most raid boses to kill you with 4 max hits in a row.<br />

(Thats assuming healers didnt do anything wrong)<br />
<br />
I didn't specifically mention one rounding, just take the example as a case of where you don't have enough hp to last you however long you're waiting for a heal, be it one round or five.  AC is great, I don't think many people seriously doubt it's usefulness, but for a great deal of mobs out there, you just won't tank them no matter how much AC you have if you don't have a certain amount of HP.  And sure, to an extent they go hand in hand, you have to try really hard to have enough HP to tank mob X while having unacceptable AC, or vice versa.  And you obviously won't be changing up your gear for every single battle you're facing, if you do you probably have a problem.   Basically all I was saying is check and make sure you're meeting whatever minimum you need for both, then go with whatever AC/HP ratio you want to.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the link Gryzx, I had figured it was just that no one had reached an AC in Velious significant enough to see a difference in parses, and no one had questioned the cap after later expansions came out, not that it was actually changed.  Either way, the (hard) cap isn't there now, although I hear it referred to a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1AC = 6 HP is more like displayed AC.  So when you considedr 1 AC on an item is more than 1 AC displayed, 1 AC on item is probably worth about 10 HPs.<br />
<br />
Of course, your mileage depends on how much HP you have total.  But, with all that said, sometimes it is just not possible to get eveything you need.  The limitation of loot plus luck may force you to get gear that aren't the best possible combination of ac and effects.</div></div><hr />

My guild has skipped VT, Ssra and all that shit.  So from my point of view, AC will come with great HP as we are moving into the EPs atm(pray for raex..).  Getting 10 ac more for 40 hp wont matter much imo.   If you got both masks, use the one with the best stats for the fight.  One got better resists pr/dr, other 5 to all +extra magic, charisma(if u use DI and cant max CHA).. In xp grps, i dont think it will matter much which one you use.<br />

No one ever listen to Slammer... : ) Just kidding, Slammer is a great tank. We are friends and were in the same guild for a while. Now he has moved on to a raiding guild and I am MA for our old guild.<br />
<br />
Anyway. Thanks for the thoughts and opinions. I am not as blessed as most of you are. I consider myself a high end tank, well as good as you can get not being in a raiding guild and no EP access. I have not won a piece of raid loot in like a year and a half (my CHSD). Everything I have was either bought or got with my normal group of friends (with one other exception of Slammer lending me his Helment of RZ. Thanks alot and still putting it to good use. One of these days I might actually get something better and give it back to you). Since I have no EP access or in a raiding guild I have to get what I can. I think I have most of the best gear I can get until I can get into EP. It seems like a 1AC to 6-10Hp ratio sounds like a good way to go to me with a minimum HP level probably being around 9000K HP I would think. I did not mention before full raid buffed I get like 9700+HP and 1500+HP so losing some HP to get some AC sounds like a good way to go. Thanks alot.</div></div><hr />

So to be a rough estimate 64 actual -&gt; 40 worn... a 1.6 ratio.  Granted, this was Loyalist Shield of Honor, which *may* be influenced by being a possible shield. I'd be interested to see what research says. So if you're going at 1AC = 6HP.... 1 worn AC or 1 actual? It makes a fairly large difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Yeah, but my point was find something that works for you, and stick with it. 1 ac = 6hp works for me, personally, so that's what I use. It's somewhat subjective on what works for you, naturally, but consistency is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

Only a very select few mobs will be 1rounding 10k tanks on the gimpy side of time, and those that can and do (Reparm anyone?) ... the extra 1k hps wont matter if your ac isnt up to snuff and they are hitting you for max dmg every other hit.<br />

If I was in a EP/Time flagged Raiding guild it would be easy to try to max out AC and HP will follow. But for me maxxing out AC with the choices I have can come at a serious cost of HP as well since I do not have access to that type of equipment. Alot of items that have high AC have low HPs or sometimes even none in below EP zones. I think there is a point where if you sacriface to much HPs for higher AC that you will hurt yourself. You do have to have enough HPs that procs and spells do not kill you before they melee you to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a tendancy for young guilds and pick up raids etc. to build a tank order based primarily off hp.Hp and ac work togeather and generally due to the type of available drops grow togeather as well.<br />
<br />
I don't assign a 1/6 ratio myself though I have subjective values in mind when i bid.I usually look at what i'm wearing in slots and what is likely to come available  to me for upgrades in the near future to decide on a path.Doesn't always work out hehe.I held my dkp all through vt hopining for atens face...didn't drop.Of course the visable slots are better upgraded in ep than vt.The thing is availability and long term planning is &gt; applying a standard ratio to all drops.Although I understand new tanks may need a measuring stick of sorts.I usually don't do much loot research(I still know little about time stuff),but, manage to pick up enough of an idea along the way.<br />
<br />
I kinda have a sentimental attachment to ac over hp,but, I ma for my guild.So I look for the best overall setup I can plan for with the drops I'll get.It was my experience in velious that ac was close enough among all our tanks that hp was easily the strongest determining stat factor in who tanked.With a raid of people at that level a tank needed over 7k hp to standup reasonably well to aow without getting splattered between heals.A little cushion went far too hehe.Moving on to Bertox we really needed 8k hp on two tanks to do it well.Generally,once a tank can stand up to a full round of max hits on a mob then ac becomes more important imo.This type of comparison is situational though and is reliant on many factors out of the tanks control.Hp is very important for a tank,just don't develop it at the expenese of a decent ac and defensive aa.What you equip has to turn into a good package not a stand alone piece.Usually,opportunity takes care of that though heh.Resists are kewl too to a certain point in the game and yeh i always have a bard.<br />

Shielding and avoidance around the corner omg! :)</div></div><hr />

I've been playing this character since Apr 11, 1999.  Since that time I have ALWAYS gone for AC.  I was over 1k ac pre-Kunark, I was high AC in Kunark, I went for AC over HP in Velious (although I did sacrifice a few points of AC for HP at a 10:1 item AC ratio because as you said, many items lacked HP), I was decent AC in Luclin although not at the top end at that point since I had to take alittle time off during that expansion, I still went AC over HP though.  In PoP I did AC over HP yet again, and still do it in GoD.  It's never once proven to be the wrong choice, and I've had a serious deficency in HP at times, my mitigation easily made up for it though.</div></div><hr />

However,Otheuym is a warrior.He may still have some interest in raid tanking and hp does play a big part then.Has anyone  that has had &quot;di&quot; fire while tanking a raid boss could tell you.Tipt mobs hit me pretty hard as im sure they do Otheuym.I think his hp is probably just enough if his aggro is strong though he could definately use more.He does need more ac for that GOD content imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have more than a interest in raid tanking. I am MA for my guild. Like I said we are not EP and are having attendence problems lately cause everyone seems to be taking a break from EQ. But I understand what you are saying and TOTALLY agree that AC is important but I still believe there has to be a balance. There has to be a point where you will give up AC for HP because if you drop to low then you loss tank ability. Like tanking mobs like Lord Mithaniel Marr with big 3500 DD procs that AC will not help you against. I know I need AC and I am working on it. I was mostly looking for the balance. How much HP for how much AC and vise versa. How much HP should you not drop below. If I was getting drops in EP where everthing seems to have 100+ Hps on it then I might not worry about the trade off as much and go for max Ac most of the time. But my options are lot more limited. I don't even have Vex Thal as almost no one in my guild if any of them have access to Vex Thal or even the Emperor of SSRA (I don't either but I am getting close). So like I said my options are limited. And considering I have not gotten a raid drop in over a year and a half now I think I have done quite well. My normal group can handle things alot of people can't who have the same access as us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye,that was my point.As a raidtanking warrior you need hp.As I stated required hp are determined by your targets.People use 1/6 has a ratio.If you will only be satisfied by a numerical factor use that then.It doesn't sound bad at our level of the game to me.Would you be better served by swapping out hp for ac pieces like the luclin back shield quest....probably.However,I doubt that such changes would factor largely in god.I wouldn't bother myself and instead look forward to solid upgrades that will improve your overall performance.&quot;Balance&quot; is important and I would keep that thought uppermost.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about individual upgrade pieces,you can search for those tho they may be tuff to get without raiding.Although ,Vxed has been droppin lots of upgrades for us recently.I'm wearing an earring off a named pooka close to zi off the right side in a lil cubby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In many situations, there is no AC vs. hps tradeoff: an upgrade will upgrade both stats.<br />
However, I tend to be more active looking for AC than hitpoints. Most non-tanking classes in the game have an exaggerated view of the role of hitpoints (that is, hitpoint total on a tank is by far the most frequently thought-about measure of a tank, often necessarily at the expense of properly weighting AC and AAs). But I've noticed that some very very bad things can happen if your AC is simply too low to mitigate a mob's attack. Basically, lots of the people you play with will think you need more hitpoints--and that's great, because you do need more hitpoints and you need help to get them. But the AC you have to advocate for yourself (or, you do more often).<br />
In terms of upgrading efficiently, it's a big help to know what potential upgrades are out there, the relative difficulty of getting them, and the relative strength/weakness of the specific pieces of armor you're wearing.</div></div><hr />

Go evasive on him and have a bard in your grp, twisting AC song and others.</div></div><hr />

I have tanked him both ways, with Defense and Evasive. Either way its up to your healers, And when he dies  the fun part comes in watching some of the hungry people not wait to get to the PP tell told to heh,Mass death to the kitty cats are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those of you who say Evasive on stuff with procs need a reality check.  For the record I use Evasive on almost everything because its effect isn't reduced by AC, whereas Defensive is.  But if you plan on surviving a proc by avoiding the hit, chances are you're already dead.  You're counting your survival on being able to evade about 20% more often on an event that happens about 10% of the time.  So what do you do when disc runs out, roll over and die because now you can't avoid the procs 20% more often?<br />
<br />
Bulwark of Alendar is a lot more reliable to deal with procs, and later on Spellshield mods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When Reparm hits you and double procs, you die. Even if you're defensive, the chance of survival is nil. Evasive decreases the number of procs landed per round, which is why it's considered more useful. On mobs with high damage procs and crazy melee damage, you are always relying on randomness to save you, unless you can survive a proc each hit with max melee damage defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Screw LMM and his proc .... use defensive heh <br />
<br />
GoD + Bard + Psalm of Veeshan + Singing mod + Singing mastery 3 + Amplification = 500MR on anybody.... Yeah you should carry one of those around in your backpocket on any mob with procs/ae's ... it helps a metric fuckton unless its practically impossible to resist.<br />
<br />
I tanked LMM not too long ago ... had a bard in my group and i chose defensive.  I was happy as i resisted every single proc LMM threw at me.<br />
<br />
The same holds true on Caprin cycle mobs ... in most cases the real answer to procs is a good bard at your side ... if nothing else you will at least partially resist a proc ... which is better than relying on an increased avoidance to live.<br />
<br />
DPS doesnt kill tanks.  Dmg spikes kill tanks.  Evasive is nice, but it leaves waaaay too much room for error on the &quot;spike&quot; issues.  Defensive imo almost always comes out on top ... at very worst you'll take 55% of the max possible melee dmg + any proc dmg.  Spellshield + Bard will help to curb that dmg more so than evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You realize that Reparm also hits for 3K.  I've plenty of deaths to Reparm that was like 2 3K hits, 2 3K procs.  If the hit was not evaded by evasive, that accounts for an additional 1500 damage taken under evasive compare to evasive (def would've mitigated it to roughly 1500).  If you assume you have about 10K HP as an EP tank given today's augs/AA/etc, then 2 procs is 6000 damage.  An Alendar would've shaved 1200, reducing the damage to 4800.  So less than half of the damage you take that led to your death was from procs.  Why not use defensive on the other 5200 damage as defensive always works (you wlll never fail to get the defensive bonus), as opposed to relying on evasive which is random?<br />
<br />
I use evasive almost always because I don't plan on dying.  If you think you're going to die, you should use defensive, because there is no randomness to it at all.  Evasive is only better if you're so sure of your survival that you do not fear the randomness aspect of evasive getting you killed, since evasive tends to be better overall mitigation versus defensive, but certainly less reliable for guaranteed mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tank all ep mobs including Reparm with defensive and have a very good survival rate.Mind you  tanking reparm is always factored by luck for me and I usually stay up after defensive drops due to good healing anyways.What I like  to avoid is surprising the chain and spot healers.People settle into a rythm and sometimes fail to react quickly enough to change.I always call defensive dropping right before it does and ask for tightened heals even if things seem smooth.I used to use evasive on dragons in tov and pop when they seemed to kill the ma quickly with added procs often as sort of a hail mary.For us smooth healing is more important than less healing generally.Once people settle in and we've got the mob positioned things generally go well.Of course my tankage is very differant from Phantron's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm the exast oposite of Phantron. Defensive Maniac.<br />
<br />
I refuse to use Evasive, havent used it for ages (exept on some bad XP pulls).<br />
<br />
Why ? My worse fear is dying.<br />
Statistically speaking, Defensive reduces by far the probability of death.<br />
While Evasive should lead to Improved Tanking efficiency under most conditions.<br />
<br />
I build my caracter around &quot;Mitigation&quot; maxing shielding &amp; AC.<br />
For me &quot;Not Going Down&quot; is a lot more important than &quot;Needing less healing&quot;<br />
<br />
I can  always find 200 300 more HP/sec healing (2 chanters runing if needed).<br />
But i cant replace myself if i am dead. At least its gonna be a lot worse.<br />
<br />
While the 2 are a paradox its understandable.<br />
With evasive the tank will still be (very rare) spike sensible (thats DI check).<br />
With defensive the tank sould be spike immune (no DI check) but require more healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">u will need ur evasive when you are in Txeuv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the tradeoff is quite simple really.  With evasive you still can get hit 4 or even 8 times in a row with a non-negligible probability, and those you get hit for whatever you get hit for.  With defensive you will be hit that many times in a row more often but each hit will be reduced by the 50% DI calculation.  Anything more than 8 straight hits (assuming no flurry) should be considered a serious problem with healing and issue of healing can overcome any amount of mitigation anyway.  <br />
<br />
If you're not worried about dying to spikes Evasive appears to be better (at least based on old parses), but taking less DPS overall doesn't help much if you die earlier than the guy taking more DPS since healing mana is usually not a significant issue.  To be fair, most mobs you don't get to refresh either discs so you might as well go with Defensive always... but I like to have my disc up quicker just in case it's needed for something.<br />
<br />
And Anueks that hit for 1000-1050 in Txevu are obviously meant to punish defensive.  It's no different than the old Kyv named that miss 1% while you're using Evasive.  For the Anueks you might as well put a monk to tank them since the best you can ever mitigate is a saving of ~200 HP per round.</div></div><hr />
