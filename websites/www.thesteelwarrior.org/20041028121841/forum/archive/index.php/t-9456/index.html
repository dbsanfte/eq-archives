That's at the most 300pp. Save your money till you're 45-51(ish) when you have a wider selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LotharoftheHillPeopl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">crusty/steel really knocks me down stat wise.  On Luclin I can get a Bracelet of Strength and a Bracelet of Fortitude for about 6k for the pair.  I get AC, almost the same stats, and some resists.  Do you guys have any idea if the change in AC and resists would be enough to spend 6k for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LotharoftheHillPeopl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just had a brilliant idea! Thanks to Magelo Sarl.  I can check these things almost as accurately as if i was playing the game!  I will reply shortly with my findings.<br />
Woohooo!<br />
An increase of 22 AC and +12 VsAll with the bracers for 6k.   I lose 1 str and 1 sta but it is expendable.  My AC will increase from 731 to 753.  I know this is generally high for my level so is this 4% increase worth the money?</div></div><hr />
