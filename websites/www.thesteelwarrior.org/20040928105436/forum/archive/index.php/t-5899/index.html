<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is going to be somewhat long, there is no short way to say this. This has been the result of a signifcant amount of contemplation. Any who would reject the below or choose to flame are advised to read the work in its entirety first. If you think after reading the below and you think, &quot;These changes would result in my class, group, etc. being impacted unfairly&quot; then feel free to say so and explain why you believe that. If you would reply, &quot;what you are *really* trying to do is...&quot; simply remain quiet. I intend to do exactly what I sate.<br />
<br />
My goal is thus:<br />
<br />
To make changes to the game, classes, abilities that results in an overall better game with each class being more evenly desired than they are currently. This does not mean that certain classes, groups or approaches are all 100% equal. As content and the remainder of group/raid composition vary this is impossible without reducing EQ to a 'Gauntlet-style' simplicty.<br />
<br />
As even pure content changes to the game are now considered 'nerfs' if said changes make a class or classes less powerful/desirable there will no doubt be those who consider the following 'nerfs'.<br />
<br />
Many of these people may be my fellow Paladins.<br />
<br />
******************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
TANK changes (Knights are used to indicate BOTH Pal and Sk, War will be used to indicate warrior-specific changes, where the term 'Tank' is used it indicates all three of those classes).<br />
<br />
PREMISE:<br />
A. All tanks have the same primary purpose. That is to be the recipient of a mobs attention and attacks.<br />
B. Because this role is EXCLUSIONARY (one tank prevents another tank from recieving said attacks in an absolute fashion) its balancing is more complex and needs the greatest care.<br />
C. 'Inherent' tanking shall indicate passive and ever-present game concepts such as HP, d/p/r, DI factor, offense skill cap, defense skill cap, damage tables, da/dw caps/rates, etc. and all AAs that modify same in a passive manner in a direct manner or provide a benefit of equal kind (e.g. Flurry increases the amount of melee attacks War obtain and is considered, HA/HG affect the healing rate of Pal, etc.)<br />
D. I am intimately familiar with Pal and War. I am not as familiar with SKs in practice with the same breadth and depth. Therefore my proposals for their class are more conjectural and subject to a greater error in misunderstanding the practical nuances involved with SKs.<br />
E. Although it is possible that fundamental mob/encounter changes could take place that would alleviate the need for most or all of the below one must accept the facts of history. For years 'tank stacking' has been asked for. It hasn't happened and is unlikely to do so on a broad scale since each method used to date would result in unwanted consequences that meet or even exceed the benefits of doing so. Hence class changes are advised.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CHANGES:<br />
<br />
1. The Stalwart Endurance (imparts a large degree of stun resistance) and Tactical Mastery (provide a noticable amount of innate strikethrough) AAs are currently War AAs. They are, however, fundamentally speaking TANK AAs and give important benefits to those classes when they exercise their primary role. Thus Knights should be given these AAs at the current War cost and effectiveness.<br />
<br />
2. ALL Hybrids would be affected by this next change. Changes would be made such that hybrid melee is unaffected by the casting of DETRIMENTAL spells (casting said spells would not pause the execution of a melee attack). This allows their offensive spells to scale appropriately with their melee. What occurs now is that while 'pure' melee/nukers DPS scales linarly with their acquisition 'hybrids' face a sometimes minimal gain due to the melee lost during spell casting, interruptions, fizzles, and resists. This results in an undesirable 'step' scenario where a new offensive spell is of great importance early, then of minimal use later. This is due to the problem of having to choose a 'middle point' for the balancing. This makes the balance linear and fairer to all classes in an overall context. This may require current rebalancing of spells, resuling in a decrease in effectiveness for hybrids from their 'chain-cast' levels in exchange for sustainably constant effectiveness in the arena of melee AND cast.<br />
<br />
3. All BENEFICIAL single target spells cast by hybrids shall default to SELF when either there is no target or an NPC targeted. Beneficial spells would continue to pause the execution of a PC melee attack as it does now. The current tab re-targeting encourages 'twitch-play' and fast client/server sync more than any skill on the part of the player.<br />
<br />
4. Paladin stuns would be changed to being no longer than 4.0s in duration (e.g DWoS down from 10s currently to 4s). Most group mobs should be stunnable. Exceptions, even frequent ones can, and SHOULD take place however. For example, encouters that are intended to be tank, healing, debuffing, or dps challenging (etc.) should certainly not be stunnable such that they are preferentially 'stun-locked'. However entire zones or areas should not be stun immune in a blanket attempt to 'make them hard'. These changes make 'stun' mitigation present, but limited in magnitude and scope.<br />
<br />
5. All tanks use the now 'warrior' mitigation table. Gear, player skill, and visible differences in skill caps, AAs, DI mods, etc. distinguish tanks, not mysteriously hidden tables.<br />
<br />
6. ALL hp, ac, and hp/ac buffs that are cleric spells are REMOVED from paladins' spell books. This eliminates the balance problem of paladins carrying around their own 'free' hit points when competing against the other tanks, especially in clericless groups.<br />
<br />
7. Paladin 90% rez is REMOVED. A paladin provides a disproportional strength on the lower end in groups with druids instead of clerics for primary healing. One of these is the presence of a 'good rez'. Paladins retain an 'emergency CR' rez of a lower level (50% xp or less).<br />
<br />
8. Warriors innate DI modifier is changed to 0.9. (the default is 1.0, War current DI mod is 0.95). This means that a warrior through innate mitgation will take 10% less damage from the DI portion of a mobs attacks than a knight does on a per-hit basis. This is not 'subject to the RNG' but instead represents a very visible and consistent ability to absorb damage better.<br />
<br />
9. The Defensive discipline is changed to take ( into account. It is changed from 45% to 40% which will result in a defensive warrior retaining a net 0.5*DI, which is its current net value.<br />
<br />
10. Knights obtain the defensive discipline. This operate very similarly to those currently used by warriors and will reduce the DI by 40% as above. DI for knights then go from 1.0 (default) to 0.6 while using Defenisve. More clearly put a knight will take 20% more damage from the DI portion of a mobs attacks than a warrior for each hit. Knights additionally obtain the evasive discipline. This functions identically to the current warrior discipline, however it is lessened in effect so that the same net relative change in tanking ability is maintained (i.e. the higher DI of pal causes the same DI mod to result in a higher net defensive DI. Since the 'miss' portion of tank defense is the same, the evasive modifier would be lessened to maintain the desired relationship of a warrior taking less damage at all times when in a the same disc.<br />
<br />
11. Warriors obtain new endurance based skills to provide some of what is commonly called 'utility' as well as provide more self-survival. These skills will all be on the same 30s timer and provide the following skills: stun (4.0/65, would have the Divine Stun-level of very low hate), snare (mr check, 0 mod, 30s), and root (mr check, 0 mod, 30s). These skill would have a modest endurance cost but would be short range (30ft). Healing Will is altered to provide a better down-time healing rate. The reuse will be cut from 3 minutes to 1 minute. Endurance cost/upkeep may also be modified (I do not have date on end regen rates to give a more definative value here). The idea here is not to replace the desirability of the clases that provide stun, snare, root, or heals but to make a warrior (and his group) less burdened by the absolute absence of those abilities and provide some 'oh no!' coverage as mobs flee, gate, etc. This makes them the only tank who has all 3 of those abilities (pal lack snare, sk lack stun) but their application is limited.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is NOT changed:<br />
<br />
1. Knights do NOT receive AE taunt or any other Disc/AA/skill other than those listed above.<br />
2. Knights do NOT receive a 100% avoidance disc of any kind. Warriors remain the only tank with this ability.<br />
3. The current HP values are not altered. This includes Sturdiness remaining.<br />
4. Warriors are not nerfed in any way whatsoever.<br />
<br />
<br />
RELATED CHANGES:<br />
<br />
To further this 'priest/tank' balance Druids obtain a 90% rez. Clerics obtain a self-buff that amplifies both the damage and the mana costs on DD spells by approximately 20%. They are also given a smaller DD that is fast enough casting (but modest in damage, ~half of their normal DDs) to actually use. Druids still provide snare, regen, DS, better damage, and the rare charm/DC ability. Clerics still provide the largest CHs and the more robust overall healing but are not now the sole source of priest-rezzes but will have some added offensive ability that makes their addition in a 'non-healing-intensive' setting less overtly redundant than it is now. There are other proposals I have for classes, but I wanted to focus this post on the tank issue primarily. Thus I am only outlining the other class changes that I believe are important to mention as they are integral to the balance changes I propose above.<br />
<br />
<br />
RESULTS:<br />
<br />
1. The paladin no longer becomes &quot;the obvious choice&quot; for groups with a druid as the sole primary healing class due to the currently present buffs and rezzes. The desirability of BOTH SKs and Warriors for said groups is increased for such settings.<br />
2. The knights obtain a more linear relationship in survivability as a result of all tanks using the same 'table'.<br />
3. Knights are able to better use their abilities when tanking. The ability to 'stun trivialize' content is reduced.<br />
4. The warrior remains supreme in 'pure tanking' by way of inherently more hp, better avoidance, and now even more visible mitigation benefits.<br />
5. Warriors obtain modest skills such that they are not as beholden on others to the same degree that they are now for some emergency situations.<br />
6. Knights have 'tanking critical' defensive disciplines, but lack other skills such as AE taunt and an auto-avoid discipline thus limiting their power in that regard. A /disc warrior will remain &gt; a /disc knight. A non-/disced warrior will remain &gt; a non-/disced knight. However a /disced knight will tank greater than a non-/disced warrior. Furthermore relative gear becomes more important element in considering which tank is 'best' in a setting.<br />
<br />
Barring some tuning required for SK-specific alterations it is my contention that the above will serve to better balance tanks (and their resulting groups) not only NOW, but throughout the progression of the game's content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kether is entitled to his opinion.  I don't agree with him but what ever.<br />
<br />
Discord will lead to something here:<br />
<br />
- Either SKs and Paladins get beefed up to handle stock monsters<br />
- Or the monsters get ratched down<br />
<br />
SOE stupidly set players on this path.  Is anyone surprised?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">how does knights getting defensive help with &quot;stock monsters&quot;?<br />
<br />
if knights got a defensive aa then they would be make warriors less of a use on a raid.  with the snap aggro that they have they could do changes just as easy as warriors with aoe taunt. as the defensive starts to expire the next knight starts stun/snare and goes defensive, the mob then switches to the new tank.<br />
<br />
knights already have 100% avoidance disc its called DA/Harmshield.<br />
<br />
thats my biggest beef with what he has suggested there.<br />
<br />
knights getting the 5% mitigation and us getting a 10% mitigation i can see that one being plausable.<br />
<br />
knights self targeted only spells not needing the use of tab im ok with that.<br />
<br />
sturdiness and strikethrough sure give them that but give us 2hd bash and horse.<br />
<br />
thats more reasonable i think.<br />
<br />
paladins losing the cleric buffs and 90% rez, i think the paladins can handle the nay saying on that one by themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Crashbomba.  I feel kind of dirty reading that.  Some of the ideas sounded good but not all.  I dont want /disc def for one thing.  And #2 has to much of a chance of making things even more wonky.  W/ the exception of 2 spells in my normal line up (DA and pet haste) the rest are detrinentional. Sure it would up my DPS being able to cast AND melee at will but it just wont work out right IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh come on, the aggro difference it very manageable now, and there is NO substitue for AE taunt for tank switches. Not to mention the ability to go furious to defensive, which basically makes tank switching utterly trivial.<br />
<br />
knights already have 100% avoidance disc its called DA/Harmshield.<br />
You do realize that DA/Harmshield immediately drop you to the bottom of the aggro list while acitve? Very useful for tanking, eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And jumps you right back to the top w/ low health aggro the second it fades.  Tested this once AEing ssra mines.  DAed at 10% hps, backed out of combat/melee range and the split second it dropped I was summoned and smooshed. :eek: <br />
<br />
Frodlin do you mean something along the lines of Weaponsheild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well this is what happens when abilities are basically hard coded into the game.<br />
<br />
it dont matter what one class has, other classes want it.<br />
<br />
if they allowed you to pick which ones you could get, it could help to minimize the bitching. classes will never be equal in a one on one situation.<br />
<br />
in a group situation i personally feel that they are more closely interchangable then ever.<br />
<br />
in a raid situation warriors are still the best choice for tanking the boss mobs. sk/paly can do it though after much more gear and healing then the warriors though.<br />
<br />
is that balanced? <br />
<br />
its when one class wants to or actually does dominate the situation that things are out of whack.<br />
<br />
clerics were the perfered choice for healing before they added the mini heals that shaman/druids had. did it make the game more unbalanced for 90% of the time that you play the game?<br />
<br />
if all you do is log in for raids then log off when they are done then there is alot more balancing to be done. most players dont do that and they see the game more as a group vs the enviroment.  its balanced more then it has been.<br />
<br />
i think whats really happened is that classes feel that if they start to raise enough of a stink on an issue SOE will throw them a bone of some sort to please them.  <br />
<br />
hell give warriors a choice of becoming a sk/paly and eliminate the class entirely and there would still be bitching that the other knight class is better. i picked a warrior to have fun in the game and with the new disciplines it is more fun to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Puff, Puff, Pass sir.<br />
<br />
Damn. thats all I can say, Im trully astounded by this guy<br />
<br />
He wants every warrior only AA we have left. And then wants defensive too. <br />
<br />
Damn. Looks like the KEI abuse finally scrambled someones brain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Give Knight a Weaponshield type of disc that eats up all their mana.  That'll be fine.  Actually call it Knight's Tenancity, 18 seconds of no melee damage taken, leaves a 5 minute -1000 mana/tick debuff uncurable on you with 1 hour refresh time.  As bad as it sounds it's probably still more useful than Warlord's Tenancity (and BTW, I don't think Warlord's Tenancity is that bad).<br />
<br />
Otherwise, no.<br />
<br />
On the subject of DA, DA is pointless for tanking.  No mob wil beat on you unless you're the only person on its aggro list.  It might be good for survival but sure isn't useful for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">puff puff pass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">how does gimping out our last standing unique AAs balance shit?? someone has LSD in this pot cause they see things that arnt there. thes mother fuckers want to force us into utility <br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors obtain new endurance based skills to provide some of what is commonly called 'utility' as well as provide more self-survival. These skills will all be on the same 30s timer and provide the following skills: stun (4.0/65, would have the Divine Stun-level of very low hate), snare (mr check, 0 mod, 30s), and root (mr check, 0 mod, 30s).&quot;<br />
<br />
fug you, i choose to tank<br />
&quot;<br />
1. Knights do NOT receive AE taunt or any other Disc/AA/skill other than those listed above.&quot; pffftt like you left any out you dick<br />
<br />
&quot;2. Knights do NOT receive a 100% avoidance disc of any kind. Warriors remain the only tank with this ability.&quot;<br />
<br />
hmm whats this? its an &quot;oh shit&quot; card you dumbfuck, and we can still be rooted or stunned and butt fucked after it runs out<br />
<br />
&quot;8. Warriors innate DI modifier is changed to 0.9. (the default is 1.0, War current DI mod is 0.95). This means that a warrior through innate mitgation will take 10% less damage from the DI portion of a mobs attacks than a knight does on a per-hit basis. This is not 'subject to the RNG' but instead represents a very visible and consistent ability to absorb damage better.<br />
<br />
9. The Defensive discipline is changed to take ( into account. It is changed from 45% to 40% which will result in a defensive warrior retaining a net 0.5*DI, which is its current net value.&quot;<br />
<br />
yet he says put everyone on a warrior metitgation table, that means that only a fully AA'd warrior would stay a visible amount ahead of you, and the magic tables he talks of do a hell of alot more than 30 more ac does.<br />
<br />
so lets see, warriors are useful when fully AA'd. paladins are useful to start with.... so basicaly no one will group with the up and coming warriors and they wait for the rest of us to quite EQ.... what a dick, i see thru it.<br />
<br />
things are closer to balances than ever as far as melee classes go, its more of a grab bag than ever<br />
<br />
bah, one more thing, just BAH! And Bah some more!</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: (#&amp;%(#)%&amp;#) i couldnt go to bed with out biting on the bait they put out again<br />
<br />
this shit wants to balance us with utility we dont really need or not, and he wants to screw with a system because 1 warrior out of the 4 on a raid is useful, and he easly forgets that we are PRIMARY TANKS and he is a SECONDARY tank because he chose to be a god danged paladin, how much more does the character creation screen need to say we are walking bad asses before they get it?<br />
<br />
he also takes alot of liberty by saying all tanks at 1k+~ ahead of them(maybe with aa's, should we charge you 200 AAs to cast thru your melee?)<br />
<br />
personally 6 types of people i know play paladins<br />
<br />
1. someone who just wanted to do something unique at the time(pre PoP, pre KEI nerf)<br />
2. someone who wants to be a gallant lady's man<br />
3. spoiled little shit that said, fight and heal? i can be god! i am like the snake eating its tail, i go on forever!<br />
4. person who just wanted to have fun, or be the guy with the shiny platemail and be called sir on FV<br />
<br />
and the 5th?<br />
the welcome unknown factor that makes this game so much fun, and so many of you fit into<br />
<br />
6th? well i hate these people the most, these are the flys and magots that move from one overpowered class to another, riding out the wave of power, and then bitch when it crashes on the beech and they have to move their bloated selves to another class because they have no grasp of &quot;sticking it out&quot;<br />
<br />
(not to hate on any classes but in most recent memory the magots where on necro's, then they where on bards, then they where on mage/wizzys and then beastlords&lt;until pet CH exploit was finally fixed&gt; and then paladins, and now a fair amount have started warriors/zerkers tho there isnt alot of blood for them to suck on this side of the fence)<br />
<br />
i just really hate the festering gonads of evil that are the &quot;l337&quot; gammers, not to be confused with skilled, or elite.<br />
<br />
i need to get an account for that board</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zaboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't understand where all this warrior envy is coming from.<br />
<br />
Knights are still the preferred tank for 99% of all known group content.  They are also the preferred tank for any raid named that slows, is rooted, or has unmanageable aggro.<br />
<br />
Warriors shine on remaining raid named.  That's it.</div></div><hr />

Might not be to bad if you reduce the mana of knights by 50% and make KEI not usefull to them the same way it is for us. Then put whatever defensive skills your trying to obtain take mana vs. taking endurance. Sure that's balance. <br />
<br />
Passes it along</div></div><hr />

I can tank some of the monsters in Discord but so many of them count on luck.  At any moment, the RNG can be unfavorable and it will kill me.  There is no skill in having me stand there and cringe.  I hate that aspect of tanking...I'm not sure why some of you thrive off of it.<br />
<br />
In any event something should change about these six player runs.  All I want is a reasonable shot at success.  Make me work for it instead of using an off ball tactic that avoids all the skills I bring to the group.  Right now all I have is suicidal russian roulette style gambles.</div></div><hr />

Ok you can have these if we get the uber fast horse and the 2 handed bash.<br />
<br />
You can have defensive but:<br />

- 30 secs dur<br />
- burns half your mana<br />
- recharge every 40 mins<br />
- paladins promise to shut the h*ll up and NEVER bring it up again<br />

I can tank some of the monsters in Discord but so many of them count on luck.  At any moment, the RNG can be unfavorable and it will kill me.  There is no skill in having me stand there and cringe.  I hate that aspect of tanking...I'm not sure why some of you thrive off of it.  Because they're warriors...and unless you've been missing a huge part of the arguments against Knight tanking replacing Warrior tanking, you know it's what they do.  They wouldn't be a warrior if they didn't like to tank, to put their life in the questionable balance between the mobs and their group.  Especially now since the official &quot;offensive warrior&quot; has been added (Berserker).</div></div><hr />

I'll trade the knights a parry discipline for a 5 AA horse.  Then for all 3 classes, a 10 AA upgrade to a unicorn (paladin), nightmare (shadowknight), or war boar (warrior).<br />

Seriously, I'll agree with Aeka that must-complete for progression content involving a mob that can one round you really sucks and is the result of poor game design.  This isn't some raid mob where there are a line of tanks that can step in to take the hit.  One unlucky round and you have just wasted a shitload of time, plus your whole group has to deal with the hell that is GoD CRs.

You have to realize that the venting and frustration shown by these Paladins is brought on by a major change in game dynamics.<br />
<br />
As a person who has played a paladin since beta.....this is the first time I truly agree that the shift in playability has changed dramatically.<br />
<br />
Many good EQ players heard the warriors issues with tanking and assisted in bring this to light for the development team. But this latest expansion has really sucked the playability for paladins out of the equation.<br />
<br />
I don't know what the solution is or if the paladins can ever get to a unified level....but a problem exists...one that makes the game play at higher levels much less enjoyable for us. If you choose to blast paladins and shrug this off as just a bitching session....You may see further imbalance occur if SOE does change it again.<br />
<br />
I recommend you talk to or play a friends paladin and see what the difference is. And get involved in recommending a viable solution...or you may once again be faced with the feeling that warriors are less then useful except on the boss mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Welp, I'm about done arguing with them over there.<br />
<br />
I've learned three things:<br />
<br />
1. Most (not all) of those posting about the unfairness of the GoD trials have 4200-7000HP unbuffed. They believe they ought to be able to MT in a standard group mobs that hit for up to 2k HP. When ever has that happened?<br />
<br />
2. Those who opposed the Provoke and &quot;-1 DI&quot; change are pretty determined to see it undone. Their new watchword is &quot;Tank Parity&quot; which is fancy talk for &quot;We want to tank like Warriors (at least in groups to start with) and have a spellbook.&quot; Warriors should be very very leary of unneeded &quot;utility&quot; as some want it counted as if it were spells.<br />
<br />
3. IF any high level Paladins are having issues they are not being too vocal about it. Those I know seem to be getting flagged.<br />
<br />
Frodlin has implied that further along in Discord the rules change quite a bit and that concepts like add tanking get shaken up some. Good, things need a little shaking up.<br />
<br />
However, I'm not ready to become a hybrid unless I get a nice spellbook and a free soul-bound Dwarven War Pony and a landshark pet with laserbeams shooting out of it's eyes. Oh, and a throwing axe that comes back. And Beergoogles.<br />
<br />
I'm not against three Tank classes being able to succeed as group MT's even against most of the single groupable named mobs in an expansion. I'm not against Knights being able to MT any raid mob after Warriors have had a shot at it a half-dozen times or so. What I am opposed to is the mid-level players that are eager to either nerf warriors or dramatically improve their mitigation just because it would be cool to be Warriors with Spellbooks.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The trick is that you have reports from Time equipped Paladins have problems dealing with spawn monsters.  Forget the fact that some of these things have a big baddy at the end: using a Paladin or SK to tank is taking a gigantic risk.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend only use a Warrior to tank so where does that place the other classes?  SKs don't have any crippling debufs to use against these things.  Paladin new heals are depricated by the double whammy of increased damage.<br />
<br />
The entire expansion is like this.  I can't heal.  I can't tank.  Why am I even there?  Roots and Ressurect I guess.  The amusing thing I've gotten more requests for a Resurrection in the last 2 weeks than I even had in LDoN (and there I had more requests to resurrect than I ever did in POP).  Is it any surprised that when the queue to do stuff beyond Kod'taz form that I'm passed over?<br />
<br />
I don't see this as balanced at all.  Somehow in Warrior math: spellbook = tanking.  That is pretty far from the truth.  So please point out to me how my much vaunted spellbook can even compare to Warrior tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">In warrior math spellbook /= tanking.  In our math<br />
<br />
Warrior tanking + Warrior DPS = Paladin tanking + Paladin DPS + Paladin Spellbook.<br />
<br />
How hard of a concept is that to grasp?<br />
<br />
Paladin tanking &lt; Warrior tanking on unstunnable mobs<br />
Paladin tanking &gt; Warrior tanking on stunnable mobs<br />
<br />
Paladin aggro &gt; Warrior aggro (aggro is a facet of tanking, if you don't have it you aren't tanking :P )<br />
<br />
Paladin DPS &lt; Warrior DPS on live mobs<br />
Paladin DPS = Warrior DPS on undead mobs<br />
<br />
Paladin spellbook = Warriors tanking advantage on unstunnable mobs + Warrior DPS advantage on live mobs<br />

Now this is from a warrior's perspective that is working on mobs for flagging to Tower of Sol Ro.  I have no experience with PoT gear so save your breath if that is your reply.  I won't understand/believe it til I see it and experience it.<br />
<br />
One fight I love is Bertox from the fact that our Knights tank all but kings and Bert (CoD version).  They could tank most kings too but they are busy tanking everything else and realistically a couple of them would be rough without evasive.  But, after we started using Knights to tank the mobs we started haveing much fewer deaths (suprise suprise) because of the aggro advantage of a knight.  Now it seems just our pullers and warriors die for the most part :)  Oh, and druids or shamans heal them so you can't really say that they require extensive healing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Paladin DPS is paultry.  Only a Bard does worse with just melee and they can more than make up for it with by generating great effects.  Restricting Slay in POP makes a lot of sense.  If you actually look at the DPS it really isn't all that impressive.  You can AE Bert and his crones much faster than you can set Paladins against them.<br />
<br />
What worth is agro if you can't tank?   A bad turn of the RNG and you have one dead Paladin.  Warrior will find this difficult for sure but it is next to impossible to prop up even well equipped Paladins in some of these areas.  What is the worth of agro?  Hell...at this point I don't want agro.<br />
<br />
Bert from lower tier POP is very much different than Discord Kod'taz and beyond.  There are some very challenging one group runs that make Warriors sweat.  I can see why you guys might think it is fun and challenging.  However it is just impossible to accomplish a Paladin or a SK.  This leaves limited options which means you avoid using a Paladin for anything but crappy secondary abilities.  Crappy secondary abilities in a six player group no less.  That is not balanced at all.</div></div><hr />

Simply put for groups of six use a Warrior.  Its not worth the time or energy to work with a Paladin to get through these things.  If anyone who believes that Warriors are the only tank option then you got your wish because this stuff is pretty pervasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">It is worthwhile to have a Paladin as backup rezzer just so that if your cleric screw it up, you have someone else to rez instead of having your cleric run back through the deathtrap known as Kod'taz.  Also the 300 HPs from Brells is significant.  Even with a warrior tanking it is not unusual to see Warriors die and that extra 300 HPs makes a big difference, unless you've a buff team camped outside the temple entrances.<br />
<br />
Paladin DPS is modest.  Not anything to write home about but it is probably 90% of a warrior, which is still significant.  You know on these trials warriors use Stonewall over Defensive because that extra bit of damage you get from Stonewall over Defensive could be the difference you need to win?  You have DA, which is invaluable for trial 2.  You can also tank trial 3 effortlessly compare to a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Now if your group can't figure that out, that's their problem.  I'm under the impression Warriors have been passed up by Knights because people are too stupid to work with a Warrior.  So welcome to our world.  I don't deny Paladin certainly isn't a top choice for the 2 'other' slots in an Ikkinz trial (rogue/wizard definitely dominates the 'other' slots), but the same can be said for other classes too so you're hardly alone.  <br />
<br />
I'm of the opinion that if the trials are needed for progression (i.e. everyone has to do them), you should be able to bring an Artifact of Whatever (heck, make it require all 3) from the Ikkinz raids and then you get an 'easy' version of the trials (no loot of course) that only grants progression (doesn't grant the ability to access raids).  Knights shouldn't be able to tank the version that opens up the raids though, because they are essentially 1 group raids without getting geared up in Ikkinz.</div></div><hr />

What about the idiotic 'tricks' we have to pull to get agro off a caster in a regular xp group when all of it can be avoided if they use a paladin...? No wait, we don't get much do we?. <br />
<br />
Maybe not a good example...but... Well, my point is, if you have to do stupid tricks in order to pull off a hard event, which by all accounts, IS a hard event whether you use a warrior or a knight, then I personally do not see a problem with it. Expecting to pull off a difficult encounter as if it was a LDoN normal adventure sounds... I don't know, Asking for way too much. If it as hard as people say it is, then heck, using 'idiotic' tricks to get through them is just fine by me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway hard encounters are a good thing, it promotes people playing smarter, and in a sense this hurts Knights because when you don't have completely foolish behaviors, their aggro lock isn't nearly as powerful.  Add to the fact a lot of Paladins seem to think stun is merely an aggro-getting tool when you're dealing with mobs that come in hasted at 1000+ DPS, Warriors have a pretty good edge in the Ikkinz trials.<br />
<br />
I have no compliants about Ikkinz trials as long as not everyone have to do them.  It is nice for once to see people actually listen to you when you tell them stuff like don't do this or you die, and they can't just say well let's get a Knight instead.  It makes people better players... at least superficially.</div></div><hr />

I really want to ask the people who designed these things what players were supposed to do to succeed at these things.  I bet it isn't at all what many players use to beat them.  Is it hard to run these trials?  No.  But since now more than ever EQ is anti-melee, exactly what in the world was SOE thinking in there design?  Drive everyone away from melee range on these things?<br />
<br />
So you have Paladins brought along on tough trials who are supposed to play smart by loading stuns and roots.  That sounds like the perfect application of a 10K HP Paladin right?

I would hazard a guess that most of us were told to stfu about GoD so we don't pass on info to other guilds. Just a guess =).<br />
<br />
I posted this on the PoN, I'm gonna mention it here. The way to fix the Paladin in GoD isn't to nerf the content, or to give us defensive or some stupid idea like that. The way to fix us is to give us _a level-appropriate stun_ that will stick on mobs up to level 70. They can fiddle with the cast time and mana requirements to balance it properly.<br />
<br />
We've already got an Ancient spell that could foot the bill, as it's not useful to us as it is (it's almost a clone of Force of Akilae). That's the way Paladins mitigate damage, always has been. How much depends on how they balance the spell against the content. If it costs more mana, we're not gonna use it in xp groups. A situationally appropriate spell, and it doesn't require messing with other classes' turf.</div></div><hr />

Another week went by in Discord. People learned some stuff. People got flagged and others didn't.<br />
<br />
Can you honestly say looking at what has been posted by Paladins on PoN and taking into account their Magelos that some of the things stated haven't been pretty overblown?<br />
<br />
Are statements like Paladins have lost their group role in LDoN, calls for &quot;Tank Parity&quot; in all roles throughout the game, remove Defensive, give Paladins Defensive, Paladins can't get flagged, etc. somewhat over-reactions to harder content?<br />
<br />
Or, as I suspect, do a few posters desire &quot;Tank Parity&quot; in all roles throughout the game so much that they intentially exagerate and try to drum up support from casual and lower-tier Paladins in an effort to &quot;get back&quot; at Warriors for the Phase 1 Melee Changes and hopefully restore Paladins to the status of Warriors with Spellbooks for all but raid bosses?<br />
<br />
I think most here are going to be sympathetic if GoD mobs need to be tuned to make Paladins effective. But I also think that the actions of a few PoN posters pulling the nerf bat out and pointing it at Warriors was reprehensible.<br />

Stuns could have worked...the problem is once you get into Kod'taz too many things are unstunable except Divine Stun and that stun duration is one of the shortest avilable.  Even with the channel AA (which as far as I can tell is worthless), it does not stop a monster from doing 10k in the next 9 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I want darkness, fear, pets, HT, rez dead, and all the &quot;worthless&quot; spells Knights have because...they are &quot;worthless&quot; according to Knights, so what does it matter if Warriors have them. We all know the spell book only becomes &quot;worthless&quot; when a Knight wants to become Warriors+spellbook.<br />
<br />
On a side note, if GoD loot=PoT loot, then my Shaman and Cleric will be far better equiped than my Warrior. I can get a group with them when it is slow. So its fair that a completly unflagged Shaman or Cleric can get that quality loot, but a Warrior who has at least some flags (magelo not fully updated) can't get any loot?</div></div><hr />

You can use a Knight to tank trial 3.  In fact you probably should use one, just have a Warrior tank the Kyv Sightsliverer at zone in and then a Knight can do the rest easier than a Warrior (maybe not trash clearing, but who cares about trash).  <br />
<br />
I'd wager a Knight can offtank the 2nd Malevolent Priest better than a Warrior if they know what they're doing.  Anyway we did it with a Bard with 1 cleric/shaman so certainly a Knight can tank that by playing smart.</div></div><hr />

Okay, drop any reference to SK, LOL. I apoligize, because I have had little if any problems with SKs. Most have gladly passed aggro on to me and even aided it with spells.</div></div><hr />

I do agree w/ most of what you guys say here, just really irrates me when people group the 2 classes together.  A SK is rather well equipped to tank SOME mobs for a bit then pass agro off to the nearest warrior.  Back in our NToV days one of our wars and I would work OTs like this.  I would grab it and when he was rdy I would FD passing all the aggro to him.  It takes a little coridination but once you got it worked out it's fantastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I'd be kinda interested to see the Paladin spoiler for doing one of the harder trials. I believe I've seen references to Monks being able to slow down the damage rate. It seems likely that group composition is a major factor.<br />
<br />
Putting a HoT, Vie, and/or Rune on the Paladin and using DArb to take advantage of the group HP pool at the start of the fight might help. I think a SeWs or Hopebringer with WA5 would be useful, etc. It's only about 30 seconds - a lot can be done in 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
I ask this because I don't know too many time-geared Paladins that haven't gotten through Vexd and Tipt. It seems very strange to read assertions on the one hand that it can't be done and on the other know that it is being done.<br />
<br />
I feel like there is some significant information missing (besides the fact many of the trials don't need to be done). I'd much rather see changes to the named mob dificulty than Paladin mitigation  since it's pretty clear I at least don't know the whole story.<br />

This thread has me sounding like Haas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I don't think most warriors get the fact that if I take 1000 DPS and a Paladin takes 2000 DPS, and my chance of dying before named dies is 25%, the chance of Paladin dying is most certainly not 50%.  In fact I'm sure in that case the chance of Paladin dying is 100%.  <br />
<br />
It looks like Knights take 30% more DPS than Warriors do from the numbers people quoted.  However the chance of a Knight dying is considerably higher than 30% more than a Warrior.  There's also factors to consider like Furious.  One thread quoted Furious brought down a Pixtt 20%, which means a Warrior only needs to tank 80% of the time compare to a Paladin, and certainly even with a SK no way a HT will bring a Pixtt down 20%.  Tanking longer = higher chance to die.  It is also not clear to me that one of the traditional advantage of Knights, which is being able to tank without attacking, is actually an advantage here because not attacking = longer fights = more chance to die.  In a 6 man group where at least 2 are healers, every bit of DPS counts.  Without using a shield Knights do not have AC advantage (AoC AC advantage is canceled by Raex BP), and certainly even as bad as mudinflation goes, Warriors still beat Knights in HPs given comparable gear.  When you add all these little things together, I estimate the chance of a Knight dying is probably twice that of a warrior.  You can reduce this to tolerable limits with enough healing, but then if you have that much healing why not bring a Warrior for the sure win?  One group I knew did it with Pal/Sham/Druid/Cl/War/Bard and in that group the Paladin probably could've tanked too, but what advantage will it get you?  You already need more healing for having a Knight, so this makes aggro less important because there just isn't as many people doing damage that you need the aggro for (especially if your DPS is not a caster).  Take the group described above, aggro would be completely meaningless since no one in that group ought to get aggro unless it's the warrior, and if a Paladin can't hold the aggro from a Warrior, then that means the Warrior should've tanked instead!<br />
<br />
Anyway there's really no trick to beating a mob that's just pure DPS.  You either try to kill it as fast as possible, in that case the party would be something like cleric X 2, bard (DS helps a ton), Knight, rogue X 2 (or maybe Wizard X2).  Or instead you've 2 monks with WA5 and SoT.  You can expect 3 stuns/minute which figures out 15% damage mitigated per monk.  Now obviously the stuns could overlap and so on but this gives you the best chance to mitigate DPS down to more manageable levels, and monks aren't bad DPS either.  Of course you can always throw in more healers in the last 2 slots if you're really paranoid.<br />
<br />
Arbitrate, DI, Vie will all help.  I really doubt you'd have the time to do another Vie in mid battle though.  It mitigates 1800 damage but why waste a cleric's time to mitigate 1800 damage when you can heal another 4k with Light instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Phantron,<br />
<br />
If you want to win against a hard-hitting named mob, you construct your group accordingly:<br />
Cleric - Prime Healer<br />
Warrior - Main Tank<br />
<br />
You want to try a hard-hitting named mob with:<br />
Shaman - healer/DoT/pet/debuff/slow<br />
Paladin - tank/buffer/spot healer/CC<br />
<br />
Okie dokie, go ahead. But realize there are mobs where the mathematics of winning are not in your favor.<br />
<br />
The problem is that Paladins can not get flagged (if the trials are actually needed to be flagged - not all are) as readily as Warriors in these trials. Not that Paladins can not do as well against named hard-hitting mobs as a Warrior. The first is regretable and should be changed. The second is an EQ fact that has been in place since Kunark and woven into what Warriors are - the preferred MT's vs. hard-hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
This should not be a marginal advantage any more than a Paladin's ability to heal is marginally better than a Warrior's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">If everyone needs to do trials to progress, then it does not make sense Warrior is the only person who can tank them, unless you expect that 1/6th of the people in a guild are Warriors, which is obviously absurd.  It's fine that Warriors outperform Knights by a significant margin in such groups... as long as you don' t have to do trials for everyone.  <br />
<br />
What there really should be is an easier version of the trial once you bring back proof you've participated in a raid beyond the trials (e.g. an Artifact from the raids) that grants no loot and no raid access, but suffice for whatever progression purposes the trials may be needed for.  If need be throw in some more time sinks before you can attempt the easier trials to slow down the rate of progression to what you'd expect from doing trials.  Challenge is not waiting for your Warriors in the guild to be available from their lockout time.  Sure, make people work hard once to get to the raids.  They drop some great stuff and entrance should be difficult.  But if everyone needs them done at some point, either Knights have to be way more powerful after gearing up with raid loot (which does not seem likely at this point... nor do I think it's a good idea...), or there needs to be some alternatives.  And if needing Warriors to be available to do trials is meant to be the timesink, I'd rather they put it elsewhere so that the timesink can be shared across everyone, not just Warriors.</div></div><hr />

If they did all that I would flat out quit.  I didn't start a Knight.  I don't want to play a Knight.<br />
<br />
Knights should not have a defensive disc.  Nor should they have a &quot;Furious&quot; Disc.  Why?  Knights have Harmtouch/LOH.  Knights also get DA.  No, you do not get to do everything Warriors do.  If you could do everything Warriors could do you'd be Warriors.<br />
<br />
Let me get this straight, this guy wants Knights to be on the same mitigation table with almost the same HPs (more if you include self healing), better utility, special abilities (Lifetap, LoH), AND our 2 best discs?  Lets not forget that not only do they already get most of our primary AAs, they get some that Warriors rightfully should get and don't (2 Hand Bash AA, anyone?).<br />
<br />
I would definitely not say that this particular Knight speaks for the Knight community, but why would anyone play a Warrior at that point?  All of thier utility plus 99% of our tanking ability?  Is this guy for real?<br />
<br />
Shadowknights, Pallies and Warriors are 3 different classes, with very different abilities.  Knights are Tank classes, but they are still hybrids and should not be able to infringe on the abilities of either parent class (which they currently don't) while still retaining some unique abilities.  They are quite capable of tanking the majority of current content (GoD excluded as I know nothing about GoD).  There are times when they are a better choice for tanking (i.e. IV).  Currently, IMO, the 3 tank classes are as balanced as they can be without making them too similar.  Warriors are innately better at taking damage, while Paladins and SKs must use thier variety of skills to make up the difference.  Knights have secondary roles while Warriors serve a single purpose (regardless of the DPS advantage over Knights, Warriors are not chosen to fill the role of DPS over the plethora of DPS classes available anymore than Knight classes are).<br />
<br />
IMO, if there is a balance problem, it is with the content, not the classes.  I don't personally think there is.  I will say this much.  I can certainly remember when PoP came out and the Knight classes were walking through the Exe trial.  Warriors were struggling with it, even with AE taunt.  Now the situation has reversed for a different set of trials.  So F-ing what?</div></div><hr />

I keep saying I'll deal but using me with as much AC and HP as I have as a spare Resser and Rooter is a waste in any definition.  I will be carried through but not as a tank.

Shadowed, I know you can.  My brother is a 63 SK that I helped him make a year ago (I've been playing for almost 4 years now) and HE can out DPS me easily.  I just didn't want to get into the Knight/Warrior DPS discussion.  To be honest, with the drop rate on Knight Weapons any Knight in my guild could out-DPS me just based on the superior weapons they have gotten.  As for the disc thing, I was referring to anything that stops melee damage, which is all that Furious is used for anyway.  I don't agree that knights should get it.  There are very slim advantages Warriors get for tanking and that just happens to be one of them.  I'm not saying that in doing it Warriors would be useless, just that I don't believe Knights are hurting at all.  Certainly none of the Knights in my guild seem to be having any problems.  If there is a problem in GoD for Knights, then the solution is in GoD, not in the classes.</div></div><hr />

It's really simple. Those mobs in the trials were made to be a challange to MT's. Because of Defensive, many more Warriors qualify as MT's sooner than Paladins.<br />
<br />
That's not to say there aren't Paladins that aren't MT's. But you've got to be pretty darned well equipped to MT like a Warrior.<br />
<br />
To do BoT including Kiegers and some named, PoEarth, etc (and that's not even tough content) then you have to have about 7k HP's unbuffed. Yes, players can do it with 6500HP's but pull the right named mob into camp and it's smush.<br />
<br />
Just look at Magelo. A top Paladin has about 8200HPs unbuffed. A top Warrior 10200HP's. And it continues right down the line #100 Paladin 7700HP. #100 Warrior 9200HP.<br />
<br />
Even without using Defensive Warriors out tank Paladins in harder content. It isn't a contest. And it certainly hasn't been a contest since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Warriors have what you like to call &quot;The Crutch&quot;. We can hit Defensive and for 3 minutes simulate a gigantic tank. We've had it for years. We aren't about to give it up or see it given to other tanks. kthnxbye ^_^. It is consistant with the fact that we are The Tank.<br />

Some of the Paladins aren't whining at all. We have what has largely proved to be a phony issue. You've told them so. Several posters indicated adjusting the mob DPS and DI might be in order. But no, that was largely ignored. Instead it's time for dunt dunt duuh.... &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (hides spellbook). Some have suggested the following Warrior nerfs:<br />
<br />
1. Removing Defensive (and Stonewall and Evasive too afaik) from the game and giving Warrior -3DI and Knights -1DI. When the math was explaned and the loss of benefit to Warriors some PoN posters and their fellow travelers howled. <br />
<br />
2. Giving Paladins mini-Defensive. Well not that mini. 40% (or was it only 30%?) Damage reduction for 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
3. Complaints that the aggro change was too much. And &quot;-1 DI&quot; was over the edge much less 500HPs.<br />
<br />
Well everyone is entitled to their opinion.<br />
<br />
But most of us (I think) know we didn't get a spellbook and as a result are and should be superior tanks in some area of the game. If not versus hard-hitting named mobs with high DI using our &quot;-1DI&quot; change and Defensive, then where?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I don't subscribe to Kether's &quot;fix&quot; to the problem.  I think the problem is a fundemental assumption which is through out all of Discord.  Doing what he wants doesn't change SOE's dumb design team logic.  Instead it feeds it.<br />
<br />
What did SOE do wrong?  All of the trials have the same fundemental pattern: fight hard hitting monsters.  There is nothing wrong with test like this.  In fact I would be very suprirsed if they didn't throw these at players a couple of times.  However where are the other type of trials?<br />
<br />
If SOE wanted really test the durability of six player groups they would make fights last 5 minutes instead of 20 seconds.  20 second fights only test if you can find something to avoid damage.  5 minutes fights shows if you can handle taking the damage effectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your premise is flawed, as the longer a fight lasts which is difficult the more it favors the warrior tank, as if mana conservation becomes an issue, then a DI-1 tank with a good chunk more HP is a clear choice.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid it would have the opposite effect of what you're trying to accomplish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">I have to say that this may be the reason single group progression trials are not a good idea.  The same issues arose when PoP first came out.  Certain classes were good at the trials (Exe), other classes had to be carried through.  At least with PoP there were alternative Trials.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the answer would be implementing a variety of trials equally difficult but in different ways.  AoW fights clearly favor Warriors as tanks.  AE fights with lighter melee DPS favor Pallies.  Exe-style fights clearly favor Knights for thier aggro abilities and group spells.  Having only 1 option for a trial and making it as difficult as it is narrows group choices quite a bit.  Allowing the players to be creative while still keeping it difficult is really the only answer I see.<br />
<br />
One example would be a trial in which the named hits about 3/4s as hard what you are describing, but procs an unresistable slow.  In this fight, Knights have a decided advantage over Warriors for tanking.<br />
<br />
I agree with Knights in the fact that all tanks should have equal opportunity to progress, but I also believe that true balance lies in the fact that no Tank is perfect in every situation.  If these trials must be completed for progression, all classes need to have a role in them.  If (and I'm not saying this is the case as I wouldn't know) these trials can only be tanked by Warriors, as you say, then there should really be variations where the Warrior might not be the best choice.  If all you have to deal with is a single melee mob, the odds clearly favor Warriors every time.<br />
<br />
But once again, I will reiterate that this does not sound like a class balance issue.  Altering the classes for 1 expansion will screw up the balance for the rest of the expansions.  The solution is where the problem lies.  In this case, the GoD trials themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Best solution that I've seen is the folowing:  When you go to get your instance, the guy goes &quot;Are you here to advance, or adventure&quot;  If you pick advance, then the trials would show up as they do now, if you pick adventure, then they show up with a boss that's reasonably able to be tanked without a disc.  Loot/Exp remains the same, only one unlocks raid level content beyond, the other is more of a dead end.</div></div><hr />

Perfectly said.  I am not in a uber guild and have only been to GoD to visit (went traveling a few days after it went live w/ a enc, cler, shaman), and almost got my ass handed to me on just a few trash mobs.  I havent been back since nor do I belive that my guild will be there any time in the near future.  <br />
<br />
Exactly what happened to me, same results. I will be VERY leery of EVER buying an expansion again. Most of the 100+ people in my guild have NOT purchased the expansion because of our (Officer) input. SOE is good at listening to the people who play EQ at the level of addictive/compulsive, but terrible at listening to the casual player. In the end it will cost them money.<br />
That being said, I have a huge pool of LDoN points, if they make the trials even a tinsy bit easier, I can MT them! It will take me about two months to deck my char out completely in LDoN gear and augs. I am ranked about 290 or so in total LDoN points on my server (which has one of the biggest player population). So some of this Knight suggestion will actually flood the trials with tanks that are not even elemental geared. <br />
Shadowedspawned is one of the most reasonable Knights (SK types are more reasonable then the high and mighty Paladin player in most cases), but are we sure that adjusting the trials, OR Knights being adjusted is the answer for one set of trials. SOE may do it just to sell the expansion, who knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Thank you Doom.  /bow<br />

<br />
I actully like Fordlin suggestion.  2 different types of trails.  One for advancement and 1 for adventure.  If i am understanding it right the loot as it is now is comparable to time gear.  leave the advancement loot just like that and gear the adventure loot down a bit toward elemental stuff.  <br />
<br />
Over 1/2 of my guild has also not bought GoD.  Like I said we have just recently gotten into the ele planes and are working out the encounters as we can, so we are focusing on that as much as we can.  Right now we have 4 time guilds, and about 6-7 ele guilds (and a few more that are busting there asses off to get there).  Competition is rough but as it is now we couldnt handle GoD raids (as a guild), and I am pretty sure we couldnt handle a raid either.<br />
<br />
Personnaly I love having a warrior tank.  The more I get hit the more I get interrupted = the less dmg I do.  I will even work w/ the ones in group at times to help them get aggro.  Snare on inc dont attack and wait till it turns away then FD.  Doing that I have never had one turn back unless I get really lucky (crit on both double attacks and have spear crit right after hehe).<br />
<br />
Doom we SK's have to be more reasonable.  We have had almost as many breaks during patchs as bards   :p , so we learn to get along w/ what we can get.</div></div><hr />

I'll take my chances with a long dragged out fight than one that just stomps me in a blink.<br />
<br />
SOE forgot the lessons learned in LDoN.  The advancement sucked (ie. it was flat) but everyone can and did run adventures.  Why isn't there a &quot;hard&quot; that is like this for advancement and a &quot;normal&quot; for those who just want to farm lower grade equipment and just experience Discord?   Right now I know way to many casual players who have never set foot in Natimbi let alone go try anything.  What a waste of their money.  I suppose they get access to Discord AA and the Leadership stuff but all of that content is utterly lost to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 When I first started EQ, I was level 20 when Velious came out. People in my guild argued for WEEKS over buying it or not, because it was meant for level 35 and up. Quite a few of us were DEAD CERTAIN we'd never see 35, let alone go to Velious.<br />
<br />
 Most of us now are in our 60's, and every once in a while one of my old guildies looks at me and says, 'Did you EVER expect to get here?' No, I never did. But just because I'm not ready to use the content right this second doesn't prevent me from making use of the AA's now, building my gear (And my guildie's gear) and going and doing it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Bemyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">First I would like to say this IS a problem for end game Knights.  To say that it isnt is no less blind then saying warriors didnt have problems in PoP.  I however, dont see this as a class balance issue but as a content issue.  Knights want what ever one else wants, to advance and make a contribution to their guild and in single group encounters.  I completly agree that knights have spells that provide alot of utility.  However in a 6 man encounter our prime job is to tank.  If the content for a single group &quot;required&quot; trial is such that a knight cant tank it then our secondary abilies need to provide enough utility to justify a slot.  At this point I dont see it.  Single group &quot;required&quot; content that favors one type of tank to the EXCLUSION of the others is broken.  I would say the exact same thing if the boss in a required 6 man group encounter cast a single target unresistable fear that required a knight with fearless aa to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">I bought Velious for the see through inventory.<br />
<br />
Partha makes a good point though, when Velious was being explored alot of the content wasn't accessible to everyone, at that time getting from one end of Kael Drakkel to the other was a big mission and you had to do that to collect your Wakening Lands tooth, then you had to get through Skyshrine (and get some key) to go pick up your Cobalt Scar tooth just to be able to port to these areas.  <br />
<br />
You can read any EQ message board you like and you will find posts where people discuss what was the best expansion and the answer is almost always &quot;Velious, something else, something else, something else, Luclin&quot;.  Well I would hazard a guess that people at SoE read these threads too, and guess which prior expansion GoD is most similar to?<br />
<br />
I've got as far as Tipt so far, got up to the final dude and got him to 9% on our 2nd try so we learnt lots, and it was fun.  The whole look and feel of the zone is excellent, aswell as the feeling of progression as you move through it. btw, on that named mob there was some confusion on the pull and I died right after furious dropped at about 75%, the SK in our group then tanked till 14% and died because the cleric went OOM, not because she couldnt tank it (he was LOM at the pull).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;trials&quot; are NOT required, as proven by 95% of the player population (and 99% of tank) being unable to do it, INCLUDING 65th Warriors. GoD is NOT required to play EQ, in fact, only the ORIGINAL game is REQUIRED. Enraging blow weapons were REQUIRED to fix Warrior taunt, but not made available to 99% of Warriors. So they were FORCED to upgrade taunt due to a bad decision at SOE to use taunting blow weapons as a crutch.<br />
Further more, if they nerf the mobs, I will be able to tank them shortly, I am just a casual player, and should NEVER be able to tank the mobs. If they increase Knights powers, the selfish 1% ruin class balance for the 99%.<br />
Cut the leg chains hooking you to your computer desk leg, and you might figure out what I am talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Bemyen, as has been said before, to gain raid access to the content beyond the trial, you only need one person PER RAID who has completed the trial. It is in no way required that EVERYONE and their grandmother be able to pass the trials to continue to further content.<br />
<br />
I think Frodlin's suggestion is best so far. Put in an NPC who initiates the trial with a selector for Adventure or Advancement. Have the named mobs in adventure content be tankable by Time-geared knights, while the named mobs in Advancement content ramain as they are now, yet have them both drop the same loot. Hell, you could even set it up so that the adventure trials would grant LDON Adventure Points.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">I am the one who advocated an 'advancement' version.  However the advancement version should not have any loot at all.  You're talking about phase 3ish loot obtainable with one group here.  If Time Paladins can do it then it can also be done by EP or possibly lower Warriors.  Granted you could have some requirements (like proof you've participated in an Ikkinz raid) but even for Time guilds, the ring from the trial is still good to have just for the spellshield effect, so there's no reason the loot from Ikkinz trials should be any easier to obtain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Bemyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">I dont think that these trials should be any easier.  However the difficulty of an encounter is not limited to how much melee output an NPC puts on a single target.  Rampage, ae rampage, ae spells, and procced spell effects are all things that NPC's use to make an encounter more difficult.  The suggestion that &quot;EP or possibly lower warriors&quot; would be able to tank this just reinforces my point that this content is out of balance.  I dont even mind the idea of different types of trials for different types of groups.  An encounter where the entire group was taking massive spell damage but the melee damage on the main tank was less would be much more difficult for a warrior's group but much better suited to a paladin as the tank.  <br />
<br />
On the other side of things a mob that cast a single target unresistable fear would be untankable by anything other then a Knight with fearless aa.  I would see that as poor content for a single group encounter as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I dont make the rules, I dont design any content.  Ya I am bummed because I am a time geared paladin with about 390 aa sitting around lfg while a group of 5 is waiting for a warrior to log in so they can do a trial in Kod Taz.  At this point I dont think anyone knows wether or not these trials will be &quot;required&quot; by everyone to progress beyond Ikkinz.  If they are, I imagine that after a few weeks of the hate tells warriors are getting because they are not doing trials 20 hours a day 7 days a week to get the rest of the guild flagged some of you might decide that this is poor content as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">Seperating out the loot from the advance would be a good idea but I'm not convinced it should be everywhere.  In POP we killed flag bearing monsters because it moved people forward.  The loot was somewhat interesting but not a deal breaker.<br />
<br />
It should be pointed out that spell drops are somewhat rare.  I can count on one hand how many items I've pulled from these things.  Especially when focusing on advancement in places like Vxed, why bother to engage hard named monsters when that isn't your target?  If SOE allowed one to run the zone/event again under different sets of monsters and cicumstances for just loot that would fix a lot of things.  Heck they might even be able to play it like &quot;teaching&quot; thing to get people aclimated to Discord monsters.<br />
<br />
As for the original topic, the trials need tuning.  If you can't see why then you haven't run them enough.  They are just plainly and blantantly off where Paladins not being able to tank well is only a facet of it.</div></div><hr />
