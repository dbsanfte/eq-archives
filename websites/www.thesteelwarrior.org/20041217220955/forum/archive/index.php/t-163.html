<br />
Download, install, run on another machine, or in the background with EQW, or just parse your log after you logoff...<br />
<br />
Also, being level 52, your DPS is going to be a lot lower than many of the people in those other threads... as they are 60+.  Keep pluggin though, you have better weapons than most of us had at level 52.  You'll do fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sivok, dont be discouraged.  Most of us in that other thread parsing 90+ DPS are all 65, with AoW+ weapons.<br />
<br />
When i was in my low 50s, i was happy to hit 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to read those threads and just wince . When I was 50ish, I was ranging from 25-30, if real lucky 40 on a greenie mob. But levels and gaining more offensive and weapon skills will up that damage. Now at 55, I'm averaging 35-40 with only Silver Chitin Hand Wrap haste and Cobalt Boot strength and goblin earring clicky buffs to affect my atk. Buffed up on a raid in Seb with 57 Enchanter haste I was averaging 50ish and spiking to low 70s once on a Jugg in same gear I had at 51, so don't sweat it too much, it will come.<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually, I know the haste doesn't affect my atk rating value at all, but the haste does boost the DPS. I re-read it and it seemed unclear what I was trying to say</div></div><hr />

<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
This is what propogates myths in EQ, like FASTEST weapon is ALWAYS best in primary (case in point, a 12/22 beats a 9/18 in primary for a long, LONG time).<br />
<br />
2handers are NOT always the superior option. Parse the stuff yourself and find out. And then, parse it again on different mobs. And parse again. And by the time you're done parsing, you'll either a) Hate parsing, or b) Finally be high enough level that it won't freaking matter anymore anyways.<br />
<br />
At level 52, his ATK is low. His skills are low. The damage bonus is low. The MODALS on GOOD dual wield weapons (which he has) are higher than on 2handers. I'd be surprised if his 2hand setup &quot;own over anything&quot; his dual wield setup.<br />
<br />
2handers don't really come into their own until later.<br />
<br />
Especially considering that at 52, the mobs he's fighting are all mostly OLD world stuff, which was much more tailored for dual wielding.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield in your early 50s is still a viable option, especially when you're MOSTLY fighting Drolvargs still.<br />
<br />
The game at 52 is a DIFFERENT game than the one at 65. And all too often we forget that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Dolvarges???? No way, the guild is in Umbral and plains (old and new). <br />
<br />
What I need now is a good haste item, I got rid of my Hand wraps, I looted some decent gloves off a dragon in SF and they are no drop so I cant sell them. Thinking maybe a waste item for haste, have a smiters gridle ATM and it is ok at best.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo thanks for input.</div></div><hr />

A dark blue conning XP mob is a dark blue conning XP mob.<br />
<br />
Be it a Krup Shaman, a Drolvarg or a Shadowy Assassin.<br />
<br />
In fact, you could probably get FASTER XP (though much more monotonous) with ye ole Dro's, considering how many god awful HPs those Moktors have.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Play the game to have fun.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying don't disrespect the old world. I dinged 56, 57 and 58 off of Lava Duct Crawlers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korak Sarathai</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I solo'd, levels 51-55 in the Hole.  Levels 56-59 in LGuk.  Around 80 percent of my xp during those stretches was in those places.  I started out fighting with a jade mace and a snare whip.  Around level 55 I had a SBoZ and LSoEE, by 59 it was a primal 2hander.  Fungi and 21% haste until level 56, then Fungi and 36% haste.  I had a truncheon of doom, but never needed it apart from the ghoul lord.<br />
<br />
Old world can be great xp, although not nearly as good as it was.  When they nerfed low blue xp a while back, they drastically reduced the ability to do what I did.  It is still an option though if you have small chunks of time to play with.<br />
<br />
Parse your damage and your xp rate in a few places.  Find what works best for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt disrespect it. I have just moved beyond it, well, that part of it anyway. I did 45-51 on the ole dawgs. Bored with it mostly. I still do kael, though not often, we are just going for equipment and this is where it takes us now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szerath</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed that for the planes you do better tanking with a 2 hander then duel. I pesonally average about 25 to 30 DSP being only 53 with average to low-end weapons. But if I'm in the planes I always take a 2 hander..the difference in the damage I take from Riposte is noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chubz Drago</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To this date I havn't personally gotten a &quot;good&quot; two-handed weapon but I'm getting close to getting one (have bee waiting for Blade of War).  The good two handed weapons combine high defense (less riposte) and high offense (120 DPS with Blade of War).<br />
<br />
As far as my personal DPS is, I avgerage ~115 DPS against mobs in Plane of Valor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">epic 2 hander (36/41) is outdamaging my DW combo (12/19 FG + 14/24 Redblade) against PoV mobs, so 2 handers definitely seems to be the way to go.<br />
<br />
Planning on shelling out the big bucks (3-4k) on a Stone bladed Axe of Dismay as a DPS weapon for when Im not tanking, and pull out the JBoW for its proc when I am.<br />
<br />
Back when I was in my early 50s I ran around with a jarsath trident and a snare whip until I 'upgraded' to a lammy/defiance combo.<br />
<br />
Sivok, it looks like you're doing sweet with those weapons for 52.  Turn on others attacks and filter them into another window, then parse your log file and you'll probably find that your damage stacks up appropriately against others of similar level.</div></div><hr />
