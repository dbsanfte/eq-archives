<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went into the most rediculous adventure last night on LDoN. Group was 65 bard, druid and warrior (me), 62 ranger, 60 chanter and 59 druid (average level 62.667). I really thought about requesting a hard...really and truely.<br />
<br />
What we ended up with (on a rescue) is an adventure so rediculously easy that no mob (including the 3 named) hit for more than 250, the majority of hits were for 100 or less and the druid on average, healing me once every 3 or 4 fights. The adventure was so non-challenging as to be boring. I suspect thay my DPS would be higher than the mobs. I have it logged so I can pull our real numbers if needed.<br />
<br />
Then came the &quot;rewards.&quot; I was harshly punished for grouping with guildies (the 59 and 60). I earned, about 1/3 the XP I would have from an all 65 group, and earned a whopping 34 Adventure points. <br />
<br />
If this is somehow &quot;tuned&quot; I will eat my GSoT.<br />
<br />
VI needs to fix mix level tuning.</div></div><hr />

I did and adventure with a level 56 and 54. The rest of the group was 60 like me. It was sooooo dang easy that I could go back to the days of hitting auto-attack and watching TV. By the middle of the adventure the cleric was meleeing so that he would have something to do. Then we got a whopping 21 adventure points from it along with absolutely no drops and we cleared the entire place out just for fun(slaughter mission).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your group average needs to be 63+ to get a level 65 adventure. You got a level 60 adventure (its in 5level steps), which is the same a 58.01 group would get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait. You guys are excited by how easy it was, yet complaining by getting less points? Come the hell on already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if hard would be managable if you have a group average of 62.9 - <br />
<br />
that might would be interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a pick up ldon group the other day which I never had done before,the group consisted of me 65 war a 65 shm and a 65 wiz,then there was a 64 wiz and then a 61 chanter and a 63 Cleric.<br />
<br />
We ended up with a lvl 65 mission which was fine an assasination.<br />
<br />
The problem in this group was 2 things, <br />
<br />
1- The chanter could only mez one mob do to level the recast time vs the mez time I guess I dunno.<br />
<br />
2- both the Chanter and the Cleric only had WoT they were nto high enough for Pacify.<br />
<br />
Luckily throughout the adventure Wot worked fine,and in situations where I ended up pulling 3 mobs root parking was a fine enough solution for CC.We went about the dungeon and things went well,Because of the group makeup I had to do well pulling and I enjoyed it,it has been a long time since I had to pull.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where the problem came in is at the boss.<br />
<br />
The boss was in a room with 3 other mobs,all 3 were to high for wot to work on,Furthermore they were healers and the room was such a size that root parking was not an option.<br />
<br />
I pre targeted a mob for chanter to mez and had each of the wizrds chosoe the other 2 targets and then I grabbed the boss and drug her out,The chanters mez was resisted and one of the wizards root was resisted....All sorts of bad things happened.<br />
<br />
I tried several differnt ways of pulling the boss,I could nto clear each single mob because they all asisted including the boss.<br />
<br />
Eventually we had to have each wizard snare the 2 adds and kite em off and root while the chanter worked the other add and me the cleric and the shaman worked the boss.<br />
<br />
We ended up killing the boss but since we arrived at the boss with only 20 min left and wiped a couple times figruing uot how to break the room we failed.<br />
<br />
Now I had fun and so did the others,I am not complaing about the difficulty.The problem is with a lvl 62 chanter or a 65 cleric that room would have been simple,or even an fd class.<br />
<br />
And as stated above,the xp for the lvl 65's was horrid while the lower lvl guys thought it was great.<br />
<br />
I liked the challenge of that dungeon,the problem is because of the need for certain skills I fear that many people will be excluded from gorups because they are not 65 or 59 or whatever the case may be,Truth be told if the chanter was one level mroe that room would have been simple to clear and we would have been succesful in our adventure,We would have cleared the dungeon much faster to.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a shame that in order you need not just the right classes but the right levels if your not all 65.It is ridiculous to me that I can go in a dungeon with 2 65 clrs 3 65 wars and a 65 shm and pull without fear of anyhting and kill the entire dungeon in half the time it took me in the multi level group.<br />
<br />
When classes are only 2 or 3 lvls of each other they should not be punished with such a difficult proces when a group of lvl 65's which the dungeon is designed for can breeze through it no matter what the class makeup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a steady group i play with, and we used to clean house on the LDoN adventures and have 20+ minutes to spare on them. This was when we were as follows:<br />
65 warrior, 63 wizzy, 59 bard, 62 ranger, 65 chanter and 62 cleric.<br />
We amassed a 10-0 record in this time.<br />
Now we have had some levelling up and our group is:<br />
65 war, 65 wiz, 62 bard, 63 Ranger, 65 chanter, 63 cleric. Since the level ups we are 0-7. Same group, same tactics that yielded us 10 straight victories and 20+ minutes left over now can't finish an adventure in time.<br />
Count your blessings on those easy points.<br />
I do think they need to retune the level 65 adventures to be able to be done by ANY group put together and not assume we are elemental equipped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heafstaag</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't excited by how easy it was. I love challenges. I absolutely hate mindless xp grinding. LDoN makes it so much more fun to xp since you are working against time. I would prefer to fail 100 times on a challenge than to succeed once on a cake-walk. I think that they need to tune it a little better than 5 level increments. It is too easy if you group with someone a little lower in level. I don't want to be penalized for taking some mid 50's out for a little fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do agree that the challenge of the level 65 adventures totally outweighs the points to be earned.<br />
They are a challenge and therefore fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Enemies seem to max at low 60s (except assassination bosses) in normal level 65 adventures so there's no reason why your enchanter couldn't have done anything a level 65 enchanter could do.  There might be a few mobs you can't use Apathy on but that's about it.<br />
<br />
I've done normal with no form of crowd control or slow whatsoever, and believe me, no matter how good your people are at root parking things or how uber everyone is, it still doesn't beat a mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A level 61 chanter has both Rapture and Apathy to work from. The first being completely unresistable, so there is no excuse for messing up on a single target mez job.<br />
<br />
As for mobs too high for apathy? I would love to see a screen shot since in about 30-35 missions I have never had apathy resisted because the mob was too high. I seriously doubt that outside of boss mob, and perhaps named mobs there is a mob high enough level to require anything higher than apathy.<br />
<br />
That being said, it sounds like it is balanced already. You are not being penalized for taking along lower levels. The dungeon is EASIER, thus less points.<br />
<br />
Seems balanced to me.<br />
<br />
Not that these dungeons are balanced perfectly, but it sounds like it is at least close to what they intended.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use apathy on my chanter over sleep/bliss for the lower mana cost and havent found anything that it wont mez in an LDoN dungeon crawl yet, but haven't done many as a chanter yet so its possible some mobs are too high.<br />
<br />
Something I have noticed however is that alot of 61 chanters - PL'd bots or maybe just newbs - don't have apathy because they don't see in the bazaar and you don't get it from a parchment hand in, its actually vendor bought (from the parchment hand in NPC even).  I have met a huge number of 61/62 enchanters in PoV who wont mez because they haven't found their 61 mez spell yet ... /boggle!<br />
<br />
As for the points for doing a lower level adventure I got a tell on my bazaar mule (a 36 cleric) a few days ago inviting me to a LDoN run and wasn't actually AFK for once so figured I'd give it a go.  <br />
<br />
Was a little dubious about the abilities of a pickup group of lvl 30 somethings but other than one person (sadly the warrior) who had to leave 5 mins in the group were alot more on to it than some lvl 65 pickup groups I've been in and we finished an assasination mission with a ranger tanking and lots of time to spare.<br />
<br />
AND.... we got 3 points.<br />
<br />
Like wtf?<br />
<br />
3 points?<br />
<br />
LDoN = so not worth it at lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds like they should make difficulty user selectable. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard for lvl 60 group is the same as normal for lvl 65 group, I tested it myself, Ive done ~45 in tak, including ~43 lvl 65 groups and ~2 lvl 60 groups so I have a lot of knowledge of how the lvl 65 group mobs work and their names and their hit ranges etc, and from the 2 lvl 60 ones and my other few lvl 60 missions I know that the mobs are different types and names for lvl 60 dungeons than for lvl 65's.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say that everything hit ranges, hp, names, mob types, etc are exactly the same on 60 hard and 65 normal.<br />
<br />
I have also done a 65 hard in Tak and the mobs have different names/hp/mob types/etc than they do in 65 normal as well.<br />
<br />
Problem solved, bring the lvl 60 group on a lvl 65 mission by choosing lvl 60 hard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maelissa</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think part of the problem might be that the game usues the same forumla for calculating dungeon level regardless of the level of the group, while relative power per level changes dramatically as you advance.  I vaguely remember reading somewhere that one level from  51-60 is roughly the same amount of power increase as 5 levels pre 50 and that one level from 61-65 is roughly the same amount of power increase as 5 levels from 51-60.  (The numbers may only apply towards casters).  At any rate, a 32 character in a mostly 35 group is a lot more balanced in terms of abilities than a 62 character in a mostly 65 group, but the game uses the same formula to determine average group level in both cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what Kailyn was trying to get at, was not that she was upset that the mission was so easy.  What she was upset about, was that by making a concious effort to group with a guildee who was not 65, she took a severe hit on the adventure points.  I can't tell you the frustration I've felt when trying to include a level 58/59/60 guildee to be told by the shaman/cleric/dps that I was trying to recruit that they wouldn't do a group that didn't have all 65s.  This elitist attitude has become more and more prevelent.  While I personally figure points are points, and I'd rather get 34 points then sit on my bum lfg in the same amount of time and not get any, I do not think it is fair to penalize a level 65 that is trying to include lower levels in their adventure.</div></div><hr />
