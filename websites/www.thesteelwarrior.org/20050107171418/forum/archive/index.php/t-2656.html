SS armor has a total of 43 dex<br />
ORNATE     a mere 27  <br />
<br />
So just call me peter pumkin head i guess <br />
without it i feel underdone.<br />
<br />
Fair enough we are upgraded in ac/hp but why should we be screwed on dex in times like these ? meaning the holding aggro<br />
crisis,because we are slaves to the proc if you ask me<br />

<br />
Beginning of a fight: Oh, I hope I proc.<br />
25% through the fight: C'mon, proc!<br />
50% through the fight: Please, please, please proc!<br />
75% through the fight: Proc, dammit!!<br />
95% through the fight: (proc) F#ck you, proc!<br />
<br />
Personally, I go through a couple more phases sprinkled through there, but that's the general idea.</div></div><hr />
