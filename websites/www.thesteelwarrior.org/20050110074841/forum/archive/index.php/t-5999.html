Seems suspicious to me that he changes his political support away from Bush and Clear Channel takes him off the air...  Especially when you look at the Bush/Clear Channel connection and the other anti-Bush DJ's that Clear Channel has yanked off...  and the FCC/Cheney connection.  Seems to me like the republican party is getting a pretty strong foothold and control over radio broadcast media....<br />
<br />
Yes I know, totally off-topic, and I'm not normally a conspiricist but this makes me wonder....  Or is it just the backlash from Janet Jackson.<br />
<br />
I don't know, but I for one will miss his radio show if it's taken off Infinity also....  it's one of the few sources of entertainment which actually makes me smile and laugh.</div></div><hr />

Least now I'll be able to listen to books on tape again )<br />
<br />
But, as the anti corporate sematic in me, I feel as though he was taken off public air waves in order for people to purchase ($$$ PAY $$$) XL radio.  This was just a &quot;reason&quot; for the corporate executives to force a pay for listen show.  Can't get E! without cable, can yas?<br />

In my view this country has gotten a bit too politically correct and uptight, we all need to lighten up a bit.<br />
<br />
I don't buy the publicity stunt argument, I think the ratings have always been phenomenal, I don't see any reason for it...  Now Janet Jackson...  that's a publicity stunt.  Her popularity was way down....  no one cared about her... now she's on everyone's mind.<br />
<br />
It scares me that the FCC which controls the airwaves has the power to do whatever they want.  If they don't want someone on the air, fine the station they are on, force the station to fire whoever it is the FCC doesn't like.  Get control of the FCC and it's pretty easy to control the airwaves and promote your agenda.  Too much power in the hands of that agency...  it scares me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want to point out that the FCC didn't take him off the air (although he does pay tons of fines to them every year).  It was Clear Channel, the corporation that owns the radio stations that took him off the air.  He is still on every week day here in the Bay Area, although at most I catch 10 minutes of his show on the rare days when I drive to work and I'm tired of the CD in my player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was taken from Clear Channels press release on the matter.<br />
<br />
What I find amusing is Rush Limbaugh is still on the Clear Channel network when Stern isn't.  Atleast Stern never illegally obtained tens of thousands of perscription drugs for his own use, lied about it and then only fessed up after being caught.  Makes you wonder what &quot;Decency&quot; means to them.  Crued jokes bad, pill poppin addict good.<br />
<br />
But then  again, Rush is a republican with his nose buried up Bush's ass.</div></div><hr />

It is my understanding that only 6 Clear Channel stations carried Stern to begin with. A drop in the bucket, he is still in all the major markets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howard Stern is on a limited number of stations, all of which are, or were, in major markets.  Clear Channel is one of two major corporations that own the majority of radio stations in the US, the other is Infinity Broadcasting.  Additionally, Clear Channel owns 30% of XL radio, so don't expect to hear Howard Stern on XL radio.  The markets where Clear Channel took Howard Stern out of are Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Rochester, San Diego, Pittsburgh, and Louisville.  I would consider those major markets.<br />
<br />
If you look at this issue at face value you could say Clear Channel took Howard Stern off the air.  If you dig deeper and you look at the big picture you will understand that Clear Channel took Howard Stern off the radio due to pressure from the FCC, or in other words, the government.  Howard Stern is not the only victim, and who will the witch hunt go after next?  Doesn't it bother anyone that the government has the ability to control speech on our airwaves?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is exactly why Rush is still on the air.  Note that four days after Howard Stern changed his support from Bush to Kerry that he was taken off the air.  Also several other DJ's have been taken off the air by Clear Channel for speaking out against Bush and/or the war, one of which is currently suing Clear Channel.</div></div><hr />

I've been one of those morons since the mid-80s when he was on am radio here in NY.  I suppose that makes me an &quot;east coast elite&quot; though.<br />
<br />
I'm really glad that the Bush administration and their allied witch hunt moral police have decided to protect all our liberties by systematically destroying them.  Whats next random suspension of individuals rights to free of unreasobable search &amp; seizure? Oh WAIT that already has happened (US Citizen grabbed off the street in Chicago and sent to Guantanamo)<br />
<br />
Probably the &quot;patriot act&quot; version 3.0 will have indecency standards codified in it.<br />
<br />
I think Al Franken summed up Limbaugh most accurately in the title of his book.  Its amusing to see a man now confirmed to have abused drugs and possibly a &quot;felon&quot; still try to take the moral high ground on anything.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah for the record I voted for Reagan, I would have voted for McCain.  Moderates are not wanted in the new world order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not know much about the whole deal but here is what it was supposedly over:<br />
<br />
&quot; It was Tuesday's Stern show that prompted the Clear Channel decision. The program featured typical fare: Paris Hilton's ex-boyfriend hawking his sex tape of the hotel heiress. Two women getting naked after losing a contest.<br />
<br />
But it was apparently a call from a listener who used the &quot;n-word&quot; that spurred Hogan's reaction. &quot;  <br />
<br />
I got this from this article http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20040227/ap_en_ce/howard_stern_9 <br />
<br />
As I said above, I do not know much about the whole situation, but it appears to be that Clear Channel is trying to act like they are out for our best interests.  Or to say it another way, they believe that they can make more money by going after the &quot;decent folks&quot; compared to those who enjoy Stern.</div></div><hr />

As for those of you who think the FCC doesn't have any power over these few companies that control most of the radio stations and thus most of the airwaves, consider that the FCC can fine any station for pretty much anything they find objectionable, and that station has no legal recourse other than to pay the fine or be shut down, and the FCC is ran by none other than Dick Cheney's son....</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are announcers far worse than Stern, on Clear Channel, and have always been.  Clear Channel only had a problem with Howard Stern because the FCC was turning up the heat.  Yes, Clear Channel has the right to pull anything they see fit, but they wouldn't have pulled Stern off if it weren't for the heat from the FCC.  If you have no problem with the FCC, a government agency, controllling free speech, then that's your purogative, I personally have a problem with it.<br />
<br />
2. The goverment owns the airwaves not the stations. The goverment gives licenes to the stations and the stations must obey the laws, if they dont the FCC can and should pull their tickets. <br />
<br />
There are no laws.  Wait, let me restate that, the ONLY laws are that seven words cannot be broadcast over the airwaves.  The f-word, the s-word, and so on.  Those are the ONLY laws.  The fines the FCC imposes are ARBITRARY, based on the SUBJECTIVE opinion of whoever decides to fine a station or revoke their license.  Because there are no laws, those who are fined or who have their license revoked have NO legal recourse available to them to fight the FCC.  That's way too much power.<br />
<br />

Did you read the interview with Mel's father?  He is crazy, certified loon.  The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  Have you noticed how the Jewish community is reacting to this movie?  Do you think all those Jewish people are wrong and crazy also?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I think people will take from this movie what they take from ANY religious discussion: Exactly what they want to hear that reinforces their beliefs. I haven't seen any of the doomsayers in the Jewish community note that several of the Jews depicted in the film deplore the treatment of Jesus during the movie.</div></div><hr />

The government has regulated the air waves since radios were invented, and you better be glad it has.  Ever wonder how the frequency range of your AM/FM radio is determined?  What what frequency cordless phones can operate at?  Or cell phones?  Ever wonder why you don't get 2 interfering signals, whether it be radio or broadcast TV?

the HONOR to tell the truth after his experiances as a Viet Nam Veteran Against the War, regardless of possible personal cost and criticism.<br />

a willingness to serve his COUNTRY in peacetime. Not as a Senator owned by this corporation or that special intrest,  but as a man when it mattered and wanting to see others treated like men.<br />

I am very glad the government performs frequency management - however, I get tired of content regulation.  However, the FCC performs both and can (and does) impose fines for subjective opinions of conent.  There are objective fines - ie words that get you in trouble.  I hate the subjective fines, if they disagree with how the message is delivered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason the FCC is granted the power to regulate content as well as the technical side of things is because of how openly available the information is to young people.  It's the same thing as putting ratings on movies and stopping 12 year olds from going into an R-rated movie.  If you argue that the government shouldn't regulate the content of BROADCASTED information, you should also be for porn magazines available in kids comic book stores.  Regulating where stuff can be seen/heard is nothing new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
people need to watch their screaming larve or NOT have them, if its a dial radio you can put it in a wood case with a lock and holes for sound, if its a digital one, you can enter a code in most modern ones to password protect any changes, if its a radio walkman they shouldnt have them at school, you can put it in a locked space you know<br />
<br />
but again, its everyone else's fault you dont lock up this or that, and you dont watch who your kid hangs around with, so the rest of us have to put up with stupid laws and/or regulations(and dont forget the novels of safty warnings that is now on everything)<br />
<br />
if i dont have a kid around i dont see why i should have to have a child lock on my gun, or in some states have my child safty locks enabled at all times(in my cars rear doors)....</div></div><hr />

In that sense, it's the same as cable TV, and you can do pretty much anything you want.  The issue is BROADCAST content, not other services you have to pay to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">digital radio as in programed with alot of buttons on the consle or remote, not as in the subcriber radio.<br />
<br />
(such as a 4 digit code on your pro logic sound system)<br />
<br />
doing so you can cap how loud it can be, you can block this or that (bye bye 109.5 or whatever) and even go as far making it NOT work for the hours that the stern show is on!, what a novel idea eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Novel idea?  No, not really.  Unless every single radio is equiped with features like those, minors will have easy-access to the content of broadcast radio.  I'm just pointing out the reasons why the FCC has the power they do, a point you seem to have missed entirely.  Stern or anyone else can never be pulled from something like XM radio or cable TV or any other non-broadcast service no matter how obscene they want to be unless the people who run the show think he's not drawing a big enough audience and want to replace him with another show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so your telling me, that its my job to go out and fix/replace every radio in my house? no, your kids wont be here.<br />
<br />
public places? hmm, i work at a subway, oldies 103 was playing hells bells, one complaint and we were limited to classic music.... so that is taken care of....<br />
<br />
all that is left is YOUR radio, and YOUR kids walkman, how about you step up and be a good perent?<br />
<br />
and just so ya know, there are PLENTY of radio stations that operate outside the FFC's rules and REPECT other broadcasters by keeping a clear freq. and staying off existing stations freq. so it is possible for people to police themsevles and maintain freedom by ones self</div></div><hr />

Don't tell me what I can and can not listen to because you can not controll what your children listen to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about your kids, but my kids are either sound asleep in bed, getting ready for school, or at school, when Howard Stern is broadcast.  They have a much better chance of catching his show on E! on our cable late at night when I'm up asleep in bed than in the morning when he's on the radio.  It is a parents job to regulate what their children see and listen to on the radio and television, not the governments job, in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
Why does everyone think it is now the governments job to protect our children and us at the expense of our freedom?  Since when are people in this country for the power of the government over the power of the people?  It is not the people here who are rising up to have Howard Stern taken off the radio, it is the government, and I honestly do not believe they are generally backed by the people, and they certainly are not backed by any laws on the books that I am aware of.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know, Clear Channel took Howard Stern off, not the FCC...   Yeah, sure....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clear channel isn't exactly the pinnacle of enlightenment either.  They're the reason you only hear the same 15 fucking songs on the radio all the time.<br />
<br />
Whether clear channel turns out to be the lesser of 2 evils has yet to be determined, but it definitely has status as evil.</div></div><hr />

I said this where?  The point is, the vast majority of radios out there are easily accessable to children (there's a reason they put the porn magazines on the high shelves).<br />
<br />

You're either refering to the designated &quot;free&quot; frequency bands that anyone can use for anything and no one can complain if there's interference on that frequency (those frequency bands are designated/regulated by the FCC, btw) or talking out of your ass.  There's no &quot;self policing&quot; going on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why does everyone think it is now the governments job to protect our children and us at the expense of our freedom? <br />
Because people are too stupid to do it themselves.  If you don't believe that, look at the warning labels you see on products today that are REQUIRED or companies get sued.  Like - Stove: CAUTION!!!!  This surface can get hot!</div></div><hr />

Only because the law allows this bullshit.  Laws that were started with &quot;protecting the masses&quot; in mind as well too.  Odd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
a willingness to serve his COUNTRY in peacetime. Not as a Senator owned by this corporation or that special intrest,  but as a man when it mattered and wanting to see others treated like men.<br />
<br />
I hate to burst your bubble but John Kerry has taken more special intrest money then any Senator over the past 19 years. I do not know if he was bought and paid for but it sure looks that way.</div></div><hr />
