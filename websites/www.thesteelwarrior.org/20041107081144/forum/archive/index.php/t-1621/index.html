2. Insist on keeping your car windshield wipers running in all weather conditions &quot;to keep them tuned up&quot;. <br />
3. Reply to everything someone says with &quot;that's what YOU think.&quot; <br />
4. Declare your apartment an independent nation, and sue your neighbors upstairs for &quot;violating your airspace&quot;. <br />
5. Forget the punchline to a long joke, but assure the listener it was a &quot;real hoot&quot;. <br />
6. Follow a few paces behind someone, spraying everything they touch with a can of Lysol. <br />
7. Highlight irrelevant information in scientific papers and copy them to your boss. <br />
8. Make beeping noises when a large person backs up. <br />
9. Invent nonsense computer jargon in conversations, and see if people play along to avoid the appearance of ignorance. <br />
10. Finish all your sentences with the words &quot;in accordance with prophesy.&quot; <br />
11. Wear a special hip holster for your remote control. <br />
12. Do not add any inflection to the end of your sentences, producing awkward silences with the impression that you'll be saying more any moment. <br />
13. Disassemble your pen and &quot;accidently&quot; flip the ink cartridge across the room. <br />
14. Give a play-by-play account of a person's every action in a nasal Murray Walker voice. <br />
15. Specify that your drive-through order is &quot;to go&quot;. <br />
16. Learn Morse code, and have conversations with friends in public consisting entirely of &quot;Beeeep Bip Bip Beeeep Bip...&quot; <br />
17. If you have a glass eye, tap on it occasionally with your pen while talking to others. <br />
18. Start each meal by conspicuously licking all your food, and announce that this is so no one will &quot;swipe your grub&quot;. <br />
19. Leave the copy machine set to reduce 200%, extra dark, 17 inch paper,99 copies. <br />
20. Leave your turn signal on for fifty miles. <br />
21. Name your dog &quot;Dog&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think perhaps I finally worked out why Raych would marry you Nin.<br />
<br />
Has she got you to sign any pre-nuptual agreements wherein all your stuff becomes hers in the event of death?<br />
<br />
How many Life insurance policies has she made you fill out so far?<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ninamwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm not allowed to discuss these matters as per agreement 4, subsection 3, paragraph 1.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Y'know i don't think I could marry a ranger for much the same reason I wouldn't want a hamster as a pet. The idea of investing that much emotion and love into something that drops dead if you just glance at them wrong just seems like a recipe for getting hurt....<br />
<br />

Val</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">OMG!! O_O ROFLMFAO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ninamwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">For a Ranger I don't die that often as it happens!  Unless a certain warrior guides her group down the wrong area and kills everyone  :P<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Okay that does it! Who's up for a game of PUNT the ranger?!?!<br />

<br />
*grovels for forgiveness before Raychael*  It's these other warriors, they're trying to turn me against you sweetie!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">are you sure he's not a warrior Raych? He has the right &quot;get beaten flat and come back for seconds&quot; type of attitude :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">He played one once but his urges to hug trees overcame him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Oh i see, a herbisexual eh. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Pretty puppy!! *bounces around*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ninamwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I've played almost all classes but a Ranger was my first character and my current highest character at 56.  I had to delete my warrior to make the Shammy Raychie, the Shammy that is going to partner your warrior (that I'm also playing! lol) remember?  :P  So technically, I am playing a warrior and doing a good job of it  *nods*  I can hold aggro just great!!  ..... 'cause I'm soloing mostly  &gt;_&gt;  But!  I can tank well.<br />
<br />
Other classes I've played.... druid (relegated to mule), bard (too much lag to make it worthwhile plus I chat too much), monk (fun but gets boring pulling constantly), rogue (got bored), wizard (NUKAGE!!!), beastlord (good but pretty much a shaman wannabe), cleric (for when I feel too lazy to do much), necromancer (I'm not group friendly, good class for me to play) and shaman.</div></div><hr />
