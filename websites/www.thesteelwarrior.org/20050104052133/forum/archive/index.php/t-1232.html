<br />
I recently upgraded my haste item from RBG to CoF.  I went from using RBG/Malestrome to Putrid Hide Belt/CoF.  <br />
<br />
The Putrid belt I already had in the bank and the CoF pretty much took all the cash I had.  <br />
<br />
I would like to get a belt upgrade with some better AC w/o losing to much HP.  So far all I can come up with is Heavy Rubicite Girdle but thats like 50k on my server :(  <br />
<br />
Would appreciate any suggestions for upgrade that can be obtained by 1 60+ group :)  or that is &lt; 20k :(<br />
<br />
Click on the sexy Barb Warrior for magelo :)<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trust me I would love too but on my server that camp as well as a few others in CT are perma camped 24/7 by the same group of characters and have been for at least a month.  I suspect Ebay is at work here :(<br />
<br />
But I will keep trying :)</div></div><hr />
