<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went over to Everquest.com to check out the developers corner to see if any cool war stuff was upcoming for future updates (basically, no there isn't if you are wondering and noticed there was a cool class page with descriptions from the origin of our game.  It is here:<br />
<br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp<br />
<br />
Just for the heck of it I thought I would cut and paste the descriptions...<br />
<br />
WARRIOR <br />
<br />
Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.<br />
<br />
<br />
PALADIN <br />
<br />
Paladins are holy warriors who use blessed spells and strength of arms to fight the evil and undead of Norrath. Paladins are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<br />
<br />
Paladins are able fighters and battlefield healers whose combat spells focus on stunning enemies and smiting undead. They also have several spells that increase the health and armor of their allies. Every so often, paladins can lay hands on themselves or their friends to instantly grant a powerful heal.<br />
<br />
Paladins are the greatest force against undead. At higher levels they gain special abilities to smite these foes. Paladins also gain a limited ability to resurrect their fallen friends with lessened penalties for death.<br />
<br />
Paladins can sometimes work alone, healing themselves with magic, but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal. Players who like to engage in melee fights but want the options spells provide will find paladins a great class to play.<br />

comment: what the fuck happened to that plan?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this is true it is*yoda*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">true, this is *better yoda*<br />
<br />
Actually, haven't the descriptions been updated? When i first started I'm sure there was an even more 'warriors are cool' spin to it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">fo shizzle *best yoda*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, originally the class descriptions did indeed have a more &quot;warriors are cool&quot; spin to them....of course, at that time we were relatively cool.  We just got left behind, and rather than fix that they just changed the description a bit.   Damn them.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i remember being cool when there were 100+ people waiting to join a group in Lower Guk :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Selaradrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I brought this class decription thing up on the PON boards 1 day in responce to an idiot claiming that paladins were supposed to be lords and therefore the best melee fighters in the game. he went on to propose that SOE needs to move knights well above warriors, nerf warriors then make a rule where if a pally (good) groups with an evil toon, he loses his gods blessings and gets lowered to a warrior for the rest of the time he is grouped...<br />
<br />
so&lt; i responded by posting that exact class description...well Holy shit did i get flamed!  they did NOT want to hear that warriors were designed to be the tank class. even though it is spelled out quite clearly...(at least IMO)<br />
<br />
just goes to prove, knights are desperatly trying to avoid the nerf bat, which in itself proves how bad the situation has become.  personally I dont think they have anythign to worry about however, i have given up any hope that SOE will ever do anything to fix this...<br />
<br />
welcome my new main character, a lvl 13 rogue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;welcome my new main character, a lvl 13 rogue&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear that Selar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well.......at least you're not a Paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually Selaradrid, they got pissy because you said that the class description implied that paladins shouldn't be tanks, which I think it pretty obviously not the case (unless you are using a very different definition of &quot;going head to head with his enemies&quot; than I am), and I think they were pretty rightly defensive about that. You saying &quot;I intepret this to mean, warriors were supposed to be the only tanks.&quot; is pretty obviously inflammatory.<br />
<br />
The part that is depressing about the description is<br />
<br />
Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Which evidently the devs have forgotten about :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">there whole crap is &quot;warriors shouldnt be able to control a level 65 mob&quot; erm we are 65 to whats the big deal? i still think im a threat, id still slap any cocky pally weather they ment to taunt or not. damn it dev team WAKE THE HELL UP dont tell us we are gona get a cruise liner and then give us a paddle boat, WTF were ya thinking?</div></div><hr />
