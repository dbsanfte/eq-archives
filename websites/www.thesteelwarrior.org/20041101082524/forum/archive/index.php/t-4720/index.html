<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone got this, and is it worth it?<br />
Couldnt find posts about it here, if its been discussed please post the link.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The lifetap proc augment?<br />
<br />
Yeah it's worth it. It taps life and you get hit points back.<br />
<br />
It's NOT an aggro proc.<br />
<br />
But it's useful. I know a couple of people who have it, and a lot more who have the cheaper version. It's not too popular among warriors since they usually save their points for hate procs, like Anger or Ykesha.<br />
<br />
I guess to better answer your question, I'd have to ask two questions of my own:<br />
<br />
What were you looking to put it on? <br />
<br />
What type of use are you hoping to get out of it?<br />
<br />
If you're looking for some added DPS and some extra HPs recovered while fighting/tanking mobs then yeah, I think you'll find it useful and worth the points.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for an aggro boost, lifetaps probably aren't the best place to start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nordicsan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got the cheaper one for my non agro main hander and it really doesn't do me much service in the elemental zones atm.  The AE and damage taken from these mobs pushed me away from the life tap augs.  I proc often enough but 50-100hp doesn't help me all that much at 9k+ hp.  I might get back 100hp per reg mob and 1k on a big mob on raids...  It's more of a utility aug for me atm... duels etc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It sucks and I regret buying it for my BBotE. It's just not warriorish. You'd be better off with the poison proc from EC if you want utility.</div></div><hr />
