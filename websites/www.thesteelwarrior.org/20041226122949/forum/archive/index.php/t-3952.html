<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyxander</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't gained any tradeskills with my warrior, (aside from incidental fletching from producing my own arrows) and as far as tradeskills go, blacksmithing is the ideal warrior tradeskill.<br />
<br />
Well, I don't know much about tradeskills, but I do know they get expensive real fast.  *Especially* smithing.<br />
<br />
But my question is this.  How expensive?  How much PP should I have put away before I start trying to smith?  I don't expect to be a grandmaster overnight, (or even anytime soon) but I would like to smith for a nice long stretch, and maybe hit some level of usefulness (at least the ability to produce some kind of armor that would replace my random brigandine bits)<br />
<br />
So, my question is two-fold.<br />
<br />
1) How much smithing does one need to make decent armor for a mid 20's warrior?<br />
2) How much PP will it cost me (order of magnitude is fine) to get that far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Smithing will almost always be cheaper to buy from someone else than to skill up and make the item yourself.<br />
<br />
Right now, you would be looking at the LDoN armor, which is about a 175 to 210 skill item.  Costs a smith of that skill about 100 to 150p to make a piece of that armor.  Probably sells for cost plus 10 to 40 percent. (currently I sell my wifes skillup goods at about cost).<br />
<br />
To get to 175 (where fine steel plate maxes out) would cost... maybe 5k?  Maybe more?  Then factor in all the leather padding you farm yourself you could have sold to make money, and then you are looking at a higher opportunity cost.<br />
<br />
If you are interested, www.eqtraders.com is a more fleshed out site for this sort of information.<br />
<br />
Oh, second side note.  If you arnt hitting 255 str with focus, I would advise putting off smithing for a while.  Doing skillups without a max stat is like tanking with a few armor pieces missing.  You can do it, but its not the best way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hit 175 with banded before they nerfed smithing (back when fine plate bps trivialed 200s, now 188).  The main cost in smithing is the leather paddings.  Back at level 30s that meant spending hours on end killing spiders in East Karanas.  Now i just buy them at 30pp each / 600pp per stack from the bazaar. <br />
<br />
 I still remember, i trivialed on banded mails (breastplate) 175, at about 600pp total in costs from skill of 1... my STR was like 130 back then  :(<br />
<br />
However, once fine plate started it went much higher, ie the molds are 22pp for bps, and about 20pp for each block of ore which are smithed to MQ folded sheet metals (need 3 for bps), and leather paddings are tedious to farm specially since everyone is in EK farming them as well (quality pelts, silk swatches)... I get 82pp back after the combines, then theres failures... (OUCH)  I would think its better to get the pp, then buy the leather paddings, but at the much lower levels you would save a LOT if you famed the leather paddings yourself.  If you got 5k on you, then you got enough to start on some fine plate batches of skill ups from skill of 1 (wont happen overnight) to reach 180-190s... it would help if you had high charisma and faction however to make more of your hard earned pp back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyxander</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you both for your input.  It looks like smithing is not the path for me, if I need to find 5-6k to do it, not to mention maxing out my strength at 255.<br />
<br />
My strength maxes out at about 180 with buffs readily available to me, and I don't think I've ever had much more than 320pp available at a time.<br />
<br />
I never thought that tradeskilling would be more cost effective than buying the pieces, but I thought learning the skill, and having it to provide to my friends and guildmates would be fun.  However from these pieces of advice it sounds like I am unlikely to enjoy it for a couple of reasons.<br />
<br />
1) Needing an absurd strength, which I don't have<br />
2) Needing about 5-6k, which I don't have<br />
3) Camping monsters for hours on end, competing with farmers doing the same thing, which I don't want to do.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input, I guess it's back to saving up for Crusty armor pieces, and leaving the tradeskilling to the experts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you like the idea of being a smith, by all means do it.<br />
<br />
I started smithing at level 7, way before I knew anything about the game.  It was important to me for role-play reasons, and as soon as I realized there was a smithing skill I started to learn it.<br />
<br />
At 26th level, there is no reason you can't get your smithing well over 100 for a relatively small amount of plat.  Once you get around 120 it starts to get a bit more expensive, but you will have access to more cash as you level.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there is not much profit to be made in low level smithing, and even GM level smithing is a saturated market nowadays.  But if you fancy yourself a smith, you can do it steadily, and for the most part cheaply, if you are not in a hurry.<br />
<br />
Go to www.eqtraders.com and look at the message boards there.  On the smithing board is a thread called The Economical Smith, that gives tips for folks like you who want to smith on a budget.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, by all means do get into it if you are looking for a diversion.  The levels where it will start being expensive are after banded trivals.  Do up to maybe 100 skill or so, and then look at the paths you have to take to get more skill ups and evailuate.  The advice we were giving was based on a skill post banded, which is an exponential cost increase.<br />
<br />
Additionally, mid level tradeskills are a good moneymaker.  If you can do sub combines for brewing, tailoring, smithing, etc, you can make things like leather padding and sell them to others, and make money off of it.  For someone who doesnt have much money at all, this is an excellent way to afford mid level upgrades in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

Furthermore, you're not going to be able to get it over 200 easily, which is when you can start making things of actual value.  There's not many methods available to skill up past 200, and all of them are ridiculously time consuming and expensive.  Basically like everyone else said..if you've got a million plat sitting around and just want to be a GM smith, well then, go for it.  Otherwise, it's just gonna be cheaper to buy what you need.</div></div><hr />

I went from 0-188 smithing a couple of hours ago. It cost about 10k plat and 3 hours, but that was with me buying leather paddings from bazaar at 25 plat each.<br />
<br />
188-250 is a significant stumbling block though, filthy gougers on my server want 300plat for ldon tempers, 100plat for windstones and there is zero chance of me every attempting for farm the parts for shadowscream. <br />

I didn't realize the smithing nerf hit that hard. I skilled up to 175 making banded pre-nerf.  Took about 2kpp to do it. (Barbarian with no cha buffs).   Looks like that's probably about as far as I'll go since I don't have the ridiculous amounts of cash to buy components now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It cost me a ton to get smithing up to 220, I was buying all the parts from people though and just combining.  So 50pp per shadow, 200 per humming orb, which is about 300pp per comine, I am guessing I have 300k into it at 228 skill, I would of maxed it already but I have a 10% modifier belt and am too lazy to get more orbs.  It is my only unmaxed skill however, so maybe I will do it some time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can easily sink 300k plus trying to make grandmaster. Unless you have useful cultural you won't even make much in the way of useful stuff to sell to defray those costs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuchulainn2</div><div class="date">11-01-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. You don't need anything more than Luclin expansion to get the leather padding as much as you need or want. Rockhoppers (DSP/Maurus Seru) drop LQ skin, and you can collect shadeling silk thread from shadeweaver thicket. <br />
<br />
2. Once you're done with fine steel stuff (188) you can hop over to the Shadowscream armor line. Yes, farming the items will suck, yet again. Still, you can get your smithing skill well over 220 with this. (244 with Shadowscream tunic)<br />
<br />
3. Also, don't forget this: If you can get your hand on XtC smithing hammer, you just need to get your smithing skill up to 220 (15% up, thus you should hit over the max mark with 220) and even if you don't have any access to such a fine tool, you still have a gearlock, which upgrades your smithing skill by 5% - in which case, you only need to hit 239, not 244.</div></div><hr />

Best is to do EC advs and ask ML to keep all goblin bones for u. Im easily getting 10 each mission, so u are farming (other stuff is vendor sold), while getting adv points and exp (really rare when talking about smithnig) ;)</div></div><hr />

after fine plate there is LDoN smithing which will get you up to 212... saves you some shadowscream trivials.  From a normal adventure I would see ~5 temper items however... :(.  But most people sell these items to NPCs as they have no idea that its for high end smithing.<br />
<br />
nothing much changes other than you dont need Leather Paddings, you use Superb Leather Paddings which are easily bought in PoK from Vendors.  As far as tempers go... i have had absolutely no problems with people in my groups allowing me to have the temper items:<br />
<br />
MQ Folded Sheet(s) <br />
Plate (armor piece) Mold <br />
Superb Leather Padding <br />
Smithy Hammer <br />
Flask of Water <br />
Temper (Sand, Bone, Gargoyle, Swamp, or Lichen) - from LDoN adventures<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GokouSan</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Smithing is very easy to max out and really doesn't require that much plat unless you're going for a 100% store bought route. LDoN stuff is fine, but if I were you, I'd do some shadowscream.  You actually make money off doing combines and just selling to venders.<br />
<br />
Since hollowshade is fixed, this is very doable.  if you have rampage, it's even more doable since you can clear all the south islands in about 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Lots of new recipes as well...think raaj said something about a 2 small piece of velium, coldain velium temper, enchant velium recipe.  It's like 100 plat a combine, but trivials somewhere around 226.  Lots and lots of shortcuts though...like the ethereal sheets, grimel bp cleaning, etc.  All in all, I think I spent maybe 30k to get my smithing all the way to 250 (did alot of sickles at the end cause LoY was coming out and I knew frogs would want solstice earrings).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">grimel bp cleaning <br />
<br />
is this the signet earring quests?  I remember asking myself If I could get skill ups on this... is it possible?  Just recently got Bertox flag and got gauntlets with 15% to blacksmithing.  Would highly appreciate the infos and your trade secrets!</div></div><hr />

I personally haven't heard of anyone who has hit 250 smithing after the smithing uhh...&quot;Nerf.&quot;  You can get your smithing up to a level where you can make some things, like fine plate and banded and shit, but it's cheaper to buy it from other people.

<br />
I finished 250 and trophy in smithing after the nerf if you mean the major one that took place before LDoN came out.  It was a pain in the butt so I picked the least painful road but most expensive one to go.<br />
<br />
I made mistletoe sickle cutters from 200 to 250.  It took 250k starting bank which by the end I got back and most of the plat I make from my 4 GM's in my 4 tradeskills is from Smithing.<br />
<br />
But then again listen to the above wisdom in the quote above.  Don't attempt this unless you have the plat to do it or you want to take the slow long road starting with shadowscream armor.  After you are done with that route we will personally commit you to the EQ tradeskiller's asylum for the insane (hint 1 skill up per every 50 pieces of successful shadowscream armor).<br />
<br />
If you just want to tweak this and that character out then buy it.  For that same 250k you could really tweak out several level 20 characters.<br />
<br />
And yes there are some LDoN recipies that can help you get through smithing now to make it a bit easier for future GM Smiths.<br />
<br />
On a side note:  I make around 100k a week with my smithing skills when I really want to work at it so you can make plat later on if you decide to become a GM in smithing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, some people do manage to get to 250, I know one person who has done it.  I'm at 207 myself.<br />
<br />
First off, consider those people who sell leather padding for 30p a whack.  All it takes to make padding is 35 tailoring skill, and farming time.  If you are willing to spend the time, this could be a source of income for you.  Get a large tailoring kit and make yourself a skinning knife.  Then go to east karana and kill lions.  Combine HQ and MQ pelts in the kit with the knife to make LQ pelts (it's the only source of LQ pelts I know, never seen a LQ pelt actually drop anywhere).  When you have a few stacks, go to ferrott, to the NE corner of the zone.  Be careful of bouncers on the way there, but once you get there the corner is safe.  Kill the spiderlings for spiderling silks.  They drop a number of different types of silk, which is annoying, but this is the best place to farm them.  There are actually 2 areas of spiderlings, one in the NE corner, and one just south of the druid circle, a good zone map will come in handy.  Combine 3 silks I think to make a thread, then combine thread and pelt to make 1 pad.  At 25p a pop, 3 stacks would make you 1500p, a nice windfall if the most plat you've ever had is 320.  Do this a few times and you will have plenty of plat to buy smithing components such as blocks of ore and molds.  If you are patient, you can improve your gear as well.<br />
<br />
Getting smithing over 100 isn't too hard or costly, banded armor goes up to 115 or so.  After that you have to make ornate chain for a while, which requires bars of precious metals, the same ones jewelers use.  Generally you can sell back what you make to a vendor for 75-80% of what it cost to make it, it's failures that really hurt the pocketbook.  I strongly recommend buying 2 opal encrusted steins (+25 chr each) to use when dealing with vendors.  You can generally get them from someone in the bazaar for 50p each or so.  Also, a geerlok automated hammer is a must.  This will boost your skill a bit, which helps cut down on failures.<br />
<br />
The reason people say to raise your str is that it improves your chance to gain a skill point.  It's actually the difference between your str and your skill level that determines your chance to gain a skill point.  For example, if your str is 180 and your skill is 105, the difference is 75.  As you gain skill the difference lessens, and the chance to gain a skillup drops as well.  There are &quot;break points&quot; in this progression, points where if you gain 1 more point you will notice that your skillup rate has suddenly dropped.  If you then gain more str you will again skill up more easily, until you hit the break point again.  Obviously, if your chance to gain a skill point drops, it takes a lot more combines to gain each point on average, and it costs more plat, so maxxing out your str helps reduce your time farming and combining, and the amount of plat you spend.<br />
<br />
Once you finish ornate chain (the gold tunic trivials at 155, don't bother with the platinum ornate, failures are too expensive) you move on to fine steel (bracers first).  Here is where you need all that leather padding, one pad per combine.  If you buy the padding from players it will add a lot to the cost of gaining skill.  Not counting padding, you can make FS items for 10-15p per combine after selling the results back to a vendor (averaging in failures).  If it's taking you 10 combines to gain a skill point, then you can see that it's costing you 100-150p per skill point.  You will make FS items from 155 to 188, or 33 skill points.<br />
<br />
From 188 to 212 you can make ldon armor fairly cheaply if you farm your own temper components.  The best source is goblin bones, in the ruj dungeons, getting 4-5 of these per mission is about the norm.  The superb padding you need is sold in pok, 25p each.<br />
<br />
The other option is to make shadowscream armor, which requires you to do the progressive smithing quest in shar val, which took me about 8 hours.  After that you do a lot of farming in hollowshade moor and in twilight sea.  There is a pretty good writeup on this on eq traders.  It can be found here:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g99&amp;menustr=040100000000<br />
<br />
There are a few mistakes in the article about the HS war.  To start, the sonic wolves start in the east, and the owl bears in the NW.  Second, killing the named of a race will often cause another race to launch an attack upon them.  Third, I've farmed the zone a lot, and I haven't had any trouble with the war getting bugged.  Fourth, you don't really need to &quot;manage&quot; the war once it starts, you won't care if bears or wolves have the south islands as you need substances from each.  As you farm it, from time to time the islands will change hands from bears to wolves and back, this is fine.  If the bears or wolves completely take over the zone, the merchant camp near the entrance to shar val is taken over by a boss bear or wolf, killing them will reset the zone.  The boss bear drops a FT1 range item which is nice for casters, I'm not sure what the boss wolf drops.<br />
<br />
Also, swirling shadows are no longer NO RENT.  They are also tradable, and sell well in the bazaar, if you want another source of income.  The shades are a bit tougher than bears and wolves though.  If you have a group, they are probably decent enough XP for someone in their 30s.<br />
<br />
To start the war, kill the grimling boss in the south.  Then kill the grimling defenders that pop when the war starts, so the attack force (bears or wolves) can get into the boss tent.  When this happens all the grimlings will depop and be replaced by bears or wolves.  Once you get teh war started, you don't really care too much if wolves or bears have the south islands, you need to farm them both for substances.  Generally you will get 1 drop per 6-8 kills.  Typically I 2-box this with my cleric and warrior.  I set my cleric up with point blank AE spells (yes, clerics get a few).  I then run around with the warrior and aggro a lot of mobs.  Levitate and sow can help here, because some of the wolves and bears are fast.  When you start getting a lot of mobs chasing you, if they surround you they can make a scrum pile with you in the middle, which will keep you from moving.  Generally once I get 40-50 mobs chasing me I run to the cleric and AE them. Typically I'll get 5-8 drops per train, 40-50 substances an hour.  It actually takes as much time to clear all the corpses as it does to pull and kill them, the owls and bears drop a lot of shit, although perfect owlbear pelts are useful for making a weight reduction bag.<br />

Shadowscream armor is actually REALLY CHEAP to make, it costs like 2p per combine because the only things you have to buy are flasks of water and ore to make metal rings, and banded molds.  You do have to do a lot of farming, which is easiest to do at high level when all the mobs are green to you.  If paying 25p per superb pad is more than you want to spend, then you can just go make shadowscream instead.  Actually, you could probably make SS armor instead of fine steel, and save yourself 5k plat, although you will end up farming more.</div></div><hr />

is this the signet earring quests?  I remember asking myself If I could get skill ups on this... is it possible?  Just recently got Bertox flag and got gauntlets with 15% to blacksmithing.  Would highly appreciate the infos and your trade secrets!  <br />

It's easily the cheapest method, but only really viable on time if you're a gater with 1 mag, or a non-gater with 2 mages to CoH back and forth. Otherwise you'll spend all your time running back and forth and waiting on the elevator</div></div><hr />

I actually turn a  profit making it (about 50pp per stack of combines).  It all falls back to the tradeskill equillibrium that you either sacrifice time to lower cost or sacrifice cost to lower time. <br />
<br />
Swirling Shadows has always been the bottleneck in farming Shadowscream combines for me (I clear the shadows in twilight about twice as fast as they spawn so sit around being non-productive most of the time), but they sell for about 30-50pp each on my server which is too cost prohibitive imo.</div></div><hr />

I'm stalled out at 195, and as an agnostic ogre, I can't see there's any point for me in smithing anymore. I still do it everything and then as a break in the action, but it's a joke the way SoE screws agnostics.</div></div><hr />
