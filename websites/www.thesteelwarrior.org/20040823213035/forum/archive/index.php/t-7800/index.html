<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We took RZtW on basically our first attempt.  We had two wipes as we ran the script but managed to move farther along on each.  This is the first time our guild has gone against him.  He didn't drop a BoW but then I really didn't expect him to.  All in all it was a good run.  Once I got aggro on him, I didn't pay attention to anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats on RZ, its a really fun script that can get really hated if you mess up. BoW drops are way streaky, RZ on the nameless had a streak of like 8 kills by various guilds where no BoW dropped. I also know of a guild that has 3 BoWs after their only two kills. /shrug.<br />
<br />
On another note, checking your magelo, please tell me you dont have the CHSD mainhanded over the GBoS in game? If so, change it, the GBoS does superior damage and also is better aggro since the procs are around the same hate, but dps is in favor of GBoS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grats =)  I really love the ole RZtW script!  Its fun to me.  Still the most adrenaline pumping event at the early elemental level.</div></div><hr />
