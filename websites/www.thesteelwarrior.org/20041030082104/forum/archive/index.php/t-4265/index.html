<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raagag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Up to now my warrior I have been able to get by on my warrior just picking up a few cheap upgrades.<br />
<br />
I am getting to the point my lack of ac/hp will start to show so I'm wondering what I should be looking at next in terms of weapons and armour.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of CHoS next for an off hander although my 1hb is a bit lower skill wise than 1hs/pierceing.  And possibly going back to skyfire to farm more essence of sunlight to at least get a few more pieces of fierce heraldic.<br />
<br />
<br />
My main char is a 65 druid, vt/elemental flagged.  I know all about thurg, skyshrine then ornate and elemental armours.  But I'm not sure what I can pickup either myself soloing, or what good bargains I should look out for in the bazaar.  Im a poor atm having bought my last spells for my druid can probably put about 20k aside for upgrades atm, I dont need to spend anymore cash on the druid now, so ill probably get a bit more cash pretty soon.<br />
<br />
The warrior is on the same account as the druid, but I do have a level 50 cleric hydra, the aim being to play the cleric and either the druid or warrior at some point in the future depending on what is needed.  Any tips would be apprechiated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm gonna try to hazard a few possible upgrades for you (dependant on your server's bazaar prices).<br />
<br />
Earring: Vah Shir Claw Earring x 1 (300pp?)<br />
Neck: Clattering Bone Necklace (2k?)<br />
Finger: Valorium Ring of Gallantry (if bazaar prices are kind)<br />
Shoulder: Barbed Dragonscale Pauldrons (2k - 4k?)<br />
Belt: Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide (2k - 5k?)<br />
Primary: Copper Hammer of Striking (pricing is erratic here - 10k to 40k)<br />
Secondary: Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
Range: Idol of the Thorned (if you don't mind swapping)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get more of the fierce Heraldic Armor as you go along the road, start by replacing the worst spots first, get a Great Staff of Thunder at level 55, and keep levelling.<br />
<br />
A full set of Fierce Heraldic at level 60+ isn't unusual and will get you by just fine.<br />
Might wanna try and get your hands on a good haste item once you pass mid-50's, like Cloak of Flames or better.<br />
<br />
Basically, your equipment aint bad, you need levels right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit :<br />
Oh, and I'm terrible with prices on stuffs, but a Frostbringer might be easy to get and I think gives better aggro than the Venemous axe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raagag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I looked at a greatstaff of thunder in the bazaar the other day.  They were selling so cheap I dismissed them as, must be rubbish at that price (100-500pp).<br />
<br />
CHoS is selling for around the 15-20k mark.  I'm thinking I can maybe solo the king with my druid to save paying, if its not camped permanantly.  I did buy the bloodsworn before I knew about the camp.<br />
<br />
I looked up frostbringer 7kish, snowchipper 1500, wavecrasher 7kish.  I remember once seeing a table of how weapon procs compared in terms of hate.  i think it was on this site somewhere.  Could anyone point me to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get the GSoT, you won't regret it.  I also bought the CHoS/SoBS combo to play with and I've found cases where the combo works better than the GSoT...but in most cases the GSoT is equally or more effective at holding agro for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Great Staff of Thunder is cheap because there too much supply for the demand, NOT because it's not a good weapon.<br />
<br />
In fact, it's an excellent weapon and it used to sell for 20k+ until SOE upped the droprate a lot and made the zone it drops in open for people without having to flag first.<br />
<br />
Not to mention it has a Required level of 55 and it is Warrior only, that really drives down the price because it's no good for a twink. Sorta like that Necromancer bone thing for the Ranged slot that dropd in PoN .. or the Ranger Necklace. They sell for what .. all of 25 pp ?<br />
<br />
They aint bad, they are just cheap. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd say get a SoTB, CHoS, and GSOT, if you need more aggro than those give, aug one or more of them with ykesha or anger. If you need more aggro than those give you, your group sucks. :)  Wish I could access magelo at work, but since I can't, I'll just guess from what I've seen in other post.  Bloodmetal earrings and mosquito leg earrings are both damned good, and it sounds like they might be upgrades to what you have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get slots with +HP's...<br />
<br />
Electrum Black Sapphire Earrings 2AC 35 HP's.  Also a solstice earrings should be cheaply purchased.  avoid all SS armor except the gaunts (90hps).  For shoulders Mantle of Ill omen 5STA and 35hps.  Since yer rallos, all your visible slots can be best filled with FH armor.</div></div><hr />
