<br />
Been a member for awhile but post intermittently.  But, I have run into something tonight that seemed very off.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had trouble with mitigation in the Tipt trial?  My stats are below.<br />
<br />
I was buffed to right around 10K.  I was buffed to 1844 AC.  Was dual wielding.  I have ID5, LR5, RM5, and DI1.<br />
<br />
These mobs were eating right through me.  The Enraged Maternal Mother hit me for 2020.<br />
<br />
This just doesn't seem right to me.  Any thoughts?  Do these all mitigate slow or something every time?<br />
<br />

<br />
Edit: My magelo is a little out of date.  So, don't look at it and go by it.  Go by the numbers above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say at that level, your just about right for tipt, but its not gonna be a walk in the park.</div></div><hr />

Lately tho we just have the charmed enchanter pet tank it solo.  Your hp/ac is just right for tanking tipt.</div></div><hr />

The time I went through without using a charmed pet (or was it twice that way) she was hitting me for around 1k with defensive on, and about 2k or so a swing without defensive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah using a charmed pet to straight up kill the maternal is best bet. The names are all pipe hitters so the more time you don't have to take their dmg the better=0.</div></div><hr />

pipe hitters rofl thats a good one..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GoD named are just messed up, when I did Vxed for my epic we had that named Pooka spawn, he was a blue con at lvl 70. I never need to use disc on any of the red con single group named in MPG or RS so I  figured I'd try him without defensive. I had barely enough time to hit furious to surive the unslowed onslaught of that blue Pooka. Bad case of underestimating there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well lets not forget, GoD was designed for level 70s :p And it turns out...at 70...they're just as bad as when you went in at 65. I went in at 68 thinking it would be relatively easy and Umbiki changed my perspective by turning me into a barbarian meat pie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tipt mobs are still pretty tough.  There is a very noticeable difference between 65 and 70, but Tipt is still not a pushover at 70, and those mobs would whip MPG stuff that is several levels higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd pit a tipt trash mob against two MPG nameds and expect it to kill at least one of them, and probably almost (or get) the other. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using chanter pet in Tipt will help alot.<br />
<br />
Never used one to tank, but there DPS is so insane, mob dies faster, so healer needs to heal less.<br />
<br />
For the maternal, rush when chanter sicks pet (can get him on rampage), rush to spawn hit furious.  By time furious is worn off she should be dead, or just about.<br />
<br />
Haven't done Tipt 66+, at your HP/AC shouldn't have a problem with simular geared group.  If you do have trouble, grab a druid and cleric.</div></div><hr />
