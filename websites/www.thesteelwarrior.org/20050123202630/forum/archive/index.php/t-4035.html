I have 10,000pp, and need advice on where to spend it.  If you know of anything easily campable by a 64 druid, 60 warrior and 61 enchanter(and a few random low 50s) that would be an upgrade, I might be able to do that as well.  Obviously in a small guild so nothing too big.<br />

I do not yet have the faction for draconic pauldrons.  I need to get it, i know...in addition the armor dropped could help a few weak points.  I have gone with guildmates to droga twice now just to see what the zone was like.  Second time there we killed all along the way to the king room, so by the time we got there a ranger needed to log and we couldnt camp it.  Tried going down with invis first time and had two people die because they didnt pay attention to their invis breaking message I guess.  Anyhow, I think i will get these two weapons in the near future.  Just wondering what you think I should be working on after I get them.<br />

Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

Try to see if there is a Human or Ogre GM smith that is willing to work deals. I see that you have put some work into smithing so you can hopefully do the subcombines. If you camp the items necessary that will stretch your cash even farther. Another thing to look at is maybe replacing your rings with Valorium Rings of Gallantry. They are coming down in price and should last ya a long time.</div></div><hr />
