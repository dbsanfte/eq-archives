<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghazad</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys<br />
<br />
I have this gear http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79331<br />
<br />
I have around 65 k pp<br />
<br />
Basicly I feel pretty set on armor for the time being and have a Windblade for DPS. What I need is agro weapon(s). <br />
<br />
I have been considering buying a Greatstaff of Thunder to try it out but they are rarely for sale on my server. <br />
<br />
I have also considered SboZ/FB or Wavecrasher/FB. There is also the playermade yaks out there.<br />
<br />
Sigh - It's really hard to decide what to get. I want the best agro I can get while hopefully maintaining decent DPS. I hate pressing the taunt button over and over when grouped with some uber rogue so I need a really high agro setup for my pp and there is so much to choose from.<br />
<br />
I want a long term solution because I ain't really guilded and I won't see another 65 k pp anytime soon. I really dislike stalking the bazaar for hours so choosing wrong now and having to resell and aquire new weapons later would suck.<br />
<br />
Someone give me advice please?<br />
<br />
(and yes, I have read the sticky about agro weapons) :-)<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch,<br />
<br />

IMO stay with the Windblade until you see a GoT and nab it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghazad</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it is obvious that the Greatstaff of Thunder is better DPS than Wavecrasher/FB is it really better agro?<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have a feeling that they are gonna nerf the Greatstaff of Thunder, either in dmg/dly or procrate?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I haven't used WC/FB together, but they're generally held to be less agro than these.</div></div><hr />
