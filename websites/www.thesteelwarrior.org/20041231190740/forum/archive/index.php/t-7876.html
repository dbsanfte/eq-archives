<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korx</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure out how to build up skills with weapons I don't use so much right now.  Currently I use pierce, 1h blunt and slash a lot (plus archery) so they stay class maxed, or close to it, for my level but 2h blunt is 0.  2h slash is like 42 and if I use these low skill weapons in group &quot;to build my skills with them&quot;, my group ends up having to pay for my learning time and that is a bogus way to treat a group IMO.<br />
<br />
I have several chars (as many do).  My Ranger, I took soloing using fear kiting to build his weapons skills up but a warrior...  Isn't so hot at soloing unless you have a few hundred k plat around to gear up with regen gear (fungi and the like) so building skills with &quot;off&quot; weapons is a bit trickier....<br />
<br />
My warrior is only 34th level now but I'd like to build his skills and keep them good but I don't know where or how to do this with reasonable chances of success.  Anyone have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

But at 40-50 your skills caps don't increase, so though that period you can play catch up. I would not worry too much about using a low skill weapon in a group, just be ready to swap back to you best weapon if things shoudl get interesting. <br />
<br />
And theoretically, its the swings, not that damage that earns agro, so you should not be impaired in your agro generation. ONce you are into your 50s you shoudl max fairly easily...and the differance between a 0 and 200 is far bigger (and more noticable) than the differance  between 200 and 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got myself Caretakers shovel (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16301) from katta, at least the dmg on it is not pitifull, could be better though, but it's fast for a 2hb so should help skill ups, used my 45 mage to kill the mob, he is in the 30's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you hit 40, as stated above, I would go to zones I hunt in and just ask random groups if they minded me adding some dps to their kills, outside the group. Most people are more than happy to allow this. You help them, they help you, but they are not depending on you as their &quot;tank&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Take a few days and just go work on skills not in group. It may seem like a waste but it achieves your goal in a day or 2 rather than slowly over months of using a weapon for 10 minutes here and there in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Semp</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually what Grundle said is one of the best ideas...<br />
As random groups in zones that you would like to exp in anyways if you can practice your weapon skills on their mobs... everybody wins!<br />
<br />
Looks like this...<br />
/lfg on<br />
/say hey guys mind if i work on my weapon skills while lfg?<br />
/say sure thing partner<br />
/say gee wizz mister, thanks &lt;throw in good old gay punch, beaver style&gt;<br />
***15 minutes of swinging***<br />
/gsay hey guys i have to head out, know any tanks that can rep me?<br />
/gsay what about this guy thats been sitting here adding to our dps enabling us to exp faster?<br />
/gsay sure sounds like a plan to me<br />
/say would you like to join our group?<br />
/say leave me alone, I'm trying to dig holes through mobs with my shovel!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used Brudal's method also for weapons and archery skills. Get hasted and find the fastest cheapest weapons you can (borrowing from a guildie or friend works too). Most groups are more than happy to have you add to their DPS as long as you're polite and consistently assist their MT. Once you're maxxed for your level, do this once every 3 lvls or so for a few minutes and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
If you want to max out Bind Wound, find a druid to DoT you alot for a few hours.and bind away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jakazzx</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have gimped my way into many pov kite groups by lvling weapon skills on their mobs for like 20-40 minutes then they invite me :P  got me from 61-62 just doing this and i caught up almost all of my weapon skills...<br />
<br />
BoT hub is my fave for archery lvling cuz i can stand in the corner and just click away.  another good spot is in poi if ur looking for some superconductive wires, just /ooc u wanna loot em if theres extras, and help the peeps out with dps: )</div></div><hr />
