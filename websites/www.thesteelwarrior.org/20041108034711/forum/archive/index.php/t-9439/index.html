<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Agaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was browsing lucy today and saw 2 discs that i didnt recognize. they are the slice disc and the 5200 strike series discs. does anyone know how i can obtain/activate these discs, as there doesnt seem to be a tome for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They were from the melee combat system that SOE scrapped. They're inactive now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What did SoE do to make up for that by the way? I mean, they realized clearly that melee needed a boost, then decided that the boost they were going to give us was slightly too good. Then they essentially did nothing to compensate.<br />

Idiots...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We got melee balance 1, it did the job. Melee balance 2 was the opening system that nobody liked and would have been to hard to implement, and would have used too much endurance. I don't see any reason to complain, we're fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Clagon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The &quot;openiing system that nobody liked&quot; is alive and well in EQ2</div></div><hr />
