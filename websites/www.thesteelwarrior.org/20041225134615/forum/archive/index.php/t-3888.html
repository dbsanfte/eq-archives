Most of my time is spent in LDoN.  LDoN is about DPS.  I rarely die in LDoN dungeons as it is, so upping my defensive abilities seems wasteful.  Currently, I have:<br />
<br />
Runx3, STAx1, Regenx2, CAx3, CSx3, NDx3, AT, and PE<br />
<br />
I've now completed my first long-range AA plan.  Where to go?  Conventional wisdom says ID5 and so forth.<br />
<br />
If I were to take a path more suited to LDoN, what do you think it would be?  Other than Stalwart Endurance, I don't see any AAs that really trip my trigger.  I really hate that first auto-stun so many mobs seem to have.<br />
<br />
A warrior in my old guild parsed the results from the offensive AAs and found them to be very... incremental.<br />
<br />
So what do you think, for a person who spends most time in LDoN?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im abit of a stickler than we as warriors should be the best at taking a hit but I understand not everyone is the same or has the same needs.<br />
<br />
The offensive AA are nice for DPS, Flurry and Ferocity jump to mind. SE is really nice, I love that AA.<br />
<br />
I would recommend saying away from PB as well. if you dual wield PB wont do a thing for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer your question, no LDoN doesn't change AA progression.  It might change your personal progression if your goals and dreams are to play in normal-difficulty adventures for the rest of your life.  I see no reason to take away the joy from nuking clerics because they have to spend their mana healing you because you didn't get defensive AA's!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Dragonetti.<br />
<br />
My cleric is my wife.  At first I thought like you, but after seeing a few warriors with Maxed defensive AAs in dungeons with our group, the difference STILL makes a large difference in healing.  A tank fully DefAAd can have a druid healer with a beastlord slower, or whatever.  It gives more options for the group the more solid you are as a tank.  Additionally, when you get to the higher end of AAs, if you have good agro weaponry, and you should after you get 2300 points and have unlocked anger 3 procs, then you can do hard dungeons for gear that you cant get raiding, because you arnt in a raiding guild.  If you dont work on your defensive AAs after the archtype, then doing hard probably is less of an option.<br />
<br />
I had it explained to me this way.  The main reason warriors are told to work on defensive AAs before Offensive AAs is mainly because the offensive ones dont really make much of a noticiable difference.  Add combat fury, what are you going to get.. maybe 4 5 more dps?  If that 12 AA had been spent in LR, you can bet your cleric is going to notice the difference on a 5 pull.  But the extra 4 or 5 DPS isnt going to amount to a hill of beans.<br />
<br />
I think what made my mind up was the group (War x 2, Cleric necro mage beast) where my wife would go 2 or 3 fights between complete healing the tank.  I know he was elemental guilded, but it doesnt really matter.  Its defenately noticeable when a warrior is defenstive AAd.  For a warrior, DPS is going to be far more ruled by how good thier weapon is, and AA just kinda augments it, I feel.<br />
<br />
Something like SE, i would almost consider it to be a Defensive AA.  Anything which reduces the amount of damage you take overall is defensive.  If you are getting stunned while pulling LDoN, then getting SE most certainly might be something to consider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO anyone who is not in a raid guild should focus on getting enough HP and AA to tank high risk adventures. Once you can successfully complete high risk adventures you will have a hard time going back to the easy ones. Not only do they have some very nice loot for people who are not in raiding guilds, but the adventures are a lot more fun because they are actually a challenge. I suppose it is fun to pull mobs in bunches in the easy dungeons, but eventually that will get boring and you will want to do the hard dungeons anyway.<br />
<br />
Personally, my warrior is only doing easy adventures until I can get him enough AA to handle the hard ones. The loot, exp, and AP are much better than the easy adventures.<br />
<br />
And before anyone says that you can do easy ones faster, keep in mind that there is a 40 minute minimum so at best you can only do 2 easy ones in the time it takes to do 1 hard one (if you use all of the time). Once you get good at doing the high risk adventures, you can usually complete them in 60-70 minutes or 1.5-1.75 AP per minute as compared to a best possible 1.275 AP per minute for normal risk dungeons. As long as you can complete a high risk faster than 80 minutes, they offer more AP per minute spent in the dungeon.<br />
<br />
I would continue along the defensive path in order to make hard adventures a better possibility. Like Draganetti said, if you plan to stay in easy dungeons then go ahead and do offensive. If you plan to move on, get the defensive AAs, you're going to need them.</div></div><hr />

I must have missed this point in the normal adventure I finished in 30 mins last week.</div></div><hr />

You need to wait 40 mins between getting missions from the adventure recruiter.</div></div><hr />

We were stuck waiting at the adventure camp for our next mission because &quot;we were too tired and needed to rest&quot; before our next mission could be given.  There is a minimum timer of 40 minutes or so between the start of missions apparently.  It kindof takes the reward out of finishing a mission really fast.</div></div><hr />

I must have missed this point in the normal adventure I finished in 30 mins last week. There is a minimum 40 minute timer before you can request your NEXT adventure. I have finished plenty of easy adventures faster than 40 minutes, but you have to wait before the recruiter will give out the next one. No matter how fast you finish a normal adventure, you can't do better than 1.275 AP/min due to the timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually never picked up on that 40 min thing. We usually like to rotate camps or take a small break between missions anyway.</div></div><hr />

I mean, we can zone in and hunt the Named mobs, mission goals be damned!<br />
<br />
And in reality I can only do one dungeon a weeknight,  be it hard or easy.  So the difference between the two is more marked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay..<br />
<br />
What I would recommend for any warrior going into LDoN is to get those defensive aa's first.  If you don't and you are the tank in group and you die some of your group will prolly die also.<br />
<br />
But again its a matter of choice.  But also remember that these mobs hit fast and hard in LDoN so its better to be prepared.  Hmm..also you don't want to die too many times in LDoN as a tank as it doesn't exactly give you a great reputation for groups.  Unless you want to be known as a &quot;paper tank&quot;.<br />
<br />
Get the defensive AA's first then you will have plenty of time to play with the offensive AA's.<br />
<br />
Please also remember as posted previously the best adventure points are awarded for the harder adventures in LDoN.  Also the best dropped items in LDoN drop mainly in the hard adventures.  I have been in some hard adventures and with the mobs hitting you 700 per swing you better have either an angel in your pocket or decent defensive AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The progresion doesnt change, you should get LR5 and ID5 imo. <br />
<br />
The increase in your survivability is much more important than the miniscule DPS gains you get from offensive AAs.<br />
<br />
And always remember, any dps increase you gain by TM/PB/flurry etc, is like a drop in the ocean in comparison with the total damage output from your group.<br />
<br />
You can spend 27 points on maxing flurry, and maybe raise the _groups_ total dps by 1% (and thats probably a high guesstimate). OR you could spend those 27 AAs on defensive skills, and give your group a much smoother ride. Hell maybe even enable your cleric to nuke once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except it takes like 91 AA to finish defensive AAs -- not including PP (including general and AE taunt, which is essential). That's a long time to wait for offensive AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, those AA take exp, and I get a fair amout in LDoN.  So a reasonable course of action would seem to be keep working on defensive AAs and spend the LDoN points on weaponry.<br />
<br />
Here's a weapon to soak up those pesky LDoN points. It will take a while, but is attainable.   I think it compares to any VexThal non-aggro weapon.<br />

It turns out to be a 17/20 1hb 75HPs with a 150pt DD proc.<br />
Total cost...1150+1150+760 = 3060...<br />
3060 / 51 = 60 successful adventures with at least 23 being in Tak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the Club is the way to go for Warrior weapons in LDoN, but I would skip the DD Proc (your not a DPS class!) and grab this instead:<br />
<br />
Mir 1150 Aug4 Marble Sphere of Ire Notlore, Effect:AngerIII  <br />
<br />
Equipping it that way makes it comparable to the BoC - the hate proc is 600 Vs 700 on the BoC, and I don't have any data on the frequency of the Anger proc...buts its a similar weapon....and with the +2 damage aug to make it 17/20 it'll do more damage than the BoC.<br />
<br />
the only thing that would be a better LDoN investment than the Club is this:<br />
<br />
Guk 1150  Curse-Smelted Long Blade<br />

<br />
You could mod it the same way as the club, with the final result looking like this:<br />
<br />
Curse-Smelted Long Blade<br />
16/19 1HS<br />
Effect: Anger III (+600 Hate Proc)<br />
AC:8 Dex:7 Agi:7 HP:75<br />
CR:7, MR:7, PR:7<br />
<br />
Total Cost?<br />
3450 adventure points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I selected the DD proc specifically because I wanted a solid off-hand non-aggro weapon.  I'm not always MT and I find myself without a reasonable non-aggro weapon set (primal+Blue epic!!??)<br />
<br />
I scoped the Anger proc but was looking for more DPS, which given the response on this thread, seems hopeless and counter-productive.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Curse-Smelted long blade... Most of my normal crew really kinda hates Guk so they prefer not to go.  Otherwise I'd be all over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ankesilke</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Surprised no one mentioned this yet.  The real value for the offensive AAs (especially in LDON) is in helping with Aggrow, not more DPS.<br />
<br />
Before LDON came out, you could tank and hold agg in most situations with a GSOT.   After LDON released, they messsed around with aggrow again and only 1 hand weapons seemed to hold the best agg (Thanks Sony).<br />
<br />
Getting more swings and more procs on 1 hand seems to help a ton.  After finally having to invest in Ambidexterity (7% more swings off hand) I could hold aggrow better, both in LDON and other encounters.<br />
<br />
That's my experience.  Offensive really helped with holding agg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">7% more swings in offhand is going to yield perhaps 2 DPS for people in this boat... There really isn't a whole lot of offensive AA's that matter. Thats why everyone says go defensive, they matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN mobs hit weak enough that you probably don't have to worry too much about defense, unless you get multiples.<br />
<br />
On Hard things have so high of an attack that it's unlikely your defense will have any effect on them to be meaningful, at least for the lower end crowd.<br />
<br />
On LDoN I think offense is more important than defense.  First of all these missions do use up every bit of DPS you can have (assuming you're not in a powerful group just bulldozing everything).  Second defense in LDoN is relatively easy but aggro is NOT. The mobs are just harder to aggro by any method in general (even Knights, though it doesn't affect them nearly as much).  While no one knows for sure if more offensive AAs helps aggro defensive AAs certainly do not help aggro whatsoever.  At the very least you should have Stalwart Endurance because able to resist stun helps a lot with aggro, especially initial aggro, since you getting stunned as a mob incoming is almost a guaranteed way for the slower to get ganked.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine doing LDoN without AE Taunt.  There's a lot of times I wished I had Hastened Instigation too.  30% faster AE taunt means you can use it roughly 40% more often, and it seems like there's always a situation to use for AE Taunt, even on normal (though that's more just a good idea in principle.  Even if the mobs can't kill my party, I like to know that I can still get aggro if it's needed).  I still don't recommend getting Hastened Instigation but if you do LDoN a lot, it is certainly a viable choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still don't recommend getting Hastened Instigation  <br />
<br />
Um, AE Taunt is far and away the best warrior AA in the game.  No other AA even comes close.  Hastened Instigation 3 let's you use it 30% more often.  Why in the world would you NOT get it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a great AA. But its not great enough to be worth 9 AA to make it a little faster. True, LDoN normal mobs don't hit THAT hard, but for gods sakes, when you tank better, YOU TANK BETTER. Its that simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, hastened instigation isn't worth it. <br />
<br />
I use AE Taunt cautiously, only if I think it's going to be the difference between group survival and a total wipe. If some wizard overnukes and is about to die, or a shaman slows too early, I use /shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well faster AE taunt is still mostly limited to LDoN situations.  Normal XP situations simply should not get to the point where you need 40% more AE Taunt to just manage (30% faster speed is roughly being able to use it 40% more often).  If all you ever do is LDoN, Hasten Instigation is for sure worth it, but it is of limited use in XP groups, and just about useless for raid situaitons.  I can't think of any reason why a faster AE Taunt would matter consider most bosses would die well before AE Taunt would refresh even at the fastest speed (10 minutes 30 seconds) and if you've tanked a boss that long, why would you need another AE Taunt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;If some wizard overnukes and is about to die, or a shaman slows too early ..&quot;<br />
<br />
If the shaman is good, there is no such thing as slowing too early.  Depending on the mob, and how much it resists, my hydra shaman casts either slow or malos while the mob is incoming.  The shaman grabs aggro for a few seconds sometimes, but I can't remember the last time my shaman died from casting on the incoming, and I only got AoE taunt on the warrior recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm.  Im a rogue that did alot of LDON heres my two cents.<br />
<br />
1) less damage taken means less heal agro.  longer time after initial pull before the first heal needs to be cast.  THIS IS HUGE IN LDON~ <br />
2)re: more agro from offensive AA.  Its not really the one your hitting thats the agro problem imo.  Its that first heal and the ones you didnt hit. Again anything that slows down that first heal or the amount of heals you need is as good as +agro.<br />
3) for every class the defensive AAs are huge in exp groups.  The difference max defensive AAs makes is staggering.  Its the difference between needing a heal every mob and being able to tank a mob to finish without a heal.  A tank with all their defensive AAs makes healers look talented.  Mainly cause the healer can actually cover other people without standing on the tanks back pumping mana like ya's a ranger.<br />
<br />
Its really that first one that is very noticable around fully defensive AAd tanks.  If you pull 3 without a mezzer and the healer is chain healing you~  your only going to tank 1.  Being able to hold off some heals cause the tank is handling the hits is very nice and makes missions play easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN normal isn't really hard enough for defensive consideration to affect aggro in a fundamental method.  For hard, the only heal you should be getting is Complete Heal.  Casting anything else consistently on Hard is asking for a quick death wish since all the quick heals seem to have increased aggro associated with them in LDoN, not to mention with the DPS on Hard mobs they'll bleed your healer dry rather fast.<br />
<br />
As for slowing, on normal it does not really matter when you slow them.  On Hard, you actually need to have some coordination anyway.   There's rarely enough time for you to get a tash &amp; slow off without getting aggro, that's for sure.  We're somewhat helpless when dealing with Enchanters slowing without additional help, but then that's always been the case.  Shaman slowing is fine (aggro-wise)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another point for defensive AA's is by reducing the mana needed to heal you, the healer can use mana to increase dps.  Last night I was in a group (avg lvl just over 63) with a cleric for healing and a druid and shaman as backups.  Except for the one time we got 3 mobs in camp, the druid and shaman didn't do any healing and the cleric was nuking (or hammering) on most of the mobs.<br />
Based on the damage I saw the cleric doing, I doubt I could have contributed more via a few offensive AA's.</div></div><hr />
