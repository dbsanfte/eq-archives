<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casual Guy</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a well esablished formula for modal damage of a given weapon?  I used to know how to calculate modal damage, but that was before the newer expansions, with new types of bonuses and new levels.  <br />
The formula used to be (DAM * 2 + LVL bonus) where [LVL bonus = (LVL - 25)/3].  Is current level bonus the same as it used to be?  And how does all that bonus damage listed on the weapon effect things?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sound like a broken record when I say this but it really is true: you need to parse your own damage versus known mobs to get a good grip for what works for *you*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As is, there are 3 factors in determining modal value at any time, ATK, AC, and Level.  ATK and level can be determined, but AC cannot.<br />
<br />
Any work done to plot modal as a function of ATK would have to be done on a mob by mob basis.</div></div><hr />
