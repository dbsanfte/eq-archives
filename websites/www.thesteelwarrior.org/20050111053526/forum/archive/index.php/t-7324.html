<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild just defeated  Bartx this basterd yesterday. Now the problem is coming. For the suck design of Uqua, we would need to have enough key class to win this battle but exp can not join anymore after pass 2nd AE door.<br />
Can anyone give a suggestion or idea about how to reflag rest guildie? Doing Uqua 1 time only flag more 10 ppl is a dam nightmare.    :mad:</div></div><hr />

You've all the time in the world (well, however long Uqua is up for) to get more people there as long as you don't open the door leading to the Devastating Construct.  After all, you don't want to be waiting for people to show up and have them complete the ceremony, which makes the Barxt fight about twice as hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We always have ppl waiting to join Uqua, but the problem is if we want to reflag the rest ppl, I estimate about 4x ppl, we will have problem to form enough power raid to defeat Bartx although after patch, it has been sooooooo easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no way around the fact that the people defeating Barxt are the only ones who can get flagged.  If you can't do it with all the people who needs flags then you just have to do it more than once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx for the info. I can not image why VI cannot let the flag system just like the EP god. Just want to block more time ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either that or trying to put the strain on zerg force guilds.  Cynosure would probably be very easy with 80-90 people, but it's alot more enjoyable/challenging when you're restricted to 40-50 people because of reflagging issues.<br />
<br />
Although I almost forgot to mention, the Ikkinz 4 turn in bug is a load of CRAP.  Having 10 people flagged for Uqua and waiting for ikkinz 4 and having it bug out every week is total BS.</div></div><hr />
