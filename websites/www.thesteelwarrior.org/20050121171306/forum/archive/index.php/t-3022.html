<br />
In the LDoN expansion also some Stun augmentations are added (the Ykesha line). This is good.<br />
<br />
Well I expect it is now time for SoE to &quot;help&quot; the warriors with their agro issues and nerf the Paladin Stun (and all other stuns in the process).<br />
<br />
Hmm, I'm starting to get paranoia.<br />

I think that's what he was saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact SoE gave warriors some Stun procs on weapons and via augmentations. This means they &quot;solved&quot; in some way the problem of the overpowered pally stun. Because now it also would hurt warriors when they should fix that. Very clever i must say.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What happened was not that the stuns were nerfed, but rather that an imformative message was added to the spell descriptions that they didn't impact mobs over level 55.  Well the stuns in question had never actually been able to stun mobs over level 55, although they generated aggro as normal.   This didn't change in the least.  Low level stuns still generate aggro and they still won't stun mobs over level 55, just as it has always been.  Some Paladins got all into a nerf parnoia tizzy over the informational message is what it all turned out to be.</div></div><hr />
