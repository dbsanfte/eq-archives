<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jeanete</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, I am in a small, young guild and I have recently rolled up a warrior to MT for epic fights and  Hate / Fear.  I will soon be level 55 and with defensive am hoping to be able to help out with tanking for epic fights.<br />
<br />
We do have a few 65 dps classes including bst, ranger and wizard.  Are there any weapons which I might find in the bazaar which cost under 25k with enough hate to keep the mobs off of our dps classes?  I have read a few threads talking about a number of no-drop weapons and very expensive droppable weapons.  <br />
<br />
I am prepared to believe that there are no good choices atm so if that is the case, we will just muddle through as best we can.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas or comments are greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">-Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
<br />
-Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
<br />
-Reinforced Sandstone-hilt Sword<br />
<br />
Or probably the cheapest and BEST 2handed option available to you at level 55:<br />
<br />
-Greatstaff of Thunder<br />
<br />
In fact, the GSoT would probably be the strongest option for you, in your situation. But a Sword of the Bloodsworn and a Reinforced Sandstone-hilt sword would work well too, if the hammers sell for too high on your server.</div></div><hr />

Man, we should have like a public service announcement that says &quot;Do not buy a Copper Hammer/Sword of the Bloodsworn.  They really are THAT easy to camp if you require them&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Relax already Haass.  To camp those weapons, you need a group, and some time.  If you get unlucky with the RNG, you can wait at that damn camp for HOURS without getting one.  A while ago, was helping a guildie camp one.  After 4 hours, we called it a night.  In those same 4 hours, I could have run around EK slaughtering cats for skins and spiders for silk, and made more than enough pp to just buy one.  Or, our same group could have been doing LDoN's and getting everyone more points.  All depends on what you have more of; time or pp.  A lot of people spend a fair bit of time just soloing, or screwing around when they have an hour here or there.  To those people, might very well be a lot easier to just buy the weapons.  Especially now that the CHoS is no longer the twink weapon of choice, and prices have been dropping steadily on most servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I camped the SotB solo with my wizard for almost three hours, no go.  Then another two plus hours and no go.  After five hours I realized that I could have easily made 10-20k camping other mobs so I just bought one.  Then later I decided to try again for the heck of it, killed the PH, and first pop up comes the seer with the SotB.  Sold it for 7k...<br />
<br />
But if you have a group you can camp both the King and the Seer at the same time, get nice xp while doing it, the pp drops are really nice (usually ~10-20pp per mob), and there's a chance for quest items for the free the slaves quests.</div></div><hr />

First of all, you can duo that camp at 60 with ANY healer.<br />
<br />
Second of all, you go fuckin kill green shit in noob zones, be my fucking guest.  I'd much rather get XP, Cash, items for some of the best risk/reward quests in the game, and hammers and swords by the bag fulls. <br />
<br />
Or hell, actually, just keep buying them from people like me.  I must have made 300-400k selling Hammers and Swords to people who thought it was easier to go kill spiders and lions.  I made 160k in one weekend right before I bought my SoD.  How many spider silks you reckon that is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, firstly, considering that I can solo EK pretty easily, and make my 2-3k an hour when I only have a short amount of time to play, such as an hour in the morning before work or school, etc, that part of the equation favours buying one.<br />
<br />
 As well, considering that on D Ro CHoS used to sell for 30-40k when they were introduced, and had a better drop rate, I can definitely see your point of camping them then.  Now, at least on my server, they sell for about 7-9k.  Also, drop rates are a LOT worse now.  I'm curious how long you would be there now if you took your shammy and warrior there and got 2 hammers.  As for breaking and holding the camp at 60 with any healer... strange, I know a few ppl who needed a group to do it, and who weren't players I would consider gimp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No way you need a group for that camp.  I watched a level 65 elem geared shaman solo King and Seer no problem.  I can solo Seer with my wizard no problem and he has some ornate and velious gear, although to be really safe it helps if I have temp or virtue.<br />
<br />
But man, is it just me or did they recently nerf the drop rates in Droga hardcore?  Farming in there has been abysmal for me lately, makes me want to just never go back.  Two named mobs in the past like 30 placeholders is just pathetic.<br />
<br />
I can keep down several placeholders and I used to be able to take on average 3-5k an hour in there, but lately, yeesh....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Comparing a lvl 65 elementally equipped shaman, known as a soloing class more than able to hold their own, to your typically average geared 55-60 warrior who would be interested in doing this camp isn't really much of a comparison.  Would your warrior be able to break and hold the king camp with a comparable healer?<br />
<br />
As for the drop rate, yeah it's definitely been nerfed, but not sure how recently it was.  I seem to remember it being some time ago already, such as about 6 mos. or maybe even more.  That would explain why the zone went from being solidly camped, to having maybe 1 or 2 groups, and often being empty, over the course of a couple of weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Blade of Carnage can be bought in the bazaar usually ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Agreed, an average group of level 55-60 players would need close to a full group, definitely a full group to pull both camps.<br />
<br />
I'm not disagreeing with you per se.  In most cases I don't camp the gear I want, I camp other things that provide better cash flow, sell them, and then buy what I want.  But in some cases, the satisfaction of knowing you obtained an item on your own is it's own reward, but that is more true for quested items than normal drops.<br />
<br />
I do however think that the king and seer camps are decent xp, a good chance at some decent drops in the hammer and sword, and also a chance for some quest pieces.  If you have a regular group of people you play with, it's definitely worth the trip to try and get these weapons on your own.  If you get frustrated with the camp, then just buy them, at least you got some decent pp and xp camping them.  If you mostly join pickup groups, then forget it, just buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heh, yeah there's one BoC for sale on my server, 400k.  For a short time they were going for 300k, and a few even were going for 250k for a bit.  I was wishing I had the funds around that time.  Then I didn't see one for sale for over a month and broke down and bought a SoD.  I really like the SoD.  I probably could have better spent my pp on other upgrades, but I just wanted to be different from the usual CHoS/SotB.  I was actually going to buy ornate, but the ornate molds dried up and prices went up to higher than I thought was fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I made 160k in one weekend right before I bought my SoD. How many spider silks you reckon that is?<br />
<br />
Thanks to Yantis and his plat duping friends that is probably like 4 or 5 spider silks nowadays...<br />
<br />
Just camp the Droga weapons--it is not hard at all and you get the satisfaction of actually doing something that is more challenging than buying everything in the bazaar and looking like a Yantis clone warrior with all buyable gear and no idea what the taunt button is for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On Povar I sell silks for 5 plat each. That's usually the lowest price and they sell within an hour or so of standing there. You could raise your price and then wait till the tailor in need buys all of the 5 plat silks and still needs more, but, eh, I'd rathter just move the silks. They're easy to farm.<br />
<br />
Anyways, you're looking at, on my server, 100 plat per stack. So that'd be 1,500 stacks of silk to get 150k. <br />
<br />
Even I don't have the patience to do that kind of farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">is this thing worth the 30-40 k they want in baz for it? the stats are nice, but does the proc work much? if so , on what lvl mob's procs will it work. also does the proc give aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lauthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I farm droga all the time with my 65 mage 62 beastlord.<br />
<br />
I rotate through 4 main named camps:<br />
Flamekeeper Japal : Kingly Boots of Splender<br />
Earthseeer Gamlok : Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
Whipkracker Kazzim: Grand Scepter of Ice<br />
Boneknight Runri: Enchanted Sash of Wonder &amp; A nice Rog Brd Dagger.<br />
<br />
Having spent a long time in droga and having farmed and sold abour 15 pairs of boots, 12 swords and countless daggers and scepters. Here are my thoughts:<br />
<br />
Droga name spawning is serious screwed up.<br />
<br />
I have seen no named in 3 hours and I have seen 5 Flamekeeper Japals spawn in a ROW.<br />
<br />
Some times you will get lucky and get loads of drops sometimes you will get none.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to just grab a healer, head over to droga and kill the named PH'ers and then stay for say 1 hr tops, that should be enough for 2 reaspawns of each camp. If you get no named, go do something else and try again another time.<br />
<br />
And if your on the Venril Sathir server just bypass the zone alltogether because the named all belong to me, ME I tells ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have seen no named in 3 hours and I have seen 5 Flamekeeper Japals spawn in a ROW <br />
<br />
That's what they call &quot;random&quot; sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Jeanete,<br />

GSoT is easier to acquire probably than CHoS/SoTB.<br />
<br />
Don't overlook the fact that to get the most out of these weapons you need aggro aurguments. Two Anger 3 augs will cost you 2300 adventure points or ~46 hours. In contrast, one Force of YKesha aug for a GSoT will cost you ~15 hours. Even more time if as I suspect you don't get 51 AP's per completed adventure.<br />
<br />
Getting augments is a major time investment. One you don't want to repeat if you don't have to.<br />
<br />
IMO if you are going to be playing for quite awhile, go with the CHoS/SoTB. Put Force of YKesha on the CHoS and Strike of YKesha on the SoTB. If you later acquire a BF or BoC you can retire the SoTB and put Anger III on your new weapon. This along with Aten gloves when you get to VT should hold you just fine until you can get a BoW.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if you are not a so-called &quot;power player&quot; get a GSoT and put a Force of YKesha aug on it. This is much cheaper in time and effort and will with a little effort be quite servicable.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Augments are fluff if you have a decent weapon.  Not necessary....fluff.<br />
<br />
I wasn't gonna buy into the LDoN bullshit augment theory, so I didn't buy the expansion, and with my SoD/Copper Hammer duo, I was set.  After Incite came into the game, I VERY seldom had issues.<br />
<br />
I'll agree that if you're going to be doing adventures anyway, weapon augments are probably the most cost effective, but you definitely do not HAVE to augment your weapons to perform adequately.</div></div><hr />
