<br />
When I get into one of these pick-up groups I have nothing to ensure that my 4k unbuffed hp's even gets used. Every round I get temporary aggro followed by ping-pong and 6 seconds later another try at pissing off the mob.<br />
<br />
I've been using a War Marshall's for the last couple of weeks, and though I like the extra dps it takes next to nothing to snag aggro from me.<br />
<br />
I realize alot of this is people casting snare at 90% (pet peeve) or slowers not giving me atleast 1 round to try and establish aggro, but DAMN!<br />
<br />
I wouldn't invite me to group knowing what I do. Why would anyone else?<br />
<br />
edit: This leaves me asking the question, why is it ok for a hybrid to have total aggro dominance but a warrior can only get some of it by owning massive weapons? <br />
<br />
There is no balance.</div></div><hr />

If you feel worthless to the world, don't put up with it. Twink another class that you enjoy playing. Went full-time with my beastlord, and haven't looked back much since ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem being that this is my cleric twink ;) <br />
<br />
I know my post is flame bait, but I felt a need to vent. It can get quite discouraging to me at times playing a sub-par tank with limited resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take your 5 friends and app to a different guild.  If you can't get done what you need to with those people then it's time to find a bigger pool of people to help you upgrade and tolerate you while you do.</div></div><hr />

These are real friends that I've seen have kids, buy their first home, get divorced, etc...<br />
<br />
I just want to have fun in this game that's all. <br />
<br />
I want to feel like me being in a a group adds more than a pet would. Currently I feel like extra baggage, and I'm at whit's end as to what to do to improve that with my resources.<br />
<br />
/em looks at the top and see's &quot;The Outhouse&quot;. It seems appropriate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been at the point you are at a couple times.  I outgrew one guild(one of only 3 people post 60, and the other 2 were not really exping much) at the same time my weapons got outdated and my hp's where substandard.  All I can say is if you keep at it, it will get better.  A couple good groups with people who will work with you will do wonders for your self esteem(at least, they did for me).  Usually I spend some time gooding around on alts when I get real frustrated, gives me a good chance to clear my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't have to leave them...take them all and go app for another growing guild that you can get along with.  There's no point in going down with a sinking ship.  Take your friends and find a new group of friends to add to it.  You want to have fun in this game, so find people who can help you do it, and take your friends with ya while you're at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, my friends are the core of this guild. They make up what is the guild other than myself.<br />
<br />
I left a heart felt moving-on post a few minutes ago. Not totally because of what you said Haass, but you did spur me into decisiveness.<br />
<br />
Now I'm gimp and guildless, but since I've hit bottom (figuratively speaking of course) it can only go up from here.<br />
<br />
I'm now stuck in perpetual pick-up groups, and that makes it hard to want to login...<br />
<br />
My problem seems to be reaching it's own conclusion to just not play at all.<br />
<br />
edit: spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ouch, was in a similar situation when I was between guilds from 60-65.  No one wanted warriors in groups and my gear was pretty poor compared to the other warriors as well as the knights with whom I was competing for group spots so most groups I got were charity cases where a friend had got me an invite to a DPS spot.<br />
<br />
My solution was to play an alt.  I had an enchanter who I had played to 49 to enchanter metals for tradeskills on which I could get groups, so I'd put LFG on every day for 30-45 mins and then log to my chanter and get a group in 5 mins and make some decent XP every day.  I made heaps of new friends and EQ became a whole lot more fun again.  <br />
<br />
Every now and then I'd get a group on my warrior and then I would try to keep the group going as long as I could and about 3 months later both my enchanter and warrior dinged 65 within 2 days of each other.<br />
<br />
Getting 65 helped me get into an awesome new guild and now I raid every night and spend all day looking forward to going home and raiding again, now playing my warrior full time again and Im getting more enjoyment out of EQ than I ever did, despite being very close to quitting a couple of times while I was unguilded.<br />
<br />
Keep at it and things will get better.  On the bright side as you said, your warrior is your twink and you have a cleric main.  Clerics have to be the most in demand class for every guild I have ever seen so Im sure once you have taken a few deep breaths and reassessed your situation you'll land on your feet in an active guild in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The warrior has to be the most frustrateing class to play , but it  also has the most upside imo ;) .  <br />
<br />
 I dont think there is anything else quite like being the MT on a raid . I dunno , but i think people kinda see you diff when your the only one they can put up toe 2 toe with the badass's . <br />
<br />
 Many many times ive quit my warrior since 1999 , but finally a while back i got into a good situation , and have thoroughly(sp) enjoyed EQ ever since. I never even play twinks anymore ;) which i think is key to &quot;getting into a good situation&quot; , but... thats another thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good luck Steenky, I'm sure most of us have been in that position, with the warrior class as it stands there are no 'better answers'.  At the end of the day though always remind yourself that it's better to have fun  than to play just for the sake of playing....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been in this position a few times myself, and just recently.<br />
<br />
I came back to playing EQ after an 8 month break.  During the time I was gone, my guild added tons of people from other guilds, cleared NToV, Sleepers, killed everything in Luclin including Emp, is clearing VT, and compiling flags for the elemental planes.  Now when I left we weren't doing any of this except a little sleepers and NToV and some easier Luclin stuff.  So, I am way behind, need levels and AAs, but also there's a ton of better equipped warriors in the guild now.  I felt like a 5th wheel.<br />
<br />
That was about a month ago.  Fast forward a bit.  Met many of the new folks and they're all great people.  Got my Emp key, Sleepers key, not too far from my VT key, am 63.5 (we raid a lot heh), got flagged for some stuff.  I've had help from some friends in the guild too who've been really great to me.  I probably won't MT anytime soon, but eh, I'm having fun and seeing content I've never seen before. <br />
<br />
So keep the faith. I've tried other classes, but my warrior is mine, I'm attached to him and get the most rewards out of playing him.  Hook up with a good bunch of folks, try to get your ex-guildies in with you (maybe you can negotiate with another guild to get a mass recruit for them going, seen it done before), and you'll be okay.  And pick up groups can be frustrating, but they can also be very fun!  Sometimes its good to meet new folks, and some people are just a hoot to play with.  =).  Take care brother warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SnapricotOrange</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Steenky, I ran into that same problem about a year ago.  I started EQ as a cleric and had made lvl 60 and epic (pre-PoP) but in spite of that, was told by an officer in my guild that I was &quot;not a guild asset&quot;.  When all your hard work and efforts to improve yourself culminate in someone telling you that, yeah I felt pretty worthless.<br />
<br />
I was guildless within the hour.<br />
<br />
I tried several other guilds and finallyh landed in &lt;Apex&gt;.  We are a small (less than 20 RL people) group, but everyone knows each other and we are all dedicated to making sure everyone improves both hteir gameplay and their gear.  No one gets left out, no one gets passed over or has to compete with anyone else.<br />
<br />
When I first joined, we had no warriors, mages, necros, beastlords or druids.  We had 4 other clerics, so I volunteered  to make another class that we needed and thus, Snapricot was born.  I play both chars normally (2 comps, 2 accounts) according to what the guild needs.  Sometimes I am MT, sometimes main cleric, other times I sit back and just play support or dps; it doesn't matter to them what role I play, because they appreciate the person at the keyboard, not the pixels on the screen.  That is what keeps us tight and makes things more fun for us all.<br />
<br />
My point in all that, Steenky, is just that it may take some time, but eventually you will settle into a group that is perfeect for you, much like I did.  It may not be a group that has a common guild tag above their heads, but you'll find your groove soon enough, if you just keep your head up and your spirits high.<br />
<br />
oh and /hugs Redhenna :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You were told that you weren't an asset to your guild as an Epiced 60 cleric?<br />
<br />
What the fuck guild is this so everyone knows who the hell to stay FAR away from?  Any guild that says they don't consider clerics to be assets are either liars or complete idiots.</div></div><hr />

Theres a guild for everyone that they feel a part of, I hope you find one that matches you perfectly :)</div></div><hr />
