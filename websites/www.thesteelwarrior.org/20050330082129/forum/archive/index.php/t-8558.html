Information on any or all of the trials would be great as I really don't have much information that I find reliable aside from Kill fast and bring your best folks for any of them.<br />
<br />
Anything you could share would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need serious DPS (for the appropriate level) to beat them.  I remember our MT started taking offensive AA's to help get people thru.  <br />
<br />
The basic strategy we used was to have all the mobs beat on the MT ( he sat down to get agro) and then everyone helped him kill one mob.  We usually did not bring an enchanter for mezzing unless the chanter needed to get thru the trial.  I am not sure of your gear/level, but at the time we had to use warrior's to mt the stuff.  Its possible to use a knight if he is decked out in VT gear tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trial of Execution is the one I've always done. Basically a timed wave event where you have to kill all the mobs before Executioner gets to the platform and performs an execution. The three keys for us were:<br />
<br />
1. Have MA select targets very fast, and move from mob to mob quickly<br />
2. Know which mobs are mezzable and which aren't. Believe the stone guys are not.<br />
3. Having someone that can banish summoned creatures is a big help.<br />
<br />
Im sure there are many other strategies, and some of this depends a lot on gear level. Mainly get high DPS together, use /assist and switch targets fast, use banish if you have it and are running out of time on a wave.<br />
<br />
Once the waves are killed you will have to kill the executioned which is not too tough.  When I first did this we would have a ranger or someone kite the Executioner around the room while rest of group medded. Not sure if this is still needed. Again, depends on level of players and gear level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargasso</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few tips on ways to beat executioner...<br />
<br />
1) Have a mage in group if possible, if not get mage in guild to DS EVERYONE...45 pt DS is HUGE when the mobs have about 10k or so HPs.<br />
Hell I don't remember if Druid DS will stack with Mage DS but if it does..use that too!<br />
<br />
2) Buy Kilva's Skin of FLame potions in bazaar...this is another dS that stacks with mage DS.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) DON'T MEZZ ANYTHING....or IF you are going to mezz only mezz one or two...LET THE DS shields do their work.<br />
Let MT sit in the middle of room with a HoT heal on him just before the room pops...he gets instant aggro from all mobs....<br />
Kill the named first if pops.  ALL assist the MT.  With a decent tank and a decent cleric you don't need to Mezz anything and this is the best way to go...after you all have killed first mob and hit assist for the 2nd mob you will notice its already at about 85% health from just beating on the DS.  Next mob will be at like 70%...this simply makes it easier to kill all t he mobs in the allotted time..I want to say you have close to 30 seconds for each mob in each wave...although My memory might not be good...could be 20 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so for the Executioner Trial the basics are:<br />
<br />
- 4 waves of 4 mobs then the Executioner himself.<br />
- 30 seconds per kill to keep the prisoner alive<br />
- Focus on named spawns during waves<br />
- Cleric Uses HoT and small patch heals (if needed) to keep aggro down until the boss, hold Cheals for boss when adds aren't present.<br />
- Warrior locks down each target in turn letting DS take its toll and tossing incite on the non assisted mobs as able to help keep aggro off cleric<br />
- Mage keeps DS on everyone and assist warrior for nukes<br />
- Everyone assists Warrior with max DPS.<br />
<br />
Anyone have info on the other trials?  I'm hoping to try for 7th hammer access while folks are interested in the trials but i want to be prepared before jumping into them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just jump into them and see what you can do.  Most of them just require killing either everything or a certain mob as fast as you can, and if you fail you can start over right away.   Really if you have a group of 65s you shouldnt lose once you figure out how the trials work.<br />
<br />
To figure out how the trials work listen to the emotes during and before the trials.  For example during the trial of strangulation or hanging or something you get an emote &quot;the prisoner starts to choke&quot; when a mob named something like &quot;spirit of strangulation&quot; spawns.  If you kill this mob fast enough you see an emote that says &quot;the prisoner can breath again&quot; if you dont get some emote like &quot;the prisoner dies&quot;.  After this just repeat 4-5x when the prisoner starts to choke again and win.  Not exactly rocket science.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the bright side, you shouldnt have a problem waiting in line to do the trials.  Back when I first did them there were about 100 people in the PoJ waiting to do trials...it was pretty insane.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a couple things about the executioner trial:<br />
<br />
1.  the stone mobs are not mezzable, so get them first.<br />
<br />
2.  although it rarely works (and may only be possible in the first wave or 2), the stone mobs can be banished by the mage/druid spells...if we get more than one stone mob the MA takes one and the mage/druid tries to banish.<br />
<br />
3.  whatever you do, don't let anyone die - you'll need all the dps you can get (I'm assuming you don't have uber types to make up the dps loss.)<br />
<br />
4.  after the last mob there is a named to kill (it spawns on the platform.)  This mob should be slowed, and hold your defensive disc until you get to this point.  (i.e.;  don't go defensive on any of the waves...wait till the single mob at the end)<br />
<br />
5.  think it's already been said, but the MA must target quickly.  We don't wait for assist calls, but we do wait for the MA to get a new target.<br />
<br />
Good luck!  (btw, the trials are a lot of fun!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks very much for the info folks, I'm glad to know theres emotes that pop up ever so often during the trial that'll help get things sorted.  Really looking forward to tanking these, hopefully we'll give a few different ones a try and I can loot me some different marks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The named at the end of the execution trial flurries, but it a pansy (hits for 400 I think). Plus you aren't timed on killing him so you can kite him around and let your cleric med if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I can give one piece of advice, it'd be this:<br />
<br />
DON'T USE BANISH - IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.<br />
<br />
If you can't kill them without it, you can't win anyway. Remember that the timer resets with every mob killed. It's not a timer to kill all 4. Plus banish is resisted all the freakin' time and can only be cast on a long refresh. It's a waste of mana, waste of time, and a waste of a slot in your group for the person using it. Just use nukes and you'll be fine. Also, the only ones that can be banished are the rocks. Although they're not mezzable, the rocks have less hp than the other ones anyway. They're the easy ones, dont waste your mana trying to banish. Plus when you banish it confuses the hell out of people sometimes =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks much for the added info on the timer Had planned to run the boss around a bit but its good to know each kill pops him back some not the last kill in the wave.<br />
<br />
And i had wondered about banish didn't think it was the right way to go but i'm glad to ahve some more detail, I'll keep the casters on nukes.<br />
<br />
Thanks again folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah they always make me crazy when they start banishing mobs. I know there are 4 in the wave and ill be running around looking for the last one wondering where the Hell it went.<br />
<br />
  Last time I did an executioner run the mobs were being pests too. As normal I sit in the middle Aisle and everyone else stays back by corner of stage when they spawn so mobs aggro on me first. But for some reason half the waves ran right past me and went for the monk. Guess thats better then them going after the casters but it was still odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did this recently in my guild, flagged a ton of folks.<br />
<br />
I played my 65 wizard for dps.  We had a decent 65 war and 65 cleric.  We failed once out of about 10 times.  We kept the same core 3-4 people and added 2-3 others each time to get everyone flagged.  Do it that way.  Don't try to just throw a bunch of different groups together and expect to win.  We typically had the fourth be any decent level 62+ dps class and the last two just basically had to provide decent dps and we were golden.  You need a good tank and cleric because the cleric needs a good mana supply and is also going to get hit.<br />
<br />
We had the casters move to the back corner and the tank start in the middle.  The mobs would all get on the bank and the casters would assist.  I don't recall how the cleric kept aggro off him from the other mobs, we had an enchanter that handled that most of the time, I think the other times it was the cleric and other casters with root based crowd control or the tank using AETaunt.<br />
<br />
I then tanked the trial myself as a 61 warrior (might have been 60) with no defensive AA's.  We didn't have a lot of dps.  We made it through second try, but it was hard.  I was taking a serious beating, especially from the boss at the end.  I'm sure it would be easy for a 65 warrior with a few defensive aa's, but it wasn't easy for me at 60-61.  I'm sure a 65 knight in ornate or equivalent or greater could tank it just fine.</div></div><hr />
