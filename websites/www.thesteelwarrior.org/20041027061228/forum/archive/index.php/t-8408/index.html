<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't had a chance to do much in EQ since I reached ally to Ring of Scale.  The KOS-to-all lava basilisks intrigue me, however.  Does anyone know:<br />
<br />
- do any other mobs assist the basilisks?<br />
- do the basilisks give a RoS faction hit?<br />
- are the basilisks a reasonable XP target for ally people?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The RoS stuff doesn't assist, but I kinda doubt that they would be worthwhile for exp.  They are pretty hardcore.  You could give it a try but I think they are probably too hard and too spread out to be worth doing exp on.  Finish up the quests and go kill the RoS trash :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm where do these basilisks spawn? I've been running around VP assuming nothing was kos hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sargeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They spawn in the lava, so if you run over lava, they will aggro. I think some are traps too, because when I went to drop the bridge near Nex, I saw an emote and there was a basilisk where I was standing, but I was invis so it didn't aggro. Some do see invis too, I had two on me passing another lava part running to the zonein.</div></div><hr />
