My intentions are to use it as a DPS once i get BoW or DBotW.  It will probably be a couple months before i get either of these so my question is this..  Since I will be using Vanzir to tank until i get one of the above, do I aug it with Anger3 and risk losing 1150ap when i upgrade or will yak aug suffice?<br />

If you get one, just use it to tank and pick up something else for DPS. And yeah, a Ykesha augment would probably do fine. Just keep in mind that more aggro is always better, so if you want to maximize your aggro get anger 3.</div></div><hr />

Dont plan on DBoW ....<br />

Some have gotten 15 Darkblades.....<br />
We have 2 in 6 months on RZ killing....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-30-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW, SEWS, and VDD.  If you have one, dont bother getting another unless its going to non-tanks.  If you have a VDD, don't &quot;upgrade&quot; to a BoW, its a waste.  Upgrade to a DBotW or some GoD item you got your heart set on.</div></div><hr />

What I meant by that was if your guild has a merit system for MA weapons, and he's somewhere up high in that line.</div></div><hr />

Most of his guildies have one. He picked up a VDD a few weeks earlier. He threw ykesha on it, and can tank with it, with WA5 no problem. Alot of raids he ends up being 2nd/3rd on the agro list. So it is very nice, even in the dbotw/eoe world.<br />
<br />
So i think my friend did well, yak proc on the VDD, it will do you well for tanking raids or groups, but not so high you can't dps with it aslong as the MT isn't shitty. Then anger3 the a dbotw when you get it. Unless you have some insane amount of points saved up.</div></div><hr />
