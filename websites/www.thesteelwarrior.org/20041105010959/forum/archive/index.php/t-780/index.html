<br />
My guild has been moving into SSra Temple to hunt as of late and we are moving up the Moblist but we are stuck on this One.<br />
The Glyphed/Exiled we can do with rather minimal losses, usually being the DT of the MA as the only real deaths.<br />
The Cursed is a different matter.<br />
We are very aware that he AE charms, so the current strategy we use is to keep a few MT's out in the open for him to play with who de-equip weapons until called in to fight as MA. The healers hide behind the walls of the Middle area of the Basement where we pull him and the rest of the raid force plug him with arrows from a max distance to avoid the AE charm.<br />
<br />
Any tips you might be willing to offer would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll offer that arrows are an extremely slow, difficult, and unnecessary tactic against Cursed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe, never done the fight, but wanted to point out that my guild of about 30 folks, plus 8 or so apps contains seven rangers.....sounds like arrows to me, regardless :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hes got 2 aes on different timers - get them both figured out &amp; called &amp; have meeles run around the corner &amp; fight him for a few seconds between aes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Briq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just call the DoT ae and you will be fine, charm should be resisted easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yah pr or dr of about 200 will resist most of the charms- i forget which it is, just need a bard or little resist gear. fun is killing the charmed ppl who didnt bother with resist gear = )<br />
<br />
generally healing isnt an issue, 1 cleric can heal MT after slowed, rest can heal thru that sissy dot np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I will tell you how we do it.<br />
<br />
At the north arch have healers inside on the wall next to the arch.  Have 2 tanks, each one with 250DR or more on other side of arch, casters and rangers back near the port down tube at max range.<br />
<br />
We pull him to North Arch and 1 warrior goes Defensive and taunts initially till debuffed then the 2 warriors trade off agro back and forth keeping the Cursed balanced in place, not on the wall and not far out from the arch so you are in range for heals. Keeping Cursed in place is key for the fight. We have 2 cho's going on the tanks with usually 3 cleric/druid combos in each one. ONLY MELEE WHO HAVE 250DR are allowed to enter the melee at 50 life and if I see one getting charmed alot I will order their ass right back out of the melee. Sure the fight is long this way but once heals are flowing it takes something really unexpected to mess up on Cursed.<br />
<br />
The only problem we had with him once getting it down was other guilds waiting around for you to fail and getting in the AE charm without resists up to par.  Nothing sucks more than some random wizard nuking your tanks while we try to maintain a long battle.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />
