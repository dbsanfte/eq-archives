<br />
Are there any recipies that create an item that is Bind on Acquire (is a weapon/armour piece that when created you cannot trade?).  That might influence my decision.<br />
<br />
I originally decided to go with Armoursmith as I am a protective specced warrior so armour would imho be the obvious choice.  I also feel as an armoursmith I could fill many slots as opposed to weaponsmith who can only fill one.<br />
<br />
I am coming to the point where I need to decide so anyone avaiable to give some explanation?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">03-23-2005, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">upper end weaponsmith items are BoP. Corruption (49 DPS 2hs) is one. generally the BoE weaponsmith items are better (like Arcanite Champion/Reaper).<br />
<br />
Dark Iron BP (armorsmith) is BoP. it's tasty, very nice for MC, but it's not the end all be all. also upper end armorsmith items are limited, like, you aren't gonna have a full suit of dark iron.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weaponsmith yields 4 recipes at the beginning, with all of them being very nice weapons, altho a bit time consuming to obtain.<br />
<br />
Armorsmith yields 2 recipies...one of which is going to be replaced the first time you do Uldaman, and the other is fuckin ridiculously stupid on the components for what it yields.<br />
<br />
Go Weaponsmith.  You won't regret it.</div></div><hr />

Armorsmith is... lacking at the moment sadly.  The bp and the gloves aren't bad.. they're just not really good either.  Until you get your hands on some nice epic level plans (Stronghold, Lionheart), it's going to sit there unused for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll see...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">03-24-2005, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can only hope.  I have a good RL friend who's char is a 300 BS Skill Weapon smith, so when it came time for me to choose, I went the Armorsmith route.  I mean hey.  It made sense as my group of friends would ALWAYS be able to smith what ever drops in raids.<br />
<br />
Man, has it sucked so far.  First, the Truesilver Gauntlet's are the only thing worth making for profit (this while my friend is selling Truesliver Champions, Phantom blades, and  such like Kiddie porn at a Pediofile convention).   And the most I can get for them is 10-11 gold.  <br />
<br />
The BP recipe you get is terrible for the components it requires.   The Heavy Mithrill BP is better in ALL respects other than the &quot;chance on hit&quot; effect that the truesilver BP has, you CANNOT sell one for any true profit unless you gather all the components yourself .. and I tell ya, I've YET to see a black pearl that wasn't in the AH, and this one requires 4 of them to make.<br />
<br />
I'm sitting at 262 BS-ing right now, as I can't seem to find a decently cheap pattern to work smithing with.   And teh ONLY other Armor Smithing plan I've Aquired are Thorium boots that a friend got for me, and I can't even learn it yet.<br />
<br />
Factor in that I've about got every skill up I'm gonna get off of truesilver gauntlets, as it's turned green for me now, and I'll be lucky to hit 300 Smithing sometime next Century.  Hopefully they take a look at this problem soon and release some more ArmorSmithing plans for the 250-280 skill crowd.</div></div><hr />
