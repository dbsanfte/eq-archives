<p class="largefont">View Thread : <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=4260">A Concern...</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK. I initially supported the entire Warrior cause. I myself am a 65 Warrior with a birth date of August 5, 1999. He is, and has been my only main. I am not E-bayed. My guild affiliations and status in the game make no difference.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, is that 90% of the Warrior population has no idea about the issues. They want everything from drastic DPS increases, insane mitigation increases (overly insane amounts), to things like a never-fail taunt button and a maximum possible hit on a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Talk like this is counterproductive. Talk of nerfing another class is even more counterproductive. Asking for game-unbalancing things is plain stupid.<br />
<br />
For instance-<br />
-Permanent agro lock by a Warrior would be game unbalancing. A never-fail taunt would do that.<br />
-A maximum possible hit on a Warrior is just plain stupid as well. Mobs should have a base damage table, from which final damage is calculated using the standard<br />
<br />
Damage = DB + X * DI  <br />
<br />
Where X is a random integer between 1 and 20 and<br />
<br />
where AA’s and class mitigation are figured in.<br />
<br />
First of all, I will say that no class needs to be nerfed because of this.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I think DPS is pretty much on target when juxtaposing most melee classes.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=3803<br />
<br />
This being said, there are a few things that need to be addressed for Warriors-<br />
-The taunt button is entirely based off of a random number generator. Warriors have zero ability to gain agro by any means other than hitting that button, or praying that a weapon procs.<br />
-As soon as Knights (or any other class for that matter) break a certain HP barrier, it is no longer necessary (or even a good idea) to use a warrior as a main tank in raid situations. Virtually similar AC and HPs ever-encroaching a Warrior’s HPs mainly due to poor itemization make this possible. Not only do their HPs get ever closer to Warrior HPs, but the mana present on the same items further increase the utility, longevity, and tanking ability of said Knights. In addition, the on-demand casting of spells makes aggro control (and thus raid success) trivial for Knights.<br />
<br />
Thus, a Warrior’s only role –to tank– has been eclipsed by other classes. A Warrior is no longer a necessary class in Everquest.<br />
<br />
If I had a working answer to these problems, I would be working for SOE right now. Unfortunately, I am a peon, a cog in the wheel. Of course, however, I do have a couple of suggestions.<br />
<br />
1) Apply a Succeed/Failure Message to the Taunt Button. Make this go in effect for every class. This way we can all see if taunt succeeded other than just seeing a mob ignores us.<br />
<br />
2) Give Warriors an additional ranged taunt. Make this an innate class skill that has its success tied into the Taunt skill. Scale a raw value of hate to this taunt appropriate to the level of the Taunt skill. Do not make this an overpowering taunt, or a means of gaining overpowering aggro. Make this have a short refresh timer. Thus, this could be used to help with mob initialization and increasing Warrior aggro over time if so wanted. This would lower the need of EB weapons and the like for tanking.<br />
<br />
3) Make us more desirable for tanking in raids by increasing our mitigation. This is very tricky. Here are a couple ideas-<br />
	-Get rid of defensive entirely. It is a crutch. In accordance with this, drastically increase Warrior mitigation against mobs that are of higher level than the player. Do not increase it to quite the level of defensive, but make it permanent. This would make Warriors more desirable for tanking because they mitigate that boss mob damage better than anyone. This would not hurt Knights in EXP groups. Knights would also be able to tank as well as they always have against boss mobs as well, so it is not a nerf. A Warrior has one basic role – to tank. Lets remember that.<br />
	-I have seen plenty of other posts regarding this, a lot of which have viable answers as well.<br />
<br />
4) Fix itemization. Items of parallel quality are grossly in favor of hybrids. For instance:<br />
Warrior:     <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17930<br />
Paladin:      <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18172<br />
<br />
Hybrids get much more use out of such poorly designed items. “A 10 HP difference is a lot,” you say… Well, add in the mana into it and it becomes a powerful item. Not to mention, it has the exact same Aura and comparable armor class.<br />
<br />
These are some of the problems I observe. Tonight, after the serverwide channel was moderated, I left it. Many many people in there protesting for Warriors are asking for stupid things. Many people arguing for both sides don’t even know what they are talking about. It is sad because I want this to succeed. I, however, am not going to associate myself with a mob of uninformed, overzealous people. <br />
<br />
That being said, I wish luck and fortitude for all the people on this endeavor, hope for the best, and will continue playing the game without interruption or personal protest other than that which I have posted.<br />

<br />
 I fail to see how you can disassociate yourself from the human race.<br />
<br />
 All seriousness aside tho, the problem is that to people like me, nerfs are certainly indicated. The hybrid classes were supposed to be trading off tanking power for a spellbook. Warriors being the baseline means that content is tuned to Warrior tank ability. The hybrids have been closing the gap in tanking power to the point where there is virtually no difference. A small percentage, perhaps.<br />
<br />
 Since you don't want them to have to retune all content to boost us back up over them a reasonable amount - some nerfage is clearly in order. Of course, many of your ideas are sound, and I support them generally.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, I read your entire post Dallatar, and find it amusing that in the beginning you blast warriors for, you know, asking for stuff, and talking about how emasculating it can be to see your class' one role totally marginalized ... and then in your suggestions you go on to do the exact same things that the mob of uniformed, overzealous people are doing.<br />
<br />
You're asking for changes.<br />

Warriors are concerned with class balance issues. These incude taunt, survivability, and DPS. We are distressed that long after SoE became aware of these issues the Future Plan section of the official website has remained the same month after month - neither recognizing our concerns nor suggesting a reasonable timetable for addressing them<br />
<br />
Frankly if I were SoE I'd think fast. The possibility of appearing in the news as a novelty story  - having the first virtual mass protest in an internet game would freak me out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">MANY OF THEM the exact same changes the mob is asking for. <br />
<br />
Agreed. On the other hand, however, there are many people in the serverwide channel, and, for instance, on my server that really don't even know why they are &quot;protesting&quot; other than to attempt to nerf Knights.<br />
<br />
Sorry but you reason like a Paladin. Knights already have permanent aggro lock. The game is already screwed and unbalanced. Now, why would a permanent aggro lock by a Warrior would be game unbalancing?  <br />
<br />
Sony views this to be the case, that is why Warriors were never given any good snap aggro capabilities. Do Warriors need the current taunt button to never fail to be improved? No.<br />
<br />
I also think it is funny how you generalize people's thoughts into classes of your chosing. I think like a Paladin do I? Maybe if you stop alienating many Knights, who at least on my server are supportive on the most part, even more could be accomplished.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Podling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's likely that SoE hasn't followed through on their plans to balance melee because they haven't got a clue how to do it without either breaking the game or completely revamping the high end content.<br />
<br />
I see 3 possible solutions.<br />
<br />
1) Take defensive out of the game.  Put warriors on a seperate table for Mitigation.  Rebalance all current raid encounters accordingly.<br />
<br />
2) Redo itemization.  Make warrior only loot that is significantly better than knight loot.  Rebalance all current raid encounters accordingly.<br />
<br />
3) This is my favorite - although it will get me flamed.  Like it or not at the middle end of the game, warriors aren't in such bad shape.  We could use a little help in terms of gaining aggro but that's fixable with small tweaks in how taunt works or small tweaks to itemization.  If your guild is tanking mid pop bosses with knights, you're probably backflagging or you're really more than ready to move on to the next level.  The problem exists primarily at the very upper end of the game -- with guilds that can use knights to tank Quarm and the rest of PoTime.  <br />
<br />
The answer then is to give warriors high end loot that make up for what we lose by dropping our spell books.<br />
<br />
Knights close the tanking gap through loot... Let warriors close the utility gap in the same way.  It should require just as much farming to make a warrior into a decent paladin as it does to make a paladin into a decent warrior - but it should be just as doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Although Sony may have viewed giving Warriors the same aggro ability as Knights as trivialing content, we have established that in identical gear Paladins can get to within 300HPs of a Warrior. Any Paladin able to obtain identical gear an chosing FT, etc. instead is doing so because the tradeoff is even more powerful. In groups and even in raids, Paladins have sufficiently Warrior-like survivability that their aggro superiority is causing them to be chosen to tank instead of a Warrior.<br />
<br />
The argument that Warriors can't have Knight equivilent aggro abilities because this would trivialize the game has been throughly and completely debunked.<br />
<br />
Do Warriors need improved taunt to be able to compete sucessfully with Knights? YES. We all know it, every class board knows it.<br />
<br />
That tired old false argument against giving Warriors improved aggro ability by anyone, including SoE, can not be logically defended. The facts man, the facts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have never seen anyone here on TSW asking for a 100% success aggro guaranteed taunt button.

<br />
What I meant was that most Paladins are also saying the same thing that you are. That their snap aggro/aggro lock capability is just fine and not harmful to the gameplay and at the same time they say that Warriors should not have similar aggro abilities because it will unbalance things.</div></div><hr />

My point exactly. Those that read this forum are generally informed. Those that do not are grossly misinformed bandwagon jumpers. Those uninformed give all of us a bad name when they spout off in ooc, or attempt to correct people using bad information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talk like this is hyperbole, but it serves to highlight that there's an issue.  It is certainly more productive than silence.<br />
<br />
Talk of nerfing another class is precisely what many paladins have been guilty of over the years.  There's no EQ community anywhere which has cried &quot;nerf that!&quot; as consistently and loudly as PoN, and far from being counterproductive, I think you'll see that SoE hear messageboard-based nerf-calls loud and clear.  And sometimes act on them.<br />

There's also the fact that nerfing knights is, in fact, the best answer to the problem.</div></div><hr />

Its not the ideal solution, but any nerf to knights would help warriors.  Period.  Plus, it would help re establish the need for skill in exp groups.  Win win situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the mindless mob mentality that Dallatar was talking about.  While there are many warriors, especially frequent posters to this board, who have good ideas on how to improve the situation, there are also a great many warriors who think the answer is to nerf the hell out of knights.<br />

Some nerfs to the knight classes may end up being part of the solution but if they are not well thought out, they will only serve to further screw up class balance.</div></div><hr />

Even if the Paladin argument was based on thar logic, look at how screwed the warrior class now is because of that logic.  Fixing the problem doesn't mean getting revenge on Paladins because SOE screwed up in the past.  Fixing the problem means finding a solution that makes both knights and warriors equally useful to a group.<br />

I'm not a paladin btw, you should at least figure out who you're insulting before throwing that language out into cyberspace.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I see by your PS that you did look at my magelo so you should know I'm not a paladin.  As for me being a clueless sub 60 knight, my SK is not by any means my highest level character.  He's just the character I identify with for purposes of this discussion because he's one of the classes you want to nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Noctix,<br />
In countless threads the idea has been submitted that giving warriors aggro on par with knight aggro would break the game, particularly the raiding game.  MANY, MANY knights came to this very board and said that, and many warriors agreed with them. However, if we accept that giving warriors knight-like aggro would break the raiding game, we must also accept the fact that the raiding game is already broken, because knights have basically become nondefensive warriors with spellbooks (and Bulwark of Vie has for all intents and purposes given them defensive, without the loss in DPS that warriors suffer when defensive).  Given that, if knights having very near warrior survivability (in some cases better) and aggro lock is game breaking, then Knights need to be nerfed.  Otherwise, we must accept the fact that giving warriors knight-like aggro will NOT break the game, and for the most part won't have much of an effect on it at all, aside from leveling the playing field.  Personally, I think knight aggro is extremely broken given the relative equality of survivability they share with warriors.  So we can either nerf knight hp/ac/mitigation, nerf knight aggro ability, or drastically improve warrior aggro.   Bottom line, knights always had the aggro, they were just never meant to have such a good ability to take a beating.  You need to pick which one you want to give up. And no I don't think a knight should die in the first round of combat in an xp group or anything, I just think there should be a very noticeable difference in the difficulty of keeping a knight on his feet versus a similarly geared and AA'd warrior.  That is what you were supposed to have to give up in exchange for your spellbook.  Being the best there is at taking damage was supposed to be what I gained in exchange for not having a spellbook, but so far it doesnt seem to have worked out that way.</div></div><hr />

First off, if you read my posts, you'd see that I said some knight nerfs may be part of the solution.  But they need to be well thought out nerfs coupled with well thought out changes to the melee classes, not &quot;the most poorly thought out, poorly executed, over the top Knight Nerf&quot; that at least one person on this thread thought would be acceptable.<br />
<br />
Knights have become &quot;non-defensive warriors with spellbooks&quot;, as you put it, because SOE has been too lazy to implement seperate armor for warriors and knights.  Any armor, in the visible slots anyway, that is equipable by both warriors and knights is the cause of the problem.  Especially when said armor has mana on it.  Any fix needs to address this problem specifically, either by giving warriors gear that focuses on hp rather than both hp and mana, or by making knights choose between hp and mana.<br />
<br />
Personally, I hate to see any class nerfed.  I play several classes and I know that it takes months to obtain many items and/or abilities and to have those taken away in the name of class balance is wrong.  I would rather see warriors get get a 2x hp modifier and agro out the ying-yang than see anyone get nerfed.<br />
<br />
Edit:Before I get flamed, I do want to clarify that I know the 2x hp mod etc would be game breaking, I wasn't actually suggesting that happen.  I was just saying that a large sweeping nerf isn't something I want to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">nerf knight aggro ability <br />
<br />
  I dont think most PALs would have a problem with tuning stun agro down from them.  I wouldnt call it a nerf, but a fix. I suggest making spells immune on mobs simply not castable at all.  IE when you cast pacify on level 55mobs = Your target is not affected, no cast, no agro produced.  Casting Cease on higher level mobs, should say &quot;your target is not affected&quot;, and cant be casted.  Sounds simple to do <br />
<br />
if you have a hard time getting in a group, stop trying to.  Make your own.  Those others in /LFG mode are wanting xp just as bad as you do and are all just waiting for someone to say something to them, just as you are waiting for a tell from them</div></div><hr />

 7. Knights share a collective hive mind that can instantly transfer the history of Knights in Norrath to any Knight. This is so the other 25 can authoritatively speak out about the injustice of Kunark.  <br />

So knights should only get groups when there's no warrior around?<br />
<br />
Knights are not a filler class only intended to be used when a member of the holy trilogy can't be found.<br />
<br />
Tell me, if warriors are the tank specialist, what group role do you see knights filling?  For normal experience groups, knights should be equally as desirable as warriors.  For raids, warriors should generally be more desirable.  I'm not saying that balance exists in either of those two areas right now but when SOE does attempt to fix the current situation, your average experience group shouldn't be telling knights &quot;sorry, we don't want you, we're waiting for a warrior&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a normal experience group, I would take a druid or a cleric as healer.  I wouldn't take a shaman as my first choice for main healer but I wouldn't consider healing to be a shaman's main role, I would look for them for haste and slow.  If we're talking about a raid or a single group fight against a large mob, I would take a cleric but I would also expect a warrior to tank for that group.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Or do you look for a cleric and if you cant find one, start looking for the other 2? <br />
This isn't really seperate from #1, is it?<br />

3.  Given your answers to questions 1 and 2 (assuming you answered honestly), explain the fact that shaman and druids still exist - nay, THRIVE - in todays EQ. <br />
As I said before, I would take a druid as a main healer for an exp group, I think that is a large part of why they thrive.  Shaman thrive because they can haste and slow plus provide extremely useful buffs and dps.  Healing is just one of many secondary abilities they offer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right about LOIO, OT, and DL, those zones have always been treadmill zones that almost any group makeup could handle.  That's why I played my SK to 52 during Kunark before trying out some other classes, I didn't really see the difference until I got to KC, BW, Chardok, etc.  I'm tired of talking about Kunark though, SOE has fixed any problems that knights had during that era so it hardly matters anymore.<br />
<br />
I more or less agree with you on the fact that knights can't own both the ability to take a beating and aggro.  The only reason I bother posting on this board is to do my part to make sure that whatever solution eventually happens is something we can all live with.  I want warriors to be happy but I also want my class to continue to be a viable class.<br />
<br />
There are many warriors who are not looking out for knights at all in their nerf demands (hold your flames, I know some of your ARE looking out for knights, you know who you are).  There are plenty of knights who are just as selfish and thickheaded.  I just hope that I can be one of the few who doesn't fall into that group :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
notice how you never answered the question.  You just tried to sidestep what it implies.  The truth is, when you need a healer in a group people look for a CLERIC FIRST, when you can;t find one, then you grab a druid, and lastly you grab a shaman.  In this example a CLERIC is the best healer there is, and the other 2 can do a great job but not the same as a cleric.  Don't tell me you look for either a cleric or druid . . . I call BS on that one.  Groups will 9/10 times take a cleric over a druid . . . why  . . . because they are the best at what they do.  They don;t have all the utility of a druid, or a shaman; they traded that to be the best healer.  <br />
<br />
If you would have honestly answered the question, you would see what the point that was trying to be made is.  I know it's hard to understand, but yes warriors should be far and away the best tank in the game.  Does that mean a Paly/SK should basically be dog meat, get the scraps, or be unable to tank mobs . . . NO!  Warriors should be like clerics in the above scenerio PERIOD.  Does that mean a paly or sk will never tank in an xp group again?! NO, it means they are not as good of a tank as a warrior just like a druid isn;t as good a healer as a cleric.  I don;t want to hear the boo-hoo stories how you'll never be wanted again, because we all know it's a load of crap.  It's amazing how the hybrid class thinks it should have all the power of the parent melee class plus the spells they get from the other.  <br />
<br />
What is amazing is how all the hybrid's can come to this board and talk to us like we are really all balanced.  You sound like a bunch of flat-earther's trying to convince everyone the world is flat.  You all want to avoid being nerfed, and granted i don;t thing anyone really wants to get hit with a nerf bat.  Lets be honest you know that warriors have fallen behind from where they should be, you just don;t want to be the bastard children of EQ with no place in a group or raid (gee like where warriors are starting to find themselves).  I don;t think that beefing up warriors is going to stick the knights into hours of /lfg, however it will ruin your monopoly.  Just so you know the holy trinity in Eq, has and will always be a myth that hybrid's use to push their own agenda.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Hola-<br />
<br />
Might be worth discussing what tanking &quot;well enough&quot; means; here's the criteria I personally use:<br />
<br />
For exp grinds:<br />
-can be healed by a single cleric, druid or shaman w/o chain casting and/or excessive mana regen breaks.<br />
-can hold aggro well enough to allow DPS classes to do a sustainable amount of DPS output w/o significant pingpong<br />
-can gain aggro quickly enough to allow debuffs relatively early during a fight.<br />
-generate a respectable amount of DPS to keep the pace up.<br />
<br />
For boss mobs/raids:<br />
-has enough HP/avoidance to allow a reasonable delay CH chain/patch heal rotation to suvive an entire fight.<br />
-can gain aggro quickly enough to prevent early debuffs/heals from getting casters splattered.<br />
-has enough AC to reduce median hits from mob to lower part of the distribution.<br />
<br />
Sound pretty reasonable?<br />
<br />
Warriors (barely in some cases) meet those criteria now for most encounters, and are therefore fairly well balanced to the existing content in EQ.  The problem is that knight classes meet all those criteria about as well as warriors do- without even using their spells!  With the spells added in, they are far superior to warriors, especially in exp grinds.  And this doesn't even touch on the OTHER utility and capability they bring to their groups...<br />
<br />
When SOE's nerfed classes in the past, it's been painful but effective.  When they've buffed up classes, they've almost invariably overcompensated.  Warrior's don't need buffing to do what we are supposed to- and now that knight classes can do the same things, they need to be trimmed down elsewhere to compensate, or have their ability to tank w/o casting eliminated.<br />
<br />
All just my own $.02, obviously- comments welcome, other opinons respected, flames tolerated. ;)<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Got to disagree somewhat.  I've seen many an overnerf as well.  Basically anytime SOE makes a bunch of changes, it causes problems.  The changes tend to be multiplicitive, building on each other.  So while each one seems reasonable, the end effect is a change that is too much.  This is the one thing I hope SOE does well.  Think things through, then introduce a change or two at a time, so that the overreaction doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
And added to that, I'd like to see warriors get a bit more diversity.  Without a heal bigger than CH, the hp advantage is pretty much dead.  Easier to get max heals will linger around a bit.  Crits will still help, but basically, it won't matter anymore.  With that advantage gone, something new needs to take it's place.</div></div><hr />

Apparently it is ok for the average experience group to say &quot;sorry, we don't want you, we're waiting for a knight&quot; though.<br />
<br />
My vision for EQ balance is one where you grab the first tank you see LFG, if theres a bunch of them then the needs of your particular group will dictate who you choose - with a druid healer a pally will probably be preferable due to the 90% rez and extra buffs, sometimes an SKs utility will make them more desireable due to FD and Snare, but ultimately the first person available will be chosen for the job regardless of class.<br />
<br />
In groups with multiple plate tanks with equal gear I see that warriors would generally take the tanking role as this frees the knights up to use thier utility - SKs will do more DPS when they use their spells for DPS instead of agro and it frees them up to chain pull, Paladins have an easier time of spot healing when they dont have to tank.  Having said that its pretty rare for me to be in a group that doesnt have a knight in it and as it is sometimes I tank, sometimes they tank.  I am fortunate that I don't have to spend too much time LFG anymore though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Im gonna be parking myself in PoK with my Jagged blade of War in hand and an AFK message pointing to this site on the 18th and I hope some good comes of it.<br />
<br />
I think some of the nerf knights calls in the outhouse have become a bit over the top, and I think that it probably is becoming counter-productive, but people need to realise that whats happening in the outhouse is simply an outlet of frustration from a community who has been brainstorming solutions to a class balance problem for the year that I have been an active member of this community and sometime before that.  People come here to tell us to stop whinging and be constructive, well we've done that, we've been constructive and it got us nowhere - this board was full of class balance threads and ideas before there even was a war-room forum, we've sent emails, feedback, petitions, you name it with lots and lots of different ideas on how to balance the 3 plate tanks and it got us nowhere.<br />
<br />
Now we're trying something else and maybe it will have an adverse effect on some people's gaming for a few days, extra lag in PoK or whatever, get over it.  Maybe we'll get enough attention that SoE will make an announcement of their intentions regarding pure melee / hybrid class balancing.  We've tried everything else, this is worth a shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perfect, there you go.  I honestly do not care how it is done, but that should be the goal of absolutely everyone.  Let come whatever has to, nerfs, improvements, whatever... If at the end of the day, that statement is true..all is well.  However, read up farther and you will hear the line that pisses knights off (and many, many other people): &quot;If someone wants a tank, they should want a warrior, ideally.&quot;  That is horseshit, that is not balance.  You can say: &quot;Based on the group makeup and where we intend to go, ideally we want...&quot; But to want a blanket statement like that to be true is simply, unfair.  <br />
<br />
I am going to break an apparent stereotype here.  I am also going to do something I am not very found of and overexplain where I am coming from...I hope it is not offensive to anyone.<br />
<br />
I have been playing since the game came out.  However, I played a mage from day one.  I have seen exactly what you guys are going through now, so I can empathize, truly I can.  Here is what I remember of kunark.  The holy trinity was god, this fact was undeniable.   I didn't pay attention to class balance as much as I do these days, however, we were all keenly aware that warriors were far and away preferred for the role of tanks.  I remember arguing with groups, yes actually arguing with them, to get a knight to tank just so we could experience.  I was told more then once that they were unacceptable.  The funny thing is, one of my friends is a particularly big sissy when it comes to creating &quot;perfect&quot; groups and it took pop to even get her to consider one (though, now she readily agrees she likes them).  <br />
<br />
Kunark presented a state of balance that many still don't quite want to realize: perception.  I don't know if knights were balanced ok with warriors back then.  All I know is that no one thought so back then, just or unjustly.  This same battle was fought between druids and clerics for so long and then between caster and melee dps classes.  You guys are finally starting to realize that perception is as important as reality.  Lets be honest, there is really no place a warrior *can't* tank, but the perception of the common player is that knights are far better...and you can't beat that right now.  <br />
<br />
Kunark and Velious were holes in reality if not on paper.  Anything that goes back to that is horribly wrong.  And now, seeing what everyone else has suffered through, I would hope you understood it better.  The &quot;holy trinity&quot; is a horrific idea from a balance persective regardless of what classes fill those slots.  It should come down to choice, real choice, not a fact decided long before the question came up.  Legitimate competiton between various classes for roles within a group/raid is very good for the game.  Stagnant, best case, idealist bullshit is not.  Part of the reason you get so little sympathy is because what many of you say seems to want to go back to the &quot;holy trinity&quot;.  Long, long battles have been fought by almost every other class to shatter that and we don't want it back, ever.  I don't want a group to not start because there are no clerics available...when there is a druid.  The same goes for any other role.  <br />
<br />
I've only played a knight the past 8 or so months.  I am almost certaintly not the best person to come up with how to initiate balance.  But, I have learned, the hard way, why balance is needed and what kinds of attitude are needed to promote it.  I will tell you this, do whatever you think is best.  Nerf knights, improve warriors, lets have them do whatever they think is right.  If at the end of the day, you can guarentee me that there is still a choice, that this statement is still true, &quot;My vision for EQ balance is one where you grab the first tank you see LFG&quot;, I will be a happy camper.  But, learn from what you are seeing now, no one wants to be in the position that they are unwanted.  <br />
<br />
You wanted knights to answer the questions you've brought up.  I'd like you to reverse them a bit and be honest.  If when a group looks for a tank and the first thing they look for is a knight and if no knight is available get a warrior (because lets face it, I've never seen a group decide no xp is better then having a warrior for a tank), that is a horrible thing.  Why do some of you say it is ok in reverse?<br />

When I setup a group, I say &quot;group looking for healer&quot;.  If a druid answers that call first, I take him.  Druids have a 75% CH and a fast casting heal that heals for nearly 2k.  I've never been in a normal experience group where that wasn't sufficient.  Just because my answer doesn't suit your argument doesn't mean I'm BSing.<br />

 It's amazing how the hybrid class thinks it should have all the power of the parent melee class plus the spells they get from the other.  <br />
I think we should have lower hp and/or mitigation than warriors.  That is not &quot;all of the power of the parent&quot;.  By the way, the parent class concept is pretty outdated.  Knights don't get the same spell lines as their &quot;parent&quot; caster classes anymore.  Maybe it's time that warriors and knights got more unique melee abilities as well.<br />
<br />
What is amazing is how all the hybrid's can come to this board and talk to us like we are really all balanced. <br />
Where exactly did I say we were all balanced?  I agree that warriors are underpowered, I just don't think you should have both superior agro and superior hp/mitigation.  One or the other.<br />

&quot;The holy trinity&quot; is still very much a reality, it's just that knights are now often able to take over the warrior's role.  I've been on many raids that were called simply because a warrior, cleric, or enchanter didn't show up.  I've never seen a raid called because there was no knight, mage, beastlord, or necromancer.  And don't say &quot;knights are tanking quarm now, this is no holy trinity&quot;.  I am well aware of this but this is a relatively recent occurance.  I don't think knights should be tanking quarm.  That's right, I think the holy trinity SHOULD exist for raids.  That's where it ends though, at the raid level.</div></div><hr />

your average experience group shouldn't be telling knights &quot;sorry, we don't want you, we're waiting for a warrior&quot;<br />

Apparently it is ok for the average experience group to say &quot;sorry, we don't want you, we're waiting for a knight&quot; though. <br />

If you read everything I've posted in the last week, you would see that I agree that warriors are underpowered and that all three tank classes should be equally viable for experience groups.  Warriors should not be passed up for knights, or vice versa.  Unfortunately, I can't copy the entire history of all my posts on every single thread :) <br />

Nice post Trilith, I agree completely.</div></div><hr />

i'd like to be an asset again and not a liability to a group no matter if i got more hp's and AC than Cthulhu or an average everyday joe. Paladins and Shadowknights are just so damn useful now in all instances that taking that away from them wouldn't be fair nor beneficial to anyone.</div></div><hr />
