Is that shielding ONLY subtracts from DB (as in mob damage is DB + DI). So on Quarm (who I understand has a DB of 1000) your 2% shielding will mitigate...20. And (as per Furor) the 15% that warriors can get total will take off about 150 of a hit that can be 3k.<br />
<br />
Check FoH for details. ( http://fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8471 ) <br />

Oh and it looking like avoidance is seriously the way to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, from the same thread, it looks like avoidance is causing a 1/2 its rating decrease in mob hit rate AND reducing mob DPS by almost its rating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correction, nobody will give a crap if Vallon is hitting for 60 less a pop. Shielding items are scarce, two of which drop off Quarm, and net out far less bang for the buck than avoidance items. Once you get to the point of even one of your warriors having 15% shielding, you don't give  a shit if VZ is hitting for 60 less a pop or 500 less a pop. It's moot.</div></div><hr />

Avoidance looks so strong (particularly considering that a monk can max out at 70 Avoidance) that a nerf is unavoidable.<br />
<br />
That said, I would go for avoidance myself, even with the very limited parsing that has been done so far.</div></div><hr />

Small question : Whats the actual effect of shield ?<br />
Max hit reduction ?<br />
Min hit reduction ?<br />
Min/Max hit reduction ?<br />
Actual hit reduction ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shielding is a straight % decrease in damage bonus of a mob.<br />
<br />
For instance, Fennin Ro's Damage bonus is 1000.<br />
<br />
With Shielding 2, then 2% of 1000 or 20 would be taken off every hit. So every hit by Fennin would be 20 less than it normally would.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm shooting for that setup eventually sans the Shroud of Eternity. <br />
<br />
20 Avoidance, 15% SS (20% SS with TZ Shield), 11% Shielding.<br />
<br />
(Note I just listed all the shielding items for continuity)<br />
<br />
The only problem is, my ATK is brought down to paladin like levels. Not sure what to do about that yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Combat Effects .. WTF does this do ? I've been told more procs<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5760  +5 combat effects<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26991 +10 combat effects<br />
<br />
Has there been any interesting data collected ?<br />
<br />
Caus i have to admit ... <br />
+15% proc rate sounds too sweet to be true.<br />
<br />
As for shielding i had noticed that its utility was gimped by the<br />
way most PoP mobs are designed (low DB , huge DI).<br />
And pointed out in the post Solinar linked.<br />
<br />
I'll be in Time in a month or so, and have a DKP margin over<br />
all the other melees that will let me have 2 or 3 uncontested<br />
loots, so i'm still trying to figure what to go for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't heard of anyone doing serious parses on +combat effects.  Most seems to agree it's +procs but just because it says +5, doesn't necessarily mean it's +5% to # of procs.  Avoidance +15 items most certainly don't let you avoid 15% better.<br />
<br />
On another note, Gods in Time tend to have pretty impressive DB so shielding should be more useful in there, though it still can't compare to Avoidance if the mod does not have serious diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every mob starts off that way, but it's only a matter of time before most become single tanked. I've tanked him for a solid 15 minutes through 2 defensives and the time between, as has another warrior in the guild. These were our first kills, and though they were before the lastest changes to the fight, it's only a matter of time before a fully PoTime equipped warrior takes Quarm all the way. Zerging warriors in 3 minute bursts is only really acceptable for progression. Once you settle into farming mode, expect to use each warrior for much longer on fights</div></div><hr />
