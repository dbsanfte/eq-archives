War lvl 65 disc that comes through a tome<br />

i thought they removed this stuff, 'cause it was going to much into FPS-Shooter-type gameplay?</div></div><hr />

<br />
the disc is 'live' indeed but it's obtainable via a tome that is 'test' only. so ... we don't have it 'live'.<br />
<br />
but don't wory we still have Fortitude Discipline (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4670&amp;source=Live) which is obtainable via the Tome of Fortitude Discipline (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=66407)<br />
<br />
have fun,<br />
Yoda.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : 'souce = live' mean it's available on live servers , while 'source= test' is for the test server, so is still in developpment.</div></div><hr />

Everytime I check lucy I hope that 4 second stun, 0 recast discipline will go live so we have a way of getting aggro fairly quickly at the cost of some endurance. Would sure as hell make me buy those points of endurance regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
i wonder what they mean by &quot;melee round&quot;. the primary and secondary are always out of sync so does it include both primary and secondary round? are these two rounds in sync with mobs even though out of sync with us?<br />
<br />
and recast time really zero? should we believe it?<br />
<br />
if this is all true then a warrior with endurance to spare can use this discipline as a crutch to allow the ch to be cast at significantly lower hp since we can now reduce spikes at the lower hp end by sacrificing endurance. and yes i agree it makes endurance regen aa suddenly very tempting.</div></div><hr />

Eh.. a 4 second 0 recast stun to generate aggro.. There sounds way to paladinish to me.  <br />
<br />
Regardless.. what level are you that your having trouble gaining aggro quickly?  I'm generating crazy aggro almost instantly.  Just hit the thing, taunt, then incite.. sometimes you don't even have to taunt. <br />
<br />
I'm not claiming your not having trouble.. I'm just saying, based on my experience, there's probably something your not doing or something you need to get.  <br />
<br />
I don't believe getting a class stun is the answer though.<br />
<br />
E.C.</div></div><hr />

Except incite (and bellow from KT) is useless for generating agro.<br />
<br />
what level are you that your having trouble gaining aggro quickly?<br />
<br />
Level 65, 158 AA, LR5/ID5/WA2/Ferocity3/Ambidex/Ferocity1, 305 all stats, 9700 HP, 1800 AC with BoC+CHSD with Anger3.<br />
<br />
Aggro is pointless in Ferubi, Vxed, Tipt, KT.<br />
Aggro is fine, solid, fixed, perm on me in all other places.<br />
<br />
Steps I perform to gain aggro:<br />
1) Pull the mob or have a FDer pull and I tag out of agro range to get &quot;1st&quot; aggro.<br />
2) Pull with arrows until I get a &quot;hit for x damage&quot;.<br />
3) Start melee attackes.<br />
4) disarm and incite/bellow.<br />
5) Pray I don't lose agro on slow or heal which happens far too often because taunt is next to pointless on yellow mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wasn't the stun that interested me, it was the quick aggro generation, and even more use for endurance. <br />
<br />
Level 65<br />
<br />
I have a BoC &amp; CHoS, anger 3 augged<br />
<br />
I tap with arrows on incoming, taunt the mob after initial slow and hit incite. If taunt fails, and the slower has aggro, i need aggro fast, not when he's dead. Incite doesn't do that, I hear the upgrade to incite isn't much better.<br />
<br />
Short of Time/GoD weaponry I generally think thats the case for most warriors. If we had a boost in incite where Shamans and Enchanters didn't sigh horribly everytime I'm tanking instead of a hybrid, i'd be happy. Doing hard LDoN's mobs die before incite refreshes a lot of the time, and taunt still fails on the white con's there quite a bit...</div></div><hr />
