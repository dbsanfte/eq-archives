Did a normal risk Guk adventure...<br />

My chanter was charmed with a 230 magic resist and was hit my numerous magic based spells that Iresisted 100% of the time in the past several months(chanter dots..)<br />
<br />
Warrior with 250 or so resisist was mezzed and charmed a couple of times, something that never happened, even at 150 or so resists =)<br />
<br />
What exactly changed or happened, I am unsure of, but it was NOT normal.<br />

<br />
It should only happen to the main tank in the first place.<br />
<br />
The only time it even resulted in a death was when I killed myself on the Bard's 110 pt DS hahahahhaa.</div></div><hr />
