<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TheWiggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not in a huge guild, but we can handle some stuff. I'll probably have to buy gear or adventure for it in LDoN possibly. Thanks for your thoughts!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your HP is falling a little behind, which could become an issue now that you're eligable for the 55+ zones of PoP.  I would make an effort to start replacing non-hp gear to gear with HP.  This would include your Cobalt pieces.  <br />
<br />
Several of your items are also excellent resist pieces, but should be put in your resist kit and replaced with more full-time hp/ac gear.  Your current neck and shoulders are examples of this.<br />
<br />
Your best upgrate lineup at your level would probably be the Velious quest armor sets.  Champion's gear (Thurg quest plate) is probably going to be the most accessable to you.  Your guild should be able to handle the arena to get the Corroded Plate pieces, or you could watch for people selling MQ's.  You could also look for some Fine Heraldic if you are of a race that can use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitely get rid of that resist gear, put it in a backpack or bank it until you come across a raid or something were you will need it.<br />
At 55 I was well over 3000hp (that was back in velious) so drop the cobalt and get some heraldic (don't know if it's available for agnostic). Since I worshop rallos zek I've found fierce heraldic to be quite nice.<br />
<br />
Get some barbed dragonscale pauldrons for your shoulders and some valorium rings of gallantry for your fingers. If you can get 3500 hp by level 60 then you should be good for any of the 2nd tier planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get Crinose Cape of the Werewolf for your shoulders.</div></div><hr />
