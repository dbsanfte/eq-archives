<br />
Myself, I don't mind some of the missions, and its nice getting some coin off of exp trash but if my guildmates weren't there so much, I wouldn't take them there. In my opinion (Tier 3 POP but non-elemental tank):<br />
<br />
Experience - decent enough I guess, but it doesn't match up to a Tactics/CoD/HoHo/BoT group<br />
<br />
Coin and sellables - its a nice change to see more coin after PoP<br />
<br />
Drops - have only done normal setting and the useable drops are rare most, non-existant for tanks. Augments are kinda cool (nice way to shore up stats like Agi or Cha and the resists.<br />
<br />
Raid content - my guild has only tried one raid, and we didn't do as bad as I thought we would, but it was still a loss. I know some of the resident ubers on my server are hitting it hard, trying to figure them out.<br />
<br />
Rewards - a joke. An exercise is bad itemization. Some of the procs are about the most useful things I have found. Not sure where things will be after today's patch.<br />
<br />
Overall grade I would give it a C</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN is great for two types of players:<br />
<br />
a) The casual player who has 90 - 120 minutes to play a few times a week.<br />
b) The ultra high-end player who has 400+ aa and full PoTime equipment.<br />
<br />
For everyone else, it's a complete waste of time.<br />
<br />
Crap XP, Crap loot, augmentations that are only marginally usefull, and then only if you spend 1000's of points on them (in which case, you better not be using them to augment some item you'll upgrade next raid!)<br />
<br />
Anyone who is in a guild that raids end game Velious or beyond shouldn't waste time in LDoN, imho.  Unless you've basically completed PoP and have all the AA you could ever want, in which case, LDoN offers the only option for &quot;advancement&quot;</div></div><hr />

First week went hardcore for yak proc record  18 wins, 0 losses<br />
Yak proc owns on BoW, Before i didnt have problems with a BBB  holding agro and now with BoW and yak its more than plenty unless a wizard is nuking on inc.<br />
<br />
Week 4,  18 wins, 272 losses<br />
average 400-500k a week part time farming hard missions, have ranger sit at zone ins, choose hard mission he zones in and tracks for nameds if 2+ up close to zone otm in if not decline and take loss. Mistmoore hard is a joke with a cleric, monk and tank boxed everything comes single. Loot on sol ro EASILY sells for 40k-90k and in 1 hour you get an average of 3 items + nice twink gear for your boxed alts.</div></div><hr />

My guildmates seem to really enjoy it but they're nearer that 400aa mark type of players; plus the drops are good for the alt army.</div></div><hr />

Mistmoore hard is a joke with a cleric, monk and tank boxed everything comes single. Loot on sol ro EASILY sells for 40k-90k and in 1 hour you get an average of 3 items + nice twink gear for your boxed alts. Wow, what a great idea!<br />
<br />
I think Bumamgar is partially correct. I have some Time gear and plenty of AA so I just have a good time doing adventures with my friends and leveling my twink while I get him enough points to buy a BP.<br />
<br />
For the middle of the road people, LDoN actually could result in some very nice gear, much higher quality than would otherwise be available. However, you have to plan your missions and know what you are buying to make the most of your adventures. I think it requires too much planning due to having to have points in the specific mission type you are doing. I think the system would benefit greatly from a few changes to the way the difficulty is determined and the way vendor loot is purchased.<br />
<br />
I would change:<br />
<br />
1. Difficulty - I would make the difficulty level either a 1-5 or 1-10 choice. It would be simple enough to set a base line level 1 mission and a maximum difficulty mission, then set everything in between to be a % based on the min/max.<br />
<br />
2. Loot - I would change the way you can purchase loot to be tiered. Rather than having to do adventures in a theme, you would have to do adventures of a particular difficulty. Points would work on lower tiered loot, but no upward. If you want the best items available on Tier 10, then you have to do difficulty 10 adventures to get those points. The loot would be level based so that the rewards available for doing difficulty 10 adventures at level 30 would not be the same as doing them at level 65. However, the points would be usable in the proper tier as you level.<br />
<br />
3. Adventure points - all adventures would result in the same points for a win. The points earned would be the same for every adventure at every level, but they would be associated with the difficulty.<br />
<br />
4. Loot cost - I would lower the cost of loot across the board with the biggest reduction at the lower levels of loot, with just a small reduction in the top level. Make a level 1 difficulty top item cost 800 points and a level 10 difficulty top item cost around 1200 points.</div></div><hr />

I haven't seen anything that the other half has linked for me in guild chat so far that is worth getting worked up over, and the points are just yet another timesink, for really lateral upgrades at best.<br />
<br />
I didn't buy LOY for the same reason...there just didn't seem like anything worth buying it for.  If you enjoy it, great, but to be perfectly honest it's all the same as just going to Droga...which is now completely empty, and I'm making a killing selling hammers/swords.  You guys keep farming the 400pp shields, I'll keep doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't seen anything that the other half has linked for me in guild chat so far that is worth getting worked up over<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you make of the new Anger3 upgrade, Haass?  We all know melee require balance and a proc cannot replace that need.  But right now procs sure do help maintain our aggro.  An additional proc, that adds MORE hate than any weapon pre-EB seems like something to get at least mildly worked up over right?<br />
<br />
Me?  I'm tired of LDON.  If I never see another ice-cavern again I'll be happy.  Its draining to wait for the right group and its especially frustrating if you MISS that window and your normal group of friends heads into an hour adventure.  I've been trying to get back to basics...fun farming, doing stupid quests for alts, etc.  <br />
<br />
But, hey, I'm #948 on the Leader Board!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had EB. I don't need it.  Weapons are one of those things where you should be able to get what you need now.  If you only do XP, get a hammer/sword from droga and it will be more than enough.  If you're in a low tier raid guild, you've got the CHSD, if you're higher up the ladder there's the Bloodfrenzy/Hategiver/Blade of War, and if you've got plat, there's the BoC.<br />
<br />
For me, the SoD/Copper Hammer ends up holding aggro as well as I can expect from procs.  When I proc, I hold aggro.  When I don't, I don't.  I don't see a reason to add yet another proc to my weapons, because it will still be the same...either I proc or I don't.  Adding EB to my stun weapons is far more aggression than I need to keep mobs off a shaman and maybe a melee or 2, so I'm basically unconcerned with them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoy LDON because it involves crawling through dungeons and an ever-changing environment as opposed to pulling static spawns and staying in one spot.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy doing hard-mode LDON adventures, haven't done many but the rush you get from having to be careful is very fun.  The loot I've seen from the hard missions isn't that bad.  Got a 100 hp ring (+ stats) from an MM hard, seen some 90 hp earrings (+ stats and a DS) drop in another dungeon on hard mode.<br />
<br />
The normal missions remind me of Diablo 2 Chaos Sanctuary runs (pre-LOD).  With a good group, hit a mission and rush through it, hit some named if any, and come back out ready to do another run.<br />
<br />
I haven't actually been saving up for anything specific.  Aiming in general for the +40 hp aug or one of the procs (guard or the yak proc).  I'd like to see some more items for pure melee, (rog, mnk, war), in terms of augments and items.  It seems only fair due to the new spell selections for casters and hybrids.<br />
<br />
The major drawbacks to LDON are incompetent pickup groups and getting home too late to join your friends and having to wait an hour or so for them to finish.<br />
<br />
I can't complain about the XP in hard mode.  Normal it's about right for the difficulty.  If I was intent on grinding XP I'd head to POE or something.</div></div><hr />

My monk has REBB, Cursed weap, Battle fists, EP bracer and other decent things and there is still plenty of nice upgrades. Mistmoore hard is a joke and vengeance II 85 hp shoulders drop there, 90hp arms, 100hp ring, 85 hp NICE tanking boots for a non ep warrior. Guk had similar loot - 90hp veng III belt, 75 hp leather bracer. Everfrost had a nice 90hp alt ring and 75 hp plate bracer, 90hp chain boots.</div></div><hr />

LDoN is perfect for me. I head to BB and put up LFG /LDoN LFA and rarely have to wait more then 15-20 mins to get a tell or two.<br />
<br />
As opposed to LFG in PoT and getting raises in fishing pretty much for 2 hours...<br />
<br />
Aye, some of the pick-up groups leave much to be desired. I'm of the school that any exp is good exp and complete or fail I've normally had a blast on missions. <br />
<br />
Gotta admit, running blind as a bat back to the dungeon is oddly thrilling. Nothing like re-grouping and winning with 2 minutes to spare!<br />
<br />
Maybe once the bloom is off the rose it'll go back to where LFG was something to dread, hope not though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The casual player who has 90 - 120 minutes to play a few times a week. <br />
That's me.  54 non-guilded warrior who's still wearing some Cobalt and has always used spider silk/leather paddings as my primary source of equipment upgrades. <br />
<br />
And, BTW, I'm surprised at how many players like me there are.<br />
<br />
For me LDoN has been great.  I had stopped playing my main warrior altogether a year ago (and quit the game for a few months) just because getting a decent group in my playing time-frame was next to impossible.  But now, EVERYONE is in a hurry, so I can fit it in quite nicely. <br />
<br />
Experience is great and the rewards, in terms of equipment, are very worthwhile for me and within reach, though they will take some time.  For guys like me, the 442 plate is a significant upgrade in most slots, and the augments are a dream come true in terms of being able to do minor upgrades.  <br />
<br />
I have also noticed that more people's dungeon skills seem to be getting better as time goes on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats good for u guys, this expansion will let normal people upgrade because you are going to get your own named with nice upgrades. I recommend to any warrior 60+ to do hard even if you fail go for named. Get a decent puller and slower and your GTG , its basically 90+ hp items that arent easily obtained elsewhere and you wont have to shell out 100k. I was once in crafted at lvl 57 yes FIFTY SEVEN with an FBSS and lammy and maybe cobalt gloves till i started my guild, i know the pain in LFG with crap gear. if you just try a little bit in Ldon you guys could easily be at least at 8k hps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's kind of funny for anyone less than EP geared to complain about LDoN over loot.  Like someone mentioned up there, just suck up 200 losses and you can get crazy loot out of Hard mode that would be completely out of your reach otherwise.  Even the normal stuff has quite a few usable pieces and in general is pretty good at filling the odd hole you may have in your equipment.  <br />
<br />
Adventures are no more boring than XP grinding.  Of course the XP in a dungeon is less than grinding in a PoP zone.  That's the way it should be, otherwise there would be no reason to be anywhere else.  Hard gives a very decent amount of XP especially consider it's pretty charm friendly.<br />
<br />
Some of the item cost are out of whack like the +10 str + 10 int augment that cost 1150, but overall the item costs look fine to me.  I'm surprised you can buy 15/19 weapons for less than 1496 or backstab mod daggers that can potentially be 16/19.  Yeah that'd put the total weapon cost to 2.5K or something but you're talking about better ratio than anything before PoP for a rogue (minus akheva/seru bane).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like LDoN for the sheer fact you have a clock to race against and an objective to achieve. The dungeons give you a purpose for being there. After a week of LDoN crawling I was offered a tactics pit group where we all stood in one area for a while pulled mobs killed mobs and before LDoN that was an acceptable way to grind exp but it was so flipping BORING! Standing in ONE SPOT pull kill for hours...whoopdee do *twirls finger*<br />
<br />
LDoN keeps the group moving, the clock keeps the pulls nice and continuous and when you finish successfully you feel like you have succeeded at something, even if there was no loot gained. <br />
<br />
In all it's not a bad expansion for those times when the guild isn't raiding or out on some expedition.</div></div><hr />
