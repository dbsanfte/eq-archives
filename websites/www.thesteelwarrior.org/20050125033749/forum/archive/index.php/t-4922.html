<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first off, my magelo : http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=553993<br />
<br />
i just dinged 65, and did not upgrade my stuff for way long time since i was a smelly stinky bitchy twinky.<br />
<br />
i know i'm not that a crappy warrior but i'd like to improve myself even more :)<br />
<br />
so here are the questions :<br />
what upgrades could i get with let's say 1 group ranging from 62 to 65 ? (i've claimed in guild raids, since i'm already the best equipped war)<br />
<br />
i can think about ornate armor, but besides some nameds in BoT, where could i get some with one group ? (errr i have no flags btw :p)<br />
<br />
and what about the weapons ?<br />
for MT task i use BoC + SotB and think it's a fairly good combo (i have a CHoS banked, but it's note mine, have to hand it back soon). i just got a GSoT too (but i must admit i'm not a great fan of it... i hate the look :p)<br />
otherwise i got a WMBS for &quot;dps<br />
<br />
i know that you've been though all these tedious questions over and over and over, and i apologize sincerely... my question is not much as &quot;what should i get ?&quot; or &quot;can i wank on my magelo now ?&quot; but more : &quot;how could i get some nice upgrades now ?&quot; :)</div></div><hr />
