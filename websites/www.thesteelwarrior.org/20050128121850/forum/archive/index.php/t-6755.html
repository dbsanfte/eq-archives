Ok we all know the solo uses of the ToD<br />
open fight with ToD swap to prefer weapon after proc<br />
<br />
Is this also a good strategy for pulling in groups<br />
so ToD hopefully procs and acts like a preslow?<br />
<br />
Also if agro is generated by the weapon does it work<br />
off damage/delay, ie ratio or just damage?<br />
<br />
What other times do you use your ToD?<br />

Rangers (I think) also have a weapon that slows. Whoever slows the mob just /g %t SLOWED and everybody switches in their normal weapons.<br />
<br />
Slow is very good aggro and with maximum haste ToD does ok damage. But Warrior level DPS even with good position isn't enough to hold aggro. With a initial bow hit on incoming and a Provoke, you should be able to hold aggro with effort until the ToD procs.<br />
<br />
No, I wouldn't use it in a group that had a slower unless they were having mana problems and needed to med.<br />

The proc is decent aggro, but it's dps is very lacking, especially with a GSoT costing only 100p.<br />
<br />
For soloing, it's very useful, and for groups without a slower, it's quite nice.  But thats all I really use it for.  Though if your slower takes a while to cast, and you don't have a bard to preslow, then I could see using it for that.<br />
<br />
Earthcaller, one of the ranger epics, also is a 50% slow.  It is a dot too, and doesn't last as long though.  Bst epic primary also has a very similar proc to Earthcaller.<br />
<br />
Also if agro is generated by the weapon does it work off damage/delay, ie ratio or just damage?<br />
<br />
Dps aggro is based off of potential damage.  However, how often you do that potential damage is very important for aggro.<br />
<br />
But Warrior level DPS even with good position isn't enough to hold aggro <br />
<br />
Not entirely true.  For a long time I kept aggro pretty well with a Greatstaff of the Four Winds.  It's definately not EB level, but it worked.  Dps is an important part of aggro.  Going without haste while others have it will show how important it is (procs stay the same regardless of haste).  Sure if you have a ton of procs, it can work, but at the lower end dps does matter some.  Though procs are much more important (2 procs &gt; bit better dps and 1 proc).</div></div><hr />

Just not worth the loss of aggro/dps especially if its some normal exp grind place.</div></div><hr />

1. weak group overall<br />
2. weak mezzer<br />
3. weak slowers<br />
4. low mana pool healer<br />
5. I'm pulling and 1-4 above<br />
<br />
Lead off with agro weap, get 1-2 procs (WA4) then swap in ToD for 10-15 secs...with incite, pull agro and procs usually can hold agro through this period with ToD in.  Sometimes can get a lucky and get an early proc on toD which tends to save lives.  Must be very careful about timing and make sure you can gauge how much agro to draw before ToD swap.  I'd strongly advise against leaving ToD equipped.  I also wouldnt advise it unless you have WA 3+.</div></div><hr />

We had no shaman or enchanters (or clerics for that matter), but 2 rangers and 2 warriors kept everything slowed. Was real fun :)</div></div><hr />
