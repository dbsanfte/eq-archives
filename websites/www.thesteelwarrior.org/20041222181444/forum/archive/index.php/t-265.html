<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You dont kill scout - her spawn is 12 hours i believe.<br />
<br />
GEt the bag from the quest NPC, give it to scout. - but only as long as shes not holding a bag. IF shes holding a bag means someone else is doing the quest.<br />
<br />
ONce she gets the bag the giants will spawn by the lake. Grab the named and pull him to tunnel. Bring melees for this as hes immue to casters. I cant remember if slow sticks so may want to go defensive.<br />
<br />
Once he drops, loot the piece - cant remember what its called again and give it to scout. She will give you a robe, give her back the robe and get your BoB.</div></div><hr />

Also, if someone could post stats on the bracer I'd appreciate it.  (Can't access most game sites from work)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ratmandu</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quest starts in Skyshrine by talking to Commander Leuz!<br />
<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail Commander Leuz' <br />
<br />
Commander Leuz says 'Hello Ratmandu , Im the new commander of the Sky Shrine Militia. This group of Shrine residents and newly aligned outlanders are given various tasks to do for the benefit of the Shrine. Are you here to request a task? <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am here to request a task.' <br />
<br />
Commander Leuz says 'We have had recent news from one of our scouts in Western Wastes that there have been Storm Giants wandering the coastal area. We have not heard back from this scout in some time. What we need is a volunteer to go deliver some tools so the scout can accurately communicate what is happening back to us. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will volunteer' <br />
<br />
Commander Leuz says 'Very good! Take this to the scout and wait for them to return the report. <br />
<br />
The Commander will hand you &quot;Scout Tools.&quot; <br />
<br />
In the Western Wastes you can find Scout Charisa that stands on a hill just south of the Sirens Grotto zone. Handing her the Scout Tools gave this dialog. <br />
<br />
Scout Charisa says' Great! I was wondering when they would send someone out to give me these. In my haste and excitement of this new assignment I forgot these. This scout business is great I must say. It sure beats setting in Southern Ro studying the ruins. I've been following these Storm Giants for days. They've been wandering up and down the coast looking for something. <br />
<br />
Faction and exp <br />
CoV+ <br />
Yelinak+ <br />
Krozmek- <br />
<br />
This will spawn 8 giants near the shoreline just south of the Scout. Seven Kromzek Warriors and one Kromzek Captain. Harmony the seven warriors so that the Captain can be single pulled. Kill him and loot the Broken Disk. <br />
<br />
Give the disk to Scout Charisa. She'll give you a &quot;Scout's Note&quot; that you can return to Commander Leuz in Skyshrine. She'll also give you the Robe of Benevolence. <br />
<br />
If you give her the robe back, you will get a Bracer of Benevolence. If you turn the bracer in, you will get a Talsiman of Benevolence.</div></div><hr />

A little exp and faction.  <br />
<br />
How hard is the Captain once you get him single?<br />
Not hard.  Can't be slowed though.  With enough DPS, you should have him down before defensive wears off.<br />
<br />
What level Druid do you need to single pull?<br />
60+.  Depending on your group make-up, you may want to have the druid charm a bronto to add dps, too.  He/she can leave it at your camp while pulling the capt.<br />
<br />
Also, I have heard 8-12 hours on Scout spawn.  I've always gotten lucky and found her up though.  Druid can track her from SG zoneline.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If scout is up, take a good look at her, if she is holding a bag in her hand, then she wont start the quest, need to wait for her to respawn.<br />
<br />
Also I think I read that the Capt can be disease slowed but that may not be confirmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">he is slowable (very resistant though) &amp; single pullable at lvl 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Captain certainly isnt very hard.  Remember doing him with 4 peeps way back.  Had a druid harmony pull him then I tagged him and kited while the druid logged to her cleric.  Once the cleric was in pulled him down to the bottom of the tunnel (we had KoS peeps with us) and we killed him with 2x 60 rogue, 58 warrior tanking and a 60 cleric healing.<br />
<br />
fun fun fun~</div></div><hr />
