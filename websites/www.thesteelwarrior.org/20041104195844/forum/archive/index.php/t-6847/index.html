If I were you I would keep the fungi until 50+.  Prices on that item are not going down (at least on Sol Ro), and nothing will be better until later in the game anyway.  In fact, I can't imagine how 90k will allow you to purchase gear that will  be more useful than the fungi tunic (aka: the best twink item in the game) at your level. <br />

Looks like it. Nothing changed. Fungi is still a fungi.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">agreed that no upgrade will match the twink power of a fungi at your level. you earn 10k a week? sounds like you are one of the minority who learns to sell in the bazaar the tradeskill items you loot. doing great in that respect :)<br />
<br />
some keep their fungi at level 65. mostly those who do a fair amount of soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Other upgrades: Go to the bazaar, do a search for ac gear and sort by hp, then compare that to the list sorted by sta. 1ac = 6hp = 2sta (or whatever, something like that for your level). Ignore str, dex, agi, wis, int, cha and resists unless those are the only differences. Do this for each slot. Buy what you can afford and shop around. Fill the empty slots with anything, it's (by definition) better than nothing.<br />
<br />
Pick up some weapon that procs slow/snare/stun/hate/ac debuff at your level for aggro. I don't know for sure of any good ones at your level, and if not just look for ratio until ~ 40-45. Around then you should be able to get an aggro proccing weapon (and NEED it). If you do LDoN, just get the dropped augs for now and save points. Miragul's armor is great for the price once you can afford it.</div></div><hr />

You need another new thread for it Haass.</div></div><hr />
