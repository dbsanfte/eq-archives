<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Minowara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it happened: With the server reset on my birthday (June 11), I got my green and red scale leaving me with a trivial, semi-trivial, and mind numbingly hard encounter. I have left to complete my epic which I started so long ago:<br />
<br />
Plane of Fear: <br />
<br />
I have listed this as trivial, we have done the golems so far a few times, but no drops.<br />
<br />
Chardok Queen: <br />
<br />
I am not very familiar with this encounter. My guild has done this before, a long time ago. What happens when you engage the queen? How hard does she hit? AE spell? Soloed by a group of high level wizards that nuke her ass off? How long does it take to clear to her? Anything I should watch out for? Help me out on this semi - trivial encounter.<br />
<br />
Plane of Sky:<br />
<br />
This is what makes me cringe. All I heard about PoSky is that raids can take 8 hours or more, and sometimes people need to camp out and log back in the next day. How do I do this big fight?<br />
Is there any way to move quickly? Any good tips? I need all I can get for this big raid.<br />
<br />
Just some facts...my guild is about vindi level, we haven't tried him in a while though. On a good raid day we can have upwards of 45 people attending, a good majority of them 55+. On a different note, although I did want to do my epic by collecting all the parts and not buying them...how much typically does a Spiroc Wingblade MQ go for? And the ball of everling golem? I know that the chardok queen blade can't be MQ'd :confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help in advanced.</div></div><hr />

The fastest way to travel in Posky is to die and have necros summon corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In terms of sheer number of raiding hours, PoSky is probably the hardest.<br />
<br />
Isle One. Kill the Fairies. Loot the Rabbit's Foot (Check a guide and double check that, I may be wrong on which you loot). Kill the Princess. See Sirran. Give him the Foot, get key. Invis. Touch key to pit thing. Zone over. KoS island, with some wierd A name- Azaracks or somesuch. Pop invis and slaughter Island. Protector of Sky or some other named one last. Loot Mirrors. Kill named. Give mirrors to Sirran, get key, pit over. Non KoS isle. Pull/Kill. Gorgalesk Last. Key over. Horsey Isle! This stuff splits in 2 when it dies. Then that splits again. Tank each. It'll die, eventually. Kill named. Invis up. Key over.<br />
<br />
Bird Isle! YAY. After you hit isle, walk to left a bit. You'll see a safish spot, where nothing much pathes near. Assemble Raid. Camp out a cleric or pally your first time. You're probably gonna die your first time. Anyone who ever did this Isle either had some experainced people along to help, or died first time. Or their first time was level 65 with 162AA's or some other such nonesense.<br />
<br />
Send you puller out. Laugh as the Spiroc Lord DT's him for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
Rez the puller. Pull a train. Make it as small as possible. Kill Vanquishers first. It does NO good to kill anything but a Vanquisher untill the Vanquishes are dead- As long as the Vanquisher is up, they just instand repop. Once the vanquishers are dead, mop the rest. Leave Guardian and Lord alone. Once you kill your first wave of Vanquishers, log on your camped out rezzer, rez the raid, rebuff, etc, do it again till only Lord and Guardian around.<br />
<br />
Pull Lord away from where he spawns, but not close enough to aggro Guardian. Laugh as he DT's the first puller. Kill him. Sirran Spawns! Move to a new spot, far from Sirran and Guardian. See how lord Insta Repoped? Kill him. Lather, rinse, repeat untill your guild's rez-hotkey-hitting-fingers bleed or have enough WingBlades. Continue Raid, or jump off to zone to Freeport. SPLASH.<br />
<br />
From my book &quot;How to raid Sky explained in 60 seconds&quot;. Consult an actual guide site for additional or correct information. No warranty expressed or implied. I left out several important things because they are too hard to explain, and several more because I forgot them. Portions of this Guide are wrong- Well, it may only be one portion, and that's this statement that I have errors ELSEWHERE in the guide, but that's probably not the case. Raiding Sky is an important decision, and should not be soley based upon the ramblings of anyone, especially me. Batteries Not Included, but Mana Battaries avaible for sale on Isle 1. I forgot to mention at least one mobs that DT's, because I can't remember his name, or maybe I just wanted you to be suprised when he appeared as an add.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chardok- Quicker then Sky, this actually, IMO, requires more Firepower.  To get to chardok Royals- Zone In. Right at Fort. Down to a little Keep Area- The Bridge Keeper (PH An Ancient Guardian or something like that, big golem) spawns here. Take the 2nd left, it crosses over some water and you end up in undead. Go down. Enter Castle. Bear mostly left and go down. You'll find it. Consult a map.<br />
<br />
How to get there- AE! 2-3 or more chanters cast PBAoE stuns. LOTS of Wizzies, Mages, Druids, etc, cast PBAoE nukes. NOT rains. Not targetable nukes. You want the unlimited target PBAoE nukes, the ones that hit EVERY mob in range. Now, send you most insane pulled into the mess of mobs, and have him try to come back with as many as he can and still live. Pull straight towards the enchanters, like you are trying to train them. You are. The Unlimited Target Stuns from 2-3 enchanters mean the mobs can't attack- They spend the whole time stunned. The Unlimited Target Nukes mean they die quickly- Idealy, before the chanters run OOM and the raid suddenly has 40 mobs in camp.<br />
<br />
Use this method to clear to King. Pull him. Killl him. Normal Mob- AE is Gflux I think, casts Wizzy spells, or something.<br />
<br />
Move to where king was. Nice spot. Clear to queen. Pull her. SOLO.<br />
<br />
Queen- AE is Flamesongofro... it's an 850/tick DOT. Very hard to resist- In fact, bet that you won't. Have MA solo her.<br />
<br />
The King room has a little &quot;dip&quot; in it- You'll see. It goes downstairs. WHOLE RAID sits there, cept MA. MA is up top, soloing Queen. Cute! The AE never hits the raid! Raid can nuke, dot, fire arrows, throw hammers, or cheer from the pit. Just- Don't get hit by AE. Or you die.<br />
<br />
From Cyrz's &quot;How to wipe in Chardok in 60 seconds&quot;. Consult a map. Consult a Physcharitrist if you listen to me. Consult a dictionary so I can learn how to spell Phys... psh.... Shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Posky...never went, avoided it since guild had no desire to go there for the timesink. bought sprioc MQ for 40k on povar.<br />
<br />
Chardok is really not that hard...but need to use some care as you can snag a hella train and have both the king and queen with 10 adds cut through your raid.<br />
<br />
There is a really simple way to yank queen. Just note there is a trap as you get close that will drop u onto king and his minions...uhh, don't fall in.<br />
<br />
Pull king and his group and let your cleric squeal with glee as they get their epic piece. Have an ally person wait till yer monk pulls queen and her room near yer ally guy. Monk FD or dies, ally dude spam hails the queen. All her minions go back to the room, queen stands there waiting to take a dirt nap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;I am not very familiar with this encounter. My guild has done this before, a long time ago. What happens when you engage the queen?&quot;<br />
<br />
A lot of things can happen depending on the pull. :P<br />
<br />
She's single pullable though. And a crafty monk can get at least her and just  a guard or two. With tagger of course.<br />
<br />
&quot;How hard does she hit?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm a monk. I never got hit by her melee. But not hard I hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;AE spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not nearly as mean as it used to be. It's RESISTABLE. Bards make her trivial. VERY VERY trivial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soloed by a group of high level wizards that nuke her ass off?&quot;<br />
<br />
We melee'd her down both times we killed her. Lost some lower level melees due to the AoE and their low levels and bad resists. But the tank was alive, and the DPS crew (me, ranger and rogue) were all still standing easily.<br />
<br />
&quot; How long does it take to clear to her?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's the bitch. It's a long walk. And you can wipe out in both the entrance to the castle ... as well as in the library ... if you're not careful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything I should watch out for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
1) The trap after the library on way towards the king room. You'll fall right into king room, with full spawn. Not fun.<br />
<br />
2) Geometry. We cornered a mob, and it poofed in the geometry, returned to us with king and his guards. VERY MESSY (chanter was godly though that day, saved the raid).<br />
<br />
<br />
We did an all out royals raid one entire day. 3 kings, 2 queens.<br />
<br />
First king was the mess you heard about above. Next king was easy. Room was broken. No problemos.<br />
<br />
Pulling queen went well till I screwed up and we got adds halfway through the fight. Chanter did fine. Mezzed/Stunned controlled them. Was amazing.<br />
<br />
Queen got dropped like a sack of potatoes. She doesn't have that many HPs, and now that you can resist her AoE, she dies fast. Lifeburn helped, heh. But wasn't needed.<br />
<br />
King 3 was a joke.<br />
<br />
Queen 2 was us camping her room, keeping it clear and waiting on her repop.<br />
<br />
Everyone popped a disc and had some fun with the eye candy.<br />
<br />
Hardest part of Chardok is getting there, and having the people there who can manage the adds when things go wrong. If you can do that, you'll win easily. Recovery in there is a pain.<br />
<br />
Oh ... and for the bleeding obvious ... BRING A ROGUE.<br />
<br />
There's locked doors.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">another way (i heard this correct me if i'm wrong) get a rogue to sneak/hide then target each one with a ench to assist. zerg in nuke/melee queen and ench mezz others then finish off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tempur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've sort of heard Dobbo's way.  Take two chanters and charge.  One chanter on each side to stun lock guards while everyone else burns the queen down fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tamurlane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">get a 63-65 cleric for the way down. have him lead and pacify (whatever spell that is) all the mobs on the way down. you can get to the bridge without throwing a single shot. big time saver... or get a mage who is chardok allied to CoH you all down... you also need the rogue for the trap on the bridge.<br />
<br />
tamurlane<br />
<br />
edit.. by bridge i mean the last span before the castle, not all the crap on the way down... sorry.</div></div><hr />
