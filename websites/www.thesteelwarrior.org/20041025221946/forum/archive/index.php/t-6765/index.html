<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After careful review, it was discovered that a paladin switching time guilds bugged an instance. Well that was the theory after eliminating all other possible reasons. Never seen that before so I thought it worthy of sharing. Always good to blame it on the paladn )</div></div><hr />

I have no clue.<br />
<br />
I guessed that there were two guilds time enabled.<br />
One player changed guilds from guild A to guild B during a raid on time.<br />
The act of switching resulted in the PoTime bugged in some way.<br />
<br />
In short, I don't find this all that surprising.</div></div><hr />

Not so much a bug as working as intended... What I'd bet happened is more of this:<br />
<br />
Guild A with Paladin to guild hop has instance A and clears time.<br />
Guild B hasn't cleared time in their 5.5 days and has no instance<br />
Paladin joins guild B and is in the raid at the time that time instance starts.<br />
Instance logic looks and says no instance, no instance, no instance, OOK! Instance A, no instance, no instance.  K adding you to Instance A.<br />
Guild B now has 72 people (or however many show up for Stage 1 farming) set on instance A probably with a dead Quarm and they get ported out as soon as P1 is done.<br />
<br />
If that wasn't how it worked there WOULD be guilds setting up ringers and alts to try to clear 2/week and just add people that win P5/Quarm loot to the raid they weren't in...</div></div><hr />
