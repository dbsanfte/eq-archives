<br />
<br />
     also, im in need of a decent 1HB to raise my 1hb skill, anyone know of a quest or a mob that isnt too too high lvl i can kill for a 1hb or 2hb drop? im in a guild currently that has a mix of players, mostly lvls 35-60 i think. we could probobly handle small raids and what not.<br />
<br />
    (btw, i know this isnt the place but im having trouble loading UI's, i do everything the instructions tell me to do but when i go to load the UI in-game, the screen freezes like its supposed to before it changes,  but when the screen stops freezing its the same original UI, anyone know what might be wrong, or is it technical and ill have to call my jerk computer know-it-all uncle?)</div></div><hr />

open your uierror.txt file to figure out what's causing the problem.  There's probably an XML file that isn't compatible with the current animation.xml file.  UI will need to be updated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Coldain Ring Quest (http://www.red3.com/TWC/Quest/QColdainRing1.htm) <br />
<br />
It is pretty solid.</div></div><hr />

If your guild has a few folks in their 50s who are willing to help you, you could get them to fight at the entrance of Maiden's Eye from the Overthere zone-in. Mobs there drop the Gorgana spiked club, 12 dam, 23 delay, AC 5, STR 2. It's no drop, so you have to go with them and loot the thing, which means being careful going through OT and being very careful around the zone-in once your are in ME.<br />
Even without guild help, you can travel there and /ooc asking politely if anyone who is letting the weapon rot would mind if you looted it.<br />
It's not a quest, obviously, but weapon should be free and there is some risk in getting there.</div></div><hr />

Overthere is in Kunark, while Maiden's Eye is on Luclin. I think you meant to say Dawnshroud Peaks zone into ME.</div></div><hr />
