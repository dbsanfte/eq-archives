<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh GL. shes a royal PITA from what i hear.<br />
I cant even start to get my mind round a strat to deal with that aoe charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">last time I thought her and MAd I died around 7-8 times fight lasted around 30 min as well. This battle sucks. Well the first time it was kinda fun just to say we won. Stupid bard.Plus I consider this bad faction. Its now much more pain in the ass to work on Sseru head quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh this fight is real easy, don't see how you died so much, just hold aggro, get charmed, debuff, go back to fighting.  The single target charm is easy to deal with, open first buff slot, one person debuffing as you call out charm.  All it is is just a semi-long fight(30mins sounds way too long) but fairly nice risk vs. reward considering the mask she drops too bad it's pretty rare, but the belt is pretty good and the 2hb is alright provided the ease of the encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I fought her pre pop with around 20 ppl :) maybe thats why and charm was/is AE and we didnt find a way to remove charm then. Tryed that bard dispell song but it didnt dispell charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Her charm is a touch proc, unresistable.  Having 3ish tanks with someone dispelling each whenever they get charmed, and assist-healing works well for us with 2-3 groups (pre-ntov guild).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you dispell tanks you mean to tell me you buff her buffless? I guess that would have and advantage of people not beating on clerics. ohhh ya we also did her pre mod rod nerf so she probably have a LOT less hp now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-Kai-</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone else confirm 7 days?  I also hear 3 to 4 days somewhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahomn</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We used to do her regularly, she was 3-4 day spawn, we did her after the Modrod nerf and before, the fight still a long fight chasing her around the room, while your guildie is beating on you... Her charm isn't AE(its a proc and she is quite fast and can charm 20 players in no time. Really pisses people off because they can only have 1 pet ), its unresistable, and with cripple/slow it makes it proc less.<br />
Key to fighting her is dots, get those druids, Shaman's, necros earring thier money... She can shake off a melee by charm but can't shake off dots. Having 4 druids stacking dots cut the time down to kill her by half. She hits for 800 which is a pain, good way to start the fight is ranger tags and uses Weaponshield (20 seconds to land OOS, Tash, and slow) because uncrippled within her first rounsd of attack the defensive warrior is charmed and does you no good.  <br />
<br />
Her fight is tedious but worth the reward for up and coming guilds, those belts and Masks are graet upgrades<br />
<br />
<br />
As the question said, 3 days respawn, Spawns when servers come up. And she has a massive Faction hit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only killed her once and am indifferent to her and everyone else in Katta now,spent some time before in the vamp caslte so nto sure what my faction was at probably amiable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mrith</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">She is 7 days for us and does pop on server reset/after patch,she can be done with 20ppl but 3 tanks is a good idea,just have them leave 2 or 3 slots open in the front of all buffs and then when they are charmed just dispell them,fight takes forever but she can drop some nice stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've killed her a couple of times with 2 groups. It's just a long fight. Gotta have a few tanks and group them with some dispellers. When a tank is charmed somebody calls it, and the dispeller dispells them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saper</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">4 days for us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did Lcea for the first time last night with 4 groups.<br />
<br />
We had junk buffs, then everyone cleared the top three after buffs were done.<br />
<br />
Had druids assigned to dispell and people called names when they were getting hit by a charmed person.  All the tanks were taunting to stay on top of the aggro list.  The shaman eventually ended up near the top and had to zone to clear aggro.<br />
<br />
Died twice.  Started off with riposte, after that was going good for a while, then all of a sudden I was dead.  Never figured out what happened, but I got hit something like 8 times in a row.<br />
<br />
Fight lasted over 30 min.  One of the clerics went oom and suicided.  Less than a dozen deaths.</div></div><hr />
