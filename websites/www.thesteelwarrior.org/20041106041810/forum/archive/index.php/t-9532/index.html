<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bedan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a little feedback on which of these two weapons I should put at the top of my two-handed DPS wish list. I enjoy soloing and I'm wondering which of the two will serve me best in that capacity. I have heard and read many good things about both weapons so I'm a little torn on which one I should go after. I know both can do the job but I'm looking for any advantage that I can get. I'm not worried about the stat differences between the two weapons. I also have a good one-handed aggro set-up and will continue to use it when grouped so that is not a factor either.  <br />
<br />
My main concerned is with the DPS difference between the two weapons and whether or not the proc on either should have a big influence in determining which weapon I go after. Will the higher DPS of the VDD with its AC de-buff allow me to kill more quickly and fight longer between breaks then the slightly (?) lower DPS of the SEWS with its Rune III proc? I have some experience with rune procing weapons and I am a big believer in the added damage mitigation they provide in a solo setting. The SEWS also has a delay that is closer to the frequently mentioned &quot;sweet&quot; spot so I am thinking a straight ratio comparison is not a fair one in this case. I'd welcome feedback from anyone with experience with either of these weapons. Ideally I'd like to hear from someone that has solo'd with both weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My raw guess is that SEWS would be the better weapon from a soloist point of view.  Anything you can solo won't be dishing out massive dps, and with WA5 that's an extra 900 dmg you'd be mitigating.<br />
<br />
I guess if you wanted to get down to it, figure up how long it takes whatever mob you want to solo to do 900dmg on average.  Take that time and compare it to how much quicker you kill a mob with the VDD.  If the time bought you is greater than the quicker kill time then go with SEWS.  If kill time is much quicker than the time bought ... go with the VDD.  <br />
<br />
If none of these mobs have any chance of really killing, and you can kill multiple before needing a break, I'd probably go with the SEWS as it would allow you to take fewer breaks and perhaps even none at all.<br />
<br />
I've owned neither, so take my advice with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I own both, but can't say I've soloed too often with either of them. The rune would certainly help with mitigating damage, and depending on what you're fighting would possibly be the best choice. <br />
You could also augment either weapon with a guard proc from LDoN or a Dd proc to increase mitigation or dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Really, the rune 3 proc only mitigates around 700 damage per minute, with WA5, assuming the procs don't go off back to back. I'm guessing the greater DPS with a VDD would probably end up lowering the damage you take between the two. Also, the faster you kill the mob the sooner you can sit down and regen, which could get you killing mobs quicker over time even if you took more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tamov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Assuming you are killing stuffs that are soloable, i would assume that the mobs' dps is at most 60ish (that is 200 second fight before you die with 12k HP)<br />
Sews ~11.5 dps mitigated with WA5, ~ 20 pct mitigation.<br />
VDD, on the otherhand, does not do 125% the dps of sews. (so as to shorten the length of fight by 20%)<br />
<br />
For solo purpose i think i would go for sews.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suporma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I solo a LOT with the SEWS and I can't say enough good things about it. If you're soloing mobs that hit for less than 100 (IE clearing greenie trash) then you'll never have to rest. There's just no way they'll break through your rune, assuming you have full defensive, which I do. Even if they do break through, if you're in a time guild you probably have very high natural regen. It's just not even fair, you laugh at their pituful attempts to scratch you. <br />
<br />
In my case, the SEWS is my only agro weapon, so I had to put Anger III on it, but in your case, you can aug it with a lifetap! /drool... With the SEWS, most groups are very happy with my performance, as I'm sure they are yours too if you actually have better! When grouping with lower level friends, the fact this sword has AE agro is a huge boon. You can eaisily tank many mobs at once, and not lose agro to your friends who don't know which one you're attacking, or that cleric that heals and doesn't realize that the adds might break off and kill him.<br />
<br />
The SEWS in my heavily baised opinion, will make you the ultimate tank! You may not be able to keep agro as well as with the VDD on a single mob, but dammit, if they don't steal your agro, you are one badass tanking machine.<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider: I have WA5 and full defensive minus the OoW defensive, but I have very very little offensive AA. Things will die slowly for me no matter what. I'd have to actually get a VDD to try out the improvement in damage, but I highly doubt that it will beat out Rune III for soloing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have both. It really depends on your AC, HP and Def/Off AAs. If you have high AC with enough HP and def AA then go with VDD, if not go with SEWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are time enabled and want to solo, there is always the Timeless Coral Greatsword from phase 3 too... http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68199 ... 100 hp self heal, decent ratio and AC/HP...these start to rot in Time a fter a few runs, I picked one up for 5 DKP (lowest possible bid in my guild)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With 3ppm it only heals you for 300, versus the rune effect nearly 3 times the number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Was just giving another option :)</div></div><hr />
