<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doraar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I'm not a full 24/7/365 player but I play 50+ hours a week and I level pretty quickly. I was wondring if when I get to 65 if there would be any hope for me to get to the elemental planes. I mean with the amount I play would I even have time to get in a guild that could do it and keep up with them. Was just wondering if I could expect one day to get in the elememntals :D  <br />
Heh forgot to mention that I play probably 5hrs a day Mon-Thu. (Man school sucks lol) And pretty much whenever I want Fri. and Sat. and most of the day Sun. If ya understand what I just said lol lemme know what ya think<br />

<br />
I guarantee you can find someone to fight with that will get you through to E planes.<br />
<br />
That is 7 hours a day. Even the top end guilds on my server raid about 5 hours a day max.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you get all your levels and AA's and join someone who will outfit you enough to hang. Start with a guild that is just doing the first PoP fights (or first Ssra fights) and you will be in good shape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I joined an asian elemental guild a few months back. They required 50 AA s to join, which I didn t quite have at the time, but they let me join their raids. I play less than you do; certainly now I only play 3-4 days a week, but after I spent enough time with them they guilded me and I started earning dkp. Was funny to receive a BoC from the guild bank after only 2 weeks for very little dkp after my old guild had been struggling to even beat the AoW yet. <br />
<br />
It is in fact perfectly possible to go to the Elemental planes flagless if there are over 32 flagged people in the raid you are invited to (limit to how many people you can bring in tho). They did however reflag all the new recruits not long after. You were also expected to hand your account info over to another 2 members so they could PH on flagging raids (which I was thankfull for; and quite honestly someone in EP gear has allmost no use whatsoever for pp anymore so they can be trusted normally)<br />
<br />
They had just killed Xegony and F ro at the time and were starting on the Rathe and Coirnav, which was a really good time to join in retrospect as these raids require large zerg forces (60-80 people) and plenty of tanks (the number of mobs that need to be defensive tanked on the way to Fennin RO is huge for example; warriors go on a rotation to speed things up). Seeing as I was top tank in old guild, I was worried I wouldn't be tanking as much, but once I got some decent upgrades they threw me right in the rotation; after all, they need you to know how to tank stuff when not enough other warriors are on (has happened plenty now). <br />
<br />
Basically, the fastest way to see the EP s is to join a guild that s there and raids daily; Just get all the exp you can and upgrade as you go and probably you can apply to one. <br />
