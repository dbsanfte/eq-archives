<br />
I say bone to replace nerfing 3-4 of the spells they have<br />
<br />
<br />
too bad you would not see a patch message like<br />
<br />
We have limited the usage of low level stuns on mobs over level 55. To compensate we have added a new spell Force of Akera that is avalible at level 53 and will affect all npc's up till level 61.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells affected in this patch are<br />
Stun<br />
Cease<br />
Desist<br />
Holy Might<br />
Force<br />
<br />
Attemting to cast these spells on npc's above 55th level will result in a message indicating that the spell will not affect the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry pallys.. but yes your aggro lock is game breaking. Its too much. This would make the game a little more interesting becasue frankly its mind numbing in a pally tank group. no risk at all unless the cleric fell asleep and the other healers go ld.<br />
<br />
You still get a spell that can aggro them but just at a 90m cost and not a 35m cost.. and a longer recast time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1: When they changed stuns on test the first time to (x/55) they still drew aggro on mobs over level 55.<br />
<br />
2: Before they shiped LoY, SOE made the spell effects available on lucy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: It is a new spell idea being tossed around for Lost Dungeons of Norath</div></div><hr />

<br />
So Paldins can remain the preferred tank, can't let that end! Poor guys need better and new stuns, probably the only way the mobs will have their spells disrupted (like mana burn) will be by a Paladin using this spell (slam, stun kick, and shield bash won't work).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt it... they get this spell one level lower than another stun. sounds like a bone to me...<br />
<br />
could only hope though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember right, when for a short period it was believed that Cease and Desist had been changed to not be castable on level 55 + mobs on test(I believe Apothes was the one to prove this beliefe wrong), pallies where complaining that it would make real trouble for them breaking mez, limiting what they could do to gain agro before mez break.  New stun is no damamge, and a perfect level to help solve such a problem.  That, combined with a number of pallies on PoN thinking that that it means impending nerf of low level stuns against 55 + mobs, leads me to suspect that maybe SoE is playing with just such a nerf.  Untill more information is available tho, it is just a guessing game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah its a bone and couldn't possibly have a thing to do with the spell tweaks that SOE said they were going to do. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
( FYI: they messed around with the wizard stun around that level to remove the stun part and the paladin stun for that level to remove the damage part! )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">once more, keep in mind that many pre-Epic weapons used by warriors have stun/slow/snare procs.  Often these are low-level effects to which 55+ mobs are immune.  That doesn't stop warriors from using them for aggro.  The nerfs that you all so desire will hurt your brethren far more than they will hurt knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is a diffrance between a proc and a spell, they arnt subject to the same RNG resist rolls, i know this because i know a person with a EQemu sever (now shut down :*( )<br />
<br />
as far as im concerned its about damn time something was done, its bullshit that a jack of 2 trades can tank as well as me, wtf do i get for remaining pure? a few crappy passive AA's?<br />
<br />
(if you start the ignorant spouting about Disc's, need i remind you we get to use them once an hour maybe, while you get specializations in a school of magic of you choice, which dont have a refresh timer at all)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of procs are actual spells used by other classes that are grafted on to weapons, so yes anything that nerfs those spells is probably gonna nerf procs that are the same spell.  I'm not bringing up disciplines because most of us are aware that beyond Defensive/Evasive our disciplines see almost no use and we save those 2 for raid mobs and for when the $#%@ really hits the fan.<br />
<br />
I'm not doing backflips over reality that I play a pure tank who in xp group situations is less effective than a lower level knight.  I'm just saying that instead of blindly salivating over the thought of low level stuns getting nerfed people might want to keep one very important thing in mind...<br />
<br />
Nerfing the low level high-aggro spells doesn't hurt the high level knights at all.  My best friend in game plays a 65 Paladin who doesn't use low-level stuns.  Between Flash of Light, a couple of high level stuns that work on 55+ mobs, group heals, and spot heals, he still rarely runs oom.  A competant knight can hold aggro at will without using spells that don't work on 55+ mobs.  The low-level spells are just a nice convenience for them.<br />
<br />
Back to my main point.  Nerfs on these spells will hurt far more warriors than knights.  I think all three pure melee classes need help and I think PoP has been a world of suck for pure melees but I think that any fixes to be made should not involve nerfing other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasso</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think PoP has been a world of suck for pure melees but I think that any fixes to be made should not involve nerfing other classes. <br />
<br />
We have been in a world of suck from the the time the released luclin.<br />
<br />
Pallys/sk's are reaching and a lot of times passing us up as far as damage mitigation/aggro control/group usefullness/hp levels<br />
<br />
I say keep the hp/dm the same/ leave all the utility spells aa alone. As for aggro control<br />
<br />
ANY toon that has the same or damn close to the ac/hp/dm  of a warrior should not have instant 100% always work aggro control.<br />
<br />
This game is all about risk=reward<br />
with a warrior you have<br />
risk=reward<br />
with a pally its<br />
risk&lt;reward <br />
<br />
Due to the fact that a pally in crustation armor and a rusty 2 handed sword can use 14th lvl spells to steal aggro from a fully buffed bow carying 65th lvl warrior<br />
<br />
Risk would be if the pally got turned into paste if he did that.. but there is no risk. <br />
<br />
Aggro is broken.. Taunt is not. <br />
<br />
So what can be done to fix wariors?<br />
<br />
1. Give us the same type of aggro generation that pallys/sk's can get. This will break the game. as I said Snap 100% ewasy to get aggro = no risk<br />
<br />
2. Nerf pally/sk aggro to the point where it actually costs mana to keep that aggro. kei and 2 stuns = fm right now.. make it where if they chain pull and they have to chain cast the spells for aggro becasue the wizzy keeps chain nuking or the shammy got 4 resists, that there is a some kind of cost for this snap aggro.<br />
<br />
also i doubt that this will affect weapons as they proc.. you wont get a your target is unaffected message from those. I could be wrong though. Maybe they thought of that =p</div></div><hr />
