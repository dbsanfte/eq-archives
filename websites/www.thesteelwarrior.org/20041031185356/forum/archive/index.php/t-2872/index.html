edit: quest in a nutshell<br />
Marton Sayor in the cottage in Qeynos Hills is concerned about the safety of his infant son. He says he will give you the gnoll slayer long sword if you help him. Marton mentions a named gnoll named Lord Elgnub who speaks common tongue, and has threatened his family. Well, Lord Elgnub can occasionally be found wandering around blackburrow. He looks like a Splitpaw Gnoll and is approximately level 20. If you kill him you will get a lore/no drop item Baby Joseph Sayer. Take the baby back to his father and the grateful man will give you a Gnoll Slayer sword, which is a 1H slashing, 6/28 lore weapon, bane damage gnoll +5. <br />
<br />
He then mentions something about the true potential of the sword. If you inquire further, he mentions there was once an enchantment placed upon a gnolls eye which was embedded in the sword that gave the sword powers to protect against disease and call forth a wolf to fight for you. He then says this eye has been stolen, along with the only book that can restore the enchantment and eye to the sword. Go to Splitpaw and kill the following: <br />
<br />
1. A one eyed gnoll - Splitpaw <br />
<br />
He spawns in Paw right at the small campfire (/loc 600, -10). His placeholder is a Tesch or Nisch Mal Gnoll (brown gnoll) and his spawn time is 7 minutes. The one eyed gnoll is strictly melee and light blue to <br />
52. Drops Gnoll Eye - LORE NODROP <br />
<br />
2. A Lteth Val Scribe - Splitpaw <br />
<br />
He spawns in the corner of the little room (/loc 370, -30). His place holder is a Lteth Val Gnoll (white gnoll) and his spawn time is 7 minutes. There is another white gnoll in the room, closer to the center that is not the PH and is on a regular spawn time. The Lteth Val Scribe is a caster. Drops Journal of Enchantments - LORE NODROP <br />
<br />
<br />
Return the Gnoll Slayer, Journal of Enchantments, and Gnoll Eye to Marton Sayer and he will give you The Gnoll Slayer ( one that summons dog pet )</div></div><hr />
