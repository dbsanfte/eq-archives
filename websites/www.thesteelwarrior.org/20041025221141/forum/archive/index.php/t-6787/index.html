<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, this is probably old news that everyone but me already knows about.  But I took a little trip to the Abysmal Sea the other day with an alt, going spell shopping for a couple of different alts.  And when I jumped on the boat to leave, it headed into Natimbi (sp).  So I'm thinking, uh oh, better stay on the boat and not go ashore anywhere just to be safe since the toon was only level 54.  <br />
<br />
The boat docks near the merchants, and then heads out.  While standing in the middle of the boat not one, not two, but four mobs aggroed on my character as we're headed out of Natimbi.  Of course they were underneath the boat so I couldn't even target them to fight.  And of course because I'm on a boat, I can't cast any spells.  And of course the boat was moving just slow enough to make sure they stayed in contact.  So there I am, running in circles on the boat in hopes of avoiding contact long enough for the boat to zone, while my HP pool is dropping lower, and lower, and lower, with no options available other than jumping into the ocean and ensuring I die at sea.  Finally, just before the boat zones, I get whacked and my corpse drops through the boat to the bottom of the ocean.  Lovely.  I eventually bribe a Necro, after making my way back to Natimbi via Nadaria's landing, to corpse summon me.  A very nice end to an evening, thanks SoE.<br />
<br />
So here comes the rant part.  WTF is this?  How dumbass are they at SoE to design an expansion where just standing on a boat gets you killed and your body dumped out at sea?  Don't they do any fucking testing on any of this shit?  Did they fucking intend the boat to be a death trap?  Is that one of the &quot;trials&quot; of GoD I keep fucking hearing about?  The &quot;trials&quot; are really figuring out what dumbass untested piece of shit SoE has introduced into the game and how to figure out where the fucking &quot;land mines&quot; are?  No freaking wonder their crap is so broken all the time, they can't even get the simple stuff right!  Yeah, I know someone is going to respond with suck it up, it's a new cutting edge expansion, expect the unexpected, blah blah blah, but I'm sorry killing people for standing on a boat is just dumbass.  That's not challenge and that sure isn't freaking fun.  <br />
<br />
Okay, got that off my chest.</div></div><hr />

Don't swim across the water while the boat is going through the channel.  If it runs over you, you can get sucked inside of the boat, and are unable to get out.  Yes, inside.  If you are lucky you won't drown before you figure out WTF is going on.  <br />
If it happens, there is an invisible hole at the back side of the boat, under the water line, that might let you off before you get sucked into zoning into Abysmal Zone... err Sea.</div></div><hr />

I dont think you are the only one with these concerns and who is getting irritated about the last changes in the game (Hello... ppl falling thru the world... did you know that the bottom of Western Wastes is made of water? And you can drown if you fall under the world?)...<br />
<br />
/buys another round</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The sad part is that I have heard this same story since the day GoD came out so obviously they could care less about it. Just one of the numerous reasons I don't set foot in that expansion.</div></div><hr />

Boats are borked all over - people get stuck in them, or (for my part), the boat leaves the dock without carrying it's passenger, or passengers don't zone with the boat but just sit there, blocked by an invisible wall, near the zone line.<br />
<br />
Why I can swim anywhere I see water *except* where a boat goes, I will never ever understand.</div></div><hr />

That is so much fun!  Happened about 5 times while hunting for Yellow Tide Feaster Bile (thank god they upped the drop rates, fucking annoying camp).  Luckily the mobs don't see invis, so if you invis before getting on the boat, it can help (if it doesn't drop).  Still an ass thing though.  Also, if you are leaving Abysmal and want to go to Nedaria, when the boat zones in it says which zone is it coming from, so you can wait and not even have to zone to natimbi and will still get back to nedaria in the same amount of time it takes to ride it through natimbi and back to abysmal then to nedaria.  There is only one boat.  Also, if you do go to natimbi, you can use the Magus at the camp where it docks to just port to nedaria.  I agree that the shit shouldn't happen, just mentioning the work around.<br />
<br />
Also, what is so great, is that the underwater mobs run, and all but the lobster things can not go on to land.  But when they run, they path to the land, and go under the land where you can't see / hit them.  They will do the same if you run from them, except then they will continue to hit you and you can't fight back.<br />
<br />
Another bug is that if you are lev'd, the boat will leave you behind.  I had lev'd myself before getting on it, so I could just run to the big boat instead of waiting on the small one to move again, and it just left me behind.  Luckily 100k horse can out run it, so I ran up over it, and clicked off lev, which let me zone with it heh.</div></div><hr />

Huzzah, boat gnomes!<br />
<br />
The only boat in the game I like so far is the one from Stonebrunt to Gunthak ... using the l337 power of Imagination(tm) I can imagine the stuttering graphics, checkerboard blue tiling, and oddly sharp angled turns that comprise an EQ boat ride ...</div></div><hr />

At least the Iceclad boat doesn't motor you to your untimely demise for no better reason than you happen to be riding it.  I still can't get over the concept that SoE released an expansion to production with the boat that goes through the very second zone in the release running through the aggro zone of a number of mobs and not doing anything about it.  It is a total and complete &quot;do'h&quot; to me, a Homer Simpsonesk kind of thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I place my bets they will say &quot;but we made it so noone has to bother pulling, everyone has their pack of mobs as soon as they hit land on the docks, and can start killing! no need to go pull!

<br />
And monks will say Boats stole their pulling role :P (no offense intended to monks hehe).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I seem to remember boats were added about 2-3 days before GoD release so not much chance to test them, I did most of my  testing /bugging the directx9 engine which was too buggy for release, and was scrapped about a week before release. At least people aren't placed 30k in the air while moving over any object placed on top of the main matrix like  a rock, then fall to their deaths then the corpses are put on top of the skybox to make pretty twinklies in the sky anymore :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amazing, so how did they expect people to get to the GoD zones, or hadn't they considered that?  *boggle*  Apparently they hadn't.<br />

Uhm, yeah, I suppose you have a point there.  That would have been even more dumbass.</div></div><hr />
