<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tildorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone – first time poster. I have a question about which weapon is best in the primary hand in order to keep aggro. I’ve always heard that the weapon that does the most damage should be in your primary. However, just recently I was given “tip” from a higher level paladin, he said that a quick weapon in primary would hold agro better. His reasoning was that I’d be taking full advantage of haste effects and hit more often (which more causes aggro). Currently I’m using the Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn combination (Copper Hammer of Striking as my primary). But don't know whether I should switch per his advise.<br />
<br />
He also mentioned that a two-handed could generate more agro (if I found a good one). Is there a good, buyable two-hander out there reasonably priced? I already have a Greatstaff of Thunder but I was looking to upgrade.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buyable 2Her I think the GSoT is the best you can. I am in the same postion really I have the GSoT auged with 125DD/stun from Guk and I use that for hard LDONs and in times where repost are a possible problem. For DWing if you are asking which order to use the 2 weapons you said I would use them just as you are (Hammer in main and sword in offhand). Read this thread:<br />
<br />

<br />
It talks about the agro from damage and seems to show that you will probably get more agro from the damage of a 2Her but of coarse it does not proc as much as DW 2 double proced weapons. Not sure where the thread is on proc rate but basically the faster the weapon does not mean it procs more. Proc rate is the same across most weapons except a few that have hieghtened or lessened proc rates but it is only like 13 warrior usable weapons if that much. So with 305 DEX it is 2 procs per minute as far as I know and half that in offhand. And if you aug it the aug procs at the same rate so in DWing you would proc 3 times per minute vs. 2 procs for a 2Her but the 2Her gets more DPS agro so it is possible it all balances out in the end.<br />
<br />
SO. for buyable 2Her I think you have the best and configuration of the 2 1H weapons you said I think you are doing it the best personally (to my understanding).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The math on the CHoS and SoBS show that they are virtually identical in terms of agro.  General consensus is that it really doesn't matter what hand the droga wepons are placed in - you won't notice a difference.<br />
<br />
On the 2H, yes a 2H weapon can hold agro as well as dual wield, depending on the weapon.  However, the GSoT is a) an excellent agro weapon for where you are in the game, and b) nearly identical to the droga weapons in terms of agro.  In addition, you'll be hard pressed to find better than the GSoT for a long time.  If you want to go 2H, go ahead and equip the GSoT - you'll likely see no real change in agro (which is good).   What that means is you can go 1H or 2H depending on the situation and you'll be that much more better of a warrior for having flexibility (I find that 2H weapons are great vs. hard hitting mobs, the 1H combo is great when I need to grab faster agro in LDoN's). <br />
<br />
Best upgrade option for the GSoT?  Hard to say - if you want more DPS try getting a Greatstaff of Four Winds and augmenting it with Anger III.  Otherwise, you can put a Ykesha proc on your GSoT for more agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use a SoBS in off hand and I found a nice 13/21 (decent stat 50hp/40 endurace 1hs that procs a 2-3 sec stun and 30 DD last night in bazaar) for my war.  Ran out did a nro ldon and even if taunt failed on first try still keep good agro over the necro/wiz/bl and bard in group using just bellow on inc and them.</div></div><hr />
