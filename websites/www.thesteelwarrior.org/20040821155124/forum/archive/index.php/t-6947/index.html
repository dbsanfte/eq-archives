<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">fastest way is playing 90 hours a week. well everyone knows that. but im not interested. i am however perfectly ok with 15-20 hours a week on my warrior. so then what is the most time-efficient course of action to better my toon given my time constraints? ill give you two plans to start the discussion rolling:<br />
<br />
1) join uber guild and follow their rules and requirements. i must spend a lot of time raiding with them or i get deguilded. of course if i dont spend time with them then there is no point joining anyway. raids provide poor experience and zero loot except for the drops my benevolent GL allows me to loot which are few and far between. i gain a few gear items that are above and beyond what i could ever obtain without the guild but my aa progression is hampered.<br />
<br />
2) stick to groups of 6 and fight in spots where experience gains are rapid and share the loot with the group. in this case loot is much better so i buy most of my equipment. some items i may get from ldon merchants as well. my aa progression is rapid.<br />
<br />
my argument for years has been that plan 2 is a faster means of character progression for the player who cannot or does not want to spend more than 20 hours a week on a character. its also more fun because 6-player groups stress good play on the part of all involved whereas raid encounters only require good play from a select elite few of which the 20-hour-per-week player will never be one of them.<br />

<br />
It will take you alot longer to gear up in LDoN then it would in a raiding guild, but given time constraints it could be nearly impossible to fully gear up in a raiding guild with a limited amount of play time, and you wouldnt be progressing AA wise as you noted.<br />
<br />
Do a few LDoN's everytime you jump on.  Get those AA skillls you need, and over time some pretty nice gear/augs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Two things you can do: <br />
<br />
One, get a higher level friend to come along and help with heals and/or damage shields (etc.) This is called &quot;power levelling&quot;. You will move up quickly. The down side is that you won't learn how to play the class and your skills will all suck.<br />
<br />
Two, fight in the zones with the exp modifiers. Paludal Caverns is the most famous, but there are lots of others. As you move up in level, watch for the &quot;hot spot&quot; zones. The down side is that you'll be dealing with idiots and trains (and sometimes trains of idiots). Your skills are also likely to be non-maxed if you do this.<br />
<br />
On a side note, why do you want to level him as quickly as possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL i may not have been clear enough. my warrior is level 65. i still want to grow him. i tried the miracle grow but it didnt work. is the fiber kind really better? i like the powerleveling from a friend idea though :). i think paludil might be a little low for me. i keep trying to kill the nexus scions but with all the deaths i think this isnt going to work out. the plus side is i die so fast that when i get my rez at least i know i didnt waste a lot of time on the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You have an odd opinion of what guilds are like... Your benevolent GL LETS you loot? Most guilds use point systems by now, if they don't, they're PROBABLY not worth joining, though there are a few exceptions... Most of those being guilds you'd have no shot at anyway. <br />
<br />
Anyway, if your already 65, and have DECENT gear, theres not much left except to find a raid guild. If you can put in FOUR hours of raiding a day, for 3 - 5 days a week, they will probably take you. You can gear up rapidly in guilds, despite your apperant belief that you have to compete with 50 people for every single drop, on the 1 - 2 pieces of loot that drop every month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you are 65 and already have 600 aa then theres not much left except to find a raid guild.  but if you have 30 aa....<br />
<br />
the real tradeoff here is between loot and experience. which is more important. raids in general provide poor experience but good loot. both grow a toon but in different ways. all no drop gear will eventually become obsolete. need i point out how many banked warrior epics there are? aa never becomes obsolete until you cap it. improved gear enables faster experience gains. so its a matter of tradeoffs. how much present day experience am i willing to give up for how much loot? how much will that loot help me in the future to make up the experience that i lost getting the loot? if i have only 20 hours a week to play and my guild requires 12 hours a week to be in good standing would i be better off powering my aa in exp groups instead of seeking guild loot on raids? would the quick ramp up to high aa level make me more desirable to a good guild next year than i would have been if i exped less but had better gear?<br />
<br />
where do we draw the line? how many hours a week do i need to play total for it to be worth it to join a guild that requires 12 hours of raiding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are trying to&quot;grow&quot; your warrior, I must ask, to what end?  For me the reason to play this game and advance my character is  to have fun and see different content.  I personaly don't see the fun in playing LDoN all the time but if that's what you enjoy then do it.  Half the fun of having a high  level toon is pulling a victory from the jaws of defeat.  High end kills are about the accomplishment first and about loot second.  I also see one flaw in your arguement... if you are experiece grouping in LDoN or BoT then you are by no means making the most of your available time.  If you raided 10-15 hours a week and did exp in elementals with the rest of your time you would see new, exciting content and likely make MORE experience.  A good elemental group can earn one AA every 30-45 min, something you can not even approach outside elementals at lvl 65.  Then consider the time you spend LFG vs the number of guild friends available at anytime - especialy right after a raid and I think you may well see that the real AA advantages would go to those who are guilded.</div></div><hr />
