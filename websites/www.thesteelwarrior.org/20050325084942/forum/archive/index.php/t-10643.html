<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone else having aggro issues in this trial? I did this trial yesterday and it went absolutely HORRIBLE. I couldn't hold aggro for the life of me, and I have no idea wth was going on. Is there some kind of &quot;de-aggro bonus&quot; on melee attacks in this trial?<br />
<br />
On the way to the trial, I lost aggro twice in about an hour of clearing... once when the rogue got a lucky string of crits, and once when the ranger snared on incoming and I wasn't anywhere near the mob. However, DURING the trial the wizard would get aggro after a single spell casted (even if he waited till 80% to cast) and the rogue was constantly battling me for aggro. The only reason I didn't have any trouble from the ranger with aggro is because he was offtanking. <br />
<br />
Now I may not have the best aggro weapons in the game...but I have pretty damn good ones. Both of my weapons are better than 1:1 ratio (24/20 and 28/26)<br />
both of them have two stun procs, and I have an Orb of the Sky for Call of Sky aggro procs. That's roughly 250dps AND 6 aggro procs, yet I stil couldn't hold aggro for shit.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea what the deal may have been?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayida</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I typically hold aggro on 2-3 mobs in this trial with no real problems.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes aggro has appeared to be slow to take hold to me, but I'm generally adrenelin pumped on group trials and when I say &quot;slow&quot; we're talking a second or two *maybe*.<br />
<br />
I try to stand slightly in front of folks in hopes of getting as much incoming aggro as possible, then pick up the first one, hit attack, hit bazu, then switch immediately to a 2nd, get a successful taunt on it, then cycle through whatever is in camp, keeping future chain bazu to keep aggro off the shaman and cleric. <br />
<br />
When I can get 4 in camp early I'll hit AEt because if your dps is up, that's the only time you'll have that many around.<br />
<br />
Tell your people to stand at your shoulders so that mobs are constantly in range to you, having someone back off so that they are out of taunt range is the single greatest problem I find in keeping aggro on multiple mobs.   My necro runs out of range all the time but I trust he can handle it or he'll run back. <br />
<br />
Just my .02 worth, and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aggro is fucked up in destruction.  We had myself and a sk with all his new aggro tools and neither of us could reliably hold aggro.<br />
<br />
Key to this trial is making sure everybody in the group is beefy enough to take several rounds or even straight up tank a mob without a chance of oom'ing the cleric etc.<br />
<br />
Regardless, we won.<br />
<br />
My favorite anecdote is losing aggro to the bard:  Mob pops while sk rog and i are beating down on 2 mobs in camp.  Bard tags it and brings it back for SK to offtank.  Bard comes back to my mob whacks him once and suddenly his name pops up in HoTT box (keep in mind i'm proccing a decent amount in his absence).<br />
<br />
Methinks the trial is built to have fucked up aggro ... honestly how would this particular trial  be a challenge otherwise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mobs in trial either chain blur or they must have like a -75% aggro thing to all plate tanks.  But like what's said above, if they don't do that the trial will be pretty trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok well now I know...high AC/HP rangers rogues and shamans are the only non-plate classes I'll be taking with me. The wizard died way too fast for the funky aggro in there.<br />
<br />
I've done and won this trial before...but we had 2 warriors and a paladin that trial, so I guess the aggro thing wasn't as noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman bard rogue shad war cleric for tehwin.<br />

Mobs in there hit very weak.  If your casters have strong gear they'll be fine.  I would add &quot;necromancer&quot; to the list of amazing classes in there right along with rangers etc.  Good necros with their channeling aa's can solo these mobs with straight up taps/pet.<br />
<br />
These guys hit for a good deal less than 1k and have moderatly low attack.  It's just a dps fight that measures your group by the weakest link.  Everybody will get beat on ... its jsut a matter of do you have enough dps and hps to plow through it.  If one of your casters dies or some folks drain the cleric dry the mission is practically a loss.  You'll never get your kill quota.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelyan</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i'm not sure about the aggro issues, but i did destruction the other day with a 10k hp time geared tank using a dbotw and demerix. He had like 220 aa though, and his aggro was questionable at best, but we still managed to win the trial. My advice is just to not worry about it. I did it with a rogue bard war shm cleric and necro i think? (forgot last class heh) Anyway as its been said the mobs only hit for about 600 max, i would compare them to wos trash mobs in terms of difficulty. If your group is decently geared you should be able to wipe them out without any problems.</div></div><hr />
