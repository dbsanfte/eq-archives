Are parry3 and dodge3 the highest out there atm?<br />
Do you notice quite a difference since you got an item with the effect?<br />
Besides the tailor made dodge3 and king belt or harrier neck for parry3, are there easier ways to get the effects?<br />
Whats the shielding cap and the avoidance cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shielding cap is 35, avoidance cap im not sure on, but i want to say 60, dont quote me there.  Dodge and Parry 3 are the highest in each at the moment.  Yes the difference is noticable, but you really have to parse in order to tell.  <br />
<br />
The only easy way to get the effects if you cant kill the mobs is to try and make the augments with the effects, but they are extremely hard to do because of the success rate and the drop rate of the components.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The combined increase of parry 2 and dodge 3 was somewhere in the realm of 3.5-5%, though its hard to nail down to any exact or scientific measure.<br />
<br />
with max defensive aa's, 2500ish ac, im averaging about 56% avoidance through all means (mob misses, dodge, parry, etc).  below is the stats from my current log file, which is a completely random sample of fighting, rs, mpg, wos, qvic, time, etc etc...<br />

times attacked: 7780<br />
times hit: 3449 (44.3%)<br />

<br />
Just wondering why you list your ac and say you average about 56% avoidence?  I believe it was established that ac does not increase your avoidence nor dodge.  IE the test is to take off all your armor let a moss snake try to hit you and find out how many misses / dodges you have over X amount of time.  Now put on your armor and you'll find the misses and dodges are the same (provided you have no + to dodge / avoidence on your equipment).<br />
<br />
Raw AC has nothing to do with avoidence.  However, if you were just letting us know how much ac you have then thats pretty impressive ac  :) <br />

<br />
Avoidance 100+ (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=869262) <br />
<br />
Can also confirm that avoidance above 100 stops giving any visible AC.</div></div><hr />

Failed final combine and lost 3 cut stones before finally said screw it.  Now just need to get to 35% shielding and some more avoid</div></div><hr />

any parses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen the same thing as Dima on these boards.  Someone also said they thought it stopped avoiding at 75.  Honestly I think 50 sounds right, thats a 5% increase in avoidance across the board.   10% seems like an awful lot to me when you consider the melee focus give what, 1.5 to 2% at level III?</div></div><hr />
