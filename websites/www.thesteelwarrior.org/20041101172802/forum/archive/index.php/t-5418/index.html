<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have tanked her twice so far with good sucess as far as keeping her on me and her back faceing other peps. I now have a clicky Helm with illusion of Human on it, When i tank her in one of the cracks i still cant see to get her AOWed enough to SEE MY Target...Sugestions and thoughts on this please. Ps. have tried Wood Elf and Gnome on her too still get (you cant see your Target /sigh the price you pay too be an Ogah...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No personal experience with Aten, but there have been times when I've had to hold the back key, to keep my target in view and cornered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being a Barbarian, I used to have no trouble cornering Aten. The last time though (August), we had issues...even being in Gnome illusion. So we just ended up wall walking her. It may be because you would get caught up somehow and not be flung up into the air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">err just pull her into the room you click up in... 90 degree corners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pin her in one of the obtuse corners of her room just left or right of door. MA along the wall, everyone else except rogues melees her side. Works fine and don't need to walk her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I sometimes get the &quot;cannot see target&quot;  message while tanking her AoW-style in the corner... but for the most part I can make small adjustments and keep aggro and keep her pinned fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love it when it says &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; and you think, &quot;yes i bloody can, it's this 20 foot woman with huge boobies in front of me&quot; Dumb game lol<br />
<br />
But we've been tanking AHR at the obtuse corner to the right of the door in her room...MA side on hugging the wall, rogues can then fit in behind, and the rest of the melee spread around...often have a few warrs at the front to keep steady, and they get a little riposte damage and need to watch out on enrage...but overall its cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so you progressed from wiping on hydrotha to having problems with AHR ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe he changed guilds?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">so you progressed from wiping on hydrotha to having problems with AHR ? ....I dont have any problems keeping her on me come on read what i stated..As from that squid we got the strat down finaly for him it was all about where to place him and try to keep him locked down, Yes i changed Guilds took a step down from the guild i was in and joined with some friends. I really thought that i stated that i wanted to just be able to HIT aten more is all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Trondir update your Magelo lets see what goodies you have since you seem to know everything and want to make comments like that ....ummm LOL nevermind your Retired =0...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what we do.  Works like a charm.</div></div><hr />

so you progressed from wiping on hydrotha to having problems with AHR ? :)  <br />
<br />
Great, quit the game and post flames here, go away, don't you have a WoW beta to sign up for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You don't need to pin her on a corner, tell your raid to stop relying on everything for a corner-afk-fest pin. The walls work fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is Slammer we're talking about ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Then on with the background infos!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">in half elf form i see them, err, her, umm, them boobz on aten just fine ^^<br />
<br />
but them corners work okay; just the push sometimes sucks but for the most part...it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have not tried High elf form will do next time. Thanks for the heads up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Smallest non-enchanter-minor-illusion player model in the game so far is a double shrunk skele.  Use an AoN then get 2 shrinks and you should be good to go- if it CAN be corner tanked, that combo will work as well or better than any other.  On some fights (AoW for instance) height difference between center of mob and center of player may be too much for AE taunt to work, but otherwise it's the way to go.<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. if a pet gets behind you into the corner somehow, you are out of luck... happens occasionally on popcorn mobs (i.e. ones that cast gflux/knockbacks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yup, get skelly or elf illusion with 2 shrinks works fine. One of our warriors refuses to use it though...so stuff doesn't get cornered. it's annoying. Anyway, i've cornered it with elf illusion. If you don't have a crown of deceit and a cobalt bracer, get em :P<br />
Oh, and if you're having trouble getting back into the corner, duck to get in there. Works sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">ahh good to know I have AoN,crown and bracer hitting VT in 2 weeks :)</div></div><hr />
