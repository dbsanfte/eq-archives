<br />
I just thought I'd zip in and say hi.  Also, I have wondered why the big focus on the taunt issue.  Now, as a shaman I am very aware of agro issues but I think that is pretty much balanced with hit points, ac and defense disc.  Anyway, my 2c is that the real issue is the ability for warriors to get exp groups because we all know your raid importance.  I suggest that the easy fix is  Sony improving warrior damage a bit it to allow warriors to grab a DPS slot in group (in addition to the customary Main Assist).  More damage is good for all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are lots of DPS classes.  Monks and Rogues don't need to be muscled out of groups by Warriors taking DPS slots.  Just as Shamans don't need to be muscled out of groups if SoE decided to give Beastlords a better slow that was almost as good as Shaman slow.<br />
<br />
The fact that you can even suggest that Warriors should be upgraded in DPS so that they can move out of the MT slot and into a DPS slot shows that there is something seriously wrong with how things are currently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I went onto shaman board pretending to be a Beastlord and made a case for Beastlords getting a malo type spell, how do you think the response would go over?  Beastlord slow isn't a HUGE issue because it's often resisted and the beastlord has no way of debuffing resists to increae landing, making the Shaman a CLEARLY better slower than the beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Beastlord slow isn't a HUGE issue because it's often resisted and the beastlord has no way of debuffing resists to increae landing, making the Shaman a CLEARLY better slower than the beastlord.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, enchanters have a slow just as good as beastlords and enchanters can debuff magic resistance. But, shamans are still superior slowers because not only is their slow better than both classes, but they have an unresistable resistance debuff (Malo/Malos). Beastlords cant lower resists, and as far as I know enchanters dont have an unresistable Tash spell.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and to top it all off, shamans have a separate line of disease-check slows and a separate unresistable disease resistance debuff line (so if the mob has ungodly magic resistance they still might be able to slow it with the other line).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This may not be on topic with the post, but I'm sick of shaman whining about 65% slow. Like Frodlin said, it's easily resisted, and it's not a gamebreaker at all. But let's compare for the sake of comparing, ok?<br />
<br />
Turgur's (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1588&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Sha's (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3462&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
As you can see, Shaman get better slows at 51, a nice comfort level for me I guess. Plus, like Sturgis said, beastlords have no way of debuffing the mob through spell means, so you're pretty much stuck chain casting until you can get it land. <br />
<br />
(By the way, if you get it to land, prepare to become the new MT :D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just wanted to point out a few things. <br />
<br />
-- An Enchanter's highest level slow spell (Forlorn Deeds) is 70 % and all forms of Tash (magic resistance debuffer) are unresistable. <br />
<br />
shamans are still superior slowers <br />
<br />
I'd have to say Shaman's are generally better slowers, because their slow is better and they can heal themselves if need be. However, I have seen on many occasions an Enchanter easily slow mobs that a lot of Shaman's seem to have difficulty with. Mobs that come to mind are some of the nameds in Bastion of Thunder. Anyways, just wanted to add that. :p Any slow is a good slow when you have mobs pounding on you! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The salient point is that even where classes have abilities close to  a 'core' classes ability, the 'core' class still has a clear advantage that keeps him ahead of the game. Warrior mitigation, as we all know, is no longer such a clear advantage. Indeed knights argue (unfortunately with 'some' truth) that they need to be near equally efficient to have a group role (tank). At this time their mob control gives them a clear advantage that often far outweighs a minor warrior mitigation advantage in the general perception.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hi friends again. Lol, these boards are as testy as the shaman ones for sure.<br />
<br />
Anyway, maybe a little clarification is in order.  First off may I say that  I personally am nearly ambiviliant about which tank to have in an experience group for the main assist unless I'm the only healer/slower in a group (then it is almost impossible with a warrior).  My &quot;problems&quot; with warrior agro were my own darn fault because I wasn't adjusting my casting accordingly.<br />
<br />
Now we all know perception is more important than reality.  This is especially true about getting into experience groups and I'll focus on the 65 game since I've played here for so long.  This is a fact - lots of groups will hold out to try to get their perceived &quot;perfect&quot; mix of classes.<br />
<br />
Let's take a look at this and ignore DPS classes which I think are pretty much balanced and interchangable. <br />
<br />
TANKS: Today's &quot;perception&quot; is that Pally/SK is better tank for exp group.  I'll say they are easier to work with - not necessarily better and we all know that most peeps will gravitate towards he &quot;easy&quot;.  So, what to do?  What should be done to warriors to make them a viable choice in an experience group and not to screw a Pally/SK.  This is where I get back to my prior post suggesting increasing warrior damage rather than increasing taunt or mitigation.<br />
<br />
Versitility is the key.   Warriors will still get tank slots - they are not shut out by Pallys/SK's in this role (lets get serious).  It's that last available spot in a balanced group that is the x factor.  If warrior damage was increased a bit they may get that last spot if no pure dps is looking for a group.  As it stands right now most groups will hang at 5 peeps waiting for a dps to show up.  Im not saying that the change should infringe on the DPS classes viability in a group, just make the warrior a somewhat reasonable addition.<br />
<br />
THAT solves the problem.<br />
<br />
Just as an aside, the other real issue on that 6th spot is peeps thinking that they NEED a cleric in every group.  This &quot;reserved&quot; spot screws druids (everyone knows this) and also makes many groups healer heavy.  This affects warriors getting into groups.<br />
<br />
Oh, and shaman don't get into groups solely for their &quot;uber slow&quot; - they are pretty much interchangable with chanters and beastlords on that.  Shaman get into groups more readily than other classes because they are often a viable &quot;6th group member choice&quot;.  THINK ABOUT THAT FRIENDS.<br />
<br />
That's enough for now.  Have a nice day friends.<br />

<br />
Run away while you can :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For future reference, class balance discussions go in the War Room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What you're saying is that because Warriors are currently perceived as the last choice for tanking, that they need the versatility of another role to fill when they can't get that tanking slot.  Not a bad thought per se, but Knights themselves have frequently argued that they need to be nearly equal to a Warrior as a tank because they don't get many groups based on their many other abilities.  Now, why should it be that Warriors should be changed in order to fill a secondary role that they're not particularly well equipped for, to allow another class to take on their primary role, when that other class is already far more capable in secondary roles than the Warrior?  Particularly when people aren't going to want the Warrior for that secondary role all that much anyway?<br />
<br />
The obvious conclusion is, fix the Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I already do replace shamans in exp groups with BST.  The new slow will help that become even more effective.  I don't really care that much about slows, as long as they are at least 50%.  Healing mana is almost always fine, as long as it's slowed somehow.  Problem is I usually can't even find a slower of any kind at all for exp groups...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, enough from me, just spent 2 hours LFG in PoTranq along with 5 other 65 Wars.  And of course no slowers were LFG so that I could 2 box my cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I didn't make a warrior to be damage dealing class, period. I made him to tank, not to be 'filler'. The thought alone pisses me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LOL, ok last try here.<br />
<br />
It seems like many folks here want to be thought of as main assist tanks only.  Well, I suppose that is fine but keep in mind that groups only usually need 1 of these characters.<br />
<br />
I never suggested that warriors move out of the main assist role,<br />
in fact my point is that I am firmly convinced that Sony has attempted and has done a pretty good job in making the choice of a main assist tank pretty much a tossup.  But, the &quot;perception&quot; of many peeps are that Pallys/SK are better because of &quot;ease of play&quot;. <br />
<br />
Since perception is &gt; reality I suggest that something does need to be done with warriors since they have trouble getting groups.  But, I still think that an appropriate fix is in the damage department.  Now if Pallys/SK were getting ALL the main assist jobs then I would think that warriors would need a taunt/mitigation/hp whatever improvement to balance things.  But, do you folks really think that EVERY group wants a Pally/SK main assist over a warrior?  I have not seen that.<br />
<br />
Hey, if warriors were broken they would not be used as raid tanks - pure and simple.<br />
<br />
I still feel that the x factor is that 6th spot in an already balanced group and warriors are not going to get that 6th spot by having better taunt/mitigation/hps.  They are going to get considered for that 6th spot for DPS potential with the bonus of being able to off tank adds if necessary. Frankly I'm a bit surprised by the &quot;tunnel vision&quot; that many warriors seem to posess - &quot;I'm a tank, that's all I can do, that's all I want to do, etc.&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe I need to provide a specific example of why a group would add a warrior as the 6th spot in a balanced group.  Frankly, I have already offered two reasons, adaquate dps (below pure DPS, but not by that much) and the bonus of being able to offtank.  A third very important reason is continuity in grouping.  If warrior is an offtank, he/she can step into main assist role if the main assist  leaves and the group can add whatever class they want.  That versitility is worth something and will help warriors get groups.<br />
<br />
I'm posting here not to tell you folks what to do, but to suggest a strategy that will get you listened to by Sony.  The DPS improvement agrument is a much easier sell than improving your defensive and taunting abilities at the risk of unbalancing the Pallys/SK's.<br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dephrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Alrighty, I gonna chime in here.. Now, think back 15 years ago.. when warriors were in books, stories and D&amp;D. What did you think when you read about, or listened to a warrior story? Or for those of us that played D&amp;D.. Made one with you pencil and paper. I know I thought of this wall of a man (or woman) whom stood infront of anything, fearless and ready to take whatever it threw at him and laugh. He was made to take damage while his friends could do what they did best.<br />
<br />
I agree we dont need any better damage mitigation, because that isn't our problem.. We could have a 100% damage mitigation and we'd still suck at AGRO control. Thats our main problem, not DPS nor mitigation. If we can't have the mob hit us.. what good is /disc defensive? <br />
<br />
I'm a relatively new warrior.. Actually.. a damn newb.. Only started mine the day LoY came out.. and only started EQ this January passed. But I have noticed now that I am reaching the Panes, especially Tier 2.. That I am disregarded so much for a paladin. Whenever I thought of a Paladin, Knight, Crusader, or Dualclass Cleric/Warrior.. I thought of someone who had minor spell capabilites, and about half the &quot;hit me&quot; usefulness as a warrior, as he is half class he should be half as potent.<br />
<br />
SO what can we do to increase our agro control? Sure Plane of Time items have increased agro modifiers.. But since I go to school and work, I will never hit a hard core raiding guild status that is PoTime flagged.. pointless for 90% of the warriors. They also have huge agro generating procs.. In Time.. <br />
<br />
Ok they're introducing another new expansion without helping us at all.. well here's a pitch.. This new &quot;Augmentation&quot; could be used as a first step, Give us stones that modify our Augmentent equipment to War only, and give it Taunt modifiers, Agro procs, Hate Modifiers.. Things like that.. But make them drop in Tier 3 and 2 planes.. and equivelent Old Skool zones.. Something that is accesible to warriors whom don't have the time to play every single day for 10+ hours. <br />
<br />
From there only take it a step further.. Change out discs, give us something useful.. Defensive is our core but I seen an amazing suggestion by someone.. Categorize our Discs by Offence and Defence.. So we can use one of each.. Though theres nothing really to waste my offence disc on.. I purposed a stun disc.. and I've seen some great suggestions in the BrainStorm thread.. <br />
<br />
So in closing.. We are not a DPS class.. never were and never should be.. We are the &quot;HIT ME YOU UGLY MOB CUZ I'M HUGE LIKE WHOA&quot; class.. and should be able to annoy our mobs enough that they want to prove me wrong.<br />
<br />
And that is my 2cp worth.. *shrugs*<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have never seen any group ever take a member because they could off tank, because they could mez, or split pull, or even root-park yes, but tanking adds is never something planed for in an exp group.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, when it come right down to it, our class powers are hitting things and being hit by them, with the emphasis on the later. It's not versatile because by designed we do both at the same time, utilizing a warrior in any other roll would be a loss of power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, I suppose that is fine but keep in mind that groups only usually need 1 of these characters.<br />
<br />
We know.  And why exactly should that one character have be a Paladin or a Shadow Knight because SoE won't address the problem for Warriors?  Why shouldn't we expect them to fix us and continue to let us fill the role we're designed for, rather than trying to shoe horn us into a role we aren't?  Should Clerics start looking for a DPS role if Druids get too close to their healing abilities or should they expect SoE to fix them so they can still fulfill their primary function?<br />
<br />
But, the &quot;perception&quot; of many peeps are that Pallys/SK are better because of &quot;ease of play&quot;. <br />
<br />
Yes, and you'd like to convince us that rather than expecting to be given similar levels of ease of play, we should instead accept a back seat to the Knights.  Sorry, equality is the only acceptable solution.   I'm not going to the back of the tanking bus so the Knights can have the front seats.<br />
<br />
Now if Pallys/SK were getting ALL the main assist jobs then I would think that warriors would need a taunt/mitigation/hp whatever improvement to balance things. But, do you folks really think that EVERY group wants a Pally/SK main assist over a warrior? I have not seen that.<br />
<br />
What you have seen and what you've admitted yourself is that Knights are getting a disproportionate number of the tank slots because, your own words here, &quot;ease of play&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hey, if warriors were broken they would not be used as raid tanks - pure and simple.<br />
<br />
This is a ludicrous statement, it really and truly is.  Warriors are used as raid tanks because of evasive and defensive.  Without those two disciplines there would be no compelling reason to use a Warrior over a Knight.  And those two disciplines have about zero impact on experience groups.<br />
<br />
Maybe I need to provide a specific example of why a group would add a warrior as the 6th spot in a balanced group. Frankly, I have already offered two reasons, adaquate dps (below pure DPS, but not by that much) and the bonus of being able to offtank. A third very important reason is continuity in grouping. If warrior is an offtank, he/she can step into main assist role if the main assist leaves and the group can add whatever class they want. That versitility is worth something and will help warriors get groups.<br />
<br />
Knights have always had more to offer in a non-MA role than a Warrior.  Ghetto crowd control, emergency heals, modest to good DPS, ability to off tank, ability to FD pull, and so on.  Yet they themselves have argued long and hard that these things aren't enough to get them a group regularly.  You expect us to accept that having slightly better DPS than currently but not good enough to be considered a pure DPS class is going to be better for us than all the things Knights could do were for them?  Not a very compelling arguement.<br />
<br />
I'm posting here not to tell you folks what to do, but to suggest a strategy that will get you listened to by Sony. The DPS improvement agrument is a much easier sell than improving your defensive and taunting abilities at the risk of unbalancing the Pallys/SK's.<br />
<br />
Actually you are.  You're telling us that despite the fact that Warriors are the class with the best HP potential, the best defensive skills, and the best mitigation ability, that in fact we should accept that all of our strengths should remain meaningless in any situation with the exception of a raid and that we should just accept that Knights will continue to be chosen over a Warrior because of &quot;ease of play&quot; while we take on a role that we're fifth rate at, at best.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm sure we're all very apperciative of your input and your thinking of us.  But I don't see that your thought processes are a particularly rewarding one for our class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
bst slow is almost as good as turgurs (65 vs 75), even I can already tank with a BST slowing in BoT, their buffs are as good as shamans.. I dont take a shaman anymore when a BST is avialable  if he has rune slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You know, how this seems to repeatedly go Shamans is beyond me.  I was merely using that as an example of how the Shaman class doesn't need to have their slow role taken away from them regularly and then be expected to try and fill a DPS role, like how Warriors don't need their role taken away by another class.<br />
<br />
If some people like Beastlords, so what?  Shamans in general still find a group as a slower pretty easily in my experience.  They're not standing around in droves LFG.  So it's all kind of pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well if by upgrade in DPS you mean that 1handers are brought more in line with 2hander dps I agree. I don't think we need more dps 2hander wise though for the reasons mentioned.<br />
<br />
And yeah out of all the slowers if I had a choice I prefer the beastlord mostly because he can take a bigger beating when I lose aggro to slow and he is damn nice dps once aggro is established. Shaman still own though but hybrids seem to own all in general exp groups IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You've hit my pet peeve right on the head.<br />
<br />
When people reach their 60's Knights start having nice AC/HP Platewearer/All equipment available. They get a very nice selection of Weapons starting with Windblade.<br />
<br />
Given their newly won AC, HP's, weapons, spells, and ability to get aggro from a distance and keep it better than Warriors they graduate from being offtanks to saying &quot;We ought to have an equal chance to MT&quot; to &quot;We are better exp group MT's.&quot;<br />
<br />
They might be correct, but just conceeding it and looking for another role for Warriors is asinine.<br />
<br />
Prior to level 56, Knights are primarily offtanks whose melee skills and spells get them a place in groups. And that my friend is what they should be after level 56. They do not need to be the MT to get a group and we do.<br />
<br />
MT is the only group slot a Warrior will ever get in exp group unless it's a pity invite.<br />
<br />
We are not hybrids, we are tanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Seems all class balance is brought to is Group and Raid....<br />
<br />
It's not that simple.<br />
<br />
How about giving a class ONE spell thats a MUST for groups,<br />
and ONE other spell thats a MUST for raids...<br />
<br />
there... you got a class needed for both raids and groups... then he MUST be balanced right? RIGHT??<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are a HORRIBLY designed class, (ya, its a Horribly designed game.. ok...),<br />
we hardly get anything that compensates our 100% dependancy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kick, which upgrades once to a stun kick... and still has like a 10% chance getting the stun off.<br />
<br />
Disarm, which is useless<br />
<br />
Taunt, which is almost useless now<br />
<br />
and... wait a sec... i know we got one more skill somewhere...<br />
ah yes!! Bash!<br />
<br />
<br />
After 5 years, we still got the same things...<br />
<br />
Now bring out the casters!<br />
<br />
Non stop upgrades and revamping of spells, resists, pets, items etc.........<br />
AND the abilities that make them independent.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I look at that, I dont care about groups or raids anymore.<br />
It's so horribly obvious that there's something very wrong with the class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh wait,<br />
we get disc defensive... forgot about that... that changes everything doesnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Oh, I know that in general a BST is not as good a slower as a shaman, I just found the choice of example amusing since I do think that considering all the flexibility they have, BSTs slow far, far too well. With a mage in a group, there is no need for another slower, and if I had a BST and a Chatner in a group, I would leave the tashing to the chanter and slowing to the BST.<br />
<br />
And of course, in most pick up exp spots, debuffing is a nicety, but not needed before slowing (particularly when your slower has Stonestance). PoV and BoT are not the Elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Oh, and shaman don't get into groups solely for their &quot;uber slow&quot; - they are pretty much interchangable with chanters and beastlords on that. Shaman get into groups more readily than other classes because they are often a viable &quot;6th group member choice&quot;. THINK ABOUT THAT FRIENDS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell the FIRST thing I want in my group is a shaman. Those buffs and Quiescence are awesome, and to be hones there's not a single tier2/3 camp I cannot hold, barring a few names with just a shaman. <br />
<br />
I have lately grouped with a beastlord a lot and they are a very versatile class. Not bad dps with pet (though from EXTENSIVE parsing I will 100% assure you that Beastlord+Pet &lt; Warrior dps) and some decent buffs plus slows. Paragon is very useful, chain paragon with Spirit of the wood from a druid on a bad pull and hell, what bad pull? <br />
<br />
However, if I had a Beastlord in my group I would not hesitate to get a shaman. On top of that if I ever joined a group and they suggested I did not main tank I would leave. I've grouped with paladin's with 400 aa's and I am still MT. If I seem to be losing it, the Paladin applies snap aggro. Problem solved. Doesn't happen often.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, enough from me, just spent 2 hours LFG in PoTranq along with 5 other 65 Wars. And of course no slowers were LFG so that I could 2 box my cleric.<br />

Then no offense but you deserve to be groupless. I can two box PoV with my druid without even getting my ToD out of the bag and gimme a KEI and I'll duo HoH. If for some reason you can't do that then 2-box PoN. Its 1%AA per kill (PoV being 3%). Why sit lfg when you can make exp?</div></div><hr />

Group of 6 is as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Tank: Warriors want to be the clear choice for the main assist role.  Best defensive tank period...end of story.<br />
<br />
2) Healer: Cleric - Because giving druid good stuff would cause the cleric to loose their god given right to slot #2 in every group.<br />
<br />
3) Slower: Shaman/Beasty/Chanter - (33% chance)<br />
<br />
4) Snare - Wizzy, Druid, SK, Necro. Ranger (20% chance)<br />
<br />
5) Puller - Monk, Bard, Ranger (33% chance - woot!)<br />
<br />
6) Other - Mage, Pally, Rogue (Plus everyone else that didn't make it in #1-5) (1/14 chance - 6% chance)<br />
<br />
There we go, life in the warrior world - ain't life grand and we sure put those Pallys in their place (lol).  You know this little experiment in posting on a warrior board has really opened up my eyes.  You guys just don't get it - don't understand Sony's &quot;class balance&quot; idea of not being held hostage by any one class (even though clerics come pretty close).<br />
<br />
How about this.. grab a tank, grab a slower, grab a healer and 3 others and kick some monster behind. I am 100% sure that is what Sony wants, what Sony has tuned the classes for and frankly is doing a pretty good job of.<br />
<br />
Guys/girls, if Pallys/SK's taunt better so be it.  If they have a few useful spells (snare and stun) good for them.  Hey, I think warriors should be improved to the point where folks are ambivalent about grabbing a warrior/sk/pally as the tank. I'm on your side.  Heck, it sucks not being able to get a group (just ask druids).  I just feel STRONGLY and so does Sony (feel free to bash me on this one, but I am 100% right) that warriors should not be superior tanks, they should be EQUAL tanks.<br />
<br />
I have not read one post here where the poster acknowledges that warriors bring a lot to an experience group with superior hit points, AC and the occasional defensive disc for a named.  It's always back to taunt and I absolutely hear you about that.  But, this game is already dummied up enough and frankly I think reducing the taunt on sk and pally spells is a feasible fix.  But you know how the Hybrids would go ballistic so that isn't going to happen. (REPEAT ISNT GOING TO HAPPEN)<br />
<br />
So, the $100 question is how to get some equality, and I continue to believe that warriors will be best served to get a DPS increase to compensate for their sub-par initial agro and lack of stun/snare.  Why? Because if folks are ambivalent about which tank to choose then it gets back to my previous post of the importance of bringing something to that 6th position in a balanced group of 5. <br />
<br />
Guess what guys, if you get 33% of the main assist &quot;jobs&quot; and ignore the 6th man (so to speak) you are going to be sitting on your rear ends LFG a lot.  Improving taunt will not get you that 6th spot.  Improving damage mitigation will not get you that 6th spot.  It's DPS baby!!<br />

<br />
<br />
If we're EQUAL why can't we hold agro like them? Wow we have more HP and a slightly better mitigation (But don't forget the fact they have enough self buffs to nullify that WITHOUT help from another character) so that makes us inferior. So therefor, your wrong as we are not an EQUAL tank. Say I have.. 1k more hp then a paladin with near identical gear, and I have 100 more AC. He can buff himself up to about that without any help.. what can I do? A few clicky effects that he gets to.<br />
<br />
I see your logic, yeah we do get better ac, mitigation, and health.. but they get self buffs.. for AC/HP/Str/Dex/Resists/Atk.. so where is the equality.. since above they they get attack magic, stuns, snares, dot's..<br />
<br />
The ONLY time a paladin should be better in a group then a warrior, is for a fully undead place.. and rightfully so as they are religious folk who dwell in teachings of destroying undead.</div></div><hr />

You're shitting me... right? Warriors were MADE to tank. WE DO NOTHING ELSE. If we wanted to do DPS, we would have made a rogue. And we already have a DPS advantage over pallies. Does that make us viable for tanks? Hell no. Then to come to OUR boards and insult us becuase WE dont' know class balance? Your ideas are nothing short of ludacris.<br />
<br />
Then to comment on druids not getting groups: I don't know abour your server, but any druid over 58 is pretty much insta-grouped here. They heal, evac, nuke, buff, mana regen, etc. And dont' comment on SOE thinking we're meant to be equal tanks. We're supposed to be the premier tanks. Are you trying to say that our only function is something we're supposed to share?<br />
<br />
&quot;I have not read one post here where the poster acknowledges that warriors bring a lot to an experience group with superior hit points, AC and the occasional defensive disc for a named.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our AC/HP advantage gets to within 500 for the average warrior vs the average pally from the people I've talked to. To say our 500 HP + ~5% mitigation advantage &gt; aggro is again. Insane. People get pallies for groups mainly for their aggro, but in the back of the groups' minds, they know pallies can back up heal if the need arises, they can buff, etc. And I have to say you're wrong, as will most everyone else here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, fuck trying to argue with you. Too many flawed statements to argue with.<br />
<br />
DPS won't fix warriors. Sorry, bucko.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Aye -<br />
<br />
Ya see, Warriors, Clerics, and to some extent Enchanters/Shaman are a little stuck since they don't get exp except in their primary roles of tank, healer, or slower. Two of these classes can solo to some extent. Two can't and won't usually get a general DPS slot either.<br />
<br />
That leave 3 dps slots that can be filled by anyone except Cleric and Enchanter. Plenty of room for a Druid, Necro, Paladin, SK, Necro, Mage, Rogue, etc.<br />
<br />
It makes as much sence to make Knights the prefered exp group MT's as to give Paladins CH and make then them the prefered Healer. Heck since Knights are utility classes, make ToD Knight usable and all of us can retire.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Warriors just being a tank is why this forum exists and why so many are unhappy.  You only need so much tanking.  Tanking beyond this is  not useful or wanted.<br />
<br />
At the moment tanking doesn't stack.  Why solely embrace this?  If a zone supports 10 groups do you guys really only want 10 Warriors in the entire zone?  If a raid requires only one Warrior and space is limited do you guys really the others to be dumped (think LDoN).<br />
<br />
Tanking is a good skill to have.  Warriors should be able to tank and by most accounts they do this better than SKs and Paladins.  It should not be the only skill any class should have reguardless of how well they can perform it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Let me give an analogy in terms of druids and clerics.<br />
<br />
In Velious and early Luclin, druids were not healers except as a last resort.  The only real option the group had in terms of healing was cleric, and druids were grubbing around for those heavily-contested DPS slots.<br />
<br />
Since the introduction of Tunares Renewal and Karana's Renewal, druids have lost a lot of ground against other classes in terms of DPS.  (Not all of them are completely happy about that, but the evoc druid is a dying breed; you just can't have a situation where there's a required group slot for a healer and only one class of healer to choose from, it's inequitable.  Equally you can't have a situation where one of the primary group healing classes is also a primary group damage dealer, but the other isn't.)<br />
<br />
The situation between druids and clerics should be that a cleric offers the big buffs and the big heals, plus noticeable damage output against undead targets, so that in any situation where you're fighting the big hitting critters or the undead, cleric is clearly the better choice.  Druids should offer buffs and heals which are adequate for a less challenging environment, plus noticeable damage output against pretty much everything, so in any situation where you're just grinding against non-undead small hitters, druid is clearly the better choice.<br />
<br />
(That's probably close to the reality of the position at the moment.  Once you have an &quot;adequate&quot; amount of healing in your group - i.e. your healer is keeping up with constant chain pulls - the choice between druid and cleric comes down to damage output.)<br />
<br />
Well, the situation between knights and warriors should be that the warrior offers the big tanking and the big damage, while the knight offers tanking which is adequate for a less challenging environment, plus situational damage output (e.g. paladins -v- undead), plus better aggro control.<br />
<br />
(That's also close to the reality of the position at the moment, the challenge being that the group's concern about aggro control has become exaggerated, owing to the fact that PoP exp critters can kill a non-tank in a few attack rounds.)<br />
<br />
The problem warriors have at the moment is partly that their damage output is too low relative to knights (which also has an impact on warrior aggro generation).  Dual wield should be noticeably better damage than two-handers, as it has been throughout the majority of EQ; fixing this would come a long way towards solving some of the issues that monks and rogues are suffering from as well.<br />
<br />
The second part of the problem is that the knight's ability to soak damage is too close to that of the warrior.  You could fix that through warrior hp or a separate damage mitigation table or whatever, but warriors need to soak damage noticeably better.<br />
<br />
However, I don't see that solving those two issues will solve the overall problem.  What will really fix warriors would require those two issues to be solved, plus the introduction of real big-hitting critters with a real incentive to kill them.<br />
<br />
Learning how to control aggro is, and should be, the price for grouping with a warrior.  What's missing is the reward (in terms of increased exp and item drops) for doing that.<br />
<br />
This is where I have high hopes for the dungeons in LDoN.  (I'm not in the beta and may be wildly off base here).  I'm hoping to zone into one of those dungeons and meet level 63-66 critters that hit for 1k and nuke like artillery pieces, right at zone in - and see them get tougher (hitting for 2k+) as the group advances - and to see real benefits from choosing a warrior as opposed to a knight to tank them.  And there has to be a real incentive in terms of exp and loot to kill these things.<br />
<br />
I also see mana-draining critters in PoP, and these are underused; I'm hoping for more of them.  Show me a mob that procs a 1khp/1kmana drain and I'll show you a mob that I want a warrior to tank.<br />
<br />
In short, despite what Absor says about class balancing not being tied in with expansions, addressing game content has to be a part of the fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ugok_EMarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Purdypog,<br />
<br />
You know that Shaman are the best slower grouped with a Warrior?<br />
<br />
Malo/Malos is almost no aggro, this allows slow to land first time, pretty much every time, and if the Shaman does get aggro, they take a beating pretty well.<br />
<br />
Tash on the other hand is high aggro, and chanters get hit hard. Chanters don't do so well with a Warrior MT.<br />
<br />
More importantly however...<br />
<br />
What do I as a Warrior, offer a group over a level 65 Knight with similar equipment/AA?<br />
<br />
1. Around 500 base HP. This can often be equaled or exceeded in xp groups using *self* buffs, lifetaps, heals.<br />
<br />
2. Slightly better mitigation. That's what we have been told, can't see much difference myself.<br />
<br />
3. Defensive/Evasive. Clear advantage to the Warrior *when needed*.<br />
<br />
In return I have...<br />
<br />
1. Woefull aggro generating capability.<br />
<br />
2. No effective soloing capability.<br />
<br />
3. Virtually no utility.<br />
<br />
4. Less total DPS than the SK.<br />
<br />
5. No healing capabilty.<br />
<br />
For giving up pretty much everything, all I got was defensive. I cry foul. As do many other Warriors.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I  think Knights are nicely balanced and certainly don't wish for them to be nerfed. I just want a bit of the action for Warriors.<br />
<br />
Some combination of...<br />
<br />
1. Better aggro.<br />
<br />
2. A more noticable, HP/mitigation advantage.<br />
<br />
3. Or something else that adds value to the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">for the second time in history, I am going to agree with Frodlin. (in spirit, if not exactly in words)<br />
<br />
Secondary abilities mean jack in XP groups.  They only mean something when the unexpected happens... and when it happens, most of the EQ population is just going to wipe and CR.<br />
<br />
<br />
More damage?  wouldn't hurt warriors honestly...  and fixing dual wield is actually part of a personal pet peeve of mine...  all three weapon combos (1H+shield, dual wield, and 2H) should be viable and useful alternatives to the classes that are best skilled to use them.  (Warriors = all three, rangers = 2H and dual, knights = 1H + shield and 2H, etc....)<br />
<br />
<br />
What warriors need is to be a little better at holding aggro.<br />
<br />
this is where the whole of the Steel Warrior is going to disagree.<br />
<br />
Warriors could really use a little bit of +hate added to the end of KICK.  Say about 200ish hate at level 65 (scaled for level somehow) added every time kick is used, whether it hits or not.  200 hate has been tested to gather aggro immediately if the mob is unaggroed, (by me...  a shadowknight can CAST such a spell) and adding 200 hate every time kick pops means a warrior will not HAVE to own EB weapons to garner aggro with certainty.<br />
<br />
I have now tested such a setup using ONLY said spell...  I was able to keep aggro over all normal aggro activity without casting additional spells.  Using Darkness or better aggro spells was superior, but not that much better.  Proper useage meant the slow landing did not take aggro... and even with moronic casting practices did not take that long to recover from. (Taunt + 200 hate helped quite a bit)<br />
<br />
I am now convinced this is the best path, AND have the first-hand testing to prove it.<br />
<br />
Warriors would have a button to mash, AND have the Taunt button to hold in reserve.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">i like shaman's in my group, if they know how to play their class we can make a awsome team, but lo and behold the good players are ever elusive, and most of the good old ones quit and Ebayed a long time ago :(<br />
<br />
anyhow once any class has around 1200 ac and 5000 hp unbuffed it all comes down to agro, so giving paladins better agro pretty much fucks us with a shotgun, i agree that warriors should be for big hitters with big rewards, and pallys should be good enough to tank light hitters that offer smaller rewards(but increased pull/kill rate) but giving them the boon(it means a gift) of agro sqaushs the rest of us, now i dont feel as threatend by SK's because they cant buff themselves over my hitpoints and ac, so they require a cleric be there at least<br />
<br />
also because of CH being a big or a light hitter doesnt mean crap anymore like it used to, now its just &quot;can i get a heal off before the next round? yes? rinse and repeat&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">bst slow is almost as good as turgurs (65 vs 75), even I can already tank with a BST slowing in BoT, their buffs are as good as shamans.. I dont take a shaman anymore when a BST is avialable if he has rune slow.<br />
<br />
Almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, especially if the beastlord cant even land his slow due to high magic resistance. Beastlords' level 65 slow is no better than the level 44 enchanter slow Shiftless Deeds. Look it up.<br />
<br />
What buffs are just as good as shamans? Almost every buff a beastlord has is a shaman spell - and the shaman has one better. <br />
<br />
Acumen - BST 65 (SHM 56 - shaman also has group version)<br />
<br />
Regrowth - BST 64 (SHM 52 - shaman has upgrade single and group versions)<br />
<br />
Spiritual Dominion - BST 64 - gives 9hp/9mana regen. Shamans dont have a mana regen buff, but why the hell would a warrior care about mana regen. Even if this stacks with Regrowth, that's still less hp regen than Replenishment alone.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Jacinth/Shadoo - BST 63/61 (SHM 51/53 - shaman has two upgrades of this, as a combined buff taking only 1 slot)<br />
<br />
Celerity - BST 63 (SHM 56 - shaman has Swift Like the Wind and a group celerity spell which last 46 mins before focus or AAs)<br />
<br />
Talisman of Kragg - BST 62 (SHM 55 - shaman has Focus line which is superior to Kragg in hps as well as adds str and dex into same buff)<br />
<br />
Infusion of Spirit - BST 61 (SHM 49 - the old notion that Kragg + IoS + Stamina is more hps than focus only applies to the original level 60 Focus of Spirit. Focus of Soul/Seventh + Endurance/Talisman of the Boar is more hps than those 3 buffs combined)<br />
<br />
Stamina - BST 57 (SHM 44 - shaman has two upgrades, single target and group version of both upgrades)<br />
<br />
Which leaves really only one single spell that beastlords have that shamans cannot duplicate (as a single buff):<br />
<br />
Ferocity - BST 65 - adds 40 stamina, 150 ATK, +65 to all resists, and fatigue regen equal to Acumen. Quite a handy spell for resists, I'd say - otherwise nothing impressive. <br />
<br />
Boar adds 60 stamina, Ferine Avatar adds 140 ATK, str, dex, and agility. Focus of Soul/Seventh adds 544 hps, plus another 75 str, 70 dex. Diaku adds another 45 str and 35 dex, and stacks with focus. So with these 4 buffs, which are pretty standard buffs when grouped with a shaman (if not required buffs) you get 544 hps, 60 stamina, 140 ATK, 140 agility, 260 strength, and 250 dex. Oh, and if you need the resists - the shaman can buff all of them also - by level 49, in fact.<br />
<br />
Should we compare healing abilities? Chloroblast and Superior Healing versus Tnarg's Mending, Khura's Mending, and Quiescence. No contest. <br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you just have a beef against shamans, and that's why you wont group with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet people want to say, OMG you want equality?  You selfish bastards, don't you understand that if you had equality no one would ever want a Knight tank again??!!  <br />
<br />
I have one word for that.  Bullshit.<br />
<br />
What should be happening is that when Warrior tanking and &quot;ease of play&quot; are compared to Knight tanking, &quot;ease of play&quot;, and &quot;various other shit they can do that a Warrior can't no matter how much freaking gear he gets&quot;, people should say, hmmm, well it's hard to decide one over the other just on their class, what other factors are there?<br />
<br />
We shouldn't have to accept inferiority just to keep the Knights in the game.  Because all that will do is grossly reduce the number of Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Ok, here is today's post.<br />
<br />
It appears that &quot;narrow minded&quot; peeps just don't get it still.  Warriors don't necessarily have to be equal in taunt to be equal tanks - they just need other areas improved to compensate.  My goodness, it seems that everyone is so absorbed with the taunt issue that no other fixes would satisfy them. <br />
<br />
And peeps, even now warriors are the best tanks - let's get real, how many times in an experience group with equally equiped/level/aa Pally/SK is the warrior an offtank - the answer is NEVER.  Anyone who really plays the game knows I'm right on this one.<br />
<br />
So, the $100 question still remains &quot;do warriors need further balancing?&quot;.  And despite what some of the idiots posting have inaccurately claimed my position is I continue to think they do for the pure reason that many are having LFG issues.<br />
<br />
Sony's most excellent vision for experience groups is to grab a tank, grab a healer, grab a slower and 3 more and go to town.  There should be NO class which is indespensible in an experience group, it's mix and match.  If you don't agree that is is Sony's vision and implimentation I am talking to a brick wall and no amount of good points is going to sink in.<br />
<br />
Some peeps are saying that you should need a warrior to fight harder experience group named and I totally disagree.  That's warriors trying to exclude the Pallys/SK again.  Let's separate raiding from experience groups.  Ok, are we on the same page?  Is it fair to &quot;absolutely have to have&quot; a warrior to tank an experience group named?  Anyone who says yes on this is part of the above mentioned&quot;brick wall&quot; and nothing I say will make any sense to you.<br />
<br />
Warriors being the prefered tank for the &quot;biger named mobs&quot; is one of the advantages it has over a Pally/SK.  The other advantages as have been stated are 500 hps, and slightly better mitigation (it's small I know, but it is an advantage).  Ok, back to the $100 question, are these advantages enough to put warriors on equal footing with Pally/SK's in getting into an experience group?  My answer continues to be no.<br />
<br />
So, what's the solution?  Well, lots of you have tunnel vision  back to the taunt issue again.  Well, I'll try one last time to state my position since I think many just do not get it.  The following are a few assumptions that I believe are clear from Sony's class balancing.<br />
<br />
1) Balancing is done not to get everyone on a level playing field on skills, dps, healing, taunt etc. but to help balance out the LFG.  If there are no LFG issues then things are pretty well balanced.<br />
<br />
2) Classes should have some differences.  If not, EQ would be more boring than it &quot;sometimes&quot; is.  Also group makeup causes differences in playing style, in an experience group you can choose to play a bit more &quot;safely&quot; with, let's say a cleric, enchanter, backup healer....or you can opt for more DPS and more risk.  It's all about kills per hour.<br />
<br />
Now, lets now talk about warriors since that is today's topic.  Hopefully we have gotten over the incorrect assumption that warriors are  broken with my argument about who is Main Assist in a group with a warrior and pally/sk.  ITS ALWAYS THE WARRIOR.<br />
<br />
Many folks have argued that the lack of initial taunt makes warriors unfeasible in high level experience groups.  I continue to say that I have not seen ONE experience group in my 190 aa's which is the case.  Now an enchanter does bring up a good point about non shaman groups having more difficulty without malos.  I acknowledge that....I know that is true..I know warriors are having problems getting into experience groups because of that...yes yes yes.<br />
<br />
And I agree that some sort of initial taunt increase - maybe kick stun with 1 min refresh would help the &quot;shamanless group&quot; in particular.  But don't discount my suggestion of an increase in DPS which aids the group in the kills per hour, protects the other dps during the fight - ie: wizzy nuking during 2nd half of fight and raises warriors to a viable 6th addition in an already balanced 5 person experience group.<br />
<br />
That 6th slot as I have said (and it seems no one is listening) is the real issue friends.  The problem is not just &quot;Warriors can't taunt as well as Pallys/SK&quot;  it's &quot;how can we solve the problems about warriors LFG?&quot;.  And that LFG has 2 components NOT ONE AS MANY WARRIORS REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE; 1) EQUAL choice as main assist, and 2) bringing something to the table to be considered as 6th member in the 5-person balanced group.<br />

<br />
I guess I don't &quot;really play the game&quot; then. Given the choice, I'll take the knight every time. And I have been in groups where we asked an equally geared warrior to just take the DPS slot so that the paladin could tank. Was the best group I ever remember being in. The paladin never lost aggro, and the mob was slowed by the time it got to camp. I started meleeing because I had too much mana. When a tough named spawned, the warrior popped /disc defensive and tanked it, and played rogue lite the rest of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullshit.  If I'm in a group with an equally geared pally or sk I'll let them tank every time and just pop aggressive every half hour.  Why?  Because it's more efficient.  I might pull aggro off of them once in awhile with procs but the slower will never die because taunt decides to fail 6 times in a row...<br />
<br />
I'm not claiming that warriors make bad tanks, we don't.  We're just outclassed by knights even when they have inferior gear and zero AAs.  That should not be the case.  I frequently get comments from people in pickup groups about how they can't believe I held aggro so well for a warrior and without fail every time I have to go they rep me with a knight if there's one available.<br />
<br />
The only time we shine in an xp group is if we want to pull a named so you're damned right I think a warrior should be required for it if they don't fix taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Purdypog, let me tell you, you  just sound real damn crazy right now.<br />
<br />
Why? I'll tell you why:<br />
<br />
-Trying to give warriors enough DPS to compete with classes like rogues and wizards is not balanced.<br />
<br />
-Trying to give warriors enough utility to compete with the likes of bards and druids is not balanced.<br />
<br />
-The entire underlying theme, &quot;Shamanless group&quot; leads me to believe you have a wish to gimp warrior aggro generation so as to make enchanters (with there low hit points and high aggro spells) less desirable as a slower in groups.<br />
<br />
-The one kick per min idea: I hope you mean a button with stun-like aggro that can be pushed only once a fight because currently our kick is on a 6 second timer base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Purdy,<br />
<br />
There are multiple reasons that your arguments fall on deaf ears, and they have little to do with obsession or single mindedness but with two things:<br />
<br />
1. Your crappy attitude (I know it all and you don't)<br />
<br />
2. Your &quot;facts&quot; are incorrect.<br />
<br />
Let me give you two examples:   You say the following things<br />
<br />
Group of 6 is as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Tank: Warriors want to be the clear choice for the main assist role. Best defensive tank period...end of story.<br />
<br />
2) Healer: Cleric - Because giving druid good stuff would cause the cleric to loose their god given right to slot #2 in every group.<br />
<br />
3) Slower: Shaman/Beasty/Chanter - (33% chance)<br />
<br />
4) Snare - Wizzy, Druid, SK, Necro. Ranger (20% chance)<br />
<br />
5) Puller - Monk, Bard, Ranger (33% chance - woot!)<br />
<br />
6) Other - Mage, Pally, Rogue (Plus everyone else that didn't make it in #1-5) (1/14 chance - 6% chance)<br />
<br />
Warriors do NOT want to exclude Paladin and SK tanking in experience groups, therefore your ability to assess our position is suspect at best.   Because of this, your ability to assess the problems and solutions is in doubt.<br />
<br />
The argument about clerics 'god given right to a spot in an exp group' is both strewn with hostility and angst, and shows again an inaccurate understanding of the issues.   The reality is with a group both clerics and druids flourish, without a group druids only (of the two) flourish.   We can draw the conclusion that clerics have a higher NEED for a group than druids, and therefore to BALANCE this, they have also a higher VALUE to a group.   This used to be a balancing issue between knights and warriors, but isn't really one any longer because both cannot really do anything of substance without a group, although with the expansion of the dark blue con ranges, it's more true than previously, it's still not really a realistic sounding board for warriors like it used to be.<br />
<br />
My view is that one class that does two things (damage and tanking) is inherently more limited than one that can do multiple things (see:  Knight skills).   Because of this, the propensity toward tanking really should be toward the warrior, and knights *should* be granted more VALUABLE stuff with which to claim that 6th spot (note:  unused value isn't real valuable, and I'll concede that while there is a gret deal more versatility in knight utility than warrior, it's currently not sufficient with which to claim a 6th spot).   Knights are designed better to be able to vie for the 6th spot than warriors.    Knights currently ARE a better choice for the 6th spot than warriors as well, but they're not good enough to stand alone in that spot.   <br />
<br />
Onto your &quot;if a warrior and a Knight are grouped, the warrior always tanks&quot; argument:<br />
<br />
This is false<br />
<br />
In just about every group I'm in with a Paladin, the Paladin ends up tanking, because I'm not stupid and know that it's better overall for the group if this is the case.  On the other hand, SK's are very well suited to ensure that I tank, and they do, so I tend to end up tanking in a group with an SK, unless the SK has a complex about being a &quot;great tank&quot;, then I will /shield them until they get frustrated enough to let it happen.   <br />
<br />
UNLESS it's somewhere like the Plane of Water, where my tankability is zilch because I must have X/Y/Z perfection to maintain aggro, while my Knightly friends dont' need anything to perform the same task.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">IMO groups are simpler than what everyone is discussing..<br />
<br />
tank<br />
healer<br />
slower<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
<br />
Snare, an FD puller and even CC are all optional at all but a handful of camps. Also enchanters and even clerics can be pullers (pacification).<br />
<br />
This is why the 'melee' issue falls on the heads of warriors even more than monks and rogues. Monks and rogues are still sought after for groups as DPS even though they haven't gained flourishes like the hybrids have.<br />
<br />
What is a tank seems fairly obvious to me.. Someone that can take hits with enough mitigation (before and after slow) to keep the healer high enough in mana to chain pull and still handle the occasional emergency. <br />
<br />
It goes without saying, though, that if the tank can't hold aggro than it defeats the whole purpose because the healer is splitting heals between the one with mitigation and the ones without as well as wasting mana on rezzes and rebuffing. <br />
<br />
DPS may *seem* like a way to get warriors back into the xp group game but it would never work. There are always DPS'ers LFG. They get groups just fine becuase they make up half of all groups but there will always be a 62 rogue LFG who would get the DPS spot ahead of a 65 warrior. Giving any tank as much DPS as said rogue would IMO be downright silly, and would be unbalancing in a new way without solving the tank issue at hand.<br />
<br />
The problem is clearly aggro control. Warriors shouldn't, as RL players, have to work ten times as hard mashing and positioning and turning and shielding, etc. to maintain aggro and thus proper mitigation. <br />
<br />
This seems fairly black and white to me.. Warrior aggro is broken and all the half-baked efforts SOE has made to restore it have failed because they have been in the form of weapons usable not only by the warrior class but by knights and even DPS'ers as well. Now we have rogues with proc'ing piercers and BST with CHoS... In a way they made it worse.<br />
<br />
  ------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Finally, on the topic of slowing mobs that was brought up towards the front of this thread... There was some misinformation there I wanted to correct.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think having an unresistable debuff for your variety of slow is that important but enchanters *do* in fact have one. The tash line is unresistable.<br />
<br />
Slows break down as follows:<br />
Shaman: 66% at 51 to 75% at 60 (unresistable debuff)<br />
Enchanters: 67% at level 57 to 70% at level 60 (unresistable debuff)<br />
Beastlords: 30% without epic, 55% via epic proc, 65% at level 65 (no debuff)<br />
<br />
In the high end game that's<br />
Shaman: 75%<br />
Enchanter: 70%<br />
Beastlord: 65%<br />
<br />
So what does 5% mean?<br />
If the mob does 1,000 damage over time period X then the final damage after slow is 250, 300 or 350 respectively.<br />
<br />
In other words a shaman slowed mob does 16.7% less damage than an enchanter-slowed mob which does 14.2% less damage then a beastlord-slowed mob.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

2) Cleric<br />

4)DPS 1<br />

Now which group is gonna pull faster, Kill faster, and get more experiance? Not only did the SK replace the Warrior here....but he is the FD puller(let's repalce the Monk with another Rogue or a second wizard for EVEN MORE DPS), and the SK can absorb damage about as well as a warrior(not quite but oh well)...and to boot you can forgo the shammy as the enchanter WON'T cause aggro problems because of the SK's ability tohold aggro. ...NOW we don't have to worry about adds, AND we get faster haste and KEI to boot.<br />
<br />
Personally I think it's pretty amazing people DON'T see a problem here.  <br />
<br />
I am NOT saying Nerf SK's........I think they are fine the way they are.  I am saying that not only do Warriors need a DPS boost, but they also need better aggro tools.  The other members of a group should NOT have to walk on eggshells OR suffer in the rate of XP gain if they can't get a SK to tank for them.  We just want some Equality.<br />
<br />
Most of us are just pissed that when it comes ot the 'ol XP grind, it has actually become a big disadvantage to have a warrior Tank'n for ya instead of a SK.  Also, even if ya increased our DPS as some people have suggested to try to take that 6th spot..........are we really gonna ever replace(or be chosen instead of) rogues or wizards???? Nope.  <br />

I don't think the chanter/shaman issue has anything to do with warriors vs. other tanks.<br />
<br />
My enchanter has 3k hp worth of self runes including a 1500 pt instant rune, also CA3.. I do just fine with warriors. ESPECIALLY ones who have learned to use /shield.<br />
<br />
The shaman vs. enchanter issue is one of utility. Does the group need CC? Does the group need shrink or a backup healer? Would shaman buffs or chanter buffs help more? Who is the shaman/chanter?<br />
<br />
IMO shaman and enchanters are fairly well balanced. Arguing about one of them versus another is moot. The argument is still about warrior aggro not the other classes present.<br />
<br />
PS. Any group that has the MT FD pulling is NOT going to get good XP imo but again the other classes aren't the issue. No one is talking about nerfing anyone else just the idea that warriors need to be able to maintain aggro or all our mitigation is for nothing. Hell, a ranger with defensive AAs and good gear would make a better tank in many xp groups because of snare aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">True.....if the MT is the puller you can't Chain pull or pull nearly as fast.  I had not considered that.  But still, the point is that SK's utility as being a Puller that can tank allready make them a desired group member.....tanking is all we got, and if you allow another class to do it better....then other than a mob that requires defensive......there is little for a warrior to offer.<br />
<br />
Lets make a quick compare.....<br />
<br />
Warrior...can tank, sometimes struggles to hold aggro.<br />
SK.... can tank, pull, has no problem holding aggro, and all of their other goodies to boot.<br />
<br />
If a SK can tank comparable to a warrior....there is little choice to which  a group will want if picking between a SK and a Warrior that are both LFG. <br />
<br />
As far as arguing one class or the other(shammy vs Chanter), my point there was that for me personally I don't have aggro problems with Shammy's....Malo is very little aggro....but Tash DOES build some nice aggro, and chanters can take aggro more easily than shammy's if not careful...and likely that means the cleric is to Burn mana healing the chanter, I got to run back and take aggro back, etc etc etc. .... I was basically using this as an example,  that SOLEY because a SK was tanking instead of a Warrior, that now one class is preferable over another, and not really comparing the two.....it was not my intent to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your tank is pulling, your group is less efficient.<br />
<br />
The puller runs out and gets more so the tank is tanking 100% of the time and the DPS is doin DPS 100% of the time if possible...<br />
<br />
If the tank has to run out and get something, your group just lost valuable time and thus XP.  If the Shadowknight is tanking, then the warrior should be pulling...<br />
<br />
I'd rather have a puller (of any class) than a stay-at-home DPS class that is going to force the tank to pull!<br />
<br />
ANY class can pull in PoP.... you don't need Feign Death except for a very few select pulls of multiple unmezzable mobs.  If they both (all three) mez, bring them to camp for the control class.<br />
<br />
Kinda funny really...  since the thread didn't start with a whine (it started with a different viewpoint, and a proposed solution) it is dismissed as a troll.<br />

[B]Ok, here is today's post.<br />
<br />
It appears that &quot;narrow minded&quot; peeps just don't get it still.  Warriors don't necessarily have to be equal in taunt to be equal tanks - they just need other areas improved to compensate.  My goodness, it seems that everyone is so absorbed with the taunt issue that no other fixes would satisfy them. <br />
<br />
<br />
You really need to read and attempt to understand the arguments being presented here, before you call Warriors &quot;narrow minded&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
And peeps, even now warriors are the best tanks - let's get real, how many times in an experience group with equally equiped/level/aa Pally/SK is the warrior an offtank - the answer is NEVER.  Anyone who really plays the game knows I'm right on this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not true, most of the time Warriors are not the best xp group tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, the $100 question still remains &quot;do warriors need further balancing?&quot;.  And despite what some of the idiots posting have inaccurately claimed my position is I continue to think they do for the pure reason that many are having LFG issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think most of us understand your position quite well. Let me have a shot at summarizing... Our poor aggro generating capabilities should remain the same and we should get DPS to compensate.<br />
<br />
Sorry, not acceptable. Warriors are tanks, I don't want to be a bad Rogue or Monk (or worse, do more DPS than a rogue or monk and invalidate their reason for being). I want to be the good tank.<br />
<br />
A good tank must have the tools to get and hold aggro *or* have a sufficient lead in HP/mitagation that the group is prepared to accept their aggro generating limitations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sony's most excellent vision for experience groups is to grab a tank, grab a healer, grab a slower and 3 more and go to town.  There should be NO class which is indespensible in an experience group, it's mix and match.  If you don't agree that is is Sony's vision and implimentation I am talking to a brick wall and no amount of good points is going to sink in.<br />
<br />
<br />
This has no bearing on the balance question. Knights and Warriors are *all* able to tank for a group. Tweaks to warrior aggro will not change this.<br />
<br />
Warriors are the specialist tank. We give up everything, to be the specialist tank. Despite this Paladins and SK's are both *better* at the Warriors specialist role.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some peeps are saying that you should need a warrior to fight harder experience group named and I totally disagree.  That's warriors trying to exclude the Pallys/SK again.  Let's separate raiding from experience groups.  Ok, are we on the same page?  Is it fair to &quot;absolutely have to have&quot; a warrior to tank an experience group named?  Anyone who says yes on this is part of the above mentioned&quot;brick wall&quot; and nothing I say will make any sense to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again this is irrelevant. Knights *are* tanking xp group named *now*. Adjusting warrior aggro will affect this how?<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors being the prefered tank for the &quot;biger named mobs&quot; is one of the advantages it has over a Pally/SK.<br />
<br />
<br />
You still talking about xp group named? If so, see above.<br />
<br />
If you are talking about raid level mobs, this is irrelevant, both Knights (especially Paladin) and Warrior have raid roles.<br />
<br />
Warriors tank the raid mob, due *only* to the curse that is defensive. My class is balanced around a single ability I got at level 55.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other advantages as have been stated are 500 hps, and slightly better mitigation (it's small I know, but it is an advantage).<br />
<br />
<br />
500hp is a good lead huh?<br />
<br />
Against xp group mobs, 500hp is less than one cast of BoD for a SK, add in LT procs and the ability to LT more aggressively in a pinch and the lead is gone.<br />
<br />
In some group configurations an equal level/aa/equip Paladin will have *more* buffed HP than me. Not to forget the ability to LH or self heal. So much for my uber 500hp<br />
<br />
As for the mitigation advantage, it's rumored to be there, but as I said previously I just don't see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, back to the $100 question, are these advantages enough to put warriors on equal footing with Pally/SK's in getting into an experience group?  My answer continues to be no.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right answer, flawed solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what's the solution?  Well, lots of you have tunnel vision  back to the taunt issue again.  Well, I'll try one last time to state my position since I think many just do not get it.  The following are a few assumptions that I believe are clear from Sony's class balancing.<br />
<br />
1) Balancing is done not to get everyone on a level playing field on skills, dps, healing, taunt etc. but to help balance out the LFG.  If there are no LFG issues then things are pretty well balanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree. You can't possibly exclude non-group capabilities in considering balance. Why should a class with great solo capability be as desirable to a group as a class with little or no solo capability? (Note: I am not saying Knights have great solo capability, albeit better than Warriors. Just that non-group related abilities must be a balance consideration)<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Classes should have some differences.  If not, EQ would be more boring than it &quot;sometimes&quot; is.  Also group makeup causes differences in playing style, in an experience group you can choose to play a bit more &quot;safely&quot; with, let's say a cleric, enchanter, backup healer....or you can opt for more DPS and more risk.  It's all about kills per hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
I accept this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, lets now talk about warriors since that is today's topic.  Hopefully we have gotten over the incorrect assumption that warriors are  broken with my argument about who is Main Assist in a group with a warrior and pally/sk. <br />
<br />
<br />
Define broken.<br />
<br />
Can we tank? Yes<br />
<br />
Are we the premier tank we gave up everthing to be? Hell no. <br />
<br />
<br />
ITS ALWAYS THE WARRIOR.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not true.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many folks have argued that the lack of initial taunt makes warriors unfeasible in high level experience groups.  I continue to say that I have not seen ONE experience group in my 190 aa's which is the case.  Now an enchanter does bring up a good point about non shaman groups having more difficulty without malos.  I acknowledge that....I know that is true..I know warriors are having problems getting into experience groups because of that...yes yes yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
and again...<br />
<br />
Can we tank? Yes<br />
<br />
Are we the premier tank we gave up everthing to be? Hell no. <br />
<br />
<br />
And I agree that some sort of initial taunt increase - maybe kick stun with 1 min refresh would help the &quot;shamanless group&quot; in particular.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once a minute is not enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
But don't discount my suggestion of an increase in DPS which aids the group in the kills per hour, protects the other dps during the fight - ie: wizzy nuking during 2nd half of fight and raises warriors to a viable 6th addition in an already balanced 5 person experience group.<br />
<br />
<br />
An increase in DPS to fix the Warrior class is not the answer. An across the board DPS upgrade for all melee, especially pure melee would be welcomed, but it does not address Warrior balance. We are tanks.<br />
<br />
1) We must be *close or equal* to Knights in our ability to get and hold aggro, in order to be considered a valid choice as group tank.<br />
<br />
2) We must be ahead of Knights in HP/mitigation to offset the benefit they get from their spells.<br />
<br />

That 6th slot as I have said (and it seems no one is listening) is the real issue friends.  The problem is not just &quot;Warriors can't taunt as well as Pallys/SK&quot;  it's &quot;how can we solve the problems about warriors LFG?&quot;.  And that LFG has 2 components NOT ONE AS MANY WARRIORS REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE; 1) EQUAL choice as main assist, and 2) bringing something to the table to be considered as 6th member in the 5-person balanced group.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 6th slot question is not a Warrior balance issue, it is a melee balance issue. Putting warriors in competition with Monks and Rogues for a DPS slot is *not* the answer.</div></div><hr />

It appears that &quot;narrow minded&quot; peeps just don't get it still. Warriors don't necessarily have to be equal in taunt to be equal tanks - they just need other areas improved to compensate. My goodness, it seems that everyone is so absorbed with the taunt issue that no other fixes would satisfy them. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />

<br />
You really need to read and attempt to understand the arguments being presented here, before you call Warriors &quot;narrow minded&quot;.<br />
<br />
Answer: There are a few good ideas, but my what a bashing for me just throwing out some thoughts!  The snipits you are referencing are in my 3rd post which is addressing many of the previous posters responses.<br />

And peeps, even now warriors are the best tanks - let's get real, how many times in an experience group with equally equiped/level/aa Pally/SK is the warrior an offtank - the answer is NEVER. Anyone who really plays the game knows I'm right on this one.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not true, most of the time Warriors are not the best xp group tanks.<br />
<br />
Answer: Well again, I have asked many of the best warriors on Quellious about this and every single one says they are always the main assist.  Now they do say that a nice trick is to have the pally/sk stun on incoming and then they grab agro as the fight goes on.  But it's still the warrior who is the main assist.<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
So, the $100 question still remains &quot;do warriors need further balancing?&quot;. And despite what some of the idiots posting have inaccurately claimed my position is I continue to think they do for the pure reason that many are having LFG issues.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think most of us understand your position quite well. Let me have a shot at summarizing... Our poor aggro generating capabilities should remain the same and we should get DPS to compensate.<br />
<br />
Sorry, not acceptable. Warriors are tanks, I don't want to be a bad Rogue or Monk (or worse, do more DPS than a rogue or monk and invalidate their reason for being). I want to be the good tank.<br />
<br />
A good tank must have the tools to get and hold aggro *or* have a sufficient lead in HP/mitagation that the group is prepared to accept their aggro generating limitations.<br />
<br />
Answer:  I never said that warriors shouldn't get some sort of initial agro booster - check out my suggestion about a 1 min stun disc to be used on inc.  And some folks posted thinking that the delay is too lengthly - well, even pallys have to time their stuns properly.  And, don't forget that additonal DPS will generate more agro.<br />

Sony's most excellent vision for experience groups is to grab a tank, grab a healer, grab a slower and 3 more and go to town. There should be NO class which is indespensible in an experience group, it's mix and match. If you don't agree that is is Sony's vision and implimentation I am talking to a brick wall and no amount of good points is going to sink in.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This has no bearing on the balance question. Knights and Warriors are *all* able to tank for a group. Tweaks to warrior aggro will not change this.<br />
<br />
Warriors are the specialist tank. We give up everything, to be the specialist tank. Despite this Paladins and SK's are both *better* at the Warriors specialist role.<br />
<br />
Answer: I wouldn't call the warrior a specialist tank, I would call a warrior a tank with limited specialities.  Hps, damage mitigation, and DPS.  Throw in a couple of discs and there you go.  Pallys and Sk's are tanks also in Sony's world - and you all know their bag of tricks.  Warriors giving up everything to be the better specialist tank? - well I would agree with that in a raid situation, but I have tried to keep this discussion focused on experience groups. <br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Some peeps are saying that you should need a warrior to fight harder experience group named and I totally disagree. That's warriors trying to exclude the Pallys/SK again. Let's separate raiding from experience groups. Ok, are we on the same page? Is it fair to &quot;absolutely have to have&quot; a warrior to tank an experience group named? Anyone who says yes on this is part of the above mentioned&quot;brick wall&quot; and nothing I say will make any sense to you.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Again this is irrelevant. Knights *are* tanking xp group named *now*. Adjusting warrior aggro will affect this how?<br />
<br />
Answer: This was in response to many posts asking for super hard named mobs in LDON so that only a warrior with defensive could tank them.  Not exactly fair to pally/sk.<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Warriors being the prefered tank for the &quot;biger named mobs&quot; is one of the advantages it has over a Pally/SK.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You still talking about xp group named? If so, see above.<br />
<br />
If you are talking about raid level mobs, this is irrelevant, both Knights (especially Paladin) and Warrior have raid roles.<br />
<br />
Warriors tank the raid mob, due *only* to the curse that is defensive. My class is balanced around a single ability I got at level 55.<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer: I am talking about experience groups, and even though there are not that many challanging single group named, there are a few.<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The other advantages as have been stated are 500 hps, and slightly better mitigation (it's small I know, but it is an advantage).<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
500hp is a good lead huh?<br />
<br />
Against xp group mobs, 500hp is less than one cast of BoD for a SK, add in LT procs and the ability to LT more aggressively in a pinch and the lead is gone.<br />
<br />
In some group configurations an equal level/aa/equip Paladin will have *more* buffed HP than me. Not to forget the ability to LH or self heal. So much for my uber 500hp<br />
<br />
As for the mitigation advantage, it's rumored to be there, but as I said previously I just don't see it.<br />
<br />
Answer: I agree 100% with the above, hence my suggestion about improving warriors.  Gosh, remember I'm suggesting pumping up warriors - I have to admit the flames are a bit surprising.  My tone in my 3rd post was more in response to the bashing I had been subjected to.<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok, back to the $100 question, are these advantages enough to put warriors on equal footing with Pally/SK's in getting into an experience group? My answer continues to be no.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Right answer, flawed solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
So, what's the solution? Well, lots of you have tunnel vision back to the taunt issue again. Well, I'll try one last time to state my position since I think many just do not get it. The following are a few assumptions that I believe are clear from Sony's class balancing.<br />
<br />
1) Balancing is done not to get everyone on a level playing field on skills, dps, healing, taunt etc. but to help balance out the LFG. If there are no LFG issues then things are pretty well balanced.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree. You can't possibly exclude non-group capabilities in considering balance. Why should a class with great solo capability be as desirable to a group as a class with little or no solo capability? (Note: I am not saying Knights have great solo capability, albeit better than Warriors. Just that non-group related abilities must be a balance consideration)<br />
<br />
Answer:  Well, I tend to agree with you there to a certain extent, but soloing isn't all that it's cracked up to be - it's lonely and boring.  EQ is a game of social interaction after all so I would dismiss the solo stuff as a class choice for those peeps who for some reason decide to do it.  I carefully suggested in my initial post that I am talking about the 65 game and that game is very heavily grouping oriented.<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
2) Classes should have some differences. If not, EQ would be more boring than it &quot;sometimes&quot; is. Also group makeup causes differences in playing style, in an experience group you can choose to play a bit more &quot;safely&quot; with, let's say a cleric, enchanter, backup healer....or you can opt for more DPS and more risk. It's all about kills per hour.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I accept this.<br />

<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now, lets now talk about warriors since that is today's topic. Hopefully we have gotten over the incorrect assumption that warriors are broken with my argument about who is Main Assist in a group with a warrior and pally/sk. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Define broken.<br />
<br />
Can we tank? Yes<br />
<br />
Are we the premier tank we gave up everthing to be? Hell no. <br />
<br />
Answer:  Well, broken was brought up in flame posts.  Premier tank? I still do not agree that premier tank is Sony's vision except in raid situations.  In experience groups I believe Sony wants the choice of tanks to be a toss-up.  Not idential in every way - just equal by in large.<br />

<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not true.<br />
<br />
Answer:  Well, as I stated and as many of the board peeps have stated I have never seen a well equiped warrior defer main assist duties to a pally/sk except for a quick stun/snare at the beginning of the fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Many folks have argued that the lack of initial taunt makes warriors unfeasible in high level experience groups. I continue to say that I have not seen ONE experience group in my 190 aa's which is the case. Now an enchanter does bring up a good point about non shaman groups having more difficulty without malos. I acknowledge that....I know that is true..I know warriors are having problems getting into experience groups because of that...yes yes yes.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and again...<br />
<br />
Can we tank? Yes<br />
<br />
Are we the premier tank we gave up everthing to be? Hell no. <br />
<br />
<br />
Answer:  Well we have beat this horse to death.  You believe that you should be the priemier experience group tank and I suggest that Sony thinks otherwise.  I also suggest that warriors give up nothing - they are what they are.  I just think personally that the warriors got so used to hybrids sucking for years that they got the impression that slot #1 was theirs in every experience group.  Thank goodness Sony fixed hybrids and made them a viable tank so that warrior(less) groups could go out and kill stuff.<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
And I agree that some sort of initial taunt increase - maybe kick stun with 1 min refresh would help the &quot;shamanless group&quot; in particular.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once a minute is not enough.<br />
<br />
Answer:  Initial agro is the problem with most well equiped warriors - they rarely loose it as the fight progresses as long as the wizzy doesnt uber nuke.  Just like a pally who stuns on inc. a warrior disc could have the same effect.  It is a foolproof agro retainer, probably not, but heck there has to be some randomness in EQ to keep things interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
But don't discount my suggestion of an increase in DPS which aids the group in the kills per hour, protects the other dps during the fight - ie: wizzy nuking during 2nd half of fight and raises warriors to a viable 6th addition in an already balanced 5 person experience group.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
An increase in DPS to fix the Warrior class is not the answer. An across the board DPS upgrade for all melee, especially pure melee would be welcomed, but it does not address Warrior balance. We are tanks.<br />
<br />
1) We must be *close or equal* to Knights in our ability to get and hold aggro, in order to be considered a valid choice as group tank.<br />
<br />
2) We must be ahead of Knights in HP/mitigation to offset the benefit they get from their spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer: I disagree, its all about kills per hour - it doesn't all come down to taunt.  Now you may say, heck what does a shaman know about agro and taunting?  Well, I suggest that the shaman knows quite a bit more than a warrior because the shaman is the one who creates the agro.  The shaman sees how different tanks and different classes generate agro.  The &quot;skilled&quot; shaman is the static element in the agro test - he sees the entire picture including resists, timing, etc.  The warrior just does not have enough information to really understand what is going on - he just knows if he has agro or not.  He doesn't know if the shaman is a turkey or a pro - doesnt know if tash landed on time, blah, blah, blah....<br />
<br />

That 6th slot as I have said (and it seems no one is listening) is the real issue friends. The problem is not just &quot;Warriors can't taunt as well as Pallys/SK&quot; it's &quot;how can we solve the problems about warriors LFG?&quot;. And that LFG has 2 components NOT ONE AS MANY WARRIORS REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE; 1) EQUAL choice as main assist, and 2) bringing something to the table to be considered as 6th member in the 5-person balanced group.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The 6th slot question is not a Warrior balance issue, it is a melee balance issue. Putting warriors in competition with Monks and Rogues for a DPS slot is *not* the answer.<br />
<br />
Answer: I never said that warriors should be competition with pure DPS classes.  I said that in a balanced group of 5 looking for the 6th (without any DPS looking for group) that a better DPS warrior is a more viable addition.  Sony eliminating the experience penalty for the 6th man was a stroke of genious.  That move in its self helped more LFG's than any class balancing.  You know, there are many situations where a group is best advised just to add a 6th and fight away rather than trying to find that perfect fit.  Think about it, ok you are in BOT and there are 3 65 warriors LFG - not that unusual these days.   I suggest that there are probably openings for DPS slots that are being reserved for the next available rogue, mage, wizzy, whatever.  If Sony improves warrior damage the group waiting for the pure DPS has a decision to make.  Now, frankly they usually blow off the warriors.<br />
<br />
Last note:  You know maybe I have not spelled out my thoughts clearly enough. It is my belief that Warriors are tuned for raids and any increase in taunting ability will throw off the raid content and Sony would rather not have to redo all the raid content.  So, I am suggesting/guessing, whatever you want to call it that they will throw the warrior class a bone in two areas, first a very slight increase in agro (my guess concentrating on initial stun kick, whatever) and by DPS.  The whole point of my initial post was that I had rarely seen a DPS suggestion presented - and now I understand why - it's because the vast majority of warriors (at least those who post here) think that warriors should be superior experience group tanks and superior raid tanks.  Warriors feel that they have &quot;given up everything to be the superior tank&quot;.  Well, in a Everquest of all raiding they are correct, but like it or not EQ is probably 1/2 raiding and 1/2 single-group encounters of mix-and-match groups.</div></div><hr />

There are no mana or healing related issues that would make me a better choice for taking the damage, and their far superior aggro control means that casters can get increased DPS. So I break out the DPS weapons and go to town.<br />
<br />
Hybrid and me in a group, with me as MT:<br />
<br />
Pros: Require sligtly less healing<br />
Cons: Lower DPS from me, due to having to switch to aggro weapons, lower DPS from the casters due to lower aggro<br />
<br />
With Hybrid as MT:<br />
<br />
Pros: Higher aggro control, saving healing mana. Higher DPS from me due to damage weapons/procs. Higher damage from casters.<br />
Cons: Require slightly more healing... which doesn't really matter because healing mana is never an issue<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, hybrids are clearly the better choice over me in XP groups. The difference in healing really doesn't matter at all, as with either tank, there's not going to be any stoppage due to low mana.<br />
<br />
Especially beyond a certain point, there is no clear advantage in having a warrior MT in an XP group, or even trash mobs in raids over a hybrid, while the hybrid enjoys the clear advantage of having far superior aggro capabilities.</div></div><hr />

TANKING = AGRO <br />

65 enchanter with 100 AA here as well..<br />
<br />
/agree 100% with Ugok.<br />
/disagree with purdy.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's this simple:<br />
When I form my own groups I look for the following:<br />
<br />
Step 1: I first look for a cleric. If I can't find one I look for a druid I know and trust who I know has PoT9 or at least PoTG. If I can't find one I give up.<br />
<br />
Step 2: I look for a paladin. Failing this I look for a shadowknight. Failing this I look for a warrior I know and trust (one who I know uses shield because I KNOW I will draw aggro). Failing this I give up.<br />
<br />
Step 3: Now the group is formed and, if I don't have one already, I find a camp. I literally do not even bother looking for DPS until we are at camp.. DPS is a dime a dozen in LFG (which is why SOE gave *most* DPS classes solo abilities.. /comfort rogues).<br />
<br />
Step 4: Flush out the group. Look for rangers with AM3 and EQ first, beastlords second, high level mages third, rogues fourth and bards fifth.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is entirely and 100% aggro managment. How can anyone think DPS is the problem? I don't understand!?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, most of the clerics I group with are 80m to FM most of the time.. So how can anyone think HP is the problem. I don't get that either.<br />

If you need defensive for a mob, you need pally/sk for their utilities. They won't be shit outta luck. It just won't happen.<br />

Thanks for calling all warriors stupid when it comes to knowing aggro. We know if a slow lands because we see the red text slow down. We know if a shaman is shitty because we see how they play. Seriously. We do.</div></div><hr />

Now, since we didn't have a usual puller the warrior just brought in 2-3 mobs at a time to speed things up.  And we sure as heck never ran short on mana by the way.<br />
<br />
Warrior was using a 2 hander also, lol. And had about 8k hps and 1400 ac (nothing uber). <br />
<br />
OK, result.......rocking...only 1 death, the beasty because cleric fell asleep once, lol.  Wizzy and Mage NEVER got agro, NEVER!!  The cleric got agro a few times, but only when warrior got beat on during the pull and needed a fast heal before the fight started.  I got agro a couple of times, but usually only when I wanted it so I could park the mobs.  Heck, most of the time I didn't bother parking, the beasty just offtanked.  Now did I get summoned? sure quite a bit, but I didn't get beat on - the warrior TAUNTED it off me, lol.<br />
<br />
Guys, I still don't think you get it.  I guess I'm questioning the peeps around the warriors, the bad shaman, the bad chanters, the over agro dps, the bad clerics, etc. The beastlords and monks who don't know how to offtank (cough cough).   Warriors are NOT broken! and AOE taunt rocks!  It is bad groups which hurt the warrior, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
You know, if you are convinced you suck there is nothing I can say and other peeps will start believing you suck.  Bad agro management is not usually the fault of the warrior unless he is eating lunch and not paying attention.<br />
<br />
Taking the occasional bad group and bad party composition and saying - &quot;See we are broken!!!&quot; is laughable.<br />
<br />
Now, I still think Sony will toss you a bone because of the LFG issue - but as far as I'm concerned its not because you are broken.  Working as intended (lol, got to love that old saying).<br />

Then I post on this message board and make a suggestion that warriors need some sort of improvement and i get a rash of  doodie for posting because I suggest that taunt is not the most appropriate fix.  Well, my purpose here was to give you folks a different perspective because I continue to say that you don't have enough information to ascertain whether taunt is broken or not.  You don't see the resists,  you don't know if a skilled shaman/chanter/cleric is going a good job or not because you are not &quot;controlling&quot; the agro, you are just generating as much as you can.  It isn't because you are stupid, lol, its because you don't have the INFORMATION.  Now I get back to my very first post, I have 190+aa's in tier 2 zones and above and there NEVER has been a time when I felt that a warrior sucked and I wanted to replace him/her in the group (unless said warrior wasn't paying attention).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Thanks for telling us what we already bloody know. Having grinded 120 aa over the time since aa came live I know exactly what an exp group entails.<br />
<br />
I swear its like other classes cannot come up with a good argument so they say &quot;well even though you have spent hundreds of days on your warrior you have zero idea how this game works, no idea how taunt works and well all warrior problems are because you suck!&quot; Its the most retarded argument.<br />
<br />
Who the fuck cares that you do not care that you sometimes get aggro, the vast majority of people will take a knight because they want more room to open up their class in an exp group and dps much faster.<br />
<br />
No one told you exping is impossible with a warrior, it is possible. Its just less efficient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that the two classes never got aggro is not because warrior aggro generation is fine, it's because some people know how to walk on eggshells around us.<br />
<br />
Oh, just to confirm what Thaak was saying: &quot;%T slows down&quot; Gee, I wonder what that spell was...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do not compare elemental people to non elemental people. Given the same teir, I have stayed at a safe distance to guild monks/rogues in dps. Rough parsing put me at about 100, guild monk at 150, and guild rogue at around 200 (very rough idea, just to give you a visual) Any dps increase given to warriors without upgradeing rogues/monks at the same time would be unfair. Not to mention not tanking, with the appropriate buffs and a good fast 2her (polearm) with some dps aa's, I come within 20 dps of some of our monks and within 50 dps of our rogues when I use aggresive. And to do so I only have to find the mob and hit attack (*hugs Tactical Mastery*). No strafing to get into position, so its easier for us to maintain our max dps. <br />
<br />
I'm quite happy with the dps numbers warriors can get up too. Of course we do not have any flashy big crits, we do some of the best sustained damage in game. Finding the mob and hitting &quot;a&quot; is a metric ton less work than dps classes have to do to get their max dps. <br />
<br />
So, your idea is moot.</div></div><hr />

Then no offense but you deserve to be groupless. I can two box PoV with my druid without even getting my ToD out of the bag and gimme a KEI and I'll duo HoH. If for some reason you can't do that then 2-box PoN. Its 1%AA per kill (PoV being 3%). Why sit lfg when you can make exp?  <br />
<br />
Because 2boxing is not how everyone wants to play this game, imagine that ? It's very boring over time. And no offense, he doesnt deserve to be groupless, and from looking at your magelo I can see why you dont need to ghetto slow for POV, I already can tank unslowed stuff to some extend, you do it on purpose to max out DS damage for faster kills.<br />
<br />
<br />
Almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, especially if the beastlord cant even land his slow due to high magic resistance. Beastlords' level 65 slow is no better than the level 44 enchanter slow Shiftless Deeds. Look it up.<br />
<br />
What buffs are just as good as shamans? Almost every buff a beastlord has is a shaman spell - and the shaman has one better. <br />
<br />
<br />
It lands most of the time in BoT and in PoV. if it doesnt on first try, he has disciple and he takes a beating well enough. About the buffs, I hardly looked it up, but when I compare being grouped with virtue + shaman buffs I am absolutly equal when having virtue + bst buffs... <br />
Reason is Spiritual vigor, which shamans do NOT have a buff line on. But ok, lets go and look at your spell list.<br />
<br />
Acumen - Use in exp group?<br />
Regrowth - Necro says thanks. thats all.<br />
Spiritual Dominion  - HUGE plus for the beastlord. You say I dont care about mana regen as a warrior? I DO care about my group being up and running without too much med time<br />
Talisman of Jacinth/Shadoo  - PR and DR are absolutly useless in most exp zones. CoD is different, but they proc the shit so often you need cures anyways.<br />
Celerity - given I dont have any other sort of haste. Still, the difference is minimal compared to the DPS a bstlord adds vs shaman pet at 25dps<br />
Stamina - As soon as vindi BP is mine every sta spell cast carries me over 255, above hardly matters.<br />
Ferocity - 150 ATK is nothing impressive? I hope you are kidding (I think its only 100 tho)<br />
<br />
Should we compare healing abilities ?<br />
No, as those are not a slowers job in the first place anyways.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you just have a beef against shamans, and that's why you wont group with them.<br />
yes, they take up a good spot in the group that could be DPS. thats all.<br />
<br />
I dont know how many beastlords are around on old servers, but stromm has alot of them, and I am glad we do.<br />
<br />
bout HP buffs..<br />

BstL are a BETTER buffing class than their parent class. sounds wrong though :)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Answer: Well, broken was brought up in flame posts. Premier tank? I still do not agree that premier tank is Sony's vision except in raid situations. In experience groups I believe Sony wants the choice of tanks to be a toss-up. Not idential in every way - just equal by in large.&quot;<br />
<br />
Right now, the choice of tanks in an experience group is not a toss-up.  Warriors need some help to get them to the point where it is a toss-up in general.  Once that choice is a toss-up, then it might be worthwhile to look at that 6th spot.<br />

P.S.  Purdypog:  As a non-Warrior, and non-regular to this board, I find your tone condescending and insulting.  I gather from your additional posts that you don't wish to come across this way.  You need to re-think your writing style then.  The know-it-all point of view you come across with will not gain you many friends, especially in this written-word medium.  I also think that most experienced players have plenty of information to decide why aggro is gained and lost.  Your statement about that was ludicrous, and your re-iteration of that statement shows that you are not listening to what others are trying to say.</div></div><hr />

Hi tarean,<br />
<br />
Tarean, why is it that I never see the already balanced group of 5 adding a warrior?  I suggest that it would not be unbalancing to put warrior damage exactly at monk damage.  It seems to me that groups looking for dps and pulling still would prefer the monk so you would not be infringing on their dps slot in a normal group.  Its just the ability to fill that 6th spot if no dps is looking which I continue to think is the key.<br />
<br />
Now, during the course of my posts (well intended and nice, btw untill I got dumped on pretty hard by the idiots), I agreed with the poster who suggested that initial agro was a key issue, and I put out a thought that a stun disc with 1 min reuse might be a feasible (not-overpowered) solution.  The reuse timer, in my opinion should not be shorter than that because it would unbalance the raid role of the warrior.<br />
<br />
Oh, and my intention posting is not to troll but to discuss the issues in a civilized manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I think monks might have a wee problem with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">As if monks aren't hurting enough as it is. Boosting warrior DPS to monk levels is a horrible idea. It would make the monk class utterly pointless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great idea! Let's make monk's upsolete with warriors and shadowknights! Warriors will replace monk DPS, and shadowknights will replace monks in pulling. Great idea.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Its just the ability to fill that 6th spot if no dps is looking which I continue to think is the key.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
And we continue to tell you that the 6th slot is something warriors weren't made to do. We made these characters not for their versitality. We made them to take a fucking beating. And that's all we want to do efficiently.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Now, during the course of my posts (well intended and nice, btw untill I got dumped on pretty hard by the idiots)&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
We're idiots for telling you our DPS isn't our main concern? Try again.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;it would unbalance the raid role of the warrior.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
This is the only thing I agree with. We don't need insta-aggro lock. In my opinion, that snap-aggro dumbs the game down. This is what's caused all the troubles. People know knights have snap aggro, and warriors don't. They know knights increase group DPS, which in turn effects kills per hour, which is more exp for them. Seems to me that cutting spell stun aggro in half would be a likely suggestion. Although pallies would be mad. =\.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Oh, and my intention posting is not to troll but to discuss the issues in a civilized manner.&lt;&lt;<br />

Civilized by all but calling us fucking idiots? Sorry, you get what you give.</div></div><hr />

Monks are already suffering here and not to SKs... High level clerics and chanters often make better pullers than FD monks because they can split the mobs in one tenth the time:<br />
<br />
Pacification<br />
1: 	Frenzy Radius(1/65)<br />
2: 	Reaction Radius(1/65)<br />
3: 	Pacify<br />
 <br />
Mana: 	350<br />
Skill: 	Alteration<br />
Casting Time: 	4.5<br />
Recast Time: 	2.25<br />
Fizzle Time: 	2.25<br />
Range: 	200<br />
Target Type: 	Single<br />
Spell Type: 	Beneficial<br />
Classes: CLR/65 ENC/62<br />
Duration: 7 ticks (42 seconds)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone who has waited literally minutes in BoT or HoH or Tactics for that twinned mob to wander off knows how frustrating FD pulling many PoP camps can be.<br />
<br />
The only drawback to pacification is that it's mana-intensive. But all that means is your enchanter (hopefully the enchanter not the cleric is pulling on the off chance there is a resist so they can eat the death, get a rez, gather mana and be GTG) DPS's a little less per fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Once again, the point is that increasing warrior DPS would not only not solve the problem at hand, it would cause further class balancing problems.  Honestly, the answer isn't hard, though. I htink a lot of hte ideas that were brainstormed on this site would work fantastically without 1. hurting the balance with other classes 2. being overpowering and 3. requiring any mechanics changes.. I sincerely hope that SOE reads the brainstorming thread here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2577) and seriously considers some of these suggestions. Certainly they should throw out *most* of them but seems to me there are some an easy sollutions that would satisfy everyone in there.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I think that I agree with something someone else wrote. Sony has shifted their attention away from EQ1 and, frankly, does NOT care about class balance, etc. In fact, they have introduced new spells INTENTIONALLY to eliminate the need for certain classes (rogues in particular). I think what is happening is that as warriors and rogues and monks leave SOE sees that guilds aren't successful at the upper tiers and aren't having fun so they try to compensate for the missing classes by allowing other classes to fill in for them.. It's backfiring on them, though, and more and more people of the rarer classes are leaving because of these relative (relative to other classes) nerfs. This just causes SOE to give even MORE abilities to the fill-in classes and the whole thing spirals downward until... until... EQ2 is released and we give them our money anew.</div></div><hr />

When you are ready to talk about the issues rather than making bold unsubstantiated claims, showing a serious lack of any understanding of class balance, then running off to other bulletin boards to generate sympathy for your little trumped up &quot;cause&quot;, and calling essentially anyone who disagrees with your incorrect assumptions an &quot;idiot&quot;, then feel free to come here and have a discussion, but until then, you'll be nothing more than my current view of you.<br />

Incidentally, please give me your magelo link, character name and server name so I can verify the truth of your claim of being a shaman, and so I can yap with you in-game.</div></div><hr />
