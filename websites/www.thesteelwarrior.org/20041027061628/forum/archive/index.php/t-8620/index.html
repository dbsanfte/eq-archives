<br />
My problem is this. My guild has 6 warriors with Dbows aug'd with anger 3 augs. We are finding it more and more possible to steal aggro without even trying.  Is this due to a taunt cap on counters?  Every anger/rage proc after a certain point will gain whoever proc'd aggro even for the most breif of time till the actual Main Tank's taunt refreshes and is successful.  so this is my question.<br />
<br />
Is there a cap on the amount of taunt counters? <br />
Is it a sliding scale meaning are Casters and the like on a different scale then warriors to avoid them completely stealing aggro like their cap is XX and ours would be XXX taunt counters?   Any help would be awesome.</div></div><hr />
