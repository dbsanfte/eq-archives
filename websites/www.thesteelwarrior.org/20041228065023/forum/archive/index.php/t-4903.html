<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zigglewort</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went out to do a bit of AE factioning using Rampage and Earthshaker yesterday but I was very disappointed with the frequency of the procs.  Previously when I have done this, masses of corpses were the result of the swarm of procs, but this did not happen.<br />
<br />
Granted, I tried this only four times yesterday, but the results were very consistent.  With groups of c. 60 mobs and 30 mobs I rampaged and go absolutely no procs either time.  With a group of c. 40 mobs I got 2 procs and with a group of c. 50 mobs I got one proc.  Although I was not slowed, I had no haste buff and no haste item.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced proc rate reductions in general or with Rampage?  Perhaps this is just an aberration of the RNG, but it is a far departure from my previous experiences.</div></div><hr />
