<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know Dadepot or Dadepot's alt on Tunare by any chance.  I was stupid enough to list my ccom without a zero and he was the fastest one to buy it.  So I practically lost 100k in a flash, DOH!  Tried sending him tells (I'm prob on ignore), petitioning didnt work, and now hoping someone knows his main. <br />
<br />
It doesnt seem him he is poor, has a few ornate items for sale.  Was hoping he would be a nice guy, and give me something back.  Now Im broke = (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bummer although it sucks it is partially your fault 8-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Adzar, why would you point that out? <br />
Don't you think Lorre is unhappy enough already without you coming along to rub his face in a mistake?<br />
<br />
Please do come by the boards when something goes against you, Adzar, so that we can extend you the kind of sympathy you're showing a fellow warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its alright Lathen, I did screw up.  I was just seeing if anyone here knew his alt or perhaps that he is a Steel Warrior as well.  Way back when Ive dropped things and people have been nice enough to give them back.  I was just being hopeful . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do hope you get your gear or money back, Lorre.<br />
<br />
My response to Adzar is a general lashing out at the behavior I see on EQ boards and in game from folks who are mostly anonymous. Nobody should have the right to abandon good manners and common courtesy just because his/her real identity is hidden behind a login name. <br />
<br />
For cryin' out loud, just treat people the way you'd like to be treated...<br />
<br />
You have fallen off your soapbox!<br />
You take 127 hitpoints of non-melee damage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I dont much care how much disdain you have for me or my opinion.<br />
<br />
The guy screwed up and someone took advantage of it. I feel a tad different from you apparently. All too often people never want to claim responsibility for their own actions. This guy mispriced an item and someone bought it. While the guy that did it is a dick I still think that people need to accept the fact that there is a certain level of responsibility for their own actions. Apparently this guy accepts that fact and that I can respect. But I did not abandon all courtesy I think you need to read my post then read yours. Your not winning any mr. Courteous awards yourself.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is I don't much care what you think so you can take your soapbox and shove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whatever. I love how you prove my point.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck, Lorre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whatever. I love how you prove my point.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck, Lorre.<br />
<br />
lol he wasnt even that hard on him, he only used &quot;partially&quot; ive seen people go all out and laugh at the person, much worse, i'm sure he didnt mean to rub it in his face (an assumption you make however it can be taken in many ways what he said).  In short, look at things more positively even in the worst circumstances I'm sure i'm not the only one who thought Adzar's response was not inappropriate or rubbing in the face but more of a sympathy towards him for his already known mistake.  <br />
<br />
As for any info, I also play on tunare but I havent heard of you Lorre :/ so dont have any info just thought I'd respond anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KronnikBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lathen, stfu.<br />
<br />
That is all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">KronnikBB, you'd better log out before your computer science teacher catches you using the lab computers for something other than homework.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hehe, I found a guildmate selling an obulus death shoud for 20pp instead of 20k that he meant to put it up for once.  Bought it on an alt and eventually sold it back to him for the 20pp I paid him for it, but not before I raked him over the coals for a few days :).<br />
<br />
Bummer about your cowl though, I've done the same thing on a smaller scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KronnikBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">edited because it was really juvenile</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lathen ya just need to chill out and understand that all people do not have the same views in life as you do.<br />
<br />
I can't concern myself with the fact that people don't like some of my opinions. I did not unleash on the guy I simply wanted to see if he was acknowledging the fact that he had part of the blame in this. He did and that makes me sympathize all the more with him. <br />
<br />
I never said anything along the lines of HA HA you retard you got what you deserved and most certainly never acted rudley towards him. I did act rudely towards you and I apologize for that, but I still don't appreciate the tone of your initial reply. You over reacted and judged me based on nothing substantial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think my initial point was poorly stated, and it's obvious that I didn't help matters with my smart ass replies. <br />
<br />
I edited out the one that followed KronnikBB's &quot;faggotry&quot; rant.<br />
<br />
Sorry about stirring that up, Warriors.<br />
<br />
See you in other threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ive had some bad luck with accidents like that myself. /sigh. One time when I was selling all my druids gear so I could twink out my new monk I had a trade window open with all 4 bags full of armor and various drops when a lag spike caused me to hit trade instead of cancel, the bastard hit trade really fast then logged. Then when I caught him online later I asked him to return the stuff and he pretended it never happened so I shitlisted him on my server board.  Happy ending is, he contacted me after that and returned everything but a cheap tunic and he gave me the cash value of it instead if id go and retract my sl. I took the sl off because his druid was only 12 so it wouldnt have been all that hard to restart on an alt anyways so it wasnt worth bothering with. I didnt tell him about the sl on my guild board though so I left that one up.  :D <br />
