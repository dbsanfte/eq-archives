Our druid got one in my group by being the first to Hail it, and then say follow.  We couldn't figure out how to transfer the pet or make it attack.  It only seemed to assist if the person who had the pet got hit.  So since our druid had the pet... it proved to be completely useless since he hardly ever got hit...  <br />
<br />
We later found another pet thing at 1% life laying down.  We tried hailing it and healing it... but it didn't respond.  So being the warrior I am... I attacked it... and killed it in one hit.  I got some msg about it's spirit or something returning to miragil's lair, shrug.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any more info on these?</div></div><hr />

uhhh, I wouldnt say a warrior would hit an almost dead person. Sounds more like a punk to me :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you've tried other things and they failed, a warrior would certainly try brute force :P<br />
<br />
Go flame someone else dick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ones with higher life, if you damage them a bit then say yes when they talk to you... you get them as a pet. Make sure the MT gets it, because its like an ench pet (sword/shield) and will only attack if the pet's owner gets attacked.<br />
<br />
The one that you found will either heal your HP (or cure your diseases maybe) or refill their mana. Or they could be traps and span 2 little things. That happened once out of 4 that I saw last night or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well on the MM adventures I have done, I have seen numerous &quot;bitten victims&quot;. To activate em, I slam and then tell em yes, they can follow me. Seems like they need to be attacked to wake up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bittem victims and such,.. the ones FDed with very low life.. are traps, but they are usually beneficial (as mentioned, HP, Mana, etc. granted to group) but occaisonally the spawn some mobs on death or trigger a nasty DoT (poison I think, called Dark Venom (?))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Baadan said. I always kill them. About 60% of the time they do something benfeicial, the other times they usually spawn 2 low level mobs that attack you. Not a problem though, they ARE low level - e.g. force shock lands on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was defaulted one of these pets last night in one the Rukarian Hills dungeons.  Normal difficulty.<br />
<br />
Before I spew into the details, the pet was a goblin and my group consisted of five level 65's and one level 61.  Due to the flexibility of how LDoN sets up dungeons, I would imagine SoE coded in several different pets depending on the group's average level.<br />
<br />
So anyhoo, we uncovered one of these new goblin style pets and the group immedietly defaulted it to me since they're coded like enchanter pets.  Mine seemed to quad for 60, though not all that often (mostly triple and doubles at best) and with shaman Swift Like Wind (60% haste), I parsed it out to roughly 38dps.  Mind you, I also noticed mobs had very little AC.  In fact, they seemed to have even less AC than BoT mobs.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, LDoN is just bloody amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI:<br />
<br />
Since many mobs in LDoN dungeons enrage, I've found it beneficial to your &quot;pet&quot; to attack the mob then turn so that your pet is at it's rear so he doesn't die on rage.<br />

I just wondered if it was a time limit, or perhaps they will only go so far into the dungeon. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Can't buff or heal these pets.<br />
<br />
And they are timed, they eventually go away.</div></div><hr />

They stood right up, asked if they could come play, I said yes, and hot damn...I have a pet! Yeah and as someone already mentioned 180-degree your pet...chewing rage will kill them fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
ps. i want a pet ALL the time now =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can heal them, not sure about buffing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I healed some last night.  I dont know what the deal is but sometimes they show up as real pets with a pet bar &amp; those are heal/buffable - most times they dont have a pet bar &amp; you cant cast on them though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if they do not show up as a pet (in fact, I never had one show up as pet yet, after about 15 or so times I had them) you can buff and heal them.<br />
<br />
We end up with 1 or 2 every adventure, and have always been able to haste, NDT, heal, etc them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pet is good if you are MT but not puller. I usually pull for the group as sometimes the rogues/rangers/etc will get a mean beatdown by 3 mobs while the chanter is working on CC. If I have a pet and pull there is a good chance a caster is gonna hit me with crap_spell_01 and the lil pet is gonna go eat hawt death to the caster and his buddies. That slows things down a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weird; I tried healing a pet that was at like 10% health and it didn't heal.  Tried it again last night too.  Spell lands, just health didn't move (and no successful spell landed message).<br />
<br />
*shrug* dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had an Ogre pet the other day and a mob got pushed thru a wall or gated one. Anyway, my pet took off around the corner and died obviously but not before bringing back 12 mobs!!<br />
<br />
So watch out, those cute little bastards will train you if a mob gets out of camp the pets keeps going. <br />
<br />
Overall though the pets seemed a nice gimick. I like the expansion as well usually don't log on other than to raid lately but this made a xp group fun again.</div></div><hr />
