<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drakh Darkscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Improvements in all areas!<br />
<br />
I created a warrior some time ago (around luclin release) on a seperate server from my main server.<br />
She is a Barbarian Warrior of RZ. Her gear is very low par and money is around 100pp.<br />
Items of note include crafted pieces, hero bracer, lammy, weighted axe, velium axe of the brood.<br />
<br />
I am looking to work on her again (more as a challenge without twinking) and was hoping i could get some good gear suggestions.<br />
<br />
I plan on spending some time farming tradeskill loot to sell in bazaar and will use the bazaar to primarily gear myself. ill do regular checks for high AC/HP items but i was wondering if there are any &quot;gold mine&quot; items i should be specifically looking for?<br />
<br />
I intend to get to 65 with this character but will not look at PoP progresson or raid content. (quite frankly i dont have the time for them) - LDoN is an option though.<br />
<br />
I will primarily be grouping to advance, i have done soloing to death and im well aware warriors aint good at soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spikela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quests, quests are AMAZING in some cases, and not so great in others. Strength of the Elements and Loyalist Shield of Honor should be high on your list to complete. You'll need some help with these, but diplomacy is a good point to be strong in =). I'd also look for Crustacean Shell armor in the bazaar, hmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>milloeq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">aye, Bracer of Benevolence quest kicks for your level, if you have skyshrine faction (kill giants in kael, get plate armor drops from arena, get faction with dorfs and dragons in Velious.  LDoN adventures are good as well, though i dont know how the lower lvl point rewards align with the effort.   A magelo link would really help in more direct advice</div></div><hr />
