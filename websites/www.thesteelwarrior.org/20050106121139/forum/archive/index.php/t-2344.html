<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myself and 5 hardy adventurers decided we'd try to camp the king area in new Droga for the weapon drops, so armed with an Eqatlas map and the limited knowledge I'd gained about the revamped zone I found on the web, off we went.<br />
<br />
Firstly we knew the mobs don't see invis, so we zoned in, invised up and made our way to the king camp, no problems so far.<br />
<br />
Then we decided our stout paladin would aggro one of the mobs in the king room, drawing them all to the chanter who would AE stun them all and we'd then pick them off one by one at our leisure.<br />
<br />
Mistake number 1.<br />
<br />
These mobs cannot be AE stunned.<br />
<br />
Ensuing mayhem and two dead adventurers later, our wizard managed to evac us back to zone in.<br />
<br />
We then went back down to the small hidden room near the king room and pulled the two corpses back to there.<br />
<br />
Mistake number 2.<br />
<br />
Don't sit down to mez in that hidden room - the nearby gobs will aggro you.<br />
<br />
Ensuing mayhem and one dead druid later, our wizard evaced us back to zone in.<br />
<br />
Undeterred we invised back down to the hidden room, rezzed the druid and made sure we all stayed stood up.<br />
<br />
We then thought we'd try to pacify the outer room and take it before venturing to the king room.  But our intrepid paladin found out these mobs cannot be pacified.<br />
<br />
Whilst deliberating what to do next, invis dropped on one of us, who happened to have his arm sticking out of the hidden wall.<br />
<br />
Aggro.<br />
<br />
Ensuing mayhem and no dead people later, our druid succored us back to zone in.<br />
<br />
By which time I had to go do some unavoidable r/l stuff.<br />
<br />
So all in all a most frustrating afternoon, and we still don't have a good strategy for breaking into the king camp.<br />
<br />
Anyone help us out please?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The agro range in the King room is beyond tiny. You can just set up in the far east side of the king room with the oven by the table and uninvis right there on that mob and no others will come.<br />
<br />
You just work your way around the room counterclockwise and you will get singles every time.<br />
<br />
I think you may have psyched yourself out on this one. It really is that easy. They dont look like they pull single, but they absolutely 100% do.<br />
<br />
P.S. I am not sure what hidden room you are talking about. Just go straight into the king room, set up in the far east corner right by the table. Let invis drop on the warrior first, and fight the mob you are sitting on. If that crap is happening in whatever &quot;hidden&quot; room you are in, don't go there. There are at least 5 places you could wait with only one mob to fight.<br />
<br />
If you cant take one mob attacking you from invis dropping, then I wonder if maybe the dungeon overall is too tough for you...<br />

<br />
You would be incorrect.  Just don't be a numbskull and pull the goblin that's farthest back.<br />
<br />
The safe spot you can pull to exists at the door of the king room.  Kill the 2 just inside the king room (if you can't handle 2 at a time, you probably shouldn't be there).  Then pull the 5 out of the king room and move in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice Jackle, I'll give it a go again soon.<br />
<br />
We have no problems on single mobs, or even 2 or more, depending on chanter (we had a lev 65 one btw).  I think as you said, we psyched ourselves out of it. :(<br />
<br />
But we will be back! :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we went, we ran into the King room invised and started the fight back in the corner.  I think we had at most 2 at any one time.  We had no chanter for mez, and the ranger off tanked the add.  Once they were cleared, it was mostly single pulls back to us.  In the entry door, we would get two on the initial pull, but would just root the add.  Other than that, it was all single pulls and we just fought right on the King spawn point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Largic</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be careful. Brought a group here and after killing good for a long while in the room one mob got stuck in the wall while running away. He was snared, and I think we pushed him up the little dirt mound looking thing on the wall. He was at 0% but still targetable, couldn't hit it with melee or spells. 10 minutes went by and he was still there, targettable and all but had regend 1%. Then we went into &quot;oh shit&quot; mode. 8 mobs paid us a visit. Not sure if anyone else had this bug, but it sucked cause it was the kings PHer. Just a heads up. KEEP MOBS AWAY FROM THE WALL! (typical lvl 50 knowledge /bonkself)</div></div><hr />

<br />
These mobs cannot be AE stunned. <br />
mobs cannot be pacified. <br />
<br />
A 65 enchanter should know damn well you can't AE stun mobs over 55. and Pacify is max level 55.  <br />
<br />
Pacify (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=45&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Use this one:<br />
Pacification (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3197&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Ok, never mind.... Im just going to stop being a bitch<br />
<br />
a good strategy for breaking into the king camp <br />
<br />
There are TONS of posts, I think even one is stickied in here.<br />
<br />
Want a good strategy.  Have the enchanter learn the class and pull singles pre slowed into camp.  Make camp any were you want.  <br />
<br />
So take the 65 enchanter out of the group. ...<br />
1) Invis and take camp anywere you want<br />
2) Pull a mob, easier to us agro distance or an arrow or malo/anull/slow pull (doenst matter just pull something).  <br />
3) max mobs per pull is two unless you pull the farthest mob pathing through others<br />
4) Kill the mobs pulled and work into King room (btw, this works for most camp types in EQ)<br />
5) /goto step 2<br />
<br />
I'm really sorry if I sound overly nasty today but the Droga King/Seer area is a 20 minute pop with lvl 59-61 mobs with 22-24k hitpoints.<br />
<br />
I've never suggested buying via bazaar.... but I might suggest it...<br />
<br />
/walks away knowing shes been a bitch</div></div><hr />

<br />
Invis to Seer (or PH)....drop invis &amp; kill (1 mob).  Hug right wall and drop down...engage 1 mob (king ph) and pin to wall (laterally so you do not warp it).  Re-invis...go back up to Seer spawn spot and single pull to it. (pull about 7-8 mobs before re-pop)  When Seer (or PH) pops repeat cycle.<br />
<br />
/boggle 1st rule of dungeon crawl NEVER use AE anything.  Its all about movement &amp; control.  My goodness gracious I wish they would create a tight dungeon where all the mobs were lvl 66 so that folks would re-learn old skills....too much PoP/DL has rotted everyone's brains *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with Faederya on this one, what 65 chanter would try an AE stun on 58+ mobs? Not only that, these mobs don't hit hard and they miss a lot, your chanter should have been able to mezz the entire king room if you somehow managed to get them all agro'd.<br />
<br />
I think you guys are thinking way too hard. Invis to the king room, make a right as soon as you go in, park by the bed. Drop invis and the near gobby might agro. If he does kill him, if he doesnt, pull him. Pick the next gobby and kill. Repeat until room cleared. Pull pool room mobs until that area is clear. The repop is 20 minutes on the nose, you should be able to kill at least 15 mobs between pops if not more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can get singles most of the time (95%) at 61, even without a bow.<br />
<br />
This is how I do it:<br />
<br />
Invis to hidden room, kill the spawns outside. Go into hidden room and inch out and go to the left, pull that gob. Repeat and go to the right. Now that room is &quot;broken in&quot;. There may be 1 other gob near the ramp to the seer but it is nothing to worry about. From here, all mobs outside the castle are single-pullable. Due to unfortunate time contraints, I haven't been inside the castle yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh I've done this camp duo as a 61 war with my 65 shammy friend.  To clear the seer/king camps you really only have to kill 4 mobs per round total.  Go up above invis, kill seer PH, invis back down and into kings room.  Fight at the little opening to the kings room, the 2 that should be behind you won't aggro.  We just pulled the first to the left which comes single, killed, invis'd to the left corner, engaged left one and if you can keep it pushed into the wall right, it won't screw you and add the other one, but unfortunatly if aggro bounces, it likes to run to the center then out again aggro'ing the other npc, so we just route CC'd the third mob which was the King's PH.  Then we killed the King's PH next.  <br />
<br />
The only way we got screwed was because our dps was sort of lacking and the King PH decided to run out to the middle again and aggro the 4th spawn at a bad time after the shammy had just c5'd and virtue was down so had low hp and got killed.  Otherwise this camp was a joke really considering the rewards duoable solo most likely and duo for sure.  Have seen about 4 swords drop, haven't gotten copper hammer yet though, got the crappy rune maul, argh/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarg</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My luck must be fugged. I'm been in the king room for two nights for about 4 hours each and have yet to see the king. My buddies think I'm crazy. &quot;XP here is amazing, just don't tell zarg that the king is only in his imagination,&quot; the rotten cleric says...<br />
<br />
I know this dungeon well from before the revamp so I am 100% positive I am in the right place. Anyone else having a hella time getting him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goska</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Decided to check out the king camp last night with me, 62 Necro (played by me) and a 63 Cleric.  It was a piece of cake really.  Pulls were nearly all single except the 2 at the front door of the kings room, but they were easly FD split by the necro.  We were in Droga for about 4 hours, 2 of which were at the King camp.  The necro got just over a full AA.  I got just over a yellow in 61.<br />
<br />
The king spawned once for us just before we left, dropped the maul and his earring.   He popped just to the right of the oven in the house, for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same experience Zarg. 11-12 hours in King room without even seeing him pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did king and seer last night, 2 hammers one sword.  (me for 2 and ranger got the other hammer (higher skill cap then his shadowheart for better am3 runs)).  We uninvised in the turn to the ramp up to the seer (left facing the king room) and pulled single bow shots all the way into the king where we just did the cycle.  Only the door mobs required a root on one and kill the other to break in (only 2 mob pull we ran into).  with 20 min respawn, 65 shm, ranger, warrior did the job just fine.  After that we set up at the seer PH and killed around there till we got a sword and headed back down to king repeating our previous breakin procedure.  Now to test the combo against a GSoT.  The exp was good enough to ping me and get me half way to another.  If you have the option of fighting in, it was the safest way we saw, as well as being decent exp.  Next time I head down I might try that uninvis in the back thing (I know a few wizards with exodus).  Good hunting to you all.<br />
