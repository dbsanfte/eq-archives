I know this may sound like a dumb question.  I'm lvl 62 I have ND 2.  I was thinking of waiting till 65 to get ND 3 so I would get more HP in the long run or should I go ahead and get it now Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
ND3 gives you 10 percent more hit points. It isn't level based.<br />
<br />
I think it's a better idea to level up first, and get the AAs later, but that has more to do with levelling being the great discriminatory factor in EQ than anything about the effectiveness of the ND AA ability.</div></div><hr />

I dont always agree with this...<br />
<br />
It depends on the situation. If your in a guild starting to do some higher level things, and you are the MT... ND3/AET are always good to have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I did it was at 61 got ND3, then leveled to 63. Then got PE and AT. Then leveled to 65 and getting everything else. <br />
<br />
Levels are &gt; all    but if you have already put in the time to get ND2 I would just buckle down and finish it off before doing anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the real crux of the question is whether ND3 gives you a set number of hit points at the time you get it that is 10% of your current HP total, or whether it increases after you get it, as your level increases.  For example, if it were a set number and I had 3000hp at lvl 56 and trained ND3 it would give me 300 hp and that's all I'd ever get from it.If I understand correctly, that is not how ND works.  It isnt a set number that you get and are then stuck with, it's just 10% of what your total unbuffed HP would be without ND3.</div></div><hr />

Bingo. ND3 give 10% of your current unbuffed HP total, it is not a set number. I still believe that level &gt; AA so I would level to 65 then worry about getting AA. Since you already have ND2, you already have your baron title anyway so the preception of being a PL'd 65 toon with no AA doesn't apply to you since you have a title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From all my parsing and empiracle (sp) evidence:<br />
<br />
5/6 AA = 1 level (for 61-65)<br />
<br />
So...  for the 6 AA's you would need to get ND3, you could be 1 level higher.  From our parsing, we saw a nice 4-5% increase in dps per level, a 7-8 % decrease in damage taken per level, 60 or so hps per level, and of course, better resists, etc...<br />
<br />
So, if you look at the data, for ND3 (6 aa's), yer gonna get something like 200 hps or so.  Whereas, for 1 level, you get 60 hps plus 7% less damage per battle.  If you are taking more than 2000 hps (7% of 2000 is 140) in a battle, then the 7% decrease is better.   <br />
<br />
The numbers speak volumes...<br />
<br />
Level &gt; AA. <br />

For proof its the same as extreme exaple as this at lvl 1 you fight lvl 5 mob you get owned at lvl 5 you come back fight same mob and you own it. If you want to be a better tank go for lvls ALWAYS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the input guys :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something else, ND3 gives you 10%, ND2 gives 5%. Keep in mind that 'finishing it off' only improves him the difference between the two.<br />
<br />
So say unbuffed he has 4.2k (4k plus nd2), ND3 will only give him another 200hp.<br />
<br />
Although I wasn't sure in the past, now that I am 65 I would say without a doubt, lvl first...you'll visably notice a diff in yer dps and tanking ability. I'd wager a 63 warrior identical to you except having ND2 will outtank you at 62 with nd3....</div></div><hr />
