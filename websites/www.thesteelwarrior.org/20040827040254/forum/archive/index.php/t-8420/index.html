<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, Its been a while since Ive posted here.  Here is my latest question.  I have a lvl 51 Barb warrior, with what I believe to be excellent gear, and lately Ive been playing a Ranger...Sss..I hear that giggling in the back row!..He is a nice break to my warrior. .. Now, I understand the roll of my warrior but the ranger roll is new to me, and to be honest I cant get an honest anwer from the ranger forums to say the least.  When your tanking what do you expecet the ranger to do?  And what should he not do?... I cant say that Ive really grouped much with a ranger before, but I have with my 62 shaman and they seem very usefull..  I also remember getting angry when the Ranger got agro and ended up dead.  My lvl 17 ranger seems to do pretty amazing damage exspecially with his bow..  I look forward to hearing from you all..Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anakun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rangers in groups should be like rouges with snare! Snare at 30% mob life and dps rest of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When your tanking what do you expecet the ranger to do?  And what should he not do?...<br />
what a ranger should do = dps while not dieing or annoying the tank, tree huggers are annoying enough without pulling aggro all the time.<br />
<br />
what a ranger should not do = dps while dieing and pulling aggro and not careing and acting like they're tough cause they can pull aggro.<br />
<br />
hope that helps some</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">buff, pull, snare, park, Melee DPS, once you get AAs its range DPS really what a ranger does in that order</div></div><hr />

<br />
?<br />
<br />
maybe i play differently, but i find myself meleeing more often then im buffing, pulling, snareing, and parking when i play my ranger =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a pretty nice ranger alt.  What I do in groups usually is root or harmony pull if outdoors.  I have am3 and eq so I mostly use archery unless I am in an area where its not working.<br />
<br />
I can also do CC if there is not an enchanter around with root.  I also snare and if there is an enchanter in the group and we get a lot of adds I will try to root them with earthen roots which is no damage so they can mezz easier. Also I will snare mezzed mobs to take the aggro off the enchanter if I can.<br />
<br />
I also can tank when the excrement hits the fan and the tank dies or I can off tank if needed.<br />
<br />
It can be a lot of fun to play.<br />
<br />
Also I will buff the group with attack buffs.<br />
<br />
Sometimes a ranger is the only one in the group with sow so I will make sure everyone has sow who wants it.  And at lower levels you might be the only one in the group with a str buff at times so that gets used and people even ask for the agility buff a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you know, its amazing, I get better replies here than at the ranger website..go figure. Now I just have to find a way to keep from getting agro..Im using the Blackened acrylia blade and Swiftblade of Zek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well you don't have jolt yet but when u do thats what I use.  If your pulling its really hard for a ranger to transfer aggro to the tank.  Don't pull with snare.<br />
<br />
Turn off attack if u get aggro and step back.<br />
<br />
Let the tank regain aggro.  Try not to snare until the mob is at lower health unless your getting a lot of snare resists.<br />
<br />
You got some pretty decent weapons prob better then the tanks your playing with at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks again for the help.  Id play my Barbarian Warrior but my server is dead when Im on, since being stationed in Okinawa..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Right now, the only thing I can see thats hurting me is my shissar scale chest armor.. I know my ranger is a twink, but thats the fun of it and I for the life of me cant find a decent chest piece..oh well, once I level up a bit more it shouldnt be an issue..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Inferna gave a good description. We have a ranger in our guild and I have grouped with him often when playing my war and/or shammy. Rangers job is pure DPS baby. Yes if a mob gets on a caster get them off my root melee snare pulling their hair whatever it takes. Aggro management you will learn just as all dps chars do. Rangers are excellent pullers in outdoor zones. You will also be popular for LDoN for tracking the possible named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes, ranger track in an LDoN is nice.<br />
Nothing like finishing a mission in a group with no tracker and eveyone standing there a minute blinking at each other wondering if there's a named somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Your chest should take you to level 51. Consider smithed Tae Ew chain armor, it tends to be very excellent for the cost of it. On Prexus, the going rate is ~2k for the pants and ~3k for the chest. That honestly surprises me since pharming Cazic  Thule for the pieces is a pain in the ass, and I don't know if the prices are similar elsewhere, but if they are, I'd hit it!  :D</div></div><hr />
