<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to buy a new PS2 Game to be specific a RPG game.    Here are my choices   Final Fanasty X-2 or Champions of Norrath<br />
<br />
Final Fanasty what can I say that can do that series justice.  Each game I played I enjoyed immensely.  The problem that I didn't buy X-2 or even played it because I didn't finish FFX because I wanted to strangle Tidus everytime he said something.  FFX I thought had a great story to it and the graphics were great.  I am wondering if anyone played X-2 can give me their opinion about the story (no spoilers just a general opinion).  <br />
<br />
OH FFXII screenshots are out at www.gamespot.com.  They look amazing.<br />
<br />
Champions of Norrath I heard great things about it.  My friends who dont like EQ really enjoy playing this game, they are addicted to it (yet they make fun of me because of EQ). Anyone here played it, can you tell me how is the story and how is the gameplay.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />

<br />
You just run around on errands forever and eventually some thing is going to destroy Spira and you stop it.  That's basically the whole game.  Throughout the game you'll find out snippets of what happened 1000 years ago between Bevelle and Zanarkand but that's about it.  <br />
<br />
I personally couldn't stand Yuna and most certainly not Rikku, but if you don't mind them, it's not a bad game.<br />
<br />
The battle engine is the standard Final Fantasy faire.  You use dress spheres to change classes which gives you an illusion of doing something matters even though you'll quickly discover White Mage + Dark Knight X 2 or even just Dark Knight X 3 will own anything.  The game is real time but all that means is that you can get slapped while choosing which spheres to switch to before you get the Dark Knight spheres.  There's a standard level up systems but the real powers come from the class that you're in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't call Champions of Norrath an RPG in any sense related to any FF game. In fact, CoN would more readily be classified as an &quot;action&quot; game - it's an overhead manually controlled slash fest in a fantasy setting. It's like playing Ikari Warriors with spells instead of grenades.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for a GREAT RPG, get Kingdom Hearts - it's made by Squaresoft, just like the FF series stuff, and it even has references to old FF chars in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye Champions of Norrath, while a very good game,  is more of a nice looking &quot;hack-n-slash&quot; type of action/RPG.  I'd highly reccommend it for server downtime, raid delays or waiting for a Rez.  But if your going for a full on RPG, PS2 has some much better ones.  Heres a few links for you to check out covering both action/RPG and full blooded RPG's.<br />

I think only Japanese can understand that. The combat itself was not bad and arena was definatley lots of fun.<br />
<br />
FFX-2 gameplay is completley different. It has a class based system like the older FF games prior to FF7. Story is lacking and I found the boss mobs way too damn easy or both optional and the ones from main story except for one or two of the hardest which are unbeatable unless you are using a cheasy tactic. I'd say its a rental since you can most definatley finish this in 20 hours at least plot vise.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for awesome rpg kingdom hearts is it. I was sceptical at first myself but after playing it I have to admit this game is close to perfection. Its fun for all ages, not just kids.<br />
<br />
Another good one is Xenosaga - good story and gameplay<br />
decent ones are: Sukodien III and Breath of Fire: Dragon Quaters<br />
sucky: .Hack, Dark Cloud (first one heared 2nd one was good)<br />
<br />
also bumping my thread about PS2 games so have a read</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Star Ocean 2 is a great RPG.  Xenosaga was cool didn't play it to much because it seems to be like a movie pretty much there is WAY WAY WAY to much talking.  I just got Drakengard yesterday that game is fun as hell so far.  It's like a mix between Dynasty Warriors and something else I can't think of.  FFX was awesome I have been playing that 80 Hours and no where near maxing anyone out on the Sphere Grid.  FFX-2 was pretty good not what I expected it to be I beat it in like 60 hours that's the best thing I always liked about FF's is they are long  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FFX2 just had too much class abuses you can pull.  It has no story on purpose.  The point is that you as Yuna are just on a big scavenger hunt around Spira while looking for clues of Tidus (not that you ever found any), and you happen to uncover the fact that some evil ancient force is going to destroy Spira, and then you stop it.  <br />
<br />
Xenosaga is way too tedious.  The game can't really be considered hard because you've an infinite supply of HP/EP items (for all practical purposes, I never got close to running out even on the 45 minute Proto Dora fight).  The game overuses physical/ether immunity and since you've to pick which techs to develop it is very easy to have a party that simply can't damage the boss.  Simeon comes to mind as a ridiculously easy battle that takes way too long.  The story is overvalued.  There actually isn't a story.  It's just a bunch of people saying they've this huge plan and you're all merely pawns in it.  Nowhere in Xenosaga Episode 1 do you actually even have a clue what's going on because the powers that be are still holding back their hand.  All you're doing is just running around and saving a planet from getting blown up, but that is obviously just the beginning based on what you see on the ending.  You don't even know what half of your party really are (Shion, KOS-MOS, Chaos).  The game is coherent enough to follow, but I really can't call what happens in the game a plot when it's obviously set up to sell later episodes.  The game deliberately fails to explain anything.<br />
<br />
Kingdom Hearts I really enjoyed... even if it gets repetetive after a while around Neverland.  Hallow Bastion and The End of the World are just beautiful looking worlds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I picked up FFX-2 and I am indifferant to it so far.  I am still trying to get use to the new battle mode and the changing of classes in fight.  The story is lacking so far but I am just past the part that I learned Wakka knocked up LULU so hopefully it gets better.  <br />
<br />
FFX I thought had lame characters a story with an ultimate goal of killing your father bothered me. I think only Japanese can understand that. The combat itself was not bad and arena was definatley lots of fun.[/ <br />
<br />
To me that was the best part of the story. <br />
<br />
I been playing FFVIII since this is the only one I didnt play through.</div></div><hr />

If you want a good Boxing game Fight Night is awesome is the best of all the EAsports Boxing games so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I played EQOA really not that bad kind of fun but I rather play it on my computer.   Well I only play RPG's really and not into sport games all to much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DabrixMGP</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Final Fantasy 7 is best of the Final Fantasies hands down even though its PS 1.  I have beaten it like 5 times and I can beat it 5 more.  Best story and best characters and by far the coolest villian ever is Sephiroth.  I gave up on FF-X2 its like a damn porno.  You try to have a plot and it ends up sucking.  I cant wait for FF 12.</div></div><hr />

And I HATED 8.  Such crap. GUNSWORDS!?!?! Wtf.  And yes, FF7 Ownz0rs.  Sephiroth stabbing Aeris through the back was the best part ever.  I don't care if did look like a woman with his fragile frame, pale skin, and looong beautiful hair.  He had a goddamn 10 foot sword! You try wielding that shit!</div></div><hr />
