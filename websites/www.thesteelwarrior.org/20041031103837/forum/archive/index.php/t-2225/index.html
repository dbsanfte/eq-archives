<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, who has an Anathema?  None have dropped on my server yet.  I'm curious to know how much it procs.  Is it going to be a decent substituion for a BoW?  Yes, the dps suck, but I'm asking about aggro.  We all know that some weapons proc more often than other weapons. . .so I'm just curious as to how much Anathema seems to proc!</div></div><hr />

The force it takes to kill Inno now can get better things, for less effort.<br />
<br />
Inno takes RvR to the extreme bad side of the scale, hes a teir 3+ PoP ring event now.  And his drops are shit compared to other mobs his difficulty.<br />
<br />
Most guilds able to kill him, dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no one has one huh?  Guess i'm gonna have to keep killing inny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No one on our server does Inny cept us. We only do it when nothing is up or with a late night crew. We have gotten one Anathema which goes pretty much unused since the person who has it does not MT on raids yet. Sorry dont have more info on it for ya.<br />
<br />
The thing about Inny is that its fun, its easy to get to (read fast). Drops are nothing special but people can still find upgrades on its corpse.</div></div><hr />
