<br />
Like many others, I'm saving AA for the release of Gates. We know that Sturdiness starts right now at 4 points. What do the additional 4 levels cost? Anyone know?<br />
<br />
(yes, obviously it could change, I'm just wondering.)</div></div><hr />

Just guessing though since I don't have access to beta but usually something that has 5 levels and starts off at 4pts will stay contstant at 4pts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it's rumor, it's high but if you have 30 banked for GoD you only need another 30 to finish it. If it only costs 20 (4 per level) that would be pretty ridiculus too. I won't complain either way but 20 seems a bit low for the reward so I'm betting it's 60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4 AAs for 100 hp is acceptable, 25 hp per AA or about what a 65 non-EP warrior could reasonably expect from a level of PD.<br />
<br />
8 AAs for 100 hp is not good.  12.5 hp per AA.  Not bad for an uber who can grind this out in a night of xping in Fire, this blows for a non-EP flagged person.<br />
<br />
12 AAs for 100 hp flat out sucks.  8.33 hp per AA.  This is less than what you get for a level of Planar Power and that at least gave you higher stat caps on all stats.  So for the exact same numbers of AAs as ND 1, 2, AND 3, you get 100 hp.  Again, still better for EP-flagged ubers.<br />
<br />
16 AAs for 100 hp is terrible.  6.67 hp per AA.  This could literally take a casual player over a MONTH.<br />
<br />
20 AAs for 100 hp is an abomination.  That is 5 hp per AA point.  I'm sorry, that would be well over a DAY OF MY LIFE for 100 hp.  Yes, that's right, as a non-EP flagged person, if I played non-stop at best I could hope to have this AA in 24 hours, more likely in about 40 hours.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, a day of my life is not worth 100 hit points for Gune.  It just isn't.  Since I wouldn't be able to do it straight, that means weeks of not seeing my friends and family just for 100 hit points.<br />
<br />
The worst part is, the people who have 9-10k hp unbuffed have better access to the xp for something like that, yet it only makes up a small difference in their vast pool of hit points.  The regular guys without the uber guilds take longer to get each AA yet need these AAs much, much more.<br />
<br />
That 4/8/12/16/20 progression had better be wrong.  I have better ways to spend my time and more importantly to SOE, my money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're gonna xp anyway, doesn't matter how expensive it is really.<br />
<br />
Warped logic, I know, and I really hope that's not it.</div></div><hr />

20aa is permantantly gaining a hp every 3-4mins, when u look at it like that its not so bad~<br />
most people would willingly waste 4mins to gain a hp<br />
<br />
people waste sets of 10 ldon's for like 25mins each for 2-3hp raises<br />

when u start needing 4aa, your gaining like a hp every 30-40sec</div></div><hr />

Enough about the elemental exp already, I got some news for you,  the zone experiance modifier is EXACTLY the same in ALL POP zones save HOH a/b.  Every single one.  If you want awesome exp just find a place with a good supply of red cons in pop, I'd recomend tactics.</div></div><hr />

You missed the boat. We are discussing how 60 AA for 500 hp is rediculous. 20 AA is acceptable if not a little cheap.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard about 2 AAs per hour for a group in Fire.  That's what I'm going on for EP xp.  Since I'm pre-EP, I can't confirm that, I just go on what I've heard from a few friends.  I'm sure I could go kill red cons in Tactics for uber xp although somehow I don't think that my guild's clerics can keep up with that for more than about 2 kills before they are totally oom.  That kinda limits me to blue cons, which means about one AA every 90-120 minutes, depending on location and the group.<br />
<br />
I suppose if GoD seriously ramps up xp rates, that would change my thinking a bit but that seems almost as dumb of an idea as 20 AAs for a 100 hp increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well let's compare to LDON, what we do know.<br />
<br />
1150 Aug2 Glowing Saphire of Courage HP:40 <br />
<br />
Let's say I get 100 points in one hour in LDON and I can get 2aa's in one hour in Elementals.<br />
<br />
It will take me 12 hours to get 40hipoints or 10 hours to get 20 aa's for 100 hitpoints.  Heck even one aa per hour isn't obsurd, and thats 20 hours for 20 aa's for 100 hitpoints.  That's still better then LDON points.<br />
<br />
Time required to gain 100 hitpoints seems better then gaining 40 hitpoints in LDON.<br />
<br />
I think it just &quot;feels like&quot; its allot since its &quot;20 aa's&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't really make sense for it to scale since the hps don't scale.  Its 100hp per level, so 4 4 4 4 4, seems reasonable.  For it to be 4 8 12 16 20 is just nuts.  If the hps were scaling up, maybe it would be worth it.  If this is the case, I'd get the first two levels and save the last 3 for when I have nothing better to do.  300 hps for 48 AA isn't worth it imo. <br />
<br />
I think the point that lots are making, and I agree, is that 60AA is absurd for the vast majority of players.  I don't know how many people have 30AA banked, but I can bet its a pretty small amount as well.  Really, in Elementals, you'll average about 1 to 1.5 AA per hour.  Yeah, there are places and situations that you can get more, but on average that's usually what I get.  I'm reserving all judgement for when GoD actually comes out though.  Hopefully it won't be this much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I look at sturdiness as about the equivalent of 5 levels. If they raised the level cap to 70 we would all be grinding out regular xp non stop until we hit 70 wouldn't we? 60 AA may take longer than 5 levels but not by a whole lot, especially if you have 30 banked when GoD comes out.</div></div><hr />

If you have the time to play alot then 60 AAs seems reasonable. If you do not have the time to play a lot, then the cost seems unreasoanble.<br />

<br />
1.   God has so much content and has such a fluid storyline that as long as you follow the progresion of the expansion your going to be busy for six months and its not going to seem like grinding aa.  <br />
<br />
2.  Anyone who goes to POP zones just to grind AA instead of progresing through GOD is an idiot.</div></div><hr />

If you think they are too expensive just get the first couple levels and when you finish all the other AA's that are worth your time you can grind out the last 3 levels.

<br />
1 AA in Luclin is MUCH harder than 1 AA in PoP.<br />
<br />
And even without seeing the new zones in Gates, 1 AA in PoP has to be harder than 1 AA in Gates because of the global 80% bonus and the 6th person doesn't count bonus that went in a while ago.  I think that figures out to close to 50% more XP gained in PoP zones with the same group after you factor in PoP ZEM were toned down.<br />
<br />
There's also the fact that new expansion = more available gear which increases player power and indirectly increases your chance of getting xp.<br />
<br />
60 AAs for 500 HP may not be cheap but it is not unreasonable.  It's probably easier to get 60 AAs now than 12 AAs back in Luclin for ND3 (and back then it wouldn't have given most people 500 HPs) when it was a good group to get 1 yellow AA per hour.</div></div><hr />

Without breaking the nda I will also say two things.<br />
<br />
1) GoD is so damn buggy right now it's insane. I know it's a 'beta' and all (I work in software development and Sony sure has a weird definition of beta) -- but if this thing ships without major, progression-blocking bugs in the two weeks it's supposed to, I'm a monkey's uncle.<br />
<br />
2) The lead developer on GoD has his head in the sand when it comes to casual players. There is tons of evidence of this, in zone design, AA costs, and other things. Hopefully someone with a clue and some power will step up and say this is unreasonable, but if not I might be looking for a refund on my prepayment.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of is that the ubers who've farmed PoTime 100+ times already and are bored to death with LDoN are making so much racket that we ended up with another ubers-only expansion. I say that being EP flagged, but 60 AA is still a lot for me, even being able to xp in Fire (I get about 1 AA an hour there, same as I could get in several places outside the Elementals -- eventually 2 AA looks reasonable, but I need about 200 more points of hard AC to camp that shit).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it really that bad for the casual player?  Up until the last 3 months, I've been in relatively active raiding guilds.  I got to Time and just decided to slow down.  From my perspective, this game is extremely crowded at the top -- it seems the casual players are who would have it best right now, and that a high-end hardcore raiding expansion is just what the Doctor ordered for EQ.<br />
<br />
There is just so much content, single group encounters, places to explore, challenges; is it really that bad for the casual player in EQ right now?</div></div><hr />

If this expansion is primarily focused at the raiding player then casual players will still have LDoN to play in, there will still be people playing catch up killing Kunark dragons, raiding Kael and ToV, farming VT keys in Luclin and working on flags in PoP.  If you haven't finished the existing content I don't think there is too much reason to get your nose bent out of shape over another raid focused expansion coming out, there will still be plenty of stuff for you to do, and while alot of it wont be new, it will still be new to you.  eg, killing trakanon is still new to someone who hasnt done it before.</div></div><hr />

We paid 12 for ND3 which gave most of us about 500 hp.  60 is way out of there.  Granted there are those that can spend hours on end getting AA in the EP's.  But if the exp is not as good if you are not.  Not to mention the entire concept of grinding is abhorrent.  No matter what you do, you are still grinding in the end.   It would be nice if the SOE folks got a clue some time.</div></div><hr />

It sucks if you're a casual player that wants to be Uber, but it's always been this way <br />
<br />
I'll choose not to interpret this as a passive-aggressive attack on me.  <br />
<br />
PoP is a waste of time if you don't want to live/eat/sleep/punch a clock for dkp. /shrug this is my opinion (having ground out most of those flags anyway).  Just because some folks have the ability to turn off the part of them that wants to be autonomous and not worry about the logistics of moving, keeping happy 60-100 people doesn't have anything to do with folks who play the game &quot;only&quot; 20 hours a week and what they want.  <br />
<br />
Seriously...I know this is really hard for alot of plane of time folks to believe but most casual gamers REALLY DONT THINK ABOUT YOU ALL THAT MUCH other than to see you in the bazaar occasionaly and say &quot;wow I havnt seen Joe in awhile and wow thats a neat new graphic on that weapon&quot;.<br />
<br />
My point is I think alot of folks would like another expansion that lets people do more than 4-5 zones w/o relying on 60 other people...thats all.   I can see the point that the 1pct of the eq population in plane of time would like something new to do...and thats fine too.  I don't suppose to know what that segment of the eq population wants; in turn I can tell you that segment in turn has no idea what the other 99pct of the eq population wants.  Its just plain arrogant to think otherwise.<br />
<br />
LDoN was cool for casual folks.  It would be nice if GoD had a mix for both segments.</div></div><hr />

The raiding guilds on my server require 100+ AA, some saying that their average player has 200+ AA. Guess what, 60 AA is over half of that first number, and over 1/4 of the second, and AA have been around for how long now? Two years?<br />
<br />
The only people who think 60 AA isn't that much are people who are pushing 500+ points now. IOW, you've finished your AA, completely.<br />
<br />
So yeah, you're looking at 60 and going &quot;no big deal, at least I'll have something to do with my xp again&quot; -- whereas the rest of us, who don't play all day every day, look at that and go &quot;wow that's a fuckload of AA&quot;.<br />
<br />
And yeah, the people with 500+ AA are the people who are playing pretty much all day, every day. I know because some of them are my friends. They also  are closing in on or have more than 1000 LDoN wins, so they're way bored with that already.<br />
<br />
So, the way it looks today, we once again have an expansion that is catering to a *very* small minority of the people playing the game. But yet we all get to pay for it...</div></div><hr />

I won't be wasting AA on any of it.  Thats just an obscene amount of XPing (and I have 245ish AAs already)  for that upgrade.. not to mention the other 2-3 AAs that look semi worthwhile which most  likely have similar, inflated point costs.

Personally, I'm not going to get too worked up about it...  It's nice to have the option, but as a casual player, there really aren't too many things I do where I really *need* 500 more HP.   It's nice to have the option, but other than the 1st level of this, I'll be much better served by finishing off my defensive AAs and then getting some more offensive ones to up my dps.<br />
<br />
Not too long ago, I wouldn't have ever guessed I'd be sitting at like 8500hp buffed, but with NToV becoming doable by a few groups of casual players, and ornate not being super hard to come by, here I am.  Not every item or ability should be a birthright to every player.  People that have the time to crank out 600+AAs or raid Time deserve to have some stuff the rest of us don't.<br />

LoY is great for the under-60 crowd, no question there.  For those who actually grind out AAs, not so good.  LDoN was nice to have, an expansion aimed solely at casual gamers.  Unfortunately, it lacks certain things like an intermediate difficulty level to bridge the gap between the ludicrously easy &quot;normal&quot; and the very difficult (for a non-uber) &quot;hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is about the haves and the have-nots.  I have about 130 AAs so the prospect of spending almost half of that to get what amounts to be a miniscule fraction of the value that the previous 130 got me is not good from my viewpoint.<br />
<br />
And yes, it does kinda suck to be a non-uber.  Want to know why?  Because of the ubers.  Maybe the ubers are used to screwing people over because that's how they got to where they are but as a more casual player it gets really old when again and again my guild is denied targets because a bunch of ubers decided to blow a spawn because they could or farm a raid mob that drops stuff that a bunch of people in my guild could use just so that their 4th alt could have a BoC.</div></div><hr />

Day GoD comes out, I will have 100 more hp's, and if I can actually get some exp time between now and then, maybe 200.  12 AA's for 200 hp's is not bad at all in my mind, and well worth it.  No one is saying I still have to get that last 48 AA's for 300 more hp's, and I will be in no rush.  Once I have gotten Sturdyness 1 and 2, I will continue working older AA's, and watch to see if the new proc AA(weapon affinity is it called?), and the AA's for more offhand damage and kick/slam damage are worth it at all.  Eventually, when I get to a point where nothing else is more worth the points, I am sure I will come back and get the rest...tho at the rate I exp, it may be quite awhile before than.</div></div><hr />

Back in Luclin you probably didn't have 5000 HP unbuffed so ND3 at 12 AAs would get you no more than 500 HPs and take you roughly 60 hours.<br />
<br />
Now in PoP a good xp group is 1 AA per hour at BoT (can get more in certain zones but let's not include these for the sake of discussion).  So it'd still take you 60 hours to get 500 HPs.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything wrong with this.  If you actually got ND3 in Luclin era you know that 12 AA is a lot.  With mudinflation it gets easier to get XP over time through gear/levels/knowledge so AA cost should get higher, especially consider there is considerable XP gain between PoP and Gates (namely, the grouping bonus, as PoP AAs are made before the xp bonus went in).<br />
<br />
There's plenty of things to do in PoP.  At least on my server public raids are abound.  Those allow the casual players to, dare I say, raid stuff they really have no business raiding in the first place.  You can get flagged to EPs on Drinal at least if you know when the public raids on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After have said this i have to say that i agree with Redhenna on this one.<br />
60AAs is way to much imo but noone is forcing you to get all the 500hp for 60AAs. 200hp for 12AAs is still good.<br />

I think theres a real perception that people in raiding guilds are a tiny vocal minority, but I dont think thats the case.  My server is pretty slow, we have 3 guilds in time (1, maybe 2 killed Quarm- not sure), another 4 guilds who have been in the elementals for a few months and competing for elemental god spawns, another guild killed RZtW last week so will be competing for elemental spawns pretty soon, 3 more guilds are working on flags in PoP Tier 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
My guild raids with 50-65ish people most night, we're the smallest of the ele+ guilds, and one of those guilds has a roster well over 200.  So theres 800 or so players with elemental+ access and another 400 working on getting there.<br />
<br />
Some nights we are lucky on spawns, and being the only guild in our time zone we get our pick of what is up when we raid, and other nights we might do something like 1 ele mob, a HoH trial for back flagging and then call an early night because theres nothing left to kill.  There's nothing in Luclin that we bother to kill anymore and loot outside of the ele planes in PoP isnt really worth the time.<br />
<br />
I dont know how many players there are on each server... 4000? maybe? that would put it at 20% of the server population looking for more content to kill.  Thats a fair chunk of players looking for something new to do and spare time on their hands to try other things (WoW maybe?... I dunno, I won't be playing it).  <br />
<br />
Im not sure what else people are looking for from new expansions.  Another 5 zones to grind XP with different scenery? More zones with velious level raid content and velious level loot?  Theres plenty of that stuff in the game already.  Hopefully there will be some more instanced XP dungeons, and more difficulty levels would be cool because I think LDoN was successful in providing entertaining content for players at all levels that makes the XPing part of the game alot more interesting even if it's raid content was a little sad.<br />
<br />
The casual players probably don't even want more content aimed at them... they're the ones who are still trying to finish whats already there, wanting to get enough points to buy a tak BP before a new expansion comes out and no one does LDoN anymore, or still trying to finish their PoP AAs, all adding more AAs does for them is move the goal posts further away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN ranking number suggests Drinal, a fairly below average population server, has at least 9500 accounts.  If you assume that not everyone bought LDoN and that most people don't have multiple acounts, that means there's probably around 10K people per server (since Drinal is below average).  It'd also fit the ~500K subscribers number quoted by SoE.<br />
<br />
The high end raiding guild is definitely a minority.  It isn't 1% as people would make it sound to be (my guild has at least 100 people in it pretty sure) but it is certainly not a majority, and frankly if all ubers disappeared overnight the game will still be fine.  Actually, considerng ubers are commonly seem as the oppressor of the common folk, I doubt it'll even have any effect on the general population of EQ.  That said, the vocal uber population tends to be the one who's doing most of the *testing* and certainly the feedback.</div></div><hr />

Well let's compare to LDON, what we do know.<br />
<br />
1150 Aug2 Glowing Saphire of Courage HP:40 <br />
<br />
Let's say I get 100 points in one hour in LDON and I can get 2aa's in one hour in Elementals.<br />
<br />
It will take me 12 hours to get 40hipoints or 10 hours to get 20 aa's for 100 hitpoints.  Heck even one aa per hour isn't obsurd, and thats 20 hours for 20 aa's for 100 hitpoints.  That's still better then LDON points.<br />
<br />
Time required to gain 100 hitpoints seems better then gaining 40 hitpoints in LDON.<br />
<br />
I think it just &quot;feels like&quot; its allot since its &quot;20 aa's&quot;. <br />

note that you get exp while doing the aug anyway</div></div><hr />

60 AA is really like 40 AAs anyway after factoring the XP gain, and about 12 in the Luclin days, after you factor the speed you can gain XP.  That's assuming people don't get more powerful due to Gates and/or there are better xp zones in Gates than PoP.</div></div><hr />

I push myself to get more aa, I have only 280 atm. Problem atm is that any nutcase has a couple of aa. If 2 warriors with the exact same gear would be compared and one had 200 aa and the other 300, there would not be a BIG difference between them.<br />

<br />
Dev1 -  I want to put in a AA for warriors to give them more hps.<br />
<br />
Dev2 - How many hps did you have in mind.<br />
<br />
Dev1 - Oh I dont know 500 maybe for like 20 aa?<br />
<br />
Smed - Your smoking crack if you think I&quot;m going to let you give one class 500 hps for 20 aa. THe rest of the classes will find me and string me up.<br />
<br />
Dev2- Why dont you just do three levels of the AA at like 4 8 12 and give them 300 hps.  <br />
<br />
Dev1-  Hmm thats not bad Dev2 but how about we make it 4 8 12 16 and 20 so that the last 200 hps are only achievable shorterm by the most dedicated warriors but the casual warrior has something to work towards long term.<br />
<br />
Smed - That seems reasonable<br />
<br />
Dev2 - I agree<br />
<br />
Smed - Make it so<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the point of this?  The point is that just because they put a set of AA's in the game does not mean its intended to be gotten by every person in that class the first week of the expansion, or even 6 months into the expansions.  AA 's give us all a way increase the power of our characters in the direction of our own choosing. It gives us something to work towards long term.  I have 30 aa saved and I'll get the first three levels of sturdiness the day the expansion hits.  Now it would be pretty boring if that were it, thats the only hp increases I can get and I got them the day the expansion released.  So now I have two more levels to get but it will take time to save them up.  Or maybe I will go offensive AA's for the first few levels then go back to sturdiness.  <br />
<br />
What you guys who are bitching are failing to realize is sturdiness is easily the best AA any class gets in this expansion.  You dont get a AA skill like this past the nerf bats unless you make it extreamly hard to get, which is what they have done by making  the last few levels expensive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm beginning to wonder if any of you actually grinded XP during Luclin.  You can easily get XP 5 times faster today than Luclin.  So if you actually did your ND3 back in Luclin that is as much time as it'd take now to get 60 AAs and for less HPs too (most people didn't have 5K unbuffed at that time, at level 60).  <br />
<br />
Luclin AAs were *cheap* because it took 5 times longer to get an AA in Luclin than PoP.  Do you really expect the same power gains per points when points are way easier to come by?  I think it's the players who are out of touch with reality, not the devs.  Just between Gates and PoP your ability to get XP has increased by 50% due to grouping bonus (assuming you group, and while this change came out in the PoP era, PoP AA costs were designed without this in mind).  That's not even counting the fact that every expansion has invariably increased player power in some way which translates to faster XP as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note, SOE confirmed today in their transcript that yes the aas cost are high, but basically said what Phantron has said. That getting aas is much faster and easier at this point in the game, so the aa values were inflated to reflect that.<br />
<br />
Then SOE is simply confirming how idiotic they are if the 60 AA rumor is true.  Yes, they have sped up experience since the Luclin days.  They also added a lot more AAs to get.  Silly me, I assumed faster experience was DESIGNED to help people who weren't playing EQ 40 hours a week actually get new skills at a tolerable rate.  As far as I knew, it was a very deliberate attempt to get away from only allowing the full time player to have nice things.  Drop the comparisons to how long it took to get the Luclin era skills back when they came out.  <br />
<br />
Yes Phantron, I did AAs well before PoP and also before the huge bonus for killing mobs within 5 levels of you.  It sucked.  Hard.  Maybe it was okay for someone playing constantly, but it sucked for most of us.  It was poorly designed, taking too damn long to advance.  The faster experience was a nice improvement. <br />
<br />
There are still problems with it such as if I do a L65 LDoN adventure with my 65 warrior and take along my L63 2 boxed cleric, the cleric gets far more experience than the warrior.  The same thing happens in most experience zones I go to up to and including tier 3 PoP.  So in effect I'm penalized for leveling up.  That's retarded.  But anyway... faster exp is something the game needed.  Catering more toward the player with 500+ AA points is stupid as a game design decision because those players make up such a small portion of the EQ population.  <br />
<br />
So what if there were a mere 200 AA or so to spend points on in GoD and 1% of players maxed them out in 4 or 5 months?  Okay, so they're done.  They get the big W.  Give them a fancy title or something.  Now they can play another character if they want to advance more, or they can worry more about raids and less about experience. <br />
<br />
Most importantly, the sturdiness AA has been viewed as hugely important to warriors to restore a little bit of the hit point advantage we use to have over knights.  It sucks that we have to pay AA to get what should already be ours.  It sucks a lot more if we have to pay so much AA that only a few warriors will ever bother to get it.  It should be reasonably attainable by the more casual high level warrior.  <br />
<br />
I have 176 AA that's taken me years to get and I think 60 AA is absolutely absurd.  <br />
<br />
As far as expansion content goes, I'd definitely like to see a signficant amount of content for more casual high level players.  LDoN gets boring fast.  I can't imagine people doing 1k adventures there.  Got a wall I can pound my head against for hours on end?  And 2 expansions since PoP?  heh... don't tell me you're counting LoY?  Calling that an expansion and charging us for it was great for Sony's profits and not much else.  'grats on ripping off the players, Sony.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, a lot more uber content may be good too because hopefully it would cut down on little groups of bored ubers ganking old mobs that my guild actually finds challenging and can use for upgrades.  I just don't know for sure if more raid content would change it much because they're usually doing the slumming on non-raid nights and times.</div></div><hr />

Today I can pull an aa in 30 mins if I feel like it with a gimp group in ele's. Anyone who didn't grind out 100+ aa's in luclin really have no idea how much faster it is with the pop era zones. These are the same ones who cried about the autrocious cost of flurry3 for 30 (12crits, 18 flurry) points when today it's balked at as 'real good value'.<br />
<br />
Catering more toward the player with 500+ AA points is stupid as a game design decision because those players make up such a small portion of the EQ population. Actually, it's quite the contrary. No one is saying that someone has to get every single GoD aa, but people will want to. Never seen the analogy of the carrot and the cart-pulling horse?</div></div><hr />

This game has always been about time spent versus reward.  You have no right to be asking for the same number of AAs as those who play it way more than you.<br />
<br />
You should be thankful you even have 176 AAs.  I assume you got most of them in PoP and if this was Luclin you'd be looking at 40-50 AAs.  Then you'd be looking at Studiness cost like say 1/2/3/4/5 but you'd be saying and you'll be saying it's ridiculous to require 15 AAs when all you have is 40-50 AAs, that the last level of Sturdiness requires 1/10th of all the AAs you have ever earned for 100 HP.  <br />
<br />
The last level of ND3 in Luclin is like a 30 AA ability today.  I remember vowing to never do Ambidexterity or Flurry 3 because I can't possibly imagine playing so long without getting a new ability.</div></div><hr />

Of course they are worth it.  Are you going to get them?  You bet! You know why?  Because if you don't your buddy over there will, and suddenly your playing second fiddle.  HP is a major factor in your success, your raids success, and your guilds success.  <br />
<br />
If you don't raid that often, it's probably not that big a deal.<br />
<br />
As for this expansion being for powergamers only.  I once read a great artcle by some player that went through and detailed how casual gamers always gain MORE content with each expansion than do the powergamers.  I hesitate to paraphrase, but the main points went something like this:<br />
<br />
* Each expansion offers opportunities for casual gamers to increase their power outside of raiding.  This makes more content available to them with less effort.<br />
<br />
* Each time an expansion comes out, the top guilds move on to the new content which frees up older content for more casual guilds.<br />
<br />
An example of this might be the guy on this thread who posted that powergamers are always killing lower end targets to feed their twinks.  Well if there was new content for them to take in, they would probably be busy doing that instead of killing AoW again and again.<br />
<br />
* Casual gamers DO get to see new content as they progress higher because of the added power the new expansion gives them.  For instance, a casual guild who had never gotten beyond HoT may be able to gain enough power ( through additional HP for example ) to move into NToV.  NToV is new content for them.<br />
<br />
So from a certain point of view, you can see that when the top end guilds get new areas to go play in, it really benefits everyone.  From the top down to the bottom.<br />

<br />
For me, it has sucked to grind out the 131 AAs that I have (all but one since PoP) and the prospect of endless grinding really pisses me off.  Maybe as a &quot;casual&quot; gamer who works 40 hours a week, has friends outside the game, and raids almost every night that I'm on, I deserve my average of about 2 AAs per week, but last I checked, there are a lot more people like me than there are people like you and we pay our money as well.

The AA's that are given to each class except for MAAYBE 2 or three are pretty much useless, AND they made them extremely expensive.<br />

How about I go out on a limb (and prolly make an ass of myself in the process) and suggest the impact of CA3 far exceeds the impact of LR5 and it's 3 AA cheaper.  Even if the prereq was taken away, I'd still suggest CA3 and CS3 to my younger warrior guildies over their PoP extensions.  It doesn't make the PoP extensions &quot;crap&quot; once you've gotten the basics though, just sets some priorities.<br />

Uhm, are you saying that just becouse you have a job, RL friends and raid all the time you should get everything handed to you?<br />
Would you like it better if they had made the cost 2AA per 100hp just so that everyone should be able to get it easy?<br />
Why dont they just lower all the Abilitys to 1AA each so that we dont have to grind so much? <br />
That would make all the ppl in the game that cant play more that 2 times a week really happy i think.<br />

If it feals like a second job to you and that the game gets boring just becouse you dont get everything easy i would advise you to turn off the game and play Diablo instead.</div></div><hr />

The best advice on the thread (regardless of whether you think 60AA is too expensive or not).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, just to note, 60 aa is beyond ridiculous for sturdiness 5. <br />
<br />
I dont' much like grinding XP, but thats not really the point. Here's a little illustration for you. At teh current stage, sturdiness 3/4/5 cost a combined 48 aa. Now, depending on when you got level 60, 59 was about 1 blue every 50 minutes, less if you were lucky enough to do it during the rewamp CT days. Now, even using the 1 blue every 50 minute routine, you're talking about going from 59 to 60 in 20 hours and 50 minutes of gameplay. Now, if assume an approximate rate of 1 aa every 50 minutes, under current standards, you're talking 48 aas in 40 hours. <br />
<br />
THe difference spread is approximately 19 hours 10 minutes. Now, even under the old system, 56 57 and 58 were all relatively quick levels. I'd say getting all 3 in 19 hours 10 minutes of game-play was not altogether impossible, but let's just argue that you could only get 58 and 59 in that alloted time (which is an understatment if using the same system for comparison). Anyone that says 300 Hp is equal in value compared to going from 57 to 60 is full of shit. <br />
<br />
Flash to SoL AA's for example#2. I will accept that getting AA's is 4-5 times faster in PoP than SoL, I will even attest to 5 times even (although this assumption requires elemental flag, which rules out the basic &quot;casual gamer&quot; category). Now, Sturdiness is approximately equavalent in value to Natural Durability in terms of the casual gamer (assuming the 5x faster rule which is actually more like 3-4x in BoT but irregardless and that a 60 SoL warrior has 3000 unbuffed Hp pre-ND). 12aa for ND-3 = 10% of 3000 = 300 = 3300 total. 60aa (at the 5x rate)  the 500 gained from sturdi-5 is 10% of 5000, a fair estimate of average for a 65 warrior with enough AA to be going for Sturd. However, this is making quite a few assumptions in favor of sturdiness, such as the average 65 warrior with PE, ND-3 and PD-3 having only 5kp (because the reality would be closer to 5500) and teh 5x rate of AAxp from SoL to poP which realistically is more like 3-4x faster outside of elementals for most.<br />
<br />
Now, the above exampel is an analysis of casual gamers. THe reality is, casual gamers won't be the ones going for sturdiness, hardcore gamers will. for Power gamers, Natural Durability was far better than sturdi will be. NOw, we can assume a 5x rate of XP, and approximately 4-5kp on a non-casual SoL warrior (let's take 4500) ND-3 = 450hp. Now, let's approximate the average non-casual gamer going for sturdiness at around 7khp unbuffed (VERY reasonable assumption considering virtually every elemental tank cracks 7k). In this scenario, 500 of 7000 is approximate 7.143% vs 10% from ND-3. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, what's my point in all of these illustrations? Simple, the only way to justify the heavy aa cost for a certain AA based on the pervious leveling scenarios, in this case sturdiness, is by comparing the benefit attained from sturdiness to the benefits previously attained from an equal investment of time. Look at the above examples and you will see that the current state of sturdiness is not justified in this matter. Personally, I believe sturdiness should be done in one of three fashions:<br />
1) 4 ranks: 4, 8, 12, 16. Increase hit-points by 50, 100, 150, 200<br />
2) 5 ranks: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. INcrease by 100 each level. <br />
3) 5 ranks: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20: increase hitpoints by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10% of unbuffed amount.<br />
<br />
the firstt 2 examples come out to a total cost of 40aa, a reasonable amount for the sturdiness aa. the 3rd is still 60 cost, but it yields higher benefit and becomes justified by the above examples.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going with the Luclin era quote of 1 yellow per hour.<br />
ND1 gave you 2% more hp for 8 hours of work<br />
ND2 gave you 3% more hp for 16 hours of work<br />
ND3 gave you 5% more hp for 24 hours of work<br />
<br />
Not great but worth working for.<br />
<br />
Given my current unbuffed hp of about 6.2k and assuming that Sturdiness 4 would get me to about 6.7k, that would mean that Sturdiness 5 would give me a 1.7% gain for 20-30 hours of work.  Thus, a Luclin era warrior grinding out ND3 was effectively getting about 3 times as much value as I would get for Stu5.<br />
<br />
If Sturdiness cost 4/8/12/16/20 and scaled at hit point values of 50/100/150/200/250 that would at least put it in some kind of rational framework.  Reward would scale with effort.  The current Sturdiness scheme is one where reward is the inverse of effort.  The idea of spending 20 AAs to get 100 hp when you got 100 hp for 4AA just seems really dumb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can understand the cost being high, because the exp comes in fast now, but I disagree with the end result.  This is definately not a casual players aa.<br />
<br />
But I agree with part of what Wilhelmm said.  A serious gamer will have around 7k hps, and will only get 7.14% for the same amount of time invested, compared to 10% for ND3 during Luclin.<br />
<br />
Though, another percentage would be very powerful at the high end, and probably not what SOE wants, and isn't really needed imo.  So I think the cost should be brought down to be more in line.  I'd say 48, as that is 80% of 60 (which is assumed close to the cost of ND3 from previous posts), though you are getting 71% compared to what you get from ND3.  This is based around the lower hps of the serious gamers, since we don't want to balance around the highers and give everyone a bunch more hps.<br />
<br />
4 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 14 would work.  Not that it really matters, SOE isn't gonna change it most likely heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All you're showing is that ND3 is probably overpowered.  It is also better than Planar Durability (9 for 4.5%).  Planar Power, which people get for HPs (the other stats rarely matter unless you can actually reach 305 cha), is roughly 100 HP for 10 AAs, and I still see a lot of people swear by Planar Power.  <br />
<br />
So 100 HP per 12 AA doesn't seem that bad to me, and besides the first 3 levels don't even cost more than 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple things pop to mind.  First is that all AA's are not equal, and some are better values than others.  Same thing holds true here.  Based on where I am for AA's, I think Sturdyness 1 and 2 will be good buys, and that 3, 4 and 5 will wait awhile.  Some time down the road tho, when I hit a point of buying the junk aa's(innate stats and such), I will be glad that 3, 4, and 5 are there, asthey will give me a definate gain for my AA's.<br />
<br />
Second is everyone isstill getting caught up in the '60 AA's for 55 hp's' thing.  It is actually 4 for 100, then 8 for 100, then 12, etc. to me, at least those first two ranks are good buys, and worth the AA's.  I will thereby be 200 hp's stronger(and how much would you pay for a 200 hp piece of gear, especially if you are not in Time yet?).  I think Sturdyness is a great AA for us, and does address the narrowed hp gap between us and knights to a certain extent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Planar Power allows your stats to go up, which has only the INDIRECT effect of adding to your HP, IF you have your sta that high to take advantage of it. It also adds indirectly to your atk if your str is high enough, and adds more procs, again, indirectly through higher max dex, among other things.<br />
<br />
Only valid comparisons are sturdiness to Natural Durability, Physical Enhancement, and Planar Durability, all of which directly increase hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Also: Natural Durability is NOT underpowered in a day and age where mobs hit for almost FOUR THOUSAND damage per hit.<br />
<br />
Redhenna: Yes, Sturdiness is a good AA for us. That isn't in question. What's in question is the extremely high cost.</div></div><hr />

More strength do not make you do more damage (someone parsed this a long time ago).  Going from 280 to 305 has at best a very minimal increase in procs and thus a very minimal increase in DPS.  You get what 1 or 2 AC from going from 280 to 305 agility?  If you don't have mana, you either got PP because didn't understood what the other stats did, or you got PP for the 100 HPs.  This is a perfectly valid comparison.</div></div><hr />

Saying that the str/dex increase is a trivial upgrade, or not useful, while that trivial level of HPs somehow aren't is a double standard.<br />

I know that the only reason I found PP worthwhile to upgrade was because it gave me more DPS and more procs as well as the HP... were it just the HPs alone I wouldn't have found it worth my while.</div></div><hr />

how one approaches getting it is the key. if you keep your mind on the end goal, 1 aa 2 aa 3 aa, then of course it will be a grind.<br />

Will I still get them? Hell yeah I will. I currently have all the existing hp aas, with the exception of PP5. I also have 8 AAs banked, and am shooting to have 12 as soon as I can. Granted, sturdiness 3-5 will take me quite a bit of time to get, but what else am I gonna buy? Any warrior who buys stuff like regen or CF before getting full defensive AAs either never tanks, or has no idea what his job is. And to restate the advice given earlier, if you get on and grind, and only see it as grinding so you can get the next 12-16-20 AAs for just 100hp each, of course the game will lose some fun. Do some LDoNs, explore GoD once it comes out, go to a cash spot with blue/lightblue mobs and duo... the AAs will come eventually, and you'll have fun and maybe score an upgrade or two while you wait.</div></div><hr />

Still, 60AA for 500hp would be incredibly expensive.  SoE needs to stop looking at Hobben's 600 AAs lol.  60 AA is only 10% for him, but it's half of what I've earned.</div></div><hr />

Would you like it better if they had made the cost 2AA per 100hp just so that everyone should be able to get it easy?<br />
Why dont they just lower all the Abilitys to 1AA each so that we dont have to grind so much? <br />
That would make all the ppl in the game that cant play more that 2 times a week really happy i think.<br />
<br />
Thank you for this ridiculous exaggeration of what I said.  Oh yes, because i think 60AA for sturdiness would be stupidly expensive, that means i want ALL AA TO COST ONE POINT EACH!!!  <br />
<br />
WTF?  Is this how you usually make an argument?  You know damn well that's not what I mean.  Is your view really so narrowed to a few obsessive players who have hundreds and hundreds of AA that you think the next expansion AAs should be designed mainly for those people?  They're are a tiny percentage of the game population.  Hell, they're a small percentage of the L65 crowd.  L65 and 100AAs is a hell of a lot of play time for the vast majority of players.  And yet you actually think 60AA for one set of skills is reasonable?  /boggle Wake up and realize that you and your friends with 500 AA or whatever are a miniscule portion of the playerbase.  <br />
<br />
So get your Luclin and PoP AAs first. These AA's arent going in so that some warrior with 100AAs has some new toys to buy, they are going in so warriors with 2-300AAs have something worth spending AAs on and a reason to XP in the new zones.<br />
<br />
Do you have any clue what a tiny portion of the playerbase you're talking about?  An expansion should be designed for high level players.  There are a lot of them.  They need stuff to do.  An expansion should NOT be designed mainly for people who are L65 with hundreds of AA and can actually look at 60AA for one set of AA skills and shrug.  <br />
<br />
If you're a casual gamer then those AAs aren't for you. Go work on some other AAs that's more useful.<br />
<br />
I see.  So L65 with 177 AAs is too casual for the expansion? lol... goddamn.  And here I thought I'd spent way, way too much of my life playing this game already, far more than most players I know, but I guess it's not even enough for the expansion skills.  Mindboggling.    <br />
<br />
Is this board really so loaded with full time EQ players who think hundreds and hundreds of AA is the standard that the next expansion should be designed for?  Phenomenal.  To summarize... &quot;Joo newbies with a mere L65 and 100 AAs shouldn't expect to have these AAs going in for you.  Come back when you have 300 or so.&quot;  lol... you guys are insane.</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of adding another 200 or so worth of useful aa in an expansion, but not a few abilities at retarded costs. That just tells me SOE is too lazy to think of anything better.  <br />
<br />
I have also never been a huge fan of the giant hurdle structure, as I feel it greatly benefits those who can play for long stretches per session (like our weapons used to be until recent changes). Whos more motivated? Someone who knows they can finish 20 aa  for 1 small ability increase pretty quickly due to having some time on his/her hands and having well equiped guildie friends at his/her disposal, or someone who knows its going to take them 2 months to get that. <br />
<br />
Having said that there are a few aa I am looking forward too (Hp, proc one, offhand damage bonus, IR5), in fact I think warriors get some of the best options this expansion on aa.  And also now those bazaar twinked ogre warriors sporting full FH will have to work their little asses off to keep up  :).</div></div><hr />

I was 60 when Luclin came out, and when PoP came out a year later I had 40ish AAs and I was a fairly active player.  Even among the really hardcore people few had over 100 and I only knew of one guy (psycho paladin on TM named Iustus) that had their AAs maxed before PoP came out (probably something like 250 AA total back then).  Now I have over 110 AAs on a character that was level 43 6 months after PoP came out, and I play less than I did back in Luclin.  My cleric bot that hit 65 about a month ago has 23 AAs from nothing but BoT farming for a couple hours after raids 3 or 4 nights a week.  There's no doubt that getting AAs is a whole lot easier than it used to be.  <br />
<br />
That said though, I will have a hard time saving the amount of AAs it will cost to max these GoD skills.  I wonder who the first person to break 100 AA will be hehe.</div></div><hr />

ill use an example to explain and i know that many ppl will scream right out when i use it.<br />
<br />
See the game as a job. If you are hard working and put in the little extra effort you will probebly be rewarded for it.<br />
If you start your own little company and work hard to get it to flow you will probebly succed better than if you are just &quot;grinding&quot; thru the work hours.<br />
<br />
Same thing in EQ. How many Time lvl guilds do you know say that AAs and the hours you can play isnt important?<br />
Most &quot;high lvl&quot; guilds demand X - AAs and that you play X - days a week or you are probebly not going to fit with them.<br />
<br />
Ppl that arnt interested in putting in this kind of work in the game / RL are probebly not going to be at the top.<br />
<br />
Yes, i see the last 3 steps of sturdiness as &quot;hardcore&quot; AAs becouse they cost alot. But you dont have to get them. Its optional. 200 extra HP is still a good boost.<br />
If you still want them, work for it. This is what seperates the players that puts in way to much time into the game from them who prefer to have alot of RL time.<br />
<br />
Most of the &quot;casual&quot; players who are between lvl 1 and 65 probebly have enough zones to explore and enough quests and tradeskills to play with.<br />
The ones at 65 with 1 - 150AAs probebly have enough to get the skills(pre GoD skills) needed to be able to tank the mobs at their lvl.<br />
Warriors lvl 65 with 150 - XXX AAs, have the needed skills and can set aside the AAs needed to max Sturdiness and other expencive skills.<br />
If you dont wanna spend alot of AAs to get them, then get the other less needed skills instead. Your choise.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that GoD are only for &quot;hardcore players&quot;. The expantion is for everyone. The high cost AA skills are not.</div></div><hr />

Do you have any clue what a tiny portion of the playerbase you're talking about? An expansion should be designed for high level players. There are a lot of them. They need stuff to do. An expansion should NOT be designed mainly for people who are L65 with hundreds of AA and can actually look at 60AA for one set of AA skills and shrug.<br />
So, to paraphrase, high level players are ones that don't have a lot of AA?  Or is this sayin please cater the AA costs to the raiding warrior?  I think this point confused me, or it might really be the double standard it seems.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am biased, i'm 65/268 (29 of which are banked), in a small raiding guild that wiped on RoV last night, hasn't completed getting keyed for Emp, and I sit at just over 6k unbuffed.  I grind to relax /shrug and as MT for my guild, I enjoy working my ass off to be the best tank I can while still having all my &quot;firsts&quot; be with my guild.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how anyone can complain about even the last level of sturdiness.  20AA for 100 hps.  100 hps that you didn't freaking have before, they just piff in out of the ether after you push that &quot;Train&quot; button.  Jesus Christ Almighty didn't say you deserve these hitpoints, and if you don't think they're worth the cost, go buy a different AA, or look for 100 hitpoint increase in gear instead.  Eventually, sometime down the road, you'll decide 20 AA is expensive, but finally worth it, for 100 hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Comparisons with Luclin and PoP AA are moot, this isn't retrofitted AA to those expansions, it's AA in an entirely new expansion with new pricing.  Don't like it?  Finish your SoL/PoP AA and bitch about it later.  Bang for buck is still SoL&gt;PoP&gt;GoD.<br />
<br />
The only valid bitch, imho, would be if other classes got amazing new AA for low cost and we got shitty AA for really shitty cost.  But from what I've seen every class is facing this &quot;yikes, GoD AA is damn expensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why do I get the impression some people think all AA need to be equal?</div></div><hr />

It's a built in time sink that allows us to get what should be our innate HP advantage back.  It should'nt cost extra AA to get something we should have innately anyway.  That having been said, I think 60 AA points for any ability is sort of excessive.</div></div><hr />

It is also better than Planar Durability (9 for 4.5%). Planar Power, which people get for HPs (the other stats rarely matter unless you can actually reach 305 cha), is roughly 100 HP for 10 AAs, and I still see a lot of people swear by Planar Power. <br />
<br />
So 100 HP per 12 AA doesn't seem that bad to me, and besides the first 3 levels don't even cost more than 12.&quot;<br />
<br />
Incorrect sir. by your logic of PoP AAXP vs. SoL AAXP, Planar Durability is a LOT better than Natural Durability if we're doing a side-by-side comparison, PD-3 is equivalent to ND-2, and getting 9 aa's in the PoP era is much faster than getting 6 from SoL times. You are even incorrect with Planar POwer because you fail to address the additional AC (however miniscule) and endurance, nor the fact that even aside from the AC and improved proc rate and atk and endurance, 100hp for 10aa is still a better ratio than 500 for 60. PS, going up from 280 to 305 agi = 4-5 ac total (somewhere between 2 and 3 raw * 1.6). At a rate of 1ac = 4hp (which is actually low) we're still talking about an additional 16-20hp equivalent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you really got PP for any stats that's not sta (for manaless class) then you obviously didn't know what the stats did.<br />
<br />
Comparing current cost, ND3 beats Planar Durability, which is what most people are looking at since people refuse to acknowledge you get XP 5 times faster today than Luclin.  ND3 was expensive back in Luclin but it is quite overpowered now given the ease of getting AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Misleading numbers, which you use to further your point.<br />
<br />
That extra 25 dex represents a nearly 10% increase in proc rate, which given the warrior maxim of &quot;aggro is everything&quot; is certainly not insignificant. At least, it's not insignificant, if 100HP is not insignificant.<br />
<br />
Hell, there's a GoD AA that's specifically for proc rate increase, you can bet it'll be a minor amount, and you can also bet players will spend the AA to get it.<br />

Again, misleading. I'd like to see a link that proves this, btw.... but operating under the assumption that that's true for the moment, for most characters, it does. Just because it doesn't for you doesn't mean you can dismiss it.<br />
<br />

Mob melee is quite overpowered now compared to Luclin. Yeah, ND3 gives you more HPS, but mob melee makes those HPs relatively less powerful.</div></div><hr />

What's important is if warriors get a similar power increase from AAs as the other classes get and for a similar amount of AAs.  If for example we got as much of a power boost as wizards do with our AAs but ours cost a total of 1000 AAs and theirs only cost 300 then something is wrong and vice versa.  By the same token if we have 1000 points worth of AAs coming but they turn out to be worthless and wizards have 1000 pts worth of useful AAs then there's also a problem.</div></div><hr />

To the best of my knowledge, attack does not cap.  It will continutue to rais your DPS a little.  I remember reading a post on the BL board that showed that the return got smaller at higher levels off attack, but it did continue to raise DPS.  As I understand it, STR does not raise max hit, it only makes you more likely to hit for max, due to the increased attack.<br />
<br />
And agree Khumak, well put.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see ND as overpowered at all.  It's one of the few things that put warriors a bit higher than others.  Everyone can get it, but if you have more hps it gives a higher bonus.  Which is much better than straight hps since they give more relatively to lower hps classes (like non class specific items do).  This aa is warrior only, I'm just talking about the power of ND specifically.  Also, yeah aas come fast higher up, but how many warriors are in groups that can get that fast of exp, and don't have ND?  I'm sure there are some that are twinks or whatever that are PL'd like that, but for most warriors when you're getting aas it's not near as fast as higher people get.  I'm not saying that it isn't much faster than luclin, it is, but it's not near as fast as they go for someone in elementals, LDoN hard, etc (unless they are non warriors, some of which don't save for it for a while).  Given return to time spent, it's not overpowered at the lower in relative power part during which you get it imo.</div></div><hr />

Nope. Everyone got it for the HP, thats obvious. But you still can't discount those factors just because they are not the driving force.<br />

<br />
Nope. Can't do that. You can't compare SoL aa's to PoP aa's using the PoP as the baseline for speed at which AA is gotten. Therefore, your claim that ND is over-powered is WRONG, because it is LESS powerful than PD, as I've already illustrated, if you do a head-on comparison factoring in the XP rates. Because according to your backwards logic, every SoL aa is over-powered. Every stat and resist AA from SoL is &gt; PoP because you get 2 point of stat increase from SoL version vs. 1 from PoP. CS/CA/CF/Regen/Run-Speed are all overpowered. Class-specific, so is AoE-taunt/Flurry/PE. &quot;OMG, all teh aa r teh over-puw3r, cast them down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reread my posts and you will reach the inevitabilty. you are wrong, and I am right because I have logic on my side whereas you have invalid baseline comparisons on yours.</div></div><hr />

Almost all of our bitching revolved around 3 things.<br />
<br />
1 - Our aggro sucked, especially compared to knights<br />
2 - because of poor itemization by SOE, knights mitigated almost as well as we did<br />
3 - because of poor itemization by SOE, knights had almost as many hit points as we did.<br />
<br />
In response, SOE -eventually- fixed problem #1 (Provoke line) and problem #2 (innate mitigation boost).  Now they are &quot;fixing&quot; problem #3 by charging us 60 AAs.  THAT is why this is unfair.  I have absolutely no objection to some people having every possible AA while I have to pick and choose with my slower rate of AA advancement.  That is fine, it is the way of the world.  The reason that I'm pissed is that to fix SOE's dumbass mistake, I'm gonna have to bust my ass to grind out 60 AAs.  All because SOE doesn't have the faintest clue how to itemize.<br />
<br />
Honestly if this was a 60 point non-essential AA ability like an upgrade to Flurry, I just wouldn't care.  All the people with more AAs than they know what to do with could then get it and I would chalk it up to one of those way, way down the road AAs, everyone would be happy.

Back in Luclin a good xp group is 1 yellow AA per 1 hour.  Back in Luclin you probably didn't have 5000 HP unbuffed so ND3 at 12 AAs would get you no more than 500 HPs and take you roughly 60 hours.<br />
<br />
No  <br />
<br />
luclin aa took 3-4 hours in fg groups, thats about 50 hours max to get 500 hps.  5 aa takes about 3-5 hours to get depending on your group ect.   Luclin equates to 10 hours per 100 hps and god equates to 3-5 per 100 if they are 5 aa per level..or at 60 aa you are assuming 30-60 hours worth of exp time divided by 5 levels gives you 6 to 12 hours per 100 hps.  Unfortunatly it is fairly equal to what luclin was.  If you want to look where we got fucked look to ldon where a 40 hp aug took 23 adventures and the fastest you can do 1 adventure and have the next entered is 40 minutes.  thats 15.22 hours per 40 hps or 38.33 hours per 100 hps in ldon.<br />
<br />
summary<br />
Luclin = 10 hours per 100 hp roughly given 3-5 hour aa and 12 aa = 500 hps<br />
<br />
ldon = 38.33 hours per 100hps given 23 adventures to buy an 1150 ph aug and 40 mins minimum between adventures.<br />
<br />

<br />
As bad as it seems it is actually very similar to what luclin was because in that 3-5 hours per aa or 36-60 hours total to cap nd where god is 30-60 hours to cap sturdiness at 60 aa.</div></div><hr />

I have 4600 atm unbuffed and that would have me sitting at 5100 which gearwise is about as significant as completing half to a whole expansion.  60 AA lets you skip half an expansion blocking your progression path?  I dont know about you but sign me up.<br />
<br />
As a bard I already have to pay twice the cost you do for the same power gain and 1/10th of the usefulness as you gain in SOL aa as it is.<br />
<br />
We both have CA3 but you tank way more than I do, we still both spent points on it because it was the best AA available to spend those points on.  Same for CS, LR, ID, PE, ambidexterity, double attack aas, etc.  If only I had an aa progression path so exponential as warriors.  At least you can say there is not a big difference between 200-300, as a bard its more like 100-500 for me.<br />
<br />
When I got sta 1-15 for the HPs I was getting the exact same value as warriors will get assuming 60aa -&gt; 500hp and I quit doing those AA because I was capped rather than because I had to.<br />
<br />
BTW there was a paladin on RZ that maxxed AA in SOL as well, name is Xblade, there were pictures on message boards and lots of talk about him beating EQ.  He is still up to his old tricks and has wasted hundreds of AA zoning.<br />
<br />
Me I do LDON because its faster progression than with AA, and thats considering that every 1500 point item is a direct downgrade for me.<br />

<br />
What I mean is, will Natural Durability and Physical Enhancement effect these HPs?<br />
<br />
I know whith the AA's I have right now, if I added a 40hp augment to say, my helm, I would actually get 47hps. That's an additional 1.175hp per 10hps. I don't know if that is the correct number, but 40 * 1.175 = 47, and 500 * 1.175 =587.5. So we would actually be getting about 9.8hp per point of AA. Maybe that would make it sound more worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all bards have been a good class for about 2 years, not 5, and they certainly arent one of *the trinity* you know, WARRIOR cleric enchanter, either.<br />
<br />
AFAIK it was warriors who owned the first 3 years of EQ so you owned longer than I did so how about stick to the argument?<br />
<br />
Secondly, obviously you are debating how suck your new AA is when you could easily give it to someone who would like to have it, like the bards for instance, and quit taking it for granted maybe?<br />
<br />
Thirdly I have probably 400 played more than you so on to fourthly...<br />
<br />
Fourthly, wth do u mean with *PS what does LDON and why you do it* have to do with the rest of the sentence, and where is the other part that connects to that?  I guess you were worrying about your 500 free HP a little bit too much, wait you didnt even mention that in your pointless flame.<br />

<br />
Hmm, so all the times groups took rangers over warriors from the original release and into the Kunark era was due to their misunderstanding of our abilities?  IMO, warriors did not really come into their own as a class until half-way through the Velious release.  SoL was the beginning of the descent of relative usefulness of the warrior class that only some recent changes have alleviated. <br />
<br />
Let's face it, no one is excited about the new AAs coming out in GoD and anyone can look at another classes AAs and pick out one or two and say they would love to have them.  As a matter of fact, I'll gladly trade you Sturdiness for Fading Memories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors were TERRRIBLE for the first few years of EQ.  Prekunark they were hybrids without spells, the only difference was the xp penalty.  Of course, rogues were even worse.  Warriors didnt get good until Velious really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulflayer</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bards have no right to bitch about their class, nor complain in this forum. You are grossly overpowered currently and should be severly beaten with the nerf bat. Before you make a statement to this one, head over to Monkly Business or Safehouse and post for sympathy there. Can always head over to Fires of Heaven and ask Furor for sympathy or ask some old school necros on why you shouldnt be nerfed.<br />
<br />
K-Dog <br />
<br />
Yes warriors sucked in Pre Kunark. There was a reason it had the nick name of &quot;Caster Quest&quot;. Though I disagree with you on your time line of when warriors came into power. They came into power in Kunark and lasted into the end of Velious or begining of Luclin. They were most dominant in Kunark era.<br />
<br />
Oh, and rogues before Kunark were not as bad as they would like you to believe. There was a reason why the first 50 was a Rogue and why that class took so many nerfs, when the game first came out. <br />
<br />
<br />
Back on Topic <br />
<br />
First, 60 AA means nothing for this skill. I am currently sitting at MAX AA points which I have been for the last 3+ months. That means experience messages give me 100% of nothing. AA's are silly easy to acquire. When I was xping I was doing 10 or so a day ( less then 7 hours ) while farming Earth for tradeskills items. When their was AA skills I needed, Plane of Fire had some terrific xping areas that with a proper group can net up to 1 AA per 15 minutes or right around that time frame, 25 minutes if not being fully optimized.<br />
<br />
Now as to the AA skill itself, I feel its a poor excuse to extend the HP gap between Warriors and others by forcing us to pay AA's for it. Yes. Verant is the one to blame for the all/all items and adding new spells to Hybrids that are self only. So instead of correcting the problem they throw a time sink to warriors to pay for Verants mistake. This is whats wrong with this AA, not the 500hp per say.<br />
<br />
For those that are bitching about the points for this skill or it not being &quot;uber&quot; enough. Understand that no one AA skill makes us or breaks us, BUT when they are all combined together they make a HUGE differnce.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: You dont need to have Elemental Flags to get to great xp areas. What you need is a good group and a steady source of red con mobs, which can be found in PoP non Elemental zones. Key is little to no down time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For every one of you, you can bet that there's literally dozens of warriors to whom this AA represents a a huge chuck of the AA's they presently have, and to whom 60AA isn't &quot;trivial&quot; to get, but rather a HUGE time investment.<br />
<br />
I swear these AA were designed to slow down the ubers, which means the normal people got completely bent over.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, you give me some good AA's to get, I don't mind paying more for them than before, that's how it goes. Give me another Natural Durability, I'll pay 4 times what it cost before. But not THIS garbage.<br />
<br />
But giving me shit AA's AND making me WAY too much for them? That's when I start feeling screwed over. Especially when you consider they want me to PAY them to be able to get these crap AA's that I would pay wayy too much for.<br />

<br />
People who are hell bent on getting as much AA as they can, maxing their ldon charm, etc are gonna play non-stop till they max these and it is an impressive number of AA. Casual people, will not.<br />
<br />
Casuals can easily get the first couple tiers, and after that, the seperation sets in. Those with max aa already and lots of time to devote to grinding will finish those last 300hp of the skill, while the casual setle for the first 200 and finish other AAthey need from previous expansions.<br />
<br />
Then you have your other hardcore players who play a TON but will just be to lazy and you can make fun of them for lacking the AA!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The holy trinity or whatever you want to call it certainly existed starting right around the day people figured out what/where sebilis was.  Not beginning of velious, not end of velious, beginning of kunark.<br />
<br />
Also, just saying I traded you fade for 500 hp, it would be useable every 30 minutes or so for you unless you invested heavily into FT items, we all know how common high FT high HP is on stuff outside time, especially plate tank items.<br />
<br />
Take off another oh just being generous 500 hp off you in addition to the previous 500 to get the mana to power fade and see who groups you then.  Oh and while we are at it you can sacrifice 1/4th of your DPS because 500 hp isnt enough loss to get FM in DEV eyes.  See how fun that is.<br />
<br />
Honestly, you have had a lot of your concerns and problems fixed, provoke is a good example, you dont deserve high aggro abilities from a distance like hybrid tanks but you get it, doesnt say anywhere in your class description that you deserve abilities like that, but hey you complain enough...<br />

<br />
The progression of our utility as a warrior class has been compromised over the past 4 years. This has required SOE to make adjustments to the warrior class. The adjustments are not upgrades as much as they are remediation. The HP differential between the primary tanking class and the hybrid tanking class was so insignificant as to make it pointless. Hybrids ended up paying no penalty for having a hybrid nature.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...our vision of those classes' roles[SK and Paladins]...basically put Paladin and SK HPs midway (in terms of Hit Points) between rangers and warriors...&quot; SOE Development team<br />
<br />
The 500 hps you talk about is an effort of a gradual remediation of our class structure. Unfortunately, SOE has required us to have to pay for that remediation.<br />
<br />
Just be glad as a Bard that an expansion for you and your class doesn't cost you AA points as a catch up utility.<br />
<br />
As for taunting? It was broke. Once we didn't have problems with it. In fact, it was the hybrids who had problems with it. SOE improved their classes by providing them spells to aid in that area - though it has gone the other pendulum and has been brainwashed into peoples mind that warriors never were meant to be effective compared to the hybrids in that arena. Fact is we were meant to be effective in that arena. Fact is the incite line was not an upgrade per say in utility as much as it was the process of remediation of our class structure from what we actually possessed once before.<br />
<br />
&quot;The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular, Paladins had difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower damage output. Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in addition to some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks.&quot; SOE Development team.<br />
<br />
So while you can look forward to the AA skills of your Bard class we as warriors are actually acquiring things we once had years and years ago, paying for it in blood in fact(60 AA's), but were lost over the course of misguided expansions that poorly considered itemization and cross class utility differentials.<br />

Each level of Sturdiness adds 100 hitpoints, flat. Unlike items which give you increased HP when you obtain ND, PD, and the like, Sturdiness is unaffected. It's exactly 100 hitpoints added on the char per level of sturdiness, no more, no less.</div></div><hr />

You seriously don't think 20 aa is worth 100hp? Assuming 20 aa will take you 2 days, and that's being optimistic, 100hp is a big boost. You'll rarely loot an item that can give you a 100hp boost and it will take how many days to upgrade 100hp from the aquisition of items? Weeks sometimes, even months. Hell, a lot of us put days into LDoN for the 20/20 augs...<br />

If you already have 30 aa saved, then right after you log in you'll be 300 hp better off. At the end of the week, 500. How can 500 hp not be worth that?</div></div><hr />

Why? Cause if you are a casual player you are not in PoT, you are not in EP and you don't need Sturdiness. This is for hard core players.

Their is no &quot;easy&quot; EP exp,  EP red cons have similar damage output to the ones in the rest of PoP.  Exp in all PoP zones use the same ZEM save HOH a/b and clerics regen mana at the same rate save ft.    You can help make the differance much smaller with the use of potions or a bard bot.  The grass isn't greener and I believe it is more of an ability issue more than SOE trying to piss on your wheeties.  People that have spent ungodly amounts of time to make themselves more efficient will and do take mobs down faster/easier than somone who hasn't.  How is that unfair?<br />
<br />
That screw up your talking about with the bluring of hitpoint totals between classes is almost exclusive to time gear.  Not in time but want something for free maybe?  <br />
<br />
If you don't have luclin aa's finished and you did them in POP you saved a shitload of time.  You have no room to bitch about anything,  the aa's you got in one month took me 11 months of seriously LONG playing hours to complete.  Being behind the curve on this makes the ones I busted my balls to get come easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So uh, how does your red cons and ZEMs are equal arguement matter at all if the blues that non-EP fight are lower level and thus worth less xp per kill than the blues that EP people kill?<br />

-edit- for some reason I can't pull up magelo profiles besides my own atm but of the 2 profiles from my guild that Brutall linked, one is ME and I raid buffed to 8678 hp before I just added Sturdiness 1 and my guild's top paladin raid buffs to over 8.4k.  Thus the pre-Sturdiness difference between myself and my guild's top paladin was UNDER 300 HP.  That's just not much.  I also never claimed that the difference was 100 hp, I simply said that it was small (implying less than 5%) which is true.</div></div><hr />

Even if I could tank at Picnics, that's 5% per kill, which means to get 2 AA an hour you'd have to kill a mob every minute (gotta figure on SOME downtime).

<br />
Does it happen in practice? Different story.<br />
<br />
I think the players that hunt Tatics mobs that split, or that knockback +strip buffs, because they want to make a little better experience are few and far between- it's too annoying. The vast majority hunt in the pit, which is much less annoying of XP.<br />
<br />
So, while it is theoretically possible to make the smae kind of experience in ONE OR TWO of the pre-elemental zones, in reality it doesn't normally happen. <br />
<br />
You talk about ZEM's, and how that means the XP is the same. <br />
<br />
The fact is, ZEM isn't everything.<br />
<br />
Most people in BoT, HoH, or Tactics are gonna fight blues. The same people are going to hunt blues in EP. And in EP, those blues are going to give you more experience than in BoT. Why, I'd guess because the average level of mobs is higher. Go to Valor, the difference is more apparent. Go to Nightmare, and the difference is just absolutely huge.<br />
<br />
For all your talk of ZEM's, the fact remains that the higher tier you're in in PoP, the better XP you make overall. That's just how it is. Saying that you make the same XP per hour in PoValor, Nightmare, or even BoT as in PoEarth is just ludicrous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that BoT is constantly full and CoD is typically empty speaks volumes of the non tier 4+ flagged players. CoD exp blows away BoT, but it is considerably harder to hunt there. No surprise, people would rather take the easy way out and hunt BoT. This is no different than the people who hunted LoIO &gt;&gt; OT &gt;&gt; DL when they could have been hunting SP &gt;&gt; Kaesora &gt;&gt; CC. People would rather get less exp in a safe outdoor environment with push over mobs, than harder indoor exp with challenging mobs.<br />

War/Pally buff comparison:<br />
<br />
Pally -<br />
Virtue - 1405hp<br />
Brells - 330hp<br />
Aura of the Crusader - 346hp<br />
Focus - 544hp<br />
Total - 2625hp<br />
<br />
Warrior (virtue) -<br />
Virtue - 1405hp<br />
Brells - 330hp<br />
Focus - 544hp<br />
Total - 2279hp<br />
<br />
Warrior (9+symbol) -<br />
Symbol - 910hp<br />
Bot9 - 618hp<br />
Brells - 330hp<br />
Focus - 544hp<br />
Total - 2402hp<br />
<br />
So a pally has an additional advantage of 346hp over a warrior with Virt and 223hp over a warrior with symb+9. I fail to see how your paladins are making up more HP than the difference in buffs. I am also curious as to why you wouldn't use 9+symbol? You are casting 9 for your caster are you not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not &quot;complaining about&quot; anyone. Perhaps you have me confused with someone else, as I'm simply  I'm stating facts, and the fact is, 90% of people, and everyone I've ever seen, is going to be hunting blue, and not the red mobs that you're claiming. Secondly, that's really getting away from the point... Brutul claims that there is no easy EP EXP, which means that every other zone in PoP or at least the majority of them, is not relatively harder experience than EP. Not JUST the &quot;red con mobs in Tactics&quot;, but the blues in BoT, the blues in tactics, and so on and so forth. Your claim that there's no easy XP in EP because SOME of the mobs in ONE zone can make the same XP is preposterous.<br />
<br />
It's come up over and over again by many people on how good EP EXP in particular is, and how many AA you can make how quickly in EP, so it's not just me. <br />
<br />
<br />
 The only difference for people who are flagged for higher tiers is that there are more red con mobs available to them. Saying that it is POSSIBLE to get the same exp in lower tiers is 100% accurate. Choose your mobs/camps wisely and the exp is considerably higher.<br />
<br />
People don't choose mobs for how much EXP is per mob alone. People choose mobs for how much EXP they give AS WELL AS how easy that EXP is. And for the same EXP as EP, those mobs are significantly more annoying. Therefore they don't do it.<br />
<br />
To say that there's &quot;No easy EP EXP&quot; when players GO to EP to make good XP that's easier than can be found elsewhere jsut boggles my mind. I mean, you're contradicting yourself with your own arguments.<br />
<br />
In fact, you prove my point for me:<br />
<br />
People would rather get less exp in a safe outdoor environment with push over mobs, than harder indoor exp with challenging mobs.<br />
<br />
What's EP? safe outdoor environment. Pushover mobs. What's Tactics reds? Harder indoor experience with challenging mobs. The only thing that doesn't quite jive is that the outdoor XP is less here, so guess what, EP is easy XP in comparison.<br />
<br />
As for why we use Virtue over P0t9, warriors have a chronic shortage of buff slots, esp in a MT role. Virtue is used to save buff slots.</div></div><hr />

Virtue lasts longer and replaces 2 HP buffs + 1 AC buff.  I frequently am short on buff slots on raids and would much rather not have to click off useful buffs to leave spots for HoTs, mob Debuffs that would otherwise dispell my own buffs if no slots are left for them, instaclicks, etc...<br />
<br />
As for the small gap in HP between our top warriors and paladins not explained by buff differences I can only assume Lky's Magelo is not up to date because he does indeed have more than 10k HPs buffed.  A moot point as I already mentioned now that Sturdiness is available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is about SOE forcing us to spend 60 AAs to fix the shrinking of the hit point gap between warriors and other classes that SOE caused by poor itemization.  If SOE created a 100 point AA that added to our dps it wouldn't be an issue at all.<br />
<br />
This is also about the fact that the people who need this AA the most are the ones who face the most difficult time getting it.  The people who can't get an AA every 30 minutes have to spend a lot more time to FIX SOE'S ITEMIZATION than the people who don't bother with Brells because they already have enough hit points and want more attack.<br />
<br />
In return, numerous ubers on this board said &quot;screw you&quot; to their pre-EP brethren.  They say &quot;you get the same xp hunting reds pre-EP that you do in the EP.&quot;  Well, that's just great, except that all but a very few pre-EP people simply do not have the gear to handle those red cons.  If a group of EP/Time people hunt elites in Tactics, they may get just as much xp as they get hunting reds in Fire, but they also have warriors with 3 or 4 THOUSAND MORE HIT POINTS and 4-500 MORE AC than a pre-EP warrior.  That makes a difference...</div></div><hr />

<br />
HP gap is a matter of concern for Time or at least near Time guilds and it is perfectly appropriate to expect people in these areas to grind 60 AAs to fix a problem because people who are not up there do not deserve just having an extra 500 HP slapped on them for being a warrior.  And you can still get those 500 HP even if you're not anywhere close to Time, but it's probably not going to be worth it if you can't get a lot of AAs like one would expect from a warrior in such guilds.</div></div><hr />

And anyone who thinks the ZEM is the same for Earth as it is everywhere else hasn't xp'd there. That's why I said Fire and Water are the only source for serious xp grouping reds.

You are presuming that the mid level warrior has similar HPs to comparably equiped knights. News flash - NToV geared warriors have considerably more HP than NToV geared knights, just like Luclin/lower PoP/LDoN warriors have more HP than similarly geared knights. The closer you get to the high end, the more narrow the gap becomes percentagewise, but the difference is much more pronounced at lower level of gear. For the sake of discussion, lets pick a random warrior, pally, and SK from EQ rankings - <br />
<br />
Warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=758589) - Mix of Velious, cultural, and lower tier PoP gear. 133aa, 5692hp, 1320ac<br />
Paladin (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=627434) - Mix of Velious, Luclin, and lower tier PoP gear. 122aa, 4950hp, 1403ac<br />
Shadowknight (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=590367) - Mix of Velious, Luclin, and lower tier PoP gear. 122aa, 4841hp, 1126ac<br />
<br />
When I picked a profile, I basically picked from on of the middle pages of the rankings when sorted by HP. Then I picked the first profile that was at or near 120aa in the listing. These numbers also happen to match the difference between one of my good pally friends and my warrior, who also have similar levels of gear. At lower levels of gear and AAs, there is still a ~700+hp difference between a warrior and a knight, but the difference is much more noticable because it is a much larger percentage of the total HP.<br />
<br />
I would say that the people that &quot;need these AA the most&quot; are the hardcore, high level players where a 700hp difference is not nearly as large as it is at lower levels of gear. These are also the people most likely to have the time and inclination to grind out the AAs. Not only that, but the lower geared/AA'd warriors will benefit a lot from just the 300hp increase of buying the first 3 levels, making their increase in HP of similar proportion to their high end brethern. 300hp incrase for a midlevel 5.5khp warrior is about  a 5.4% increase in HP for 24aa, or a little over 4aa per 1% gain. For a high end warrior who has 8khp, they are getting about a 6.25% increase in HP for 60aa, or a little over 9aa per 1%.<br />
<br />
Face it, the top tiers of Sturdiness are no meant for everyone, nor should they be. For the people who don't feel they are worth it - DON'T BUY THEM. Chances are those people already have a pretty substancial advanatge in HP as it is.<br />
<br />
Here is another eye opening comparison. I love using my warrior as an example because all of his gear is obtainable in the bazaar or with small raids of 3 groups or less. He is not EP flagged, or even Sol Ro flagged for that matter. Take a look at the gear knights would require to match his AC/HP -<br />
<br />
my warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=460039) - 6214hp, 1503ac, 59aa. Mix of bazaar, low end PoP, and LDoN gear.<br />
6219 HP SK (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=250473) - 6219hp, 1544ac, 206aa. Lots of EP gear, 1 Time drop, few slots with lower PoP or high end Velious gear.<br />
6220 HP Paladin (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=27165) - 6220hp, 1539ac, 242aa. Several pieces of EP gear, several VT and high end Luclin drops.<br />
<br />
You REALLY think that the itemization problem is prevalent in the pre-EP level of the game? Seems like to me, the pre-EP crowd is getting a pretty good deal on AAs that are just a bonus in addition to the advantage in HP they already enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you remember to account for self buffs, or brell's at least?Well, since the point of the discussion is not centered around soloing, I think it would be safe to assume that any buffs the knight gets would also be available to the warrior. In any case, did you even bother to look at the comparison? At similar levels of pre-EP gear, knights fall in around 700-1khp less than a warrior. SKs get no buff advantage and pallys get at most a ~350hp advantage due to buffs. Seems like to me, a warrior is STILL going to have a pretty clear advantage with buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I have to agree with earlier posters: My guild is all fairly evenly geared (pre-VT), and our knights are easily 1k-1.5k behind the warriors on hitpoints, although ac values are pretty close (maybe due to shields... would have to check a bunch of magelos to figure that out).<br />
<br />
I can say that for myself, 100-300 more hitpoints would be great.  And as vain as it sounds, there's more to hitpoints than just how many smacks you can take... it's also about respect as a tank.  The virtual equivalent of &quot;whipping it out&quot;, as it were.  When a raidleader is deciding who will MA, it's not terribly unusual to have them ask for our hitpoint/ac totals (and, lately, avoidance / mitigation aa's as well).  The difference in our guild between a 5500hp unbuffed tank, and one at 5800 is the difference between MA'ing &quot;most of the time&quot; versus &quot;some of the time&quot;.<br />

with what?  An overpowered charmer?  I haven't hunted CoD enough to say, but I've hunted Tactics with some very good dps groups for non-ele gear and exp is absolutely no ways near 2 points per hour.  Even if I allow for you having a group that had say 50% more dps than the best dps group I was ever in for that zone, it's still no ways near 2 per hour.  And yes, we went to the good exp camps.

People are confusing &quot;skill&quot; with &quot;available time&quot; and &quot;gear&quot;.  You and I agree Flair. Grinding 5-6aa has a lot more to do with camp choice and time than it does skill and gear. The point I am making is that it is easier to FIND the camps that yeild the best AA with elem access because there are more areas with 65+ mob available. Not only that, but in general, the causal player is not interested in a hard core work your ass off camp, particularly when the groups can be found in the cake camps like BoT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I can't help but respond to some of these posts.<br />
<br />
First, to address the &quot;Knight Vs. Warrior HP Gap&quot; problem, there's a few things a lot of people seem to be forgetting.  1) The close relation between knights and warriors is rarely seen in any situations EXCEPT the extremely high end game (upper Elementals, Time+).  Therefore, all of the people saying &quot;I'm 65 with 168 AA and just over 6k unbuffed HP&quot; have no room to argue about Knight's comparable HP, because a knight of your stature in equipment wouldn't have 6k unbuffed HP.  Perhaps you know knights with more, and that's great, but they simply have better equipment.  That's not a case of design flaws there, it's simply the Knight aquiring better equipment by whatever means necessary.  More power to them.  Remember, you cannot ask Knights to always remain below Warriors in HP.  Some players are more uber than others; that will always be the case.  No amount of 'proper itemization' will &quot;fix&quot; that (and I quote that because I don't see it as a problem in the slightest.)<br />
<br />
Secondly, the differences between Knights and warrior's, even when the knight has equivalent HPs, are completely offset by Disciplines.  What's that, you mitigate 45% damage now?  Where's the Paladin's defensive or stonewall or evasive?  The SK just Harm Touched for 8000 damage and healed himself at the same time, but now he's going to get owned by that 1500 hitting mob where a warrior with LESS hp and WORSE equipment could tank it better in many situations.  Try to argue all you'd like, that fact remains.  With the Incite skill now making agro control slightly easier, you cannot discount disciplines into your power.  (And don't start arguing, &quot;Well they have spells!  I want self-buffs and heals!&quot; because you're a PURE MELEE class, and your advanced discs are the equivalent of thier spells.)<br />
<br />
The bottom line, for this 'issue,' is if you truly are concerned about tanking (as your primary job) then you will not be outdone in most situations by a similarly equipped/AAed Knight.  However, when Knights are required to tank a few Time Gods because of their abilities, and they can still handle it, that gives you no right to scream bloody murder.  You're still superior by and large; and that's only exaggerated in exp groups now that discs can be used so often.<br />
<br />
Now, to address the main issue of the thread, I personally don't think 60 AAs are *too* much for maxing this skill.  Is it a lot?  Yes, it's a big number in the scheme of things, but no one seems to remember it's a benefit to you.  Plain and simple.  It's the equivalent of getting a new equipment slot, and being given a 500+ item for free; all it costs you is time.  Get ready, here's the key factor: ANYONE can get this uber 500 HP item and new slot - Doesn't matter if you're in Time or fighting in Plane of Justice.  All these arguements of &quot;it's easier for Time enabled warriors to get 60AAs than it is for me&quot; is ridiculous.  I'm not time enabled, I only have 6200 unbuffed HP (and mostly old school equipment), but I don't have any problems tanking for exp groups in PoP, elementals, and now GoD expeditions.  Is it difficult?  Sometimes.  Is it worth it?  Hell yes!<br />
<br />
Any Warrior worth their salt knows any additional HP gain, especially without requiring equipment change, is a good thing regardless of the cost.  Saying that because mobs hit you for 1200 in your exp groups, you spit on 500 HP gain is a ridiculous statement at the least.  If 500 HP isn't any use to you, how about you not only don't get the new skill, but you give me back 500 more of your current HP.  I mean, it's only 1000 HP, and the mobs hit for 1200+!  Actually, how about you give me back 1000?  1500?<br />
<br />
Get the point?  It's not a matter of saying, &quot;This number, compared to this number, is small,&quot; but rather a matter of expanding the buffer between the bad, mediocre, and uber warriors.  Like most AA abilities, this one will help you down the road.  Choosing not to work towards it is fine and completely up to you, but as a few people mentioned, someone will get it, and the gap between you and him/her will be even greater.<br />
<br />
Remember, these are AAs designed for a new expansion; a HIGH END expansion from the looks of things so far.  Just because you buy the content, doesn't mean you get to have everything right away.  That's the entire basis of EQ's progressional system.  Time and effort = reward.  If the time and effort isn't worth that reward for you, then it's your choice not to work towards it.  The bottom line, however, is that a free 500 HP boost (to ANY class) where you wouldn't have possibly had a chance at that boost previously, is nothing to look down on.<br />
<br />
Additionally, exp in GoD is insane.  In my opinion, even better then Elementals in terms of time/difficulty vs. exp gain.  Again, it's not something you can sit around with your finger up your nose to do well at, but if you try you'll gain exp at an amazing rate.  Therefore, AA costs for THIS EXPANSION need to be higher.  There's no other way to compensate for it.<br />

The problem is 1) This was THEIR screwup via itemization that they're making US pay to fix, and 2) Take a step back and look at the game for a second compared to others, even compared to other MMoRPG's, forcing people to play for 8 hours for FIVE DAYS MINIMUM, to get an upgrade that is an insignificant power upgrade.

<br />
As I mentioned, the entire point is that you are *not* forced to get this in any way, shape or form - certainly not 8 hours a day, five days a week.  If you played that much, you'd almost be assured of having maxxed AAs anyway and could get 60 more in no time.  Your logic doesn't make any sense in that regard.<br />
<br />
Additionally, as everyone knows, you do not lose AA experience in any way.  Every minute you spend getting AA is another step closer to whatever goal you may have at that point.  Therefore, you could spend 1 hour a day, 2 days a week, and still achieve the same goal that the 8 hour a day, 5 day a week guy does - it'll just take you longer.  However, if you can't or choose not to dedicate that much time to EQ, you cannot blame others for your standing.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, read the first section of my post.  &quot;Poor itemization&quot; is one of those catch phrases used all too often nowadays.  The fact remains, you are far superior in tanking with discs than any similarly equipped (or even better equipped) Knight.  If you feel like a useless class in these situations, you may be doing something wrong or are comparing yourself to much too high of an upper tier Knight.  At your own level, a Knight will not be able to compete with your equivalent HP, AAs, and Discs.<br />
<br />
Finally, no one said you had to buy the expansion.  You have no right whatsoever to blame SoE solely if you're unhappy with the AA costs for a skill they designed.  Again, if it's too much for you (to pay for the expansion/monthly costs OR for the in game costs) then don't do it.  <br />
<br />
Whatever you do though, stop acting like you're being held hostage here.  The only one pointing a gun at your head is you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
500 HP is 500 HP.  It'd take me 5 loot upgrades to get that much HP at least.  Not even worrying about DKP or whatever loot system your guild might use, you first have to wait for the items to drop which could take a while.  60 AAs, while a lot (sturdiness 4 cost is really depressing to look at), is something you can work toward without being hold up by anything else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I mentioned, the entire point is that you are *not* forced to get this in any way, shape or form - certainly not 8 hours a day, five days a week.  If you played that much, you'd almost be assured of having maxxed AAs anyway and could get 60 more in no time.  Your logic doesn't make any sense in that regard.<br />
<br />
Basiae, that was an example to illustrate the time it takes to obtain this craptacular upgrade. And yes, if I want to upgrade my hitpoints without getting gear, I AM forced to pay this. Many warriors who app to the higher guilds WILL be forced to get it, as the GoD HP AA will be a requirement to apply to the guild. Many warriors who are in guilds that aren't able to get past a certain level in the game due to being in a small guild or a non raiding guild will be FORCED to pay the AA if they want to upgrade their HP.<br />
<br />
However, if you can't or choose not to dedicate that much time to EQ, you cannot blame others for your standing.<br />
<br />
I never said I could blame Sony for the time I play per day. What I CAN blame Sony for bringing out an expansion whose AA abilities are nothing short of craptacular compared to what's come out before, AND costing a hell of a lot more on top of it. I can accept the same kind of decent AA's costing more,  I can accept much less powerful AA's that cost the same, but what I CANNOT accept is PAYING SONY for the ability to get AA's that are nothing short of crap, AND paying through the nose to get them.<br />
<br />
No, I've said it before and I'll say it again. Give me decent AA's that cost significant AA's, I'll accept that. Give me crappy AA's that cost the same, I'll accept that. But try to feed me crappy AA's PLUS make me pay through the nose for them? No, that's where I draw the line.<br />
<br />
The fact remains, you are far superior in tanking with discs than any similarly equipped (or even better equipped) Knight.<br />
<br />
That's a misleading argument. Qualifyuing that you're a better tank WITH DISCS means we're only situationally better. You know what, I can state right here and now that paladins are better tanks than we are with stun lock! That's the same kind of argument.... they're both situational. The warrior cannot maintain his discs, and the pally cannot maintain his stun lock.<br />
<br />
The truth is, warriors are better in mitigation, hybrids are better in aggro. That's what's balanced. What is NOT balanced is the fact that the relative hitpoint gap between warriors and hybrids has ben shrinking, and that needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
If you feel like a useless class in these situations, you may be doing something wrong or are comparing yourself to much too high of an upper tier Knight.<br />
<br />
I never once said or implied that I feel useless. This argument is ONLY about Sturdiness, and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Finally, no one said you had to buy the expansion.  You have no right whatsoever to blame SoE solely if you're unhappy with the AA costs for a skill they designed.<br />
<br />
You're damn right I do. I beta'd, I feedbacked repeatedly that the AA cost far too much for what it did. The fact that they didn't listen is of no big surprise.<br />
<br />
See, they're just doing what they've always done - in PoP, they gave everyone far too much, and now in GoD they're going to the other extreme, and giving far too little. It's just how they work. The fact that they never can seem to get the balance right doesn't mean I can't complain until they DO get it right.<br />
<br />
Again, if it's too much for you (to pay for the expansion/monthly costs OR for the in game costs) then don't do it.<br />
<br />
There's one word that comes to my mind for that statement. Duh. I have no plans on wasting my money on this expansion until and unless either the price drops significantly, or they actually rebalance AA costs to reflect how little the AA's actually do for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take for example Vex Thal - Some few weeks after I started a campaign to get those damned warders fixed, including posts on boards, sending off emails to CSR's, developers, the bug fixing department, Absor, as well as some management level people at SoE, as well as speaking directly to Dev's, the warder issue was reviewed and fixed.<br />
<br />
Or a post about the stun levels on procs on warrior weapons... a few weeks after a loud debate on that, some of the stun levels on some of the warrior proc imbues were upped. Symbol of the Planesmasters for example.<br />
<br />
Or my suggestion made in the War Room to scrap the text based disciplines system and replace it with a graphical interface that worked much like the spell gems, including a menu for memorizing the discs that worked much like the the maneu based spell memorization system... and converting the discs to spells so that new abilities could be added to pure melee just as they were added every expansin for casters... and included the suggestion for seperating the timers on discs. When you look at the system that's in place now, it's almost completely identical to the suggestion I made a couple months prior.<br />
<br />
I'm not nearly so arrogant to think that I was solely responsible for these changes, but surely given the timing, I made some difference for the betterment of all, for at least some of these things.</div></div><hr />

Didn't you just laugh and say that you bought it? I don't know about you, but if I'm spending money to BUY something, I want to make sure I'm getting a quality product that i'm happy with.

<br />
Actually, not at all. I guess you haven't actually read what I've been saying.<br />
<br />
I don't CARE what kind of AA's we're given. But if i'm paying for an expansion, I want either AA's that are as powerful as we were given originally and in PoP for the higher cost that we're seeing now, OR I want the AA's that add so little to us to have the same kind of cost as what's in the game now. Giving us AA's that are nothing short of shoddy, and making us pay through the nose to get them in an expansion which we have to pay to get to begin with is just utterly ridiculous. I mean, I don't mind paying more considering that AA's are easier to get now, but that's just WAY too much.<br />
<br />
In short, considering we are paying them for the expansion, and paying them the same amount we paid them for PoP, I might add, I want either:<br />
<br />
much less powerful AA's, same cost<br />
or same power AA's, but much more expensive.<br />
<br />
I DO NOT WANT:<br />
much less powerful AA's, but much more expensive.<br />
<br />
Give me one or the other, and I'm happy. <br />
<br />
It's not like what I'm asking is unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

What exactly is shitty programming or broken content about the sturdiness AA? I thought that was what this thread was about... I apologise.<br />
<br />
And just cause you dont like paying for new spell graphics, some do. In fact, those that have seen an improvement in game performance with the new graphics are most likey very pleased with them.<br />
<br />
Now, about the arrogance portion.. um... I dont give two shits about your arrogance. I am not bitching at anyone about anything. I am telling you I think some of you just cry about anything SOE does. You can be as arrogant as you want and I dont give a fuck. Have at it brother. But, if you think you are the only one entitled to post an opinion here... give me a break.<br />

<br />
That is an interesting analogy. It would help support your argument if it applied to this case however. Ya see, there was a GoD BETA test. In the beta test, level 5 of sturdiness would cost you 60 AA. In live, it cost you 60 AA. So, I payed 30 bucks to get an expansion, with a so-so AA skill that cost 60AA, and SOE delivered me an expansion with a so-so AA skill that costs 60AA.<br />
<br />
If, during the beta is cost, say 10AA, and then went live at 60... your analogy might hold water.<br />
<br />
Maybe a better analogy is...<br />
<br />
If I go to Mcdonalds, and I order the $3 buger meal, and it does not come to me as a $30 steak dinner, I am gonna be pissed<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, cuz LDoN was such a great expansion in terms of time invested for upgrades. Of course if you compare it to that it's gonna look good.&quot; <br />
<br />
Here, gonna have to pop in with some more arrogance here. Roughly 16 hours of LDoN will, on average net a group with at least some playing skill and intelligence...<br />
<br />
6 armor pieces of quality between ornate and elemental<br />
<br />
10-12 drops of Ssra level loot. Some of it even better, some of it kinda crappy. I would guess a group doing high risk that actually needs the drops would net at least 5 or 6 useable items, roughly 1 per group member.<br />
<br />
5-6 AA points<br />
<br />
Minor imp on their adventure stone<br />
<br />
So, name me one other place I can take 5 friends to, farm for 16 hours of play time and walk away with better rewards? Good luck.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if i'm paying for an expansion, I want either AA's that are as powerful as we were given originally and in PoP for the higher cost that we're seeing now, OR I want the AA's that add so little to us to have the same kind of cost as what's in the game now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Several expansions contained no AA at all. Expansion are about content. Which, from the little I have done so far in GoD is quite exciting, HARD, and rewarding. This expansion added lots of shit, not just AA. They did not have to add any AA at all. Think LDoN, LoY, Velius, Kunark.. Of at least 1 of those, most agree was a great expansion. I think 2 of them were great, and the other 2 are &quot;OK&quot;. But, when I ordered them, I knew what I was getting into basically. I did not expect more than what I seen before release.<br />
<br />
And yes, this post is sorta chaotic and unorganized. Discovered editing in this little box is more trouble then it is worth /shrug<br />

<br />
Of course if you want to charm something you can easily break 3 AA/hour I'm sure.  It seems like the charmable stuff can be snared even?  But they do summon...<br />
<br />
At any rate GoD isn't about xping in those zones.  It's about progress.  I have never gone into an instance dungeon planning on XP but usually I end up with 1 or more AAs to show for it after I'm done (fail or win, assuming not fail too badly).  Of course it's much less if you like to skip content but a reasonable clear on any dungeon will net you plenty of AA, and it's hard enough to keep you from thinking it's a grind.</div></div><hr />

yeah, main problem with Ferubi is that if you don't have a L60+ necro/sk available and you die, you're screwed.  There's a few places an sos rogue can CR you, but the roaming see sos dogs makes it very tough.  We lost a couple group members the other night and had to evac.  We had no sos rogue and no corpse summoner.  I finally logged on my old necro and got his stupid adventure stone so he could use the magus to get to GoD.  After eating a death trying to cross the Courts, I finally reached the Ferubi zone line from the coliseum where most the part was waiting... only to learn about the L60 min to zone in.  Much profanity ensued.  About 90 min. to 2 hours after some of our players died, a guild 65 necro finally got free and came over with coffins to get them.<br />
<br />
It blows.  And of course we didn't get any named.  We pulled mobs right before an intersection that led to a named and while we killed them, another group came from the other direction and took out the named. sigh.</div></div><hr />

Sturdiness will _definately_ be the next thing i buy, mobs seriously kick ass and you need all the HP you can get.<br />

This is definately not the /yawn affair that LDON dungeons are hehe, seems most of the trash mobs can potentially give you a good spanking if your cleric do not have that CH inc from 80%ish hp.</div></div><hr />

Now 10.6K is enough HP to tank him if you don't get a bad spike or you have 3 healers in a group, but then that's really not saying much.  Ironically, a monk can probably tank better than a Knight on bosses.</div></div><hr />
