<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wiped really badly to this mob...  :(   So I have a couple of questions.  <br />
<br />
Where do people like to position it?  <br />
<br />
We followed a recommendation to pull the behemoth just outside its room and corner it in that little room just past the door and right before its room.  The location has the advantage of being outside the 4k dmg area if a spider happened to get through, though it will probably add on the fight at least.  Too bad we were dumb and our raid force was in completely the wrong position.  Everyone got hammered by all of the AEs including the Silence.  sigh...<br />
<br />
Do you bother with a CH chain or just spam patch?  <br />
<br />
We had groups handling the spiders.  We're thinking now we should have started with those groups, but the moment the MB became targetable, pull all but crowd control people off the spiders and bring them to help with the behemoth so we can kill it before it kills us.<br />
<br />
With 50-60 characters or so, none of them elemental or VT geared, would we even have enough dps to take down the behemoth fast enough and be able to control the spiders?  A friend told me they tried to make sure behemoth was dead in under a minute so it wouldn't wipe them first.  I don't think we begin to have the dps to kill it that fast. <br />
<br />
Is his huge range knockback/600dd AE directional?  We intend to corner the mob, but that knockback is very disruptive of heals and can't be avoided (250' range) by getting further away.<br />
<br />
We're undecided on positioning for our next attempt, but changes planned right now include)<br />
<br />
1. Be much more careful of caster/healer position relative to the target to try to keep them out of range of the AE (all healers must have ext range items).  <br />
<br />
2. Pull most of the people off the spiders once MB becomes targetable and hope the chanters and maybe a few others can keep them away from the MBs room while we kill it.  We run the risk there of a spider getting through and wiping us, but we may have to chance it to get enough dps on the boss.<br />
<br />
3. Spam heal the tank(s) instead of using a CH chain.  We're thinking that getting even slightly out of position will cause people to get hit by the AEs, disrupting a chain badly.  If we spam heal, we have to be able to kill the target FAST, because of course it's not mana efficient.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on what else to try would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm we always fight MB right inside his room.  Don't worry about killing the spiders while killing MB, just have 1-2 enchanters mez what they cant and everyone else use full dps disciplines / lifeburn/ harmtouch whatever on MB so he dies fast.  If the fight takes more than like 1 minute you have probably lost already.  MB is a pure zerg fight, dont try and set him up with MT and CH chains and corner tanking just blast him down asap</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spam patch! Also have druids MGB SoTW and clerics MGB EE and whatever other heals you can MGB. Just go all out offensive and he should die quick. I prefer that 4 enchanters keep spiders mezzed, 1 in each corner. There's really no way to avoid the AE as it goes through walls. We've always killed him in his room and just positioned, and kept, him in the center. After he dies just have everyone run out and have an sk or monk train the gnome out and FD so everyone can hail. Usually a lot of folks will die to the AE dot, but just rez them within 10 min so they can get their flag.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
Forgot to add that I've heard of raids pulling him to zone in and killing him there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, but I'm wondering... since his Silence and elemental DoT AEs are range of 100', meaning you CAN be out of range of it and still close enough to heal your tank, why is it necessary to zerg the mob?  If you corner it, then the knockback won't bother your tank.  It seems like it should be quite possible to do without just going full dps and hoping you have enough dmg to kill him before he kills you.  <br />
<br />
I don't know though.  That's why I asked here.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By zerg I mean, send everyone in attacking full blast, nuking as hard as they can, harm toucing and everything.  If you waste 10-15 seconds getting the mob positioned and cornered that is 10-15 seconds that you could have been doing mass damage to the mob in and 10 more seconds of spiders and other adds attacking the raid group.  MB is one of those mobs that if win and kill him fast the fight seem so easy that you wonder how people could ever lose to him.  If you take too long and everyone dies from the AoE, then you think that he must be impossible to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see....<br />
<br />
MB has 7 effects total that he uses on top of normal melee. 6 of those 7 are AE's. Anyone who has enough gear to resist his AE's wouldn't be doing MB in the first place so pretty much everyone will get hit by the AE's. It's more work to corner him than it is to just run in and burn his ass down asap. The long it takes to kill the more spiders you have to mez. And someone always ends up training tin soldiers on the raid.<br />

1: Decrease Hitpoints by 2000 - don't want the MT taking too many of these, clerics will run out of mana fast as patch heals generally cost more mana than CH.<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, our guild just wiped to him also.  I think we probably could have been successful by going full bore on MB and leaving just a couple people to deal with spiders.  We had 4 groups keeping the spiders dead (which worked well, but wasted a ton of DPS).  MB got to 50% before we wiped.  The 4 groups could have made up the other 50% pretty easy.<br />
<br />
We didn't have any enchanters online, BTW.  Mezzing is definitely the way to go.  Although, I'm betting kiting would be pretty easy, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been on a ton of messy Behemoth wins and losses, and one very clean win.  I'll explain the difference on the clean win, as I saw it.<br />
<br />
In my experience, 90% of the reason raids wipe is because of the chaos that ensues when people try to run into the Behemoth room after he's awakened.  Multiple AE's, large aggro range, etc. mean that the rush into the room turns into a zerg, as Behemoth attacks the wrong people, the right people don't get heals, and the wrong people are thrown out of range.<br />
<br />
On the clean win that I was on, the main raid force was positioned in the Behemoth room IN ADVANCE, before he awakened.  As soon as the spider groups began their thing, the main force moved into position and waited (and waited).  So when Behemoth finally woke up, the tank and everyone else were already positioned properly, aggro was obtained properly, and the fight proceeded like any AE boss encounter.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a very vulnerable feeling to be standing in the danger room, next to the sleeping Behemoth, while the raid's life is in the hands of the spider groups.  But so what?  If the spider groups mess up, then your raid is borked anyway, regardless of your strategy.  Put the tank and healers in the right place BEFORE Behemoth wakes up, and you remove 90% of the chaos from the event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow Sassinak  thats a great idea. I will have to relay this to my guildleader. We are doing flaging with another guild. We made an alliance and only raid together when we flag. But our guild is getting stronger and are more of a tactics type raiding guild. We dont zerg or atleast dont try and zerg anything. I hated our behom raids with allies becuase we did the zerg fest much like back in the day when you would Zerg in on Nagafen. Your idea seems to be the best way to do it.  my only question is would you have the raid standing behind him or in the front side of him and have tank where? As I am the MT or second tank for our guild I have only done this raid 2 and we zerged with other guild. Please post a lil more on where people are to be.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
here is the how we used to kill it :<br />

CC...........................................................    CC<br />
<br />
<br />
MT used to be SK or Pal to lock aggro, probably a war can do it nowadays with incite and anger stuff, but considering the dps of behemoth on MT is really, a Pal or SK will be just fine.<br />
Clerics use short heal (SR) at 150 feets range they will just get hit by AE knockback no need ot heal them, depending on your tank gear, but assuming a 5k hp unbuff tank 4 clerics should be cool.<br />
CC team, about 3/4 people on this, put all your melee + 1 healer per CC grp in this, 4 people will be able to kill mobs as they pop.<br />
Range DPS, have them opposite corner from behemoth, they will just get hit by AE KB, so they won't take any damage.<br />
<br />
You'll need 30ish people, about 15 in CC 5 clerics 1 MT 8 or so damage dealer. Behemoth has really no HP and no DPS, even with 8 enc it will go down fast andwith 8 wiz they probably won't have time to land 3 nukes ...<br />
<br />
How to engage : set the 4 CC group, ask them to start killing spider, check for 1 mn if no spider make it through, then ask MT to go in his corner in behe room, and stay there. Have clerics make sure they are in range and target MT. Then Behemoth will become targetable, MT tag it with aggro spell, once behe on MT, he calls range dps, they come in room from opposite door and proceed on nuking it down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not much benefit to having the clerics through the wall, since the wall doesn't block the AE's.<br />
<br />
But yes, that's basically the same as the clean raid I described, we just had the clerics in the middle of the room, further from Behemoth than the melee crowd.<br />
<br />
It's amazing how few people you actually need to kill Behemoth when the fight starts cleanly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragan</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We park half the raid force on each side of the Behemoths room and start killing spiders. When he becomes targettable, the CC teams starts locking down (we use 4 teams of 2 people for this). <br />
<br />
When the CC teams are in control, ie no more spiders reach either door into Behemoth room, we call the charge. The tank engages backed by spam heals from healers, seconds later everybody goes all out DPS. It's usually over faster than you can say &quot;speedbump&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aimras</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, we usally do him with 35 - 45 depending on how many can be arsed to not ninja log out when we call a MB raid. but the raid is very simple, i can assure ya we whiped to him like 5 times prior to our win, not sure - but we had the same problems as you really.<br />
<br />
we genrally making it very easy, keep him in total center of room - put caster's at one of the doors and let them nuke through the doors (it will work 100%tly), with that positioning ya will have only a few meele's hit with AE but with casting a MGB CR before the engage it will compose it easy off. <br />
<br />
all in all, we whiped usally prior to that to stupidness of meeles pushing it out of the position we initally wanted then most just zerg'd in and whiped out flat. <br />
<br />
our first kill ended about 25 sec after engage was call'd, past kills to that usally take 15 - 30 sec not more.<br />

ok, genrally i tank MB (10500 hp / 1900AC) and i can easy heal with supernal remedy / tnarg mending myself up.<br />
<br />
if ya letting a MGB go out before engage ya're set for a good 1min, fight shouldnt last longer then that.<br />
<br />
the hardest part actually will be to let meele's not to push so much, we actually trying to &quot;round&quot; mobs arround a set point (like MT) and just turn mob arorund him, that is from us to prevent the &quot;falling into a wall&quot; with a mob, sure it doesnt work for quite a lot of bosses in upper ep's but good enough for MB and preventing him going out of LoS from Caster league.<br />
<br />
<br />
i think that will help ya to get him dead, since the cornering him in a open area where &quot;walls&quot; arent &quot;walls&quot; wioll not help ya any bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
good luck on next try!</div></div><hr />

Only need a single enchanter to handle the necessary spiders. I'll admit that if your going for the low number kill and arent well geared, bards are key. But if your using 36-40 or whatever, who cares if a couple die. But it is completely possible to own him without &quot;zerging&quot; as your strat.<br />

Find a way to mitigate each aspect of the encounter. Play with your ranges!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to AoW him just before the room in the doorway itself (or either side) are two solid corners (both within tether range so he wont warp).  The regular corners inside the room kinda suck as MB can be pushed into z axis objects causing major problems.  Basically if you have MT in 1 doorway...have him agro with furious..pull to his door corner and then have rest of raid move from other opposite door from the rear its an easy fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with the zerg proponents on this fight.  If you have 50+ people and they all go all-out dps on him, he will die in about 30 seconds tops.  Hell a weaponshield ranger could tank that long with no heals.  <br />
<br />
I have done him with 2 different guilds and the 2nd one does him a whole lot better.  What we did on him was position groups around the hallway to kill spiders.  When the MB becomes targetable, you stop killing spiders once there are none aggro in your camp and let them go back to their marching and everybody except a couple enchanters moves to the doorway, get lev and med up.  Then when you're ready to go, you pop you MGB heals, enchanters start mezzing, and everybody goes all out with damage discs.  He's usually dead before he has a chance to kill anyone.  If you're trying to 3-group him then yea you will need to work a little on positioning, but with 50+ people, by the time you got him positioned, he would have been dead if you just went full dps on him.  You're only decreasing your chances of winning by screwing around with him when he has so few hps.  We do push him toward a corner with the MT in front of him, but by the time he gets to the corner he's at half health and dropping fast.<br />

Do make sure your nukers know to nuke from melee range if they think they have any chance of getting aggro though, because ping-pong will kill you.</div></div><hr />

We have done him as an alliance. But we would like to do him just us.  So we have to get it all just right as some of you said or we could wipe easily. I had thought this guy could be done with 30-40 people and all of you have really helped with that. Thank you. Had my guildleader look at this thread. We will be trying this soon.<br />
  Thank you all for your help.</div></div><hr />

The most recent time i did it, I had one group engage MB and let the crowd control groups just stay at their corners.  The group engaging MB was myself at MT, a bard playing scales of veeshan, and 4 rogues.  Clerics healed me through the wall, went down in about 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, this might not work for everyone, the people I had doing the healing, and the rogues were all elemental+ gear.<br />
<br />
Most people just have enchanters mezz the spiders at the two doors during the fight.  That or use their ae stuns.  MB has very low hitpoints, I was alone on him to start the fight, and used furious.  Took him to 91%hp in those 12 seconds with a 56dmg 2hs.  The most frustrating part of the fight is getting the loot afterwards.  Since MB's corpse is in his room, and spiders are still coming in there, you'll need to send people in either with a bard playing DA song, or using a clerics bestow divine aura aaxp skill to get their loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't there, but my guild and allies had a large turnout and took him down last week with many, many deaths.  Unfortunately there was a misunderstanding about the gnome and people thought that once you started hailing him, it would start a timer and despawn him within a few minutes.  So they worked on getting rezzes, keeping spiders controlled while corpses were dragged around, etc.  Little did they know that the gnome would simply despawn on his own after about 6 minutes.  :(  So they got to award the loot, but no flags.  At least we know we can take him now and the next fight will go more smoothly.  <br />
<br />
People felt really stupid, but I also know they weren't the first and won't be the last raid force to drop the behemoth and not get people flagged.  We need to kill him without having nearly a total raid wipe.</div></div><hr />
