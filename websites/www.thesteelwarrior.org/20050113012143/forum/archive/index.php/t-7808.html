<br />
but thats beside the point...<br />
<br />
<br />
Tonight we had our first, partial elemental raid and did The Dust Ring in PoEarth, we didn't know what to expect but killed 2 dusty warders , about 70 of 90 mobs that spawned. then moved to a fort and had spawns to kill.<br />
<br />
Eventually after clearing the fort about 80% of the way;  Triumvirate of Soil  spawned.<br />
<br />
Rushed us, and that was that =\ we got raped, weren't expecting it. Only had like 40 people there.  So my question is, what happens next? after those 6 are killed. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to find out when these rings are up, how many different ones are there? Is there a strat guide we can get anywhere to say what is for what? Normally we get our information from trial and error but i'd like to get going on things in Elemental asap. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you'd like to help me out with a few of those answers feel free to post responses here, or PM me with them, It'd be much appreciated - Also is there any other encounters like this one that are easier for non-fire flagged guilds?~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can answer a couple of your questions but not all...<br />
<br />
The earth rings are basically always up.  The only question is whether they end with loot dropping bosses or with lootless placeholder bosses.  They produce loot once per 3 days.  The only way to know whether they are in &quot;loot mode&quot; is to track other guilds' kills of the rings, or to have a guildmate running ShowEQ.  Hypothetically, if a person was to use the latter method, then they would probably already be aware of how it shows the Earth rings, from having read the ShowEQ message boards.<br />
<br />
As for easier targets, there are several mini-mini's in Air (mostly in the 4 buildings) that drop a single half decent non-mold item every time, and they are 3-groupable, but you will probably want 40 people in order to clear the long route to reach them.  Hydrotha and Kriziik in water are two of the easiest mold droppers in the EP's in my opinion, watch for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the last Dust Warder thing is killed 3 triumverates of soil spawn, you need to have 2 offtanks and a Main assist. After about 1 minute of being engaged they turn invisible, so the only way to see them is the targetting ring...aim to kill 2 of them and do non damage to the 3rd while everyone gets rezzed up...when every one is ready, kill the 3rd and the named spawns and charges raid...depending on how EQ is feeling, at I think 90% health 3 more triumverates will spawn and charge raid, have these either strong rooted or non damage kited (cos they summon). Kill named, then kill the 3 adds...btw the named is a memblurring king, holding aggro on him is virtually impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodeus</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but killed 2 dusty warders<br />
<br />
Often more than one dusty warder is up, and EACH dusty warder you kill trigger a ring.<br />
<br />
Since you killed 2, you done 2 dust rings same time, and then got 6 triumvirates, instead of 3 normally (we done exactly same on our first dust ring :p).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only kill one Dusty Warder, like bloodeus stated above.<br />
<br />
It will explode into a buncha mobs like you said (not 90 though), kill them and the temple spawns a bunch of elementals.<br />
<br />
Kill all the initiates and 3 triumverates become active and rush the raid.  As stated above, they become invisible after a short time of fighting (imagine doing this without targeting rings, lots of hailing and 'ASSIST ME !!!' and looking for little clouds of dust).<br />
<br />
Once you kill the third one, the named rushes you.  Since you're most likely LoM from that point on, we normally AETL a la rallos zek, and run back to the zone in, have rogues recover corpses and then pull the named to us (we dont fight the ring at the zone in to start, because when you kill the triggers, mobs seem to like to spawn under the world...same with mud ring)<br />
<br />
As for tracking...theres two ways like said above.  1) Know when he last dropped loot, and wait until 3 days after that.  2) ShowEQ, or so I hear</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gratz on Elementals Froggerx.  If you want to break into Elementals and get some decent loot. I would start in PoAir.  Avatar of Wind can be done with about 32+ people and while you are in zone, you can hit a lot of mini-named and yield some really decent loot.  There is a FT 5 range item that would be great for your casters.  Also once you guys kill Sol Ro you can go into PoFire and nail the Twin Charm birds and General Druav Flamesinger for decent loot.  But beware, General has a 3k proc that if it hits you at the right time, you are a scorch mark on the deck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earth Dust ring is a good time to work your knights/chanters.  It's pretty good practice for knights NDT'ing and chanters cc'ing while the raid follows the MA around.  Key is obviously to get all the adds locked asap as the devotees mow down healers heh.<br />
<br />
Personally we would just have a knight ndt the 3rd red con with one cleric ch'ing at the fort while everyone medded up then killed and let the named charge the camp.  Do the adds not come if you kill him at the ent?  The adds in all the earth rings are pretty unpredictable which is a pain because sometimes you'll have 2 and then the next there's 20+.  Also unlike Vine the adds on Dust don't despawn when the named dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramelus</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dust is easily the hardest thing in Plane of Earth.<br />
<br />
It's mindboggling that they haven't fixed the &quot;double pop&quot; of the dusty warder after all this time.  I'm sure if it dropped loot, they'd have fixed it right away.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, it sounds like you were only truly dealing with one incarnation of the ring, since you said the Triumverates rushed you after you killed approximately 80% of the 70-90 dust devotees that spawned.<br />
<br />
What probably happened is that you killed 100% of one instance's devotees, and this triggered the triumverates to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we had Triumverates rush us and still had approx 20-30mobs left up at the fort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SolRo himself drops elemental quality loot, and is of typical EP-mini difficulty, and he's up most of the time (at least on my server).  Nothing much for warriors, but his loot is basically all DPS oriented, and will noticeably improve your guild's DPS.  A little farming goes a long way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you only took out 3 of the triumverates (or were only rushed)...but your monks were pulling roughly double the mobs, it seems (as every mob would have been stacked on itself)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elaborate on this please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What people in SEQ track are actually timers located in the northern temple.  In that same temple, there are a bunch of undead traps.  They seem to respawn at the same spawn rate as normal traps in the zone, so I think I'm going to go check that temple out soon and see what he's talking bout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What people in SEQ track are actually timers located in the northern temple.<br />
<br />
I'll elaborate a little more on that one.  What people using SEQ are tracking are MOBS, invisible mobs, that are found in the northern temple.  If these mobs are up, then the ring is down.  If the mobs aren't up, then the ring is up.<br />
<br />
Since they are actually mobs though, you can *hint* *hint* tell your pet to attack them.  The pet won't move, of course, but he will verbally respond...<br />
