<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Flowing moss mantles from the Rock ring in EarthA are pretty common, so are the haste bracers from the Mud Ring in EarthA. They are the most common raid drop haste items i can think of. <br />
<br />
There is also a haste cloak from fire called a Flame Gilded Cloak that comes from a one groupable mini named in the second field in PoFire. I think those three will prove the easiest to get haste items from the Ele's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whatever you do don't get envenomed moccassins... you'll be kicking yourself in the ass later when plate mold after plate mold drop.  Go with FMM or the bracer.  A rarer peice could be the band of swirling air but frankly for the slot,  I'd go with the bracer (you lose less stats wise compared to dual Raex bracers vs. Exquisite Phoenix Mantle / Puresteel Mantle).  I know that our time in air is quite limited (as we fookin h8 the zone), so I'm planning on either FMM or the bracer (already got nice cloak from PoF).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KAELZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mud Ring and Rock Ring are some of the first, if not the first elemental encounters we can expect to have correct?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/kick self<br />
<br />
have had emp haste boots a long time and boy do i regret ever getting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd also suggest mud bracer. You lose a few AC and like 10hp from Raex, but I love my Puresteel mantle and would be loathe to give it up for Moss. Mmmmmmmm 40ac.<br />
<br />
 Air ring will probably be more scarce really, but that's what I'm aiming for(F Yeli gloves).<br />
<br />
 And it's really not mentioned much, but MM belt is a decent compromise for haste. 125hp, semi-decent AC, and nice saves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Air ring is pretty pathetic ac, and if you lock your haste down there you're going to regret it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't think there is really an elemental haste item you won't regret later, unless you count coir belt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">FMM is probably easier to get, but might depend on server.<br />
On Terris mud ring is heavily farmed even by the time guilds and as you cannot see if ring is up its hard to get a shot on it.<br />
<br />
On another note what do you plan to upgrade your CoF with if you didnt grab something in VT already ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Air ring is 3 less AC than my earth crafted ring(45 more HP), 1 less than Dain ring(35 more HP). FMM is 15ac less than my shoulders(same HP). Bracer is 8ac less than Raex, and 10 HP(I still need a 2nd though). MM belt would be 5ac less 25hp more. So as it stands, I'd sacrifice the least by taking the ring. Of the items I have a realistic shot of getting in the relatively near future. FR event boots would be biggest AC drop I think from Raex, and rare as shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Soooo, yeah I may regret ring later, but it will be later than any of the other options that I make with the regretting=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We have gotten one air ring to date and we got into the elementals on January 6th hehe.  Dunno how it is on other servers but if it is as rare on yours as it is here, you might just want to bite the bullet and get a mudring bracer or a flowing moss mantle or a coirnav belt /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KAELZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have cloak of icy shadows in bank to replace cof.  FMM, PoE Bracer and Air Ring seem like the best options so far and BTW we killed RZ yesterday, cong us elementals and it possible to get the above.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">7/11 Mud ring bracers.<br />
<br />
4/11 Moss mantles.<br />
<br />
It's hard to go wrong with Bracers of Earthen Energy, unless you have 2 Raex Bracers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Avallach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am considering the BP o' Speed, my guild is currently farming VT to prep for elementals, very close.  <br />
<br />
I know its 20 AC less (ouch) but from what I can see the last thing I am gonna upgrade is BP anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KAELZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">lol dont remind me of BP's we have cleared VT a dozen times and have gotten ZERO breastplates of speed and ONE aten bp.  So im settling for ornate.<br />
<br />
KAELZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm personally going to stay with Silver Bracelet of Speed until time, but I was considering the nice rare Corinav belt as a possible upgrade.  I figured I would just get a time haste item and either another Raex Bracer or some sort of time bracer once we get there.<br />
<br />
Now back on subject, I would suggest either a Mantle from stone ring or a Bracer from Earth ring as well, they are both rather common and your losing minimal stats for using that slot on haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KAELZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">LMAO as luck would have it i won emp boots in a pickup raid at 3am.   Still going ot go for anotehr haste item but this was a great fix for a few months.<br />
<br />
KAELZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think we're 5 for 11 on haste rings dropping.<br />
<br />
 And BP of Speed is definately a decent option. The other negative(besides low relative AC) on it is no saves. Chest slot is generally a big time resist slot. Seru has 105 total resists. AHR has 60.  Void 40. Kizrak's 40. And of course the ubiquitous Vindi has 75. All that said, if I didn't have Seru chest I'd be looking at Speed as a definate option. Atk, off-slot Haste, decent AC, and good HP's all in one slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm going for either a flowing moss mantle or a bracer of earthen energy. Whichever I see first will be the one I get as long as I have the points! I would prefer bracer so I can get a puresteel mantle from air though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ictherus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The Bracers are definitely a great choice.  Very little sacrifice for a haste item.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Picked up the Flowing Moss Mantle last night.  We've been dropping the Bracers of Earthen Energy regularly also, but so far they are being snapped up by the clerics (go figure).  Now I have to start shopping for a decent upgrade for my ratty old Woven Shim Choker...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">About half of ours have been bought up by clerics too with their points :p. Don't feel bad. I think I'll pass on the mantle for sure and wait for the bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Since my guild still dont have elemental access I have heard poi dragon ralely drops a 41PCT neck haste item...can anyone confirm pls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>tenshinen pm5k</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">ya xanamech can drop  &gt;&gt;this&lt;&lt; (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=8785) 50 hp is weak though i remember we were 1/3 on them :P, and for haste im using cloak of the black wind i dont plan on upgrading it till time . maybe if an air ring or earth bracer ends up rotting ill pick it up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gobbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Clawed Coat of Tyro (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29457) from ST ancients isn't bad if you don't want to spend DKP or have crappy luck in VT.  Can do ancients with 2 groups or so that have alot of hands on their time, and the BPs are pretty common.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that a chain graphic?</div></div><hr />
