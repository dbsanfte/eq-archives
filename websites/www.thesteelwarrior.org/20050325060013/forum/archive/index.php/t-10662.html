<br />
Noticed it because I've been farming the stupid hunter Leisov to get my rogue chain pants, got 60 cloaks in a row in a week of farming, zero chain legs (sucks to use chain in mpg).<br />
<br />
Anyway, after yesterday's patch, I logged the rogue to scout if he was up, and I noticed that the mob density was doubled, there are now double the mob numbers on the last stretch to get to the projection. Many new static mobs in those area.<br />
<br />
Gonna make reaching those awfull camps twice as hard, and as boring.<br />
<br />
Maybe SoE thought people were having too much of an easy time to get to those trials, and figured they'd fuck the one group people with more mindless trash clearing before they can do a trial.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The all important question though...<br />
<br />
Is the &quot;no see invis&quot; safe path, still safe?  Or do a couple new mobs see past invis now  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the RS run twice yesterday, and twice there were see-invis in the way.  However, may of my guildies made the run and they were fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We ran into a see invis &quot;a Dragorn Champion&quot; otw to the north camp that we were not expecting. I don't mind them adding mobs or making some see invis, but some notice would've been nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, the path to RS is no longer safe (barring BH) anymore? Well, gee...thats just peachy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I await the less subtle hints of dropping &quot;phat lewtz&quot; like candy off 1 group new expansion mobs for the first week or so to get people to buy the expansion, then nerf it all to hell! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rigeld</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres a thread on the eqlive board saying that the see invis mobs otw to RS arent supposed to be there, and a Dev took them out on Test.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So maybe it wasn't a permanent change, hoping it isn't.<br />
<br />
Rezzed a dozen people who didn't know about the new see invis mob between zoneline and RSS....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yella</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've run to RSS many times raids (allmost daily), and other than BH, I've never ever seen a see-invis mob on the way. I don't do single group trials much these days, but those times I have been on recently have had exactly the same number of mobs they have allways had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruenorg</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can squeeze by BH even when he is up if you stick close to the wall from what I've heard.  I've never actually tried this myself but apparently you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is about a 50/50 shot.  As an FD class, I try it all the time without risk, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone whose life depends on it.</div></div><hr />

Unless BH is up can still run there just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrya Anuuazz</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I zoned into MPG from WoS and was on a usual run to CY.  I normally expect to find a See Invis as I get close to CY unless I take the long route past RS zone.  Well, I did find a See Invis, but where I found it was odd.  There was a level 70, see invis, dragorn champion just around the corner from the WoS zone in.  I wasn't expecting to find a see invis there (there's never been one there any other time I've made a run through MPG.  I thought perhaps it was trained there, but everytime someone would agro it unsuspectingly, and zone out, it would always reset to the same exact spot.  There was no way to get around it to go anywhere from the zone in... I found this peculiar.  I've never once seen a see invis anywhere even remotely close to the WoS zone in area...</div></div><hr />
