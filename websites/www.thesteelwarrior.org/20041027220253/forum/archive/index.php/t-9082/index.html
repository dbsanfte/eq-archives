<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anger 3 auged no matter what...<br />
<br />
Soulpiercer<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
<br />
For agro, of course...<br />
<br />
Can the DPS make up for agro that might be lost from procs (stun/strike, Rune 1)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well if no one has any real responce, I will let you all know what I think of Soulpiercer MH (with anger 3) and CHoS off hand (and anger 3) as an agro set up.<br />
<br />
I just have to wornder why just rune 1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The reason nobody has responded is because all of these new attuneable weapons are too new for any testing to have been done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe they're all in shock that you're thinking of using something with an effect of :<br />
<br />
Increase Absorb Damage by 27 (L16) to 55 (L21)<br />
<br />
Instead of something with a stun.<br />
<br />
Come on.  110 damage absorbed per minute.  Woo hoo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can't just look at the proc Haass--at least not from my understanding from the agro threads. Its also a main hand switch in DPS from 13/20 to 15/19--which has to be factored in.<br />
<br />
And we know almost nothing about the agro from rune--other than it can get enchanters agro. <br />
<br />
I would call it more like 165 damage absorbed per minute. Woo hoo? (Yes I agree the actaul proc effect is underwhelming--but if the agro works who cares?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sigh.<br />
<br />
Rune adds aggro because it's essentially a heal spell.  That's why chanters get fucking mulched chain casting Runes.  Rune in and of itself, once every little while, isn't going to generate aggro (Here's where all the people with their SEWS come in and say it does, but they forget the fact that their sword also deals a healthy amount of DPS aggro on it's own).  Figure out how much hate a 55 point heal makes (IE : Not a whole fucking lot).  I'll bet it's pretty close to rune I.<br />
<br />
Second of all, why are you estimating procs high?  You only have WA2, and on top of that, you're applying it to a buff proc.  You understand that all the times you proc back to back you're completely wasting the rune?  <br />
<br />
You get hit.<br />
You proc<br />
You proc again<br />
You get hit.<br />
<br />
You still only absorbed 55 points of damage, not 110.<br />
<br />
Third, what kind of crap is it to compare weapons to each other when they've got fucking anger 3 on them?  We all know that anger 3 allows you to tank with whatever piece of shit you want, so why is that any indication at all of a weapons aggro generating capabilities?  Adding an augment to a weapon only serves the purpose of making it look like it generates more aggro than it does (Look at all the tards with A3 augmented SBoD's coming here).<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, come on.  This is stuff you should know.</div></div><hr />

Basically, what Baaden said.<br />
<br />
Of course, if Brael is correct, you'd be better off with a Yeksha proc than the Anger III.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say A LOT less than Force Shock does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Because of the higher DPS it will be easier to get initial aggro at the beginning of the fight (before any procs).<br />
No idea if the DPS can make up for the high-aggro proc on a droga weapon in longer fights.<br />
If it does a Velium Gemmed weapon would be just as good as this. No proc, but slightly better ratio of 16/20 and prices for Velium Gemmed weapons are dropping fast, under 10K on my server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's where the logic train leads to, and that's where you see how ridiculous it would be.<br />
<br />
If this is better than the droga weapons, then a 16/20 would be better, and if that's better, then a Splitblade of Destruction can't be far behind!<br />
<br />
But wait....uhh, it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, here's the the way I'd figure it.<br />
Melee aggro is not going to keep you ahead of the casters forever. It might help you keep ahead of some other melee dps folks, but they have to be way way ahead of your melee hate before they jump over your incite button.<br />
So even if your melee hate production is a bit lower than someone else's at the beginning stages of a fight, you should be okay (assuming someone else is not trying to gank your aggro): your melee hate+initial arrow tag of mob (where possible)+incite+proximity aggro will tend to keep you up over a slight melee hate advantage by someone else.<br />
So you hang on until a proc. And what you want at that point is the biggest hate proc you can get.<br />
In this case, the droga.<br />
<br />
I was in Velks the other day farming velium with a shaman and a cleric. All spiders early in are DB to us, but not especially dangerous. The cleric was not too busy so she started to melee. she was using an (unaug'd) CHoS. I decided to try something: I equipt a Blade of Insanity (13/21, proc itching madness --resist debuff 5 on a bunch of stuff, minus 30 on the disease counter). In my offhand I put in Bloodguard wand of walking dead (hmmm, 16/26 procs Guard II, which doesn't seem to have much aggro at all). <br />
So, at this point, given that I have an offhand weapon, I'm doing more melee hate than the cleric. <br />
Not surprisingly, I'm holding aggro as long as neither weapon procs.<br />
If the cleric's CHoS procs before the Blade of Insanity I lose aggro, but that's a duh. The BoI would probably steal aggro from the CHoS if the situation were reversed and it proc'd first.<br />
The thing is, that if the BoI procs and then after that the ChoS procs, the cleric *still* steals the aggro.<br />
Now, this experiment is not parced and way way too short to be scientific. but I was watching the proc messages pretty carefully, and of course also who the spiders were hitting. And CHoS proc=spider instantly jumping the cleric.<br />
I needed two procs before the cleric gets one proc for me to hold aggro, period. And needing twice the procs to keep up the mob from bouncing certainly looks like you're swiming upstream against the RNG.<br />
I don't know the relative hate value of itching madness vs. rune, but for my money you have to have a pretty darn big jump in the melee hate to make up for a proc that is markedly inferior to that of the CHoS. Obviously I have no problem playing with different weapons, but I'm going with the best proc weapon I've got when the mobs are tough.<br />
And no I did not let my cleric get below 85% health, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">*Sigh* <br />
<br />
Much as it pains me (more because I grabbed a weapon that others could possible put to better use--or ended up in the bazaar) my feel from the Soulpiercer is that it is not as good on agro. <br />
<br />
I will give it a bit more time, but unslowed WoS mobs, at least, are nasty customers if you beleive cloth is armor--particularly unslowed. Since I don't like splat casters...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had a soulpericer. Sold it for 88K.... <br />
<br />
Possibly the Ax from RCoD might be nice but...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">And your point sam? SInce the thing is atuneable, you obviously didn't use it--so have no clue what the agro is like.<br />
<br />
Or you trying to make me feel good about ripping someone off for 88k?<br />
<br />
Still getting a feelf or the darned thing... so still MH and anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sam's point is that he's a retard, and he likes to take every oppurtunity to tell you how much money he has.  At the moment he has over 1.1 million platinum in his bank, but he's still a jackoff, so it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Oh, and back on topic.  At work tonite I was thinking that the only reason I would ever use a soulpiercer would be mainhand, if I was a DPS warrior on an AE raid.<br />
<br />
Since I'm never a DPS warrior, and since I don't raid, I'll let someone else get some more mileage out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I used a BBB for a while and was pretty impressed with rune3 agro, for a while I would only use it tanking cos a run of procs would get me killed using it as a DPS weapon against raid mobs.<br />
<br />
A while back I saw someone post an agro calculation they had come up with after some testing which put runes at something like 1.6*damage they absorb.  That makes rune 3 pretty decent coming in pretty close to a stun proc for agro.<br />
<br />
After the BBB I used an SEM for a while (offhand with a BoC) and the rune 2 proc did nothing for agro - most of my guild's rogues picked them up at some point and none of them ever whinged that rune 2 was pulling agro for them.  After the BBB which I found to be good agro I was really underwhelmed by Rune 2 and I would think Rune 1 would be worthless.</div></div><hr />
