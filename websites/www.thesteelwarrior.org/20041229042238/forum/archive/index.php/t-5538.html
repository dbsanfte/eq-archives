Cha song is almost never going when DI is cast - unless its mid fight - and it makes an enormous difference in the effectiveness of DI.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that caster charisma has nothing to do with it. However, I maintain it's recipient charisma when cast, not when it goes off. The thread on the cleric boards really does nothing to prove or disprove it one way or the other.<br />
<br />
What I do know is this. Our sub-100 charisma warriors generally equip steins and charisma song when they get DI cast. Obviously they unequip steins when fighting, and bards have for some time operated under the idea that it's charisma at the time of cast, not at the time of triggering. These warriors who have what would be considered very low charisma (100 or lower in most cases) at time of DI triggering have had incredible success with it firing, for months. When they aren't grouped with bards when receiving DI, the fire rate has been significantly lower. They're at the same low charisma at the time of trigger/fail, the difference being charisma at the time of cast.<br />
<br />
I know that's not what one would consider solid scientific evidence to say the least, but having repeatedly seen very favorable results for months has been good enough for me. Until I see strong evidence to suggest otherwise, I'm a believer that it's recipient DI at the time of cast, not at the time of firing.</div></div><hr />

Hola-<br />
<br />
Just to summarize then, cha works as follows with DI (please correct if this is wrong/inconsistent):<br />
<br />
-caster's cha does not matter<br />
-target's cha WHEN DI IS CAST*** decreases chance of failure as cha increases.<br />
-cleric AA converts fails into partials.<br />
-each level of cleric AA = ~1600pts healed for partial<br />
-target's and caster's cha when DI gets triggered does not matter***<br />
<br />
That sound right? Re-read the cleric thread, but there wasn't any good summary of results. Note that the above is consistent with what I've seen while MTing (base 40 cha...).<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
*** = I've seen it suggested both ways, but not enough data to support either. I typcially drop cha buffs after DI hits, and (empirically) haven't seen any drop in effectiveness. Fairly small sample size tho.</div></div><hr />
