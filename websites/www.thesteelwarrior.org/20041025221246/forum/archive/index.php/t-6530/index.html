<br />
Fan Faire Reports (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=19686.topic) <br />
<br />
Quick reply to one topic discussed at the fan faire. The words and concerns of the holy warrior have not gone unnoticed. The proposed fix for tanking Paladins in GATES will be the individual encounters will be specifically tuned to WHAT TYPE of plate class is your tank in the adventure.<br />
<br />
If you bring in a WARRIOR as your tank for Tipt for example, the mobs will reach a certain level of DPS, if your tank is a PALADIN or SHADOW KNIGHT, they will reach a lower level of DPS.<br />
<br />
Not an unreasonable solution, fixes the concerns about tanking in GoD, but sure makes a Paladin feel a whole lot less versus what we were even a month ago.<br />
<br />
(I did post a super quick summary with some generic camera phone pictures if anyone is interested on our guild website)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm, they had better be FAIR about it, if the warrior trial takes 30 min to do, then so should the paladin and SK, they shouldnt just get a retarded mob.<br />
<br />
i suggest <br />
<br />
warrior mob = high damage low hit points<br />
<br />
paladin mob = mild damage mob, alot of hit points, casts spells, moderate resists<br />
<br />
SK mob = mild damage mob, alot of hit points, doesnt cast spells, high resists<br />
<br />
or something like that, just dont go giving the paladins and SKs gimp mobs with the same loot table or there will be no reason to use a warrior (just like before melee balance part one)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What happens if a group has a warrior AND a knight?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So there's something outside of Elemental boss content where warriors are pretty much required to be the main tank and the knights raise a hissy fit. Instead of taking a lump like we did Sony bends over and makes a change to the entire expansion (you think Tipt is rough little casters?) to handicap it for the twinked oout masses in LESS than two months? Don't min me if I'm not annoyed at that.<br />
<br />
Nevermind that progression in GoD is sickening. You face mobs that hit like the wheaties eating spawn of General Reparm. Passing Ikkiniz and beyond requires heavy drugs since most of it is either bugged or just not finished. <br />
<br />
All this and WoW's beta servers are up almost as much as Sony's Live servers. /looks for more drugs<br />
<br />
Hey Sony...how about really fix the problem and not blame?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this happens, why on earth would ANYONE bring a warrior? The enc gets hit for more trying to mez. The ranger/monk can't AT at a pinch. The cleric gets hit for more on heal agro. The healers all have more healing to spend mana on. And to cap it all, the paladin can res the cleric if needed, saving a 30 minute interruption, and maybe restart.<br />
<br />
I'd add to this:<br />
If there's no cleric, lower DPS so druid can heal<br />
If there's no enc, add a zonewide manaregen AE on the VoQ line<br />
If there's no puller, make mob agro/assist radius = 0 (zonewide pacify)<br />
If there are no DPS nukers, reduce mob's AC<br />
If no DPS melees, reduce mob's resists</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sounds Great!  If you have a knight, everyone in the group gets hit for significantly less, of course if you have a knight, aggro control is a lot easier also.<br />
<br />
If you have a warrior, it's easier to steal aggro, and more deadly to the person who does.<br />
<br />
Knights get hit softer permanently.  Warriors have to disc to get the effect.  It's not like we sacrificed everything to be the top tank, so lets hand that title to knights.<br />
<br />
I truly hope that this was just an odd idea that came out at the wrong time, and not an actual plan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm hoping that's the case and Mr Brenlo can come here and explain what it is precisely, because as I read that, it's giving knights - and their groups - defensive/mitigation indirectly. And I don't think even SoE could be THAT stupid.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure the majority of active high-level guild members have all the known required single group flags. Farming loot isn't really the issue - there's one drop that I've seen in the trials I wouldn't mind having but I know there's better just down the road a piece.<br />
<br />
I would like to see SoE check the flags and guild affiliations of the top 150 Paladins and SK's before doing anything, but they won't.<br />

It also sickens me to read that thread on PoN, because there was a lot of with what we have went thru over the last 3 months, I say f*** the warriors, they deserve the nerf.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well they dont fix anything with this. The unbalance will still exist. They only fix the effect the unbalance have on the stuff we see at the moment and not the source of the unbalance which will grow and grow as stronger mobs get. If that is there answer for the knight fix. They dont know how there game work.<br />
<br />
Players are smart and will find ways arround it. Start instance with knight and replace it with warriors to make it easier etc. They will create more troubles then they will solve with this and mostly they will have it that bugged that you get lucky and get a weak version and get unlucky and get a hard version etc.<br />
<br />
And battleblade there are not even 50 top knights which done the trials when they tanked themself. I will be surprised when there are 20 paladins and 20 shadowkngihts which done all ikkniz trials with them as maintank. <br />

It doesn't matter if they tank the named boss mobs themselves. If they got flagged, then they got flagged.<br />
<br />
Are you equipped with any PoTime loot Mr. Tank? Did you MT the mob that dropped it? I thought not.<br />
<br />
There are the mobs you can tank and there are mobs you can't. The game should neither give out jet boots so puppies can run with the big dogs or make lame weak boss mobs so puppies can go &quot;Yay I tanked a boss mob!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
***Defensive has been around for 4 years. ***<br />
Nothing really has changed except the ability to start with Furious. Silly me on an Ikkinz trial I slipped and hit Defensive. Not Furious, and not Stonewall. We won. You sir have not ever at any time been a Warrior. Enjoy the pinata mobs. &quot;Yay!! You killed a moss snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess that's better than artificial Warrior muscle implants.<br />
<br />
If 50 Paladins Tanked these mobs, then they CAN be Paladin tanked and nothing anywhere says Paladins should be able to tank anything Warriors can. Not in parties of 6, 18, 54, or 72. Get a little spoiled in PoP didyas?<br />
<br />
High-level Paladins don't need the content gimped or &quot;help&quot;. I don't have any problem with sensible spellbook improvement, but both Knight Defensive and We'll Give 'Em Moss Snakes is wrong. Yas should've asked for a cheat code - Up Down Up Down Left Right Enter.<br />

Unlike you who bought aggro control for 20pp at level 9, I didn't even get a BoC until I had over 300days played. I actually fought in the EP's for quite awhile with a Blade of Strategy and camped Crystalline Silk Nets for ranged aggro.<br />
<br />
Up until the time SoE started paying some attention to Warrior aggro posts I could at least vendor recharge them. What's the first thing SoE did about Warrior aggro control when it became a hot topic again? They nerfed vendor recharging on Crystalline Silk Nets, Swollen Fungus Beast Glands, and Puppet Strings. Warriors complained forever about aggro control and SoE did next to nothing for years and when they did act, they started with nerfing our only method to reasonably keep supplied with a gimp substitute.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, there's 3 trial mobs that maybe 200 Paladins that ought to be able to MT that they have trouble with two months into the expansion. Hold all other development!! This must be fixed!!!!!<br />

<br />
According to you all the trials serve ONLY the purpose of guild progression, so why the fuck do you care if knights have an easier version. I mean you ARE just doing them to get guildmates through right? There's NO other PURPOSE to them is there? So stop whining, now you can have others help you bring ppl through.

Taragor<br />
<br />
Actually Taragor, what most warriors suggested was making the trials a challenge to the various strengths that knights have, not just gimping down a warrior version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Taragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually Taragor, what most warriors suggested was making the trials a challenge to the various strengths that knights have, not just gimping down a warrior version.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which in a way is where this leads. Clearing the trash is one thing, generally knights at this time can achieve it. The issue occurs with the named mobs.<br />
<br />
Named mobs are flagged stun immune. Which means there's nothing in my spellbook to help me mitigate dmg. Removing the immunity flag leads to having multiple classes (pal/cle/chanter) stunning the mobs and trivializing the encounter. <br />
<br />
*You'll note that 2 of the 3 classes in bracket are a MUST for these trials. <br />
<br />
In the long run though this isn't really going to help. Sure trials can be passed, but that's just trials. Open zones still won't be an option for knights vs any type of named mob. And if Uqua (and any zone after that) continues the way it is right now, knights don't even have an offtanking role anymore (this is based on what I've been told from a few high lvl paladins that I know).<br />

I'm pretty sure that this wasn't what I saw... I saw a few different crowds.<br />
<br />
The Kadah/Partha crowd &quot;I realize I'll never see this content yet it would be an outrage to me personally if knights could tank it, even if it'll never affect me in any way shape or form&quot;<br />
<br />
Another crowd was &quot;Pfft, you have one piece of unaugmented time gear, while the rest of your slots are augmented time gear, go suit up you fucking newbie&quot;<br />
<br />
Another crowd was &quot;Pfft, we're a week into the expansion... we're 2 weeks into the expansion... we're only a month into the expansion, we're only a month and a half into the expansion... we're only 2 months into the expansion.... (this can continue as long as someone can type the word &quot;only&quot; in front of whatever time interval was there).<br />
<br />
Another crowd was this:  &quot;In case you haven't seen this in the 4,769,495 other times I posted it, here's the class description.  'Warriors should be unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles'.   What I define this to mean is that if a knight can't tank it, then I can classify it as a 'most brutal battle', regardless of whether it's true or not, and also in case you get any bright ideas, unmatched shall be defined as 'The only one able to survive', not what the dictionary says, since we know that Webster was a known Paladin sympathizer and anti-warrior&quot;<br />
<br />
What MOST warriors basically wanted was to have nothing done in the face of the reality that it created a situation of imbalance, and fought bitterly against the one solution that had the LEAST impact on them, only to be 'rewarded' with a situation which is FAR worse for them since no one in their right mind wants to put themselves at unnecessary risk when they can go fight a &quot;Bosssnake&quot;.<br />

Actually Frodlin, what I was referring to was the warriors who did say they wanted the encounters changed for knights, and Taragor's twisting of that fact.  I was not referring to ALL warriors, nor do I presume to speak for all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">On the bright side, the devs did say that knights will NEVER get any form of defensive disc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not going to say defensive was a good mechanism, but, is the current idea better or worse?  I would have liked to have seen a spell that was basically a scaled down defensive with a huge mana cost.  Now, SONY may be setting a precedence of mobs instanced for your Tank - this could be bad especially if it is easier for a group to clear a trial with a knight then a warrior.  At least using a gimped defensive (or some mitigation type spell), it would be relatively easier keeping warriors as the preferred tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If all they are going to do us lower the mob DPS then this is the dumbest solution I've seen to date.  I'm one of those that Zito was referring to.  If they want to make the trials &quot;more reasonable&quot; for knights they should tailor them to the knights strengths instead.  Simply lowing the DPS of the mobs just gimps the entire thing.  <br />
<br />
I guess it's a good thing that I can't handle GoD yet or I might be a little torqued.  But this is nothing new.  Inevitably every difficult encounter gets gimped.  It's happen on every expansion.  99% of people never get to see the tough encounters in thier original form.  Look at Emperor and LI Seru.</div></div><hr />

I have seen some of the Ikkinz trials. <br />
Yes Im a low geared elemental warrior but that dosent mean a couple friends and I havent been through them. <br />
Just because I dont whine that I have died tanking them with 9300hp under defensive dosent mean I havent seen them, Just means I know I have to get better gear.<br />
<br />
Why dont you take the knight cock out of your ass, and stop being such a sellout.  I know you need to be the Johnny Cochran of EQ and defend the little man, So you can be teh ubah &quot;W1N&quot; Warrior. But dude, You change sides so often my head spins.<br />
<br />
I have seen the trials. I have tanked the trials. I never said I won any. Just that I have been there. Shut the fuck up about content this and content that, I have been there, done that. And can justify my point that knights dont need defensive. That trials are balanced and fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The proposed fix for tanking Paladins in GATES will be the individual encounters will be specifically tuned to WHAT TYPE of plate class is your tank in the adventure. <br />

This is the most f*cking stupid thing I've ever seen them propose.<br />

Also: Clerics wear plate?  Will they get the &quot;super reduced Emperor Crush&quot; level DPS tables when they tank now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">How is it possible to tune an encounter for Knight strength without reducing DPS?

Make Pixtt Annihlator snareable only by Festering Darkness (and not summon)?  <br />
<br />
No matter how you look at it, they got to drop the DPS on at least two of the key mobs, Kyv Sightsilverer and Pixtt Annihlator.  If they're going to do that, why not just let you trigger an 'easy' version of the trials that require raid access?

<br />
 And of course, the ability of a 65 Paladin to get a mini defensive could NEVER be abused, translated back to old content, or exploited into the hands of those who don't need it because THEY'RE not doing them either, right, Frod? Gimme a fucking break. In a game where I know 51 Bards who are EP flagged, it WILL be abused. And it WILL trickle down. But keep on dreamin' in your ivory tower, buddy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The very first thing I posted in that thread was that I hoped warriors would get some sort of compensation for being required to use Defensive to tank the mobs.  Whether or not that'll happen I don't know.  Its possible that the dps will be lowered, but not as much as the change created by Defensive.  So a warrior would still take less damage per swing (with Defensive in place), but a knight would have a decent chance of surviving the fight.  Note that this is entirely speculation on my part as to a possible way to keep things balanced still.<br />
<br />
There's also some confusion still over what &quot;lowered dps&quot; exactly means.  Some people have suggested that it means every mob in the instanced dungeon would have a lower dps.  I doubt it myself as I haven't heard anyone suggest that the other mobs are a problem for knights, and I would hope that the devs already take into account that Defensive is only required on the named mob.<br />
<br />
Paladins as a whole seem to be unhappy with the solution.  Some of them are clearly those who were hoping for some form of Defensive.  The others are those who are glad that a solution is in place, but wish it had been something that wasn't as obviously a band-aid, and didn't insult a knight's tanking ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">It probably isn't possible, but that's not the point.  The point is that they are basically making the Mobs easier based on the fact that you are using a Pally or SK instead of a Warrior.  The difficulty should not change based on the class.  That is called gimping the content.  If they want to go this route, they need to add an element to the encounter to make it just as difficult for Knights without the extreme melee DPS.  Knights do have other abilities and if they are going to tailor encounters for them they need to take all those abilities into account.  Knights are supposed to be complex and versatile classes.  Taking damage is only one aspect of them.  For Warriors, taking damage is the only aspect (hence the extreme DPS).  Knights should be forced to utilize thier versatility to beat it just as Warriors have to utilize thier single ability to the maximum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Taragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Goradain:<br />
<br />
Though I understand what you're saying, and do somewhat agree, there's a fundamental difference between the 2. Furious/Defensive is a guarantee. No spell in a paladins spellbook is, due to fizzles/interrupts (I'd add resists but named mobs have always been immune to stuns)<br />
<br />
<br />
Taragor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">While I can't speak for shadowknights, one of the problems that paladins are having is that their other abilities don't really help in these specific encounters.<br />
<br />
The mobs are flagged as unstunnable and too high of a level to stun (iirc), so stuns are worthless as damage mitigation and spell interruption.<br />
<br />
Root doesn't really help you tank better (i.e. you're still getting hit just as hard), and tends to break quite quickly when the rooted mob takes large amounts of damage.  In any event, root tends to be only used as a stop gap measure to delay adds since snare does largely the same thing when a mob runs at low health.<br />
<br />
Heals require you to channel through a constant beating, and the amount of damage that paladins can heal doesn't mean much against these mobs in any event.<br />
<br />
Paladins aren't exactly known for their dps even with their proc spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
A paladin's big tanking advantage comes in getting a mob's attention and holding it there (via stuns, primarily).  The rest of the versatility is useful in your ordinary encounters but not really that useful in the ones that are causing problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">No, spells are not guaranteed.  And I'm not even going to begin to suggest that nameds be stunnable (that would obviously make the encounter too easy to completely gimp).  I'm just saying I have no problem with tailoring encounters to different classes so long as the actual abilities of that class are put to the test.  In this case, it doesn't appear that they have done that and instead have chosen the easy and uncreative solution.  Spells are not a guarantee, but then again, you can recast spells.  You cannot recast a discipline.  Once it's used, it's gone for a good while.  IMO, that's where alot of the balance lies.  I would not presume to tell a high level Knight class what thier abilities are, being that I don't play one, but if they are going to tailor something to the tanks, they need to do it all the way.  This is just half-assed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">A warrior's most important discipline, however, is one that lasts the entire encounter.  So recast time isn't all that material.<br />
<br />
There are two problems here for paladins.  The first is that casting spells is difficult.  The second is that even when paladins can get a spell off, none of the spells that a paladin has are all that relevant to the encounter.  Yes, you might be able to land your quick heal as a paladin, but the damage healed doesn't mean much because of the dps your opponent is doing.<br />
<br />
Sure, a paladin has lots of utility.  But in order to actually allow a paladin to productively use any of that utility, you would have to make the encounter more paladin friendly than it is now, or than I suspect it will be after the nerf to the mob dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Eumerin, that is exactly what I said the problem is.  With the way the current encounter is all that matters is Melee mitigation.  Hence, not &quot;tailored&quot; to the Versatility that encompasses the Knight classes.  Hence, not really &quot;tailored&quot; so much as just gimped.<br />
<br />
Secondly, have you ever blown an LoH when you didn't really mean to?  Guess what, it happens with Discs, too.  I have, on occasion, accidentally blown a disc or just plain punched the wrong one.  Granted this isn't as much of an issue as not being able to cast spells (and I just have to ask, even with all the channelling AAs you still get interrupted alot or are you speaking as one who has not gotten those AAs yet?) but the point remains that spells can be cast almost an unlimited amount of times during fights whereas a disc is only good once during a fight (unless it's a really long fight).  None of this really has anything to do with the topic here, though, which is the total lack of not only creativity, but lack of sense in how they are dealing with the issue.  The bottom line is that simply lowing DPS so that another class can tank it is a shitty way of doing business.  Not only will this be exploited beyond it's intent (bet on that happening), it shows that the devs aren't willing to put much thought into a solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Kazh the Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Worst fucking idea ever.  Knights are no more happy about the proposed solution than you are.<br />
<br />
It does nothing to address issues outside these instanced trials.  Is SOE going to create a kiddie version of every encounter for knights to tank from here to eternity?  No?  Well get ready to revisit this same argument every 3 months from here to the death of EQ.  Not to mention the sense of pride I'll get from tanking the kiddie version with training wheels.  Grats knights. :(<br />
<br />
In fact, this might backfire on all you warriors who were bitching so loudly about knights getting a REDUCED version of defensive.  If the mobs hit warriors for 2500 a pop and knights for 1000, who the hell is going to do the warrior version of the trial?  If shit hits the fan under the knight version, the ranger/monk/beastlord can step up no problem at all.  Knight loses aggro a second or two?  No problem, the cleric can take a few hits.  I guess they'll have to code in kunark-level gear for the knight tankable version so there'll still be a reason to take a warrior group through the trials...<br />
<br />
Seems like a lot of wasted effort for what is really a simple class balance issue.  Non-disced knights were tanking too well compared to warriors.  Fine I won't argue you that one, grats on some well deserved upgrades.  Factor in the now-unlinked warrior disciplines, on the other hand, and you have a severe tanking imbalance.  Knights aren't even close to in the same league as warriors.  Isn't the fact that SOE wants to create TWO versions of the same content to even let knights stand a reasonable chance evidence enough of this???<br />
<br />
How about a more direct approach... figure out how well knights should tank relative to warriors under disciplines.  Give them a watered-down mitigation discipline (I've seen 25% proposed who cares the exact number isn't really the issue at this point) that scales accordingly.  Put it on a longer refresh timer.  Make the tome drop in Time or in the harder GoD trials to minimize the impact on warriors through kunark, velious, luclin, or PoP (yes there will always be bottom feeders, but this older content is already trivialized even without a knight discipline).  <br />
<br />
Wow, the issue is fixed for all content, not just these trials.  Warriors are still the best tanks by a significant but reasonable margin, as they should be.  Knights are now significantly better than non-tank chain and leather classes, as they should be.  Knights would have a legitimate chance of tanking even challenging content, though it is still significantly less risky to use a warrior tank.  That seems balanced to me, without some gimicky tank detection bullshit.<br />
<br />
In spite of what you may think, most reasonable knights don't believe we should tank equally as well as warriors (after all we have spell books), but we should at least be somewhere in the same league (a.k.a. more than a 1 round speed bump).  The main issue I see would be determining an appropriate percentage for a knight mitigation discipline to make sure there was still a significant advantage for warriors and at the same time making knights more viable tanks again.  We could bicker and argue about some arbitrary number, but play testing and tweaking in real group and raid environments would be the only real way to figure this out.  <br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe if SOE did more play testing and tweaking instead of introducing massive sweeping changes to game mechanics they could have anticipated and prevented the tanking train wreck that was on its way in GoD?<br />
<br />
Instead, grats to you warriors that wanted to keep the ability to &quot;survive the most brutal battles&quot; all to yourselves.  Good for you, you won't have to share defensive or even a watered down version with knights.  Is that some kind of moral victory?  You are now the one and only official tank for any content that matters.  Good going warriors... I guess.  You may get your wish, but if this is really SOE's &quot;fix&quot; to the problem, I'm afraid it's going to end up causing more harm than good in the long run.  And neither warriors nor knights are going to be happy about it.<br />
<br />
I know none of you warriors give a shit what a lowly shadowknight thinks, but maybe someone from SOE will accidentally read this and get a clue.  I haven't completely given up hope for EQ yet, but I'm getting really close.  :( <br />

The only times I've ever fired off LoH by accident was on players that were either out of range (casters suffering from &quot;headless chicken&quot; syndrome  ;)  )or dead before I managed to click the button.  I suppose in that way, I'm luckier than you are.  Then again, the refresh timer on Defensive isn't really that bad.

<br />
Exactly, just because it's hard for the first couple of months doesn't mean it will always be that way. Knights can tank all the way through the PoP expansion, and they should do it naturally in GoD also.

<br />
Hopefully SoE will tune the non-Warrior versions of these trials so we won't suffer from not getting groups readily where we had and should have kept a strong preference.<br />
<br />
The bad news for Knights is that spellbook effectiveness, open zone grouping, and their ability to tank adds everywhere in GoD won't be affected by the trials changes. But these wouldn't have been addressed by Knight Defensive either.<br />
<br />
Knights could have contended that they lose some tanking ability and DPS as a &quot;cost&quot; of having a spellbook and that their spellbook should allow them recover enough of these abilites to handle one group content and their raid role. It might not have worked, but at least they would have had a reasonable argument.<br />
<br />
Instead, they pinned their hopes on Knight Defensive. It reminded me of the Pied Piper. At Fan Faire alledgedly a developer stated Defensive would remain Warrior Only. Obviously PoN posters were stuned when the music stopped and they found themselves in the river.<br />
<br />
With any luck, PoN Paladins will concider Paladin appropriate solutions for their problems in the future and get some of their issues addressed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Well if the coding works a particular way (in that the instance goes off of what &quot;tank&quot; you bring, as the original post suggests) ... then what happens to the coding when you don't bring a tank?<br />
<br />
I'm sure some people would try ways to skirt the system or abuse the intent of the coding. And that, to me, would be an obvious one, since people already spend lots of time doing things the unorthodox way, or ways that weren't &quot;intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
In other words, this idea to &quot;help&quot; the plight of non-defensive warriors, could end up hurting both knights and warriors by making neither class needed in that content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">From what I've heard, the non-Warrior version is the default. Should a Warrior enter the zone in an Expedition the Wariror version is spawned. It may affect the boss mobs only.<br />
<br />
Who is capable of MTing the non-Warrior versions is up to how SoE tunes it. The closer it is to the Warrior version, the less likely a Ranger, Beastlord, of Monk will be to MT it sucessfullly. Obviously if a trial is tuned so a 6500HP Paladin can do it an 8K Monk or 2 will likely be able to handle it as well.<br />
<br />
If I were SoE (actually I'd be counting money, not posting here), I'd look at Paladins and Knights around #250 on EQRankings and make Vxed and Tipt a Challange for them. I'd then look at #150-175 or so and make Ikkinz a challange. This won't necessarily preclude other classes from sucessfully MTing this but that's a cost of making it easier.<br />

The first report of this I saw was on the sk boards (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=20969&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1)... the poster was apparently at fanfaire, and paraphrasing what s/he heard:<br />
<br />
· Knight tanking trials: Tipt and the three Ikkinz trials will be made customized to either a knight or warrior tanking them. Ranger will not be able to tank them.<br />
<br />
The way that post was worded(specifically saying warriors and knights yes, non-plate no), sounded fairly direct.  It also wouldn't be that tough to code, provided they find a way to keep people from starting a knight-level trial and swapping a warrior in.  Something like:<br />
<br />
IF (shadowknight_present=YES OR paladin_present=YES) AND warrior_present=NO<br />
THEN load_kiddie_trial<br />
ELSE load_normal_trial<br />
<br />
That keeps the difficulty level too high for a ranger/beastlord/whatever to tank, but it makes it &quot;easy enough&quot; for a knight.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it's a terrible idea... UNLESS Ikkinz post-tuning is both a) the last single-group progression step in GoD and b) every bit as tough for a knight as the current version is for a warrior.  Or if it's not needed beyond unlocking raids, and is solely for farming loot, then I wouldn't care either.  But post-tuning, if Ikkinz doesn't meet those conditions, this is nothing more than a band-aid fix that will need to be reapplied every time a progression step is designed for six people.  <br />
<br />
Warriors being the unrivaled tanks of dangerous encounters and knights being viable, if not the best, are not ideas that mutually exclude one another... and as long as one of those ideas aren't true or percieved as true, there'll be temper tantrums thrown by whichever side is &quot;weaker&quot;, and this issue will crop up again.  And again, and again, and again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Fafnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">IMO, SOE sold out warriors when they created the BER.  Clearly BER is not a substitute for a WAR, far from it - but they do have some of the utility which should have been given to warriors.  E.g. warcry, limited snares and stuns etc<br />
<br />
Someone put it that you balance &quot;power with power&quot; and &quot;utility with utility&quot;.<br />
<br />
A warrior has good power (with unlinked /disc) but very little, if any, utility.  A paladin has decent power and plenty of utility.<br />
<br />
If SOE added utility to the warrior (not that I want it particularly, I want power) then they could set about balancing the power of knights vs warriors on a level playing field.<br />
<br />
SOE just sold out and put the good warrior ideas on a new class, and one which has a pretty useless concept supporting it.<br />
<br />
Making kiddie versions of these trials is amazingly insulting to the concept of class balance and fairness.  If these trials are meant to be that hard, then get a bloody warrior to tank them and have a knight elsewhere in the group.  Do knights have to be the focal point of everything or they feel useless?  Those wave heals, emergency rez, FD pulling, back up tanking duties they have must be pretty inconsequential.  Heh, if so, why do my guildies always do these trials with a knight in the team? /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">If they reduce the dps of these mobs in any significant way for knight tanking, they must conversely reduce the mobs hps for a warrior tanking. Knights have already been tanking these with the same healing as a warrior, just with less reliable results. The fact is that the knight doesnt have his groups chances lowered significantly on certain mobs if furious happens to be down and the group doesnt have amazing dps.<br />
<br />
Well I think this is a reasonable change IF it is implemented in this manner. There must be a give and take on this or it simply swings the entire other end of the spectrum making knights the 100% preferred tank and noone wants to risk using a warrior. Balance on several fronts based on which tank is present so that you have to choose between longer but safer fights, and quicker more brutal encounters.<br />
<br />
The other balance alternative is to make the &quot;watered down&quot; version available to everyone with a choice of phrase from the NPC who gives out the trial. The difference would of course be that the easier version would drop no loot and/or less flagitems. This has the consequence that more guilds would get access to the Ikkinz raids, but I dont think that is such a big deal after the upgrades... theyre not a walk in the park anymore.</div></div><hr />

I'm a warrior and happen to be affected by this dramatically, since the adjustment I proposed would've been only available to knights who were in this area, it wouldn't affect anyone else anyhow.   If you were tackling previous content, it wouldn't affect you one bit, that's the point I've been making this entire time.   No one at your level would have it unless it was some gimp paladin or SK who was climbing down the ladder of success.<br />

Since you are CLEARLY not understanding the implications of this not being available in the rest of the game, or are just completely ignoring it, I don't know what else I can tell you other than thanks for fucking me without actually looking at the issue, I cant' tell you how much I appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

 Seeing as how we have Knights whining about addtanking in Uqua, and now that the new basis for a 'fix' to mobs that are too much for a Knight to tank is to make them easier, we can now look forward to gimpified mobs ANYWHERE a Knight proclaims it's 'too hard' or 'doesn't offer a reasonable chance of success'.

If something is only available at a given level which is extremely difficult to reach, then you've effectively prevented those who cannot do it from getting it.   <br />
<br />
I can confidently say you've been prevented from getting a Raex BP, Symbol of the Planemasters, and a DB/EoE.   What the effect of those items has on guilds doing the Bertox ring in CoD is of *zero* consequence, wouldnt' you agree?<br />
<br />
The same is true of other skills/gear which can only be acquired after a certain level of farming.   Bellow of the Mastruq has NO bearing on your play, nor do GoD dropped Ancient spells.   Why this would be any different is beyond me to understand.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see a knight discuss the implications of a Raex BP/Symbol/EoE/DB wielding warrior on Aten Ha Ra, I want to know why you woudl think the inverse would be true?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the constant gimping of mobs is a TERRIBLE way of addressing an issue that can be addressed simply and easily and *far better for warriors* by implementing a 25% mit disc for knights with reasonable drawbacks, a refresh timer, and a cost.   Look at my post on the War Room defensive thread of Kadah's, it spells it out nicely.  <br />
<br />
You are cynical enough to be able to see that this thing is just the start of a consistent gimping of mobs or encounters, whichis balanced by player mudflation before they've consumed previous content, lowering the life of the expansion... and worst of all, hurting warriors.   Anyone who thinks that this won't start in Vxed/Tipt and will start at Ikkinz trials needs to face reality.  This is a terrible, possibly the WORST &quot;fix&quot; on how it will impact warriors in EQ, and it's all because we're afraid to look at what turns out to be a pretty reasonable recommmendation that would have MINIMAL impact on warriors' play, which is WHY I have argued so strongly for it, not for the sake of the Knights, although i strongly believe they shoudl have a right to play the game and enjoy it, but primarily because it enabled that to occur with the absolute *least* effect on warriors possible.<br />
<br />
Unfortuantely it seems as though they're going to take the road that has the most dramatic effect on warriors, and we both know will eventually hurt the longetivity of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

*** Defensive is a Warrior defining ability not to be shared. In fact SoE said this at Fan Faire.***<br />
<br />
Those determined that Knights not be given Defensive looked at other alternatives including spellbok revision, Weapon Shield, etc. Knight Defensive would not have adressed Knight add tanking (Defensive is available for 3 minute periods with a 10 or 30 minute refresh) and insufficient heals.<br />
<br />
There were four clear dangers:<br />
1. Half Defensive wouldn't have proved to be enough and they'd eventually get the whole pie.<br />
<br />
2. They would get Defensive and later get other spellbook revisions that they needed and the two would stack.<br />
<br />
3. The advocates were unwilling to insist Knight Defensive could only be used in GoD. Pre-EP Paladins suggested they needed it too and suggested a lower version be sold in the EC Tunnel. Knight Defensive could have affected balance where it was not needed.<br />
<br />
4. With full equipment tranfers it would be inevitible that high level twinks and others with this capability would change servers and join lower progression guilds. With both superior equipment and half Defensive there was a real danger they would be more effective MT's than a guild's less well equipped Warriors.<br />

I am not trying to personally attack you. However I have respect for my class and didnt want to see defensive going to plate hybrids without warriors recieving soemthing in return. You didnt offer anything back to the warrior community when you sold out your defensive idea, and too this day you have failed to make any offer that most warriors would find acceptable for the core class defining skill.<br />
<br />
if you noticed I started a trade off thread in the war room, for the sole purpose of seeing what warriors would think if knights where to recieve something to the akin of defensive that warriors would recieve something as well.<br />
<br />
You say im short sighted only because I refuse to rob Peter to pay Paul. I instead would ask Paul and Peter to trade off something to the benefit of each class,. Instead of simply giving away a core ability as you seem to want.<br />
<br />
You have shown how you would make a good and balanced Plate Hybrid defensive and yet you havent showed anywhere what the trade to warriors would be for that core class ability. This is why I have oppesed your vision so to say.<br />
<br />
And for it you have called me and others short sighted, and said about content we will never see, yet failed to ask if we had indeed seen said content. it isnt that my panties are in a twist, its simply I dont want to give up my tanking ability even in a high end zone without recieveing something else even if it only worked in that zone as well, even if I had to go through the same thing as the plate hyrbids by getting the tome from time etc. <br />
<br />
Think over what I have said, and what the majority of your class brethern have said, and try and see if you can see things from our point of view, that giving away soemthing for free is bad but recieiving something in trade for it is good. <br />

I think its moot. SoE has apparently indicated Defensive will not be shared.<br />

Now if they change the trials and Warriors do come out on the short end, I do hope SoE has the decency to toss a random 50HP, 20CHA, etc. in ours and maybe something moderately useful for casters so we in fact won't be stuck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Coroq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Maybe I'm just an optimistic fool, but this sounds to me like it will work out very well IF it's done right. Yes I know, that's a big IF. Really they are going to make 4 new trials that are alternate versions of the existing trials that are given when the trial is started with no warrior (of course this begs the question: will these Expedetions be such that a warrior can never join?). Yes, if they just take the existing trial and reduce the melee damage on the 1 encounter in each trial that really hurts, that will completely ruin them.<br />
<br />
But they could make them just as challenging, only not (almost) requiring /disc defens mitigation. Why not make more mobs add at several points in the trial, and even on the killer encounter? Knights are much better tanks on normal mobs than warriors because they can get enoumous aggro quickly, help in crowd control and healing, hold aggro on a mob until it's mezzed, etc. All that makes the content much easier for a knight-tank group, so why not adjust that part of it up to compenstate?<br />
<br />
Just some ideas, the point is that these 4 trials will (IF done right) go from being warrior preferred to any war/pal/sk taken with equal confidence, which will help guilds get through these trials from a player availability standpoint without gimping them one bit. Also, defensive-like ability, the major thing we get for giving up the Knight's spellbook, will not be given out to other classes thus rendering warriors useless. Sounds like good news to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Kadah,<br />
<br />
I apologize for coming off brash, I get that way sometimes when something is really really obvious to me, and it wasn't personal to you per se, I get really pissy when I lay out something that I've put a lot of effort into thinking about and consideration of the ramifications, and it's met with glib responses.  Not ones such as your and Partha's more recent ones, but previous ones such as &quot;Give me their spellbook&quot; and other such stuff.   <br />
<br />
He'll, if I thought for a minute that someone was being serious about &quot;what would we get as a result&quot; and was asking for somthing more or less reasonable and balanceable, I probably could sell it to the Paladin and SK communities as long as it doesnt' represent a direct threat to their roles.<br />
<br />
It seemed pretty clear to me that the *primary* concerns were twofold.  First being that really, warriors kind of were enjoying their moment &quot;in the sun&quot; in these trials, and in the back of our minds we kind of hoped SoE had actually made something that we would be the clear &quot;best&quot; in that wasn't big dumb raid mob_01.  The other concerns wer clearly valid, which is &quot;Well, I'm not at that content yet, but man, if Holyroller, the Paladin in my guild got a hold of this, he'd rub it in my face and try to tank raid mobs ahead of me and I would have a hard time justifying it&quot;.   <br />
<br />
This is why I have been so strict on &quot;Where&quot; it would come from, because the KEY to this whole thing to remain balanced is for it not to commonly filter down to pre-time content where it WOULD directly affect warrior tanking.   I'm not talking about a remote thing like some Pally selling his toon, and the new owner paying for a server transfer to some other server where he'd join some lower end guild, that such a remote chance that it'd be dumb to think about, I mean seriously, the Paladin in time gear able to complete these things would already be a better tank even without defensive, so it wouldn't matter.  Im talking about real world... is Joe Holyblower or Dave Devilschild gonna get this and tank Magma instead of me issues, and I want to do everything to PREVENT that, because I FIRMLY believe that it doesn't belong on knights that don't need it to survive.   <br />
<br />
The problems with &quot;content changes&quot; IN PARTICULAR the one described by Sony is that it lowers the bar.... it means Dave Devilschild with 9300hp can tank these.... but you with 9300 CANT because you're facing a beast that's tremendously more difficult.    I also fear that it'll affect Vxed and Tipt, areas that DO NOT NEED TO BE CHANGED.   I don't think it's reasonable for every joe blow to be mulling around KodTaz because they could round up a knight and make it easy for themselves.    <br />
<br />
The beauty of my proposal was that they had to rough it through those areas, and they had to have a warrior along to enable them to gain what they needed, and when they DID get it, they were still not as good as us, by a noticeable margin.  It also kept the need for progression at the high bar, and most of all, it didn't change the dynamic to make knights preferable in really ANY situation like this did.   It made knights acceptable without making them the tank of choice.  I'm afraid that this method makes them the tank of choice.   A lot of people thought that I was taking this position and ignoring the needs of warriors, but that's not the case at all, I was taking the position I was to PROTECT warriors from something just like this happenning.    <br />
<br />
Now, here's the thing:    A lot of warriors said &quot;Well, if they get a mini defensive then i shoudl get X&quot;, when clearly those things were pretty overpowered, but look at what COULD be done.<br />
<br />
The two big strengths that the knights have is burst healing and burst damage in LoH and HT.   <br />
<br />
We have 2 ways of doing similar things.....but over time<br />
<br />
Healing will and Fellstrike<br />
<br />
It would be easy to go &quot;Well, I'd be willing to accept this with 2 upgrades, first, to have something that allowed me to &quot;burst&quot; healing will, in other words to make it instant and not take an icon.  I'd get the benefit of a one time refresh of instant health like a &quot;mini LoH', and then to do a similar thing with Fellstrike, your next successful hit is for some large burst amount... say 12x base weapon damage.   Now all of a sudden you have a &quot;mini harmtouch&quot;.     In both instances they'd disable the disc for the appropriate amount of time, but that wouldn't be completely unreasonable in my view, and I bet knights would be willing to accept that in exchange for a scaleable 25% mit mod under the terms and conditions I previously described.    <br />
<br />
All this would do would be to instantize skills that warriors already posess, but it would be pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Things along those lines I bet wouldn't be too hard to sell to the EQ community, and we wouldn't have had to deal with this garbage that we're dealing with.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't happy cause we'll be in essence the most dangerous tank<br />
<br />
Knights aren't happy because it doesn't address their real and valid tanking concerns throughout GoD, also because they feel like they're riding the &quot;kiddie rides&quot; and I know that if I get any crap from any knight, the first thing out of my mouth is &quot;Looking for man's Ikkinz trial, not the girly version&quot;.<br />
<br />
The current solution doesn't make anyone happy, AND it sets a bad precedent.   The other solution makes a LOT of people happy and it does address it insofar as it can be addressed without hurting warriors, and THAT is my goal, to try to strike a balance.   It's clear to me that SoE intends knights to be tanks in GoD including Ikk trials, but they're on the verge of making a HUGE mistake that will cost warriors DEARLY.    I dont see why not fix the whole problem in one easy sweep.    <br />
<br />
What holds SoE back is seeing how completely opposed warriors have been to allowing knights to gain what has been considered a &quot;core warrior skill&quot;, and I truly understand those concerns, I really do.  I just can't for the life of me find the threat in it, particularly with so many other great benefits to being a warrior, in particular the unlinking of furious with defensive.... even with a 25% mit disc, knights arent even gona come CLOSE to being able to match it, and that is GOOD for the game, they'd be able to succeed without trampling us.</div></div><hr />

I resent SoE for proposing making a kiddy ride for Knights.<br />
<br />
Knights should tank worse than warriors.  They picked their class knowing this would happen.<br />
<br />
I don't care that they would like to pass off their spellbook as useless, I think the spells in them are damned useful.<br />
<br />
I am a 9k buffed warrior that spent pretty much the whole time of PoP until GoD LFG.  I got 20 AA while PoP was out.  I got 92 AA since Incite.  I still stuck ass (No sturdiness and only WA1) but I see a light at the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
This whole deal where SoE seems willing to do ANYTHING to make Knights happy makes me think I have wasted the several years in EQ, because I think I am going to get screwed in the near future because there is no fix to this problem.  At least no fix that involves making the mobs hit for less, making a spell for knights to mitigate better, giving them any mitigation ability, or anything of the like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It solves no problems.<br />
<br />
But I don't particularly mind if they make the trials &quot;easier&quot; to do by other tanks, provided there is also a tradeoff.  If so, imo they should just make it so that you can spawn the &quot;lower DPS&quot; version regardless of who you have tanking it.  Make the lower DPS version have mobs with twice the hps or much higher AC... then see how you like it.  You can say &quot;Well, we can do the low DPS version with a paladin tank, but OMG... it's gonna take 10 hours!&quot;.  You could, of course, also do the lower DPS version with a warrior... but at the same time cost.</div></div><hr />

Retune the DESIGN of the actual &quot;flagging&quot; process.<br />
<br />
Create a new Full Raid Encounter that is challenging, fun and rewarding, and have that content be the way a guild can get through this stage. Make these trials something else ... with rewards, but no flags. Some other kind of reward or sonmething, along with the loot.<br />
<br />
That way, the issue of knights being bottlenecked out by content that absolutely requires a warrior becomes null and void, as your guild's entire raid force can attend. I don't recall anyone being really bitchy that Rallos Zek the Warlord REQUIRED a warrior tank when people were going through the bottleneck of getting Elemental Flagged way back when.<br />

I dunno. It's just an idea. But it seems to me that the design of Gates of Discord, as a whole, is just filled with these little frustrations that they are throwing at people.</div></div><hr />

Which is why this horrible &quot;fix&quot;... you still just don't get it because you refuse to actually engage in brain wave activity past that closed door in your brain that automatically says &quot;A mit disc is bad, everything else is good&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once you get rid of preconceived notions, and accept the reality that SoE wants knights to be tanks in GoD, you'll start to understand that a 25% mit mod disc as outlined above is the best possible solution FOR WARRIORS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">SoE has read 70+ pages of discussion of this topic. They've said what they intend to do.<br />
<br />
I personally think Knights would be better served by spellbook revision and then an examination of their mitigation needs given the types of tank SoE wants them to be. Paladins in particular seem to believe they need improved combat healing and better avoidence of spell interrupts. Such things could help them to be able to assist with their own survival in trials, open zone grouping, their raid add tanking role, and raid combat healer role.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't well served when Knights do not have separate roles and the means by which they can perform them. When players focus on them exclusively as Tanks then they will expect to tank as closely as possible to Warriors. When players focus on them as Tank/priests and Tank/necro it's clear that their role and the Warrior role diverge outside of normal experince groups.<br />
<br />
While I'm disapointed for Knights that their issues will be differed by SoE's approach, I am very happy that the Defensive solution was rejected. We don't need three Tanks in three flavors. The game needs Primary Tanks, Tank/priests, and Tank/necros.<br />
<br />
Yes, Knights should be able to tank - in normal experiance groups, a limited set of one group named mobs as they benefit from drops in an expansion, raid adds, and depending of their ability to obtain end expansion equipment raid boss mobs that have become trivial.<br />
<br />
I'm not all that happy about SoE's solution, but not for the phony reason that Warriors will be /lfg - SoE can adjust the trials so that Warriors and Knights will have very simular success/failure rates. I'm disappointed that it doesn't address Knight spellbook and raid add tanking issues and dispose of their belief that they need to tank as much as possible like Warriors to be a viable class.<br />

 Actually, sirrah, I have not been prevented from getting anything that a level 65 can get. I have chosen NOT TO PURSUE those items. There IS a difference.<br />
<br />
 If you make a Knight Defensive that can only be gotten off a drop in, say, Ikkinz, and link it to a turn in in PoTime, IT WOULD STILL BE ABUSABLE. Any drop that can be MQ'd, any place that's not physically blocked off from being reached, these things can be worked around. Remember people selling spots on PoJ trials and MQ's of the alternate flags? But yeah, continue to assume that you can lock it behind a door and keep it from the 'unworthy'.

A warrior might manage it with defensive but there is *NOTHING* *NADA* *ZIP* *ZILCH* either in our spellbook or in our disciplines that will lessen a spike whatsoever.. Mob quads and lands all 4 rounds .. we're down to 1k hp .. if he procs more than once during that quad .. or god forbid it flurries? we're dead .. not one thing we can do about it.<br />
So If i'm reading the above statement right .. you're saying our odds don't decrease which is partially true .. if there were any odds to mention...<br />

If you had actually read my post youd see that I was commenting on these trials should this change take place, not how they are currently. Take the time to read something before making an ass of yourself in response.</div></div><hr />

As to this idiotic stupidity of a fix...<br />
<br />
You DO realize that once the zone is created, it cannot be fixed.<br />
You DO realize you can, and will still be able to dzadd and dzremove players from said expedition<br />
You DO realize that this is INFINITELY broken, as you simply have a knight in the group, get the trial, drop the knight, add a warrior... and the game cannot compensate.<br />
<br />
They cannot remove single groups from the dz engine, they cannot change the zone once the expedition is created and mobs are spawned.<br />
<br />
<br />
This idea is beyond absurd.<br />
<br />
All it shows is thet the Dev's really dont have a clue as to what they are doing.  Its finally reached a new low. <br />
<br />
This idiotic piece of shit idea better not even see the light of day (mainly as it fails to address the issue of knights in every other zone in GoD, which are also confirmed to be &quot;able to be tanked by knights&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Barraind,<br />
<br />
You dodged the question. Did Knights MT the mobs that dropped the PoTime loot you wear? Very well equipped Knights can and do MT named boss mobs, but they have always (at least since Kunark) lagged behind Warriors conciderably when tanking high DI boss mobs that don't use special means to insure Warriors don't tank them well. In PoTime there are two such boss mobs that fear - IMO Paladins ought to be prefered to tank these.<br />
<br />
Did you realize that SoE absolutely can do what they say they can do? They do all of this stuff when you chose an LDoN Hard or Normal adventure and Collect, Assassinate, or Rescue. In this case they are making that selection for you in a manner that they will insure works, has equal group success%, and solves the issues they have elected to solve in the manner they choose to solve them.<br />
<br />
You want another actual possible downside instead of another phony issue?<br />
(I've already supplied one - Warriors are the only class that can't choose to do either type of Expedition.) Even though high level Knights from high level guilds could get flagged, their failure to tell the lowbie's to stfu has likely cost their guilds the opprotunity to farm no drop spells, augs, and equipment in these zones if SoE doesn't permit you to alter your group once the expedition starts - nice going PoN posters!!<br />
<br />
Next Paladins complaint please. You don't need to supply a method to repair, we already know what that will be - &quot;Gimmie Defensive!&quot;<br />
<br />

This will give the Paladins who have reigned supreme and are having to adjust to &quot;second best tank&quot; (as it should have always been) a nice deja vu into what was once their complete dominance over the EQ PoP-Era tank role.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately you have been made to be this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Cleric - - - - - - - - - Pal - Warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
And, as a result when your ability to tank is lessened you have an identity crisis of sorts.  I am quite curious why I don't see any paladins asking for something closer to this:<br />
<br />
Cleric - - - - - Pal - - - - - Warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
with really increased buffs, heals and utility.  Are you that much married to and desirous of the tank position?</div></div><hr />

my guess.. the mobs will just have +bane warrior on them... no cheezing it by swaping in a pally or sk.</div></div><hr />

I never whined when i couldn't tank something that i was under-equipped for, and i interpret most of these complaints as being just that.<br />
<br />
That being said, if a &quot;fix&quot; does need to happen in SoE's mind, then could't they just have a SK/PAL only charm that provides a small mitigation boost?  This boost would have to have a duration/effect/and re-use time that is worse than what we wars receive, just so the preferred tank would still be wars. This charm could drop in GoD or Time or whatever, and would only function in trials so it would not create undo imbalance with events outside of trials.  Also, using other charms as examples could they be coded to not work when a war was in the zone?<br />
<br />
Just a thought. I hate the idea of giving away even a sliver of our only unique (useful) ability, but if they do decide to do it i'd at least like to have the cancer contained/limited to the trials.</div></div><hr />

Beyond that, theres no point to ever using a knight to do it, a warrior does it infinitely better. Hell, we dont use knights on inny anymore since its easier to position the tank right to assure fear isnt a problem.<br />

At this point I'm starting to favor SoE reducing the difficulty of all content in GoD by 25%. That way, they won't need special trial versions and no one will feel left out.<br />
<br />
Would that be OK with you? Or do you just want that done for Knight groups only? Oh, maybe you are one of those that wants to be a Warrior with a Spellbook. I've jumped to conclusions.<br />
<br />
Please clear it up for me.<br />
<br />
Do you favor:<br />
<br />
A. Removing Defensive from Warriors.<br />
<br />
B. Effectively giving Knights enough Defensive even if it's more than Warriors get (for most of the PoN posters, thats &quot;-18 DI&quot;) so you can tank everything a Warrior can outside of a few raid mobs on raid day while casting spells too.<br />

Okay jack asses, I will spell out for you since you are to jimminy STUPID to figure it out! It takes less than a WEEK for any PALADIN issue to get addresses because their precious little SOE shit head Paladin buddy plays one (Alan). Now, how long did it take SOE to fix taunt issues with Warriors? It took a MASSIVE threatened virtual shut down of servers to do it! <br />
PoN just sends an email to Alan for whatever they want. Thats what I am accusing you of. Let me spell it out further, as several warriors have.<br />
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PALADIN BITCH IS TO BECOME THE MOST POWERFUL TANK IN THE GAME: IE WARRIOR+SPELLBOOK! Of course you don't see anything wrong with this, cause all the ex-Necromancer and ex-kiting crap head Dr00ds now play Paladins, the cesspool of the player base.</div></div><hr />

You really think that SoE is out to make Paladins all so powerful and just screw Warriors?   Every class in the game has been at one point in time the red headed step child of EQ.  At that point every idiot that plays that class makes posts like these.  <br />
<br />
Now the entire problem with GoD has been going on since release which is far more than 1 week.   Now did SoE make a quick response to Knights and defensive?  Why yes they did because it is easy to say NO.<br />
<br />
Now did SoE make a stupid fix to GoD?  Yes.  Am I surprised NO, because they have a tendancy not to look past the tip of thier nose.  Now there does need to be a fix but making seperate trials for each class is stupid.  Lowering the DPS is a start but depending on how far the do lower it they might just want to add some stuff in.  That way it can be a challenge not just for Knights but also Warriors.  Making it so one class does not have a unfair advantage.<br />

There is one time that's not true. When I have to hit Defensive (or it's varients). So let's by all means make those ocassions as infrequent as possible so you can Tank just like me and have your priest spells as a free bonus even more of the time we both play.<br />

Shall we restrict the only Warrior advantage to raids and a couple of MT's? Is that too much? Lessee 10 boss mobs at 3 minutes each. Thirty minutes total time per guild a week. Too much? Cut it to 2 minutes?<br />

     Killa1 you need to grow up not take things so seriously.  You have a very inflated sense of self importance.  You think that other classes including Paladins have never had abilaties taken away from them because SoE made a mistake when they included it.  You think classes have never been told they are on crack for asking for something.  Well it just happened to Paladins.  SoE rightfuly told all the winners just like you that they could not have defensive.  The reason it was so fast is because it is easy to say no.  Not to mention you are complaining about something that happened back in 2002, talk about pathetic.<br />
<br />
     If you want SoE to listen to you make some constructive arguments don't make demands like a child.  SoE will never have a class Advocate for any class.  This means Warriors and even Paladins.   Warriors have gotten goodies before other class jusst like Paladins.  <br />
<br />
     Now yes I am a Paladin and I know I can be impartial with Paladin and Warrior issues.  Heck a good friend of mine plays a Warrior and it is important to me that the class he plays is considered.  That goes with friends that plays Clerics, Druids, and Rangers.  You however are clearly incapeable of making any kind of impartial decision.  After all you are still complaining about events back in 2002.<br />

Oh yeah, tell me there's not 14million posts here from warriors going *oh YEAH, well if you get MY defensive then I should get ch/loh/ht/fd/da/rez/root/etc*.  <br />

Yes, but that's not ME saying it. So quit accusing me personally of it. Replace the singular &quot;you&quot; with the group &quot;warriors&quot; and we have no problem, here. Well, except for your claim that warriors want EVERYTHING both hybrids get to give them defensive. That's just idiotic, and shows your lack of understanding.<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
I'm not painting you in a corner. I'm stating a fact. EVERYTIME there's a reply in regards to the defensive ability, MANY a warrior always say *defensive* which leads to many a post from foaming at the mouth warriors screaming that knights want to be Gods. Doesn't cut it. We're not asking for your FULL ability, we're asking for a % of it. There's a big difference in the 2 and arguing to the contrary is ridiculous.  <br />
<br />
<br />
That doesn't friggin matter one bit. The fact that you think it does shows your lack of understanding. The FACT is you're asking for defensive... basically for free... because you feel you deserve to have it. JUST like druids asked for cheal... basically for free... because they felt they deserved to have it. Difference being, there was a clear and compelling reason for druids to get it... such is not the case with paladins. Druids had this issue gamewide. They had this issue in all groups. Not just some groups in some places, but ALL groups, hunting in ALL expansions. Paladins have this issue in a very few encounters, which are ALREADY BEING FIXED.<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
I didn't mean as in *warrior* when I stated the *my* part. I meant, saying over and over that knights want *your* ability is WRONG because we're not asking for a copy of it. We're asking for a %. Again, there's a large difference.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Knights want a defensive ability.. Period. JUST like druids wanted a cheal spell. A lesser form of defensive, even called a &quot;50% defensive&quot; is STILL a defensive ability. JUST LIKE Druid 75% Cheal is still a CHeal... it's even referred to as such. IT'S THE SAME GODDAMNED THING. THE SAME KIND OF ABILITY, WITH A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF POWER/STRENGTH! In the entire time this debate has been raging, this concept has been bandied around with the label &quot;knight defensive&quot;!<br />
<br />
I can't believe you can even get this simple fact through your thick skull. Are you you always this dense, or do you have to work at it???<br />

Quote:<br />

A reason for your uberness. What a laugh. No, you've got it backward. It's that they can do that BECAUSE of their uberness. <br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
a reason why we shouldn't get anything. Here it is you are stating that your ability dates back to YEARS and thus should be considered as well OLD, but a knight soloing that same content is deemed Godly. Double standard don't you think?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Here you show yet again how you just don't get it. When I referred to Kunark, I referred to it as how the gameplay was BACK THEN. Now you're talking about how several year old content can be soloed by a single class in the PRESENT when that content has been completely trivialized through mudflation? What an absolutely ridiculous comparison.<br />

Quote:<br />
No Daemon, fact is fact. Fact is you had your disciplines unlinked. Fact is that the combination of furious and defensive is a MAJOR advantage. Fact is that you CAN and DO use your discs now without the fear of being unable to pop defensive if the need arises. THOSE are facts. It's NOT a moot point, it's a MAJOR point. And YES, it WAS a free upgrade. Sure it affected melee classes as a whole but paladins do NOT have discs worth using and arguing that we GAINED from it the way warriors do is plain stupid.  <br />
<br />
<br />
...as Taragor merrily continues on his way stating facts, and still trying to ignore all the other &quot;facts&quot; that don't support his poit of view. Like all those spells. And no, claiming that hybrids gained from it the same way warriors did is not stupid. It's fact. You know, those things you're so fond of? Let me see, were hybrids discs unlinked? Check. Can you use one without being in fear of not being able to use another? Check. Hmmm, sure sounds like you gained in the same way to me. Not nearly to the same DEGREE, of course, as I've already stated, but you have gotten a gain from it in the same way.<br />
<br />
Next thing you know, Taragor will be claiming that adding knight defensive doesn't mean hybrids gained from it the same way warriors did, showing his fundamental misunderstanding of the English language and the issues at hand. Here's a clue for you Taragor. Gaining &quot;in the same way&quot; and &quot;to the same degree&quot; do NOT mean the same thing. <br />
<br />
Typical.<br />
<br />
Here's another clue for you, Taragor. One you desperately need. The discs unlinking? That was part of of a specific process that they called melee rebalancing. In other words, there was an imbalance that existed that the dev's acknowledged, and THAT was one of the changes. The same bloody thing was with incite. It was an imbalance. It was a bug. It got fixed. THAT was why warriors got these changes, because there was a problem, and it was fixed. JUST like the encounters that were the source of this problem are getting. And guess what, Jack... it's not involving giving you defensive. Why? Because devs don't feel it needs to be done like they felt the rest of it needed to be done.<br />

Quote:<br />
In regards to my free upgrades (spells), I beg to differ. They AREN'T free. Remember the cost I paid for having a spellbook. You know. NO offensive discs. NO defensive discs. NO inate dmg mitigation. CRAPPY DPS, lower HP, lower AC<br />
<br />
Again, we're discussing FREE upgrades. FREE upgrades come at NO cost. The COST for me to receive spells with each expansion means I do LESS dmg than you, I have LESS ac then you, I have LESS hp than you, I have LESS dmg mitigation than you, I have no discs compared to you. Need I go on?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Heh. Wrong. You paid NO price in lowering of capabilities to get these new and more powerful spells. Instead, it was the CHOICE YOU MADE when you created your character, that you would be able to cost this spell, and that spell. AFTER you made that decision, you got more powerful spells at no cost. That &quot;cost I paid&quot; doesn't match the definition used in this thread. Nice try.<br />
<br />
By your logic, if warriors get an upgraded defensive like paladins have gotten upgraded spells, they've already paid the price for a better defensive because that was the cost we paid for not having a spellbook, so that's all fine, right? Haha, yeah, right. You've be all over that screaming &quot;overpowered&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; in a heartbeat. Funny how your arguments are only valid if they benefit you, isn't it?<br />

Quote:<br />
An imbalance that existed since the beginning of the game? WTF do you think the Kunark era was? THAT was an imbalance.

<br />
<br />
Oh, here we go. &quot;OMG Kunark!!!!&quot; from the Paladin.<br />
<br />
Quit yer whining about ancient history. You like facts? How about this one... The FACT is, warriors had the aggro issue since the beginning of the game. The FACT is, hybrids were fixed and rose to dominance while warriors STILL had the same issue. The FACT is, YOUR problem was fixed FAR before ours was.

Jesus, arguing with you is like arguing with a retarded chimpanzee. IN case you just haven't &quot;gotten it&quot; yet, which is certainly not surprising, when I talk about hybrids getting defensive, I'm NOT TALKING ABOUT hybrids getting a defensive that's just as powerful as what warriors have, and the even if I did, it doesn't affect the point I was trying to make.</div></div><hr />

The FACT is you're asking for defensive... basically for free... because you feel you deserve to have it. JUST like druids asked for cheal... basically for free... because they felt they deserved to have it. Difference being, there was a clear and compelling reason for druids to get it... such is not the case with paladins. Druids had this issue gamewide. They had this issue in all groups. Not just some groups in some places, but ALL groups, hunting in ALL expansions. Paladins have this issue in a very few encounters, which are ALREADY BEING FIXED.<br />
<br />
Let me break this down for you. Druids at all levels did not suffer from the problems of the minority. Hell, not even every druid at the top levels did.  The druids who knew exactly what their class could do were holding their own even pre upgrade.  Why were druids retuned? Because they lacked a viable, significant raid role at the upper end, where what they added to a raid, outside of a single buff line, was worth absolute shit in the grand scope of things.<br />
<br />
Notice, change &quot;druid&quot; to &quot;knight&quot; and change &quot;then&quot; and &quot;now&quot; and you have the exact same situation.  Knights are fine on lower level raids, where their spellbook can actually do something to those mobs.  That usefulness diminishes greatly after luclin and stops cold in GoD.<br />
<br />
And no, the trials (of which i assume you mean by &quot;those situations&quot; which is not even half the zones knights have major issues in) are not getting tweaked... they are already exploring other options.<br />
<br />
I cant think of a much more &quot;clear and compelling&quot; reason to fix a classtype (knights) when they are in that situation in GoD.  Not all knights have major problems in this expansion. ALL knights have serious problems however.  As we learned with druid fixes, warrior fixes, and so on, the upper-end game is not balanced around those in the top 5% who CAN do their job, its based around the top 5% who CANNOT (it might be closert to 7.5 - 10%, but it really is all the same)<br />
<br />
<br />
A reason for your uberness. What a laugh. No, you've got it backward. It's that they can do that BECAUSE of their uberness.<br />
<br />
I guess that makes clerics and warriors &quot;uber&quot; too, because I sure as hell have watched both those classes solo dragons (cleric vs gore was a 35 minute fight, and really boring to watch).  Was close to forgetting Druid, Bard, Shaman, Necromancer, Beastlord, Monk, Wizard, Magician, Enchanter... well, you surely get the idea by now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh. Wrong. You paid NO price in lowering of capabilities to get these new and more powerful spells. Instead, it was the CHOICE YOU MADE when you created your character, that you would be able to cost this spell, and that spell. AFTER you made that decision, you got more powerful spells at no cost. That &quot;cost I paid&quot; doesn't match the definition used in this thread. Nice try.<br />
<br />
I love the &quot;choice you made when you made your character omgz!!&quot; argument.  Not only does it hold no water, as every class in eq has seen massive changes since the majority of us created our characters, its an admission that you have no intelligent response to the statement you are responding to.  Are you aware of what a paladin is compared to a warrior in other RPG's? Are you aware most people had nothing to go by when they created their characters besides the description of the classes and what those classes had been like in other games?<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I wasnt &quot;aware&quot; i was making sacrifices of not being able to tank current content when I made my character.  Probably because I wasn't...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Funny you should say that. How many times do warriors bring up knights soloing kunark dragons as a reason for our uberness <br />
<br />
Eh, just a quick note.  Warriors have solo'd them also.  Soloing old shit is nothing, and not of importance in balancing classes in the current game (especially when we're talking about high end troubles).<br />
<br />
that a warrior hasnt said &quot;omg's i n33d that 2 tank if they get defenzif!!!1!one!!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Actually usually that is sarcastic because many knights do tend to downplay their spell books in these arguements.  Also, if you take away our last class defining ability, I think we deserve to get a new one.  Every class should have at least one class defining ability.<br />
<br />
That usefulness diminishes greatly after luclin and stops cold in GoD <br />
<br />
Like I said, knights tend to downplay their spell book.  It is still useful in GoD actually.  Fast casting patch heals are more useful than people let on.  Used a pally instead of a shaman for secondary heals while doing an Ikkinz named, and it went just as well.  Plus he had LoH in case of a bad couple rounds.  While the amount of usefulness has gone down on most pally spells, I'd hardly say they are useless.<br />
<br />
That said, I am for balancing things for knights a bit better where needed.  My main opinion is hope that SOE doesn't screw things up and make it so warriors are in a bad spot instead, and a wish that if knights do recieve a watered down defensive, that we recieve something that could count as a class defining ability.  Having few things special does get disheartening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Annoc Starshield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">You are the one that needs to grow up. The entire Paladin bitch is all about being number 1 tank again and screwing the warriors/SKs out of the most contested group spot, tank. You are NOT impartial, I and the rest of Warriors DEMAND an outside group look at the issue. You wouldn't like that, I know exactly what they would say:<br />
<br />
Greedy Paladins attempting to become Warrior+spellbook=just a cheap attempt at becoming #1 tank. So how about this, PALADIN, get the fuck off the Warrior board with your bullshit! YOUR board PoN has shown REPEATIDLY why the Paladin is the new class of the whining BABIES (not warriors) with banning of anyone who doesn't toe the line with becoming &quot;god&quot; mode play!<br />
<br />
The &quot;fairness&quot; of the Paladins would be shown, go ahead I fucking dare you, post just ONE post on the PoN board against the &quot;toed line&quot;, you will be banned. Fuckin whining baby class of EQ now! Here is the answer:<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, tell me there's not 14million posts here from warriors going *oh YEAH, well if you get MY defensive then I should get ch/loh/ht/fd/da/rez/root/etc*.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahh so we are complaining  about number  one tank again jsut so we can take the spot away for m SK's and Warriors.   Well when it comes to most of EQ any tank will do.  However when it comes to the single group GoD trials you need a Warrior.   Doesn't spound like we are compeating for anything there.   You sound sound like a Politicion or a Burecrat talking about this outside third party stuff so give it a rest SoE is the third party.   I think SoE will basicly tell you to take that DEMAND part and stick it where the sun don't shine.   After all they never have taken that type of attitude very well.<br />
<br />
Now as to getting banned on PoN.  Easiest way to do that is use the language you are using here.  Warriors have come there and disagreed along with Paladins.  Most of the Paladins who disagreed are in a sitation similar to mine.  We are in or past Time and see that the problem is not with the Class but with the Mobs in question.  If you ead about how they fixed this you will see SoE agreed with us even though they did not implement it very well.<br />
<br />
And yes I am impartial.  I have probley sat down with Warriros and discussed how they needed to be fixed in regards to taunt and your Disc far more than you  have.  When a friend of mine that I see on regular basis sits down and calmly talks to me about his problems with a game I tend to listen and belive him.  I tend to get highly offended whn people say or imply that I don't take his concerns seriously.  After all Aesir is a far better Warrior than you will ever be.<br />

Fear an impartial outside look?  Why the hell would anyone fear that.  I have seen plenty of warrior's post both here and on PoN that something needs to be done in GoD+ to balance knights.  You may not wish to acknowlege it, but there is a problem.  Giving knights defensive is not the answer - but then again neither is instancing content for the type of tank.<br />

Ignoring everything else he said, this one's true. It took PoN under 48 hours to get clerics' 35dps summoned hammer proc rate nerfed when it was first introduced. SoE stealth-returned the original proc rate, but at a higher level. PoN didn't press for another nerf, but the one they did cause is known as &quot;The Fastest Nerf in History&quot; over at EQCleric.<br />
<br />
Knights want a defensive ability.. Period. JUST like druids wanted a cheal spell. A lesser form of defensive, even called a &quot;50% defensive&quot; is STILL a defensive ability. JUST LIKE Druid 75% Cheal is still a CHeal... it's even referred to as such. IT'S THE SAME GODDAMNED THING. THE SAME KIND OF ABILITY, WITH A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF POWER/STRENGTH! In the entire time this debate has been raging, this concept has been bandied around with the label &quot;knight defensive&quot;!<br />
<br />
I've been trying to stay neutral over Knight Defensive since I'm sympathetic to Warriors' issues with their respective generalist classes, but seriously, not only did the Clue-Train miss your stop today, you just got hit by it. By admitting that SoE farmed clerics' biggest defining role (at the time) out to its generalist class, at a different level of strength, your entire argument hypocrisizes itself, since SoE set a precedent. Here, I'll go a little slower for you:<br />
<br />
Druids are a generalist priest class. Clerics are the specialist priest class. Clerics have CH. Druids wanted a CH ripoff. They whined, and they whined, and they whined, and during Priest Rebalancing Part 2, in Luclin/early PoP, they got a CH ripoff; 62.5% of a real CH, that healed up to 75% of the target's max HP. Viably, a full CH for PoP groups (since as tough as early PoP groups were sometimes at level 61 in luclin gear, heals didn't usually land in xp groups under 25% very often), and about half a CH on raids. What did druids give up for this? Not a damn thing. What did clerics get? A weak hammer that was nerfed to be even weaker thanks to paladins, and an extension of the yaulp line.<br />
<br />
Woo Woo! Here comes the Clue-Train again, try to catch it this time -<br />
<br />
Paladins are a generalist tank class. Warriors are the specialist tank class. Warriors have Defensive. Paladins want a Defensive ripoff. They whined, and they whined, and they whined, and during Melee Rebalancing Part 2...<br />
<br />
I'm against Mini-Defensive for Knights, but the precedent is there. I'd prefer to see their immense mana pools (a Time knight can easily have more HP than an elemental warrior, and more mana than an elemental cleric at the same time) go to use in a combination of Vie and Diablo's Mana Shield. Knight casts a short-duration self-only buff (5 minutes at the absolute max) that mitigates 20 or so percent melee damage, but half of that mitigated damage goes to their mana instead. A knight with 6k mana can use it as a mini-defensive to mitigate 12000 damage. That 6k mana would last 60000 damage (72k minus the mitigated 12k). A Knight with 4k mana could mitigate 8k damage, lasting 40k. Vie at its best only mitigates 1600, and lasts 14400 before it fades. This uses a knight's mana for the same thing warriors use endurance for, but it's finite, shouldn't last 3 minutes if the knight is fighting something appropriate for their gear, it scales with content, and isn't close to Warriors' 55% mitigation under defensive. The knight can't hold aggro once the mitigation fades, since they'll have no mana? Have the foresight to click off the fucking buff before you totally run out. It's not like Cease/Fear cost much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>killa1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">If you weren't so utterly clueless you would realize I was and still am against Druids having mini-CH. I don't give a rats ass there is precedence for ripping off another class abilities. Warriors will NOT stand for it, or they WILL give us a Knight ability WE choose (or several). If you weren't so utterly without a clue, you would realize the Clerics WERE given stuff to compensate for it, ie their hammer and several spells, and Clerics STILL draw WAY less aggro healing than a Druid.<br />
Knights can take a big flying leap over ripping off Warriors defensive.<br />
In fact what they can do, is completely unhook our disc timers, then have our endurance pool determine disc use time. Then they can give say, Shaman, a spell EXACTLY like KEI, that refreshes it for 3.5 hours. Then we can become DPS monsters with aggro control. Giving the whining pussy Knights, defensive type abilities is okay, because we were compensated for it.<br />
<br />
P.S. The Knights posting have shown they are the idiots (their favorite word to throw at anyone who disagrees with them) with their poor grammer and total inability to spell. Clerics btw, will lose their monopoly on the slot as healer too in the GoD trials, go ahead and side with Knights, we'll push that also! I have 4 votes to your 1 btw, I pay for 4 accounts.

<br />
Guys, Warriors know Paladins have friends at SoE. We don't expect three different Tank classes -<br />
<br />
a Primary Tank that is most effective vs. named high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
a Tank/priest that can MT everything except for the hardest known mobs in the game while keeping their party strong and healthy.<br />
<br />
a Tank/necro that can MT everything except for the hardest known mobs in the game, does terrible things to the mob weakening it and wreaking havoc on it's ability to survive.<br />
<br />
We are expecting that Paladins will be transformed into Warriors with Spellbooks for all content except a small handful encountered on raid day. Then the Warrior pet class can log in, do it's MTing job, and log out for the week. It's been that way for years.<br />
<br />
SK's? Hahahahaha. If your Epic, nerfs, and consistant ignoring of your issues hasn't convinced you that SK's don't have a guardian angel looking out for your intrests at SoE than nothing will. If you get anything at all it will be because to do otherwise would be too obvious.<br />

<br />
That's right. EITHER class. not both. Just drop it, you're not going to be able to make the point you want to with this one, and I don't want to waste the time explaining the point I made to someone else.<br />
<br />
Why were druids retuned? Because they lacked a viable, significant raid role at the upper end, where what they added to a raid, outside of a single buff line, was worth absolute shit in the grand scope of things.<br />
<br />
Incorrect... or rather only partially correct. They were also returned because they were lacking a in the healing role subset in EXP groups. Druids were not taken as healers in groups, either. They had very little healing and nuking role. Need a healer? Cleric. Need a nuker? get a mage or wizard. They had no real valid role in raids OR in groups. That was the biggest reason.<br />
<br />
Notice, change &quot;druid&quot; to &quot;knight&quot; and change &quot;then&quot; and &quot;now&quot; and you have the exact same situation.  Knights are fine on lower level raids, where their spellbook can actually do something to those mobs.  That usefulness diminishes greatly after luclin and stops cold in GoD.<br />
<br />
This is a flawed argument, because it was based on a flawed assumption as to why they were given CHeal.<br />
<br />
And no, the trials (of which i assume you mean by &quot;those situations&quot; which is not even half the zones knights have major issues in) are not getting tweaked... they are already exploring other options.<br />
<br />
According to the last dev statement, they are getting tweaked. Unless you have a dev statement where they decided not to do that, I'm going to take Sony's official word over the word of just another player.<br />
<br />
I cant think of a much more &quot;clear and compelling&quot; reason to fix a classtype (knights) when they are in that situation in GoD.<br />
<br />
Because they have problems in SOME encounters in one expansion? Some few encounters don't justify a fix that affectsgameplay everywhere else as well.<br />
<br />
Not all knights have major problems in this expansion. ALL knights have serious problems however.<br />
<br />
Contradictory statements. Secondly, serious problems? Too general. Serious problems in general don't mean that a mini defensive is justified. Only having serious problems in some few encounters don't justify a fix that affects gameplay across the board. Sorry.<br />
<br />
I guess that makes clerics and warriors &quot;uber&quot; too, because I sure as hell have watched both those classes solo dragons (cleric vs gore was a 35 minute fight, and really boring to watch).  Was close to forgetting Druid, Bard, Shaman, Necromancer, Beastlord, Monk, Wizard, Magician, Enchanter... well, you surely get the idea by now.<br />
<br />
What you're not mentioning is how SOON they could solo this trivial content. I heard about pals and SK's doing it long before any other class. Every class in the game can solo pre-Kunark named now, does that make them all uber? Of course not.<br />
<br />
I love the &quot;choice you made when you made your character omgz!!&quot; argument.  Not only does it hold no water, as every class in eq has seen massive changes since the majority of us created our characters,<br />
<br />
Um. No. Those massive changes mean something yes, but not as much as you would make it seem. When you chose a cleric, you chose to heal at the expense of nuking and melee power. That's OMGZ the choice you made. When you choose a warrior, you choose to specialize in melee to the exclusion of all else. That's OMGZ the choice you made.<br />
<br />
<br />
its an admission that you have no intelligent response to the statement you are responding to.<br />
<br />

Message Boards... hell, I see a &quot;thinking of making a warrior, any advice?&quot; on a weekly basis on this board alone. Don't try to feed me that bull about lack of information.<br />

<br />
As for you playing for 5 years I doubt it.  You thought bringing it up proves that you see it as an important part of this argument.  If you remember when EQ came out  Warriors did not know that they were the MA or SA.  Nobody knew exactly what thier class did and did not do.  MA roles did not come into effect untill Kunark or maybe even Velious.  Not to mention looking at your fake Magelo that I belive is your fantasy because it makes you feel like you are important to the world instead of just a person who plays a video game like the rest of us.<br />

Please tell me jow you are so certain tht you know what will happend?  Did you know SOE has already stated that they are planning on changing thetrials depending on if a Warrior is in the group or not.  Even though this is a stupid way to do things it is what they said is going to happen.  And no Warriors or any of us for that matter are so important to make sure that it does not happen.<br />

I don't give a rats ass there is precedence for ripping off another class abilities. Warriors will NOT stand for it, or they WILL give us a Knight ability WE choose (or several).

Hi. I'm telling you that this argument basically already happened in another form in the past, and the generalist class won. Druids whined that they needed a version of clerics' defining ability, CH, even though druid patch heals at the time were very close to clerics (2.6 hp/mana on Divine Light versus 2.445 hp/mana on Nature's Touch, 2.502 hp/mana on Remedy versus 2.4457 hp/mana on Chloroblast). Druids could patch heal nearly identically to clerics, and had 3 extra mana per tick regeneration absolutely free (still do). Then tougher xp zones started becoming more mainstream, like Umbral and CT towards the end of luclin, and in those places patch heals couldn't keep up. Heavy patching in CT was suicide, since when it first opened taunt didn't work there (old world mobs over level 50 were all flagged untauntable). Patch heals didn't have enough HPS (healing per second) to keep tanks alive in those harder zones, so druids started clawing for a CH.<br />
<br />
No one knew back then about the exponential increase mob damage would take in PoP, this was just druids whining for a CH ripoff so they could compete for groups in the tougher zones. They weren't willing to give up anything for it, they wanted cleric healing power + druid utility... cleric+utility, sound a little like &quot;warrior+spellbook&quot;?<br />
<br />
Clerics wouldn't stand for it either; it created a huge rift between the specialist and generalist priest classes:<br />
<br />
Warriors will NOT stand for it, or they WILL give us a Knight ability WE choose (or several).<br />
<br />
Change &quot;Warriors&quot; to &quot;Clerics&quot;, and &quot;Knight&quot; to &quot;Druid&quot;, and not only can I guarantee I've seen that line before, I probably wrote it. <br />
<br />
Despite clerics' opposition, druids ended up getting their CH, and gave up nothing for it. SoE gave us a few tricks to help us melee better; something not really any of us wanted, was largely useless, and didn't farm out any of that druid utility our way. Cleric melee can't ever be made truly viable, as paladins would (and did) campaign for it to be nerfed, and understandably so. A Time-geared cleric with maxed strength, dexterity and +10 Combat Effects, using a Hammer of Holy Vengeance (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20627), parses at 40dps on a good day. A bazaar cleric, using only nukes, can reach 170+ burst dps against undead, while still meditating the entire time. Our Yaulp line was extended and given raw dex, mana regen and haste, so that for a cleric to melee, they would only be losing 16 mana per tick by not medding instead of 26. We didn't want any of this, but there was one piece of the druid arsenal many clerics had set their sights on in exchange for giving them a modified CH: Snare. Instead, we got a few bones that are very situational, and most of the time laughed at, let alone useless:<br />
<br />
&quot;RandomDPS_02 tells the group, 'Huhu, Ciae has a pet!'&quot;<br />
<br />
A pet that very rarely breaks 15dps fighting mobs over level 50, dies in three hits against a level 25 mob, and has to be recast for 175 mana every single mob. Upgrading the hammer pet to that was the final change for clerics in Priest Rebalancing. You call this fair in exchange for Complete fucking Heal, back when it was our saving grace with Aegolism and rez?<br />
<br />
That's why I relate this issue to clerics vs druids; the specialist vs generalist debate has been done before - and clerics lost. I'm still against mini-defensive for knights (though I wouldn't be entirely against the mana-based Vie), but due to the precedent and SoE's track record, it shouldn't be a surprise if knights were ever given it. Many warriors here accuse paladins of wanting &quot;warrior+spellbook&quot; (minus Furious); druids back then got &quot;cleric+utility&quot; (minus Rez), and no, clerics didn't get anything close to invis/see invis/snare/lev/EB/sow/debuffs/multiple resist DD/multiple resist dots/DS/type-based charm/ports/evac in exchange.<br />
<br />
This board is quite probably the best-run, realistic, no bullshit Everquest discussion board there is, period. If any solid, balanced solution to knights' problem is going to happen, it'll almost definitely be here, and if knights do end up with some kind of mini-defensive, warriors won't be getting LoH+FD+HT, no matter how many half-sane arguments &quot;killa1&quot; et al come up with. My little history lesson was meant to help warriors realize what clerics went through, and maybe learn from our mistakes... cause EQCleric's puke-inducing love-fest approach of &quot;If druids take our CH, I won't be their friend anymore!&quot; got us fucking nowhere.<br />
<br />
And I'll say it again, any form of mini-defensive for knights should be heavily based on their mana, since it makes the implementation finite, much more controllable, and makes it costly to the point that knights will have to be careful about when they use it.</div></div><hr />

Your group is at full mana. You engage the named high DI mob. The Necro twitches you so you can keep Vie up longer? It's a race guy. If a Necro is in your group, he's there for DPS, not twitching you and not twitching the Cleric. The mana conversion is not good.<br />

I just got done reading a level 65 on another board post that Paladins can not add tank in Kod'Taz, but Rangers can because of WS. Adds are not 50 minutes apart. There is no advantage in having a Ranger tank adds.<br />
<br />
Now posting stuff like this might get the pre-EP Paladins all a twitter, but anyone who has done PoTime and some GoD knows better and so does SoE.<br />
<br />
Want to make a case that Paladins can't add tank in Kod'Taz? Publish the mobs, quantity, DB, DI, and some Parses showing a Cleric unable to keep an addtank on their feet.<br />

When a tough add shows up in camp, then the raid leader might say get a Warrior on that %t. Otherwise the add tanks (not that we bother with formal add tanks in Kod'Taz) just grab them.<br />

Knights can and do pass these trials as the tank in a group, pretending that they cant isnt terribly useful. There is only 2 mobs which are a real problem. The whole situation would be fixed by simply dropping the dps slightly on these 2 mobs and retuning the damage model to rely more on DB then DI.

My point was that your 4 accounts that you've been throwing around as some sort of weight for your opinion (omg I have 4 accounts, so SOE must listen to me more!) don't really count much compared to Stormhammer players and Yantis, even according to your silly little logic.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">But the Ikkinz trials are about loot to some extent.<br />
<br />
Even with most of the Top 100 Paladins sporting a Ring of Simple Purity and a Timestone Adorned Ring (hard to argue with either of those two choices), ~20% of them wear a Glyphed Prayer Ring from the Ikkinz trials.<br />
<br />
Glyphed Prayer Rings still show up ocassionally around Paladin ~#250 with unbuffed HP's of about 7800HP's. This pretty well establishes that Paladins can do at least one Ikkinz trial. For those that can't it's a matter of equipment.<br />
<br />
The funny part is that with the Warrior Top 250 Magelos showing much higher HP's Glyphed Prayer rings aren't that common either. My guess is, despite protestations to the contrary, the expanion is still new.<br />
<br />
Paladins do not speak with one voice or agree where the so-called &quot;problem&quot; exists. Many low level Paladins contend it's gamewide, not ready for GoD Paladins have said it starts in Vxed and Tipt - Paladins can't get normal experiance groups in GoD. Others say it's the Ikkinz trials and others say normal raid adds. I think step #1 would be to get the story straight.<br />
<br />
IMO, it's not the Sewer trials, Vxed, and Tipt - too many Paladins have advanced beyond these for their claims that it can't be done to be taken seriously.<br />
<br />
Magelos seem to indicate that Paladin members of guilds that have farmed the hardest previous content (PoTime) for 6 months or more are succeding at at least one Ikkinz trial. Since afaik we haven't encountered content requiring each raid member to have completed these, to at least some extent being &quot;ready&quot; (geared up) is a reasonable requirement. SoE has suggested that they will adjust some of the Ikkinz mobs. This also seems reasonable.<br />
<br />
All that's left is the assertion that Paladins can't tank adds in Uqua, etc. Some people say they can and do in their guilds, others say it isn't possible.<br />
<br />
I think most of this is an matter of SoE checking if PvE balance is where they intend it to be for Paladins.<br />
<br />
The PvW (Paladin vs. Warrior) garbage is garbage. Paladins aren't Warriors. They do not share our role except in normal experiance groups. Heck, unlike Monks they aren't even pure melee. Like Rangers, they are a melee/caster  hybrid. While they should be able to perform their role - tank/priest, they certainly shouldn't be able to perform ours - Primary Tank, not on those ocassions when we have to use our Defining Ability that Should Not be Shared.<br />

Answer me this BB. If as you say there are 7800hp knights with this ring<br />
<br />
a) Did they tank? I mean if they weren't MT but a warrior was. How does this define balance?<br />
<br />
b) If it was tanked by the knights. What does this have to do with only the top 250 warriors sporting them? I mean you can't honestly tell me that a warrior with 7800 can't tank the trial if a knight can.<br />

Let me repeat this again. I'm not arguing defensive here. But saying that PoTime knights are capable of tanking sewers is retarded. The basis of the sewers isn't PoTime level. So what you need to do is look at the different trials and different open zones, gauge what lvl of the game they represent, and THEN compare the balance between the 2 classes vs the proper lvl content.</div></div><hr />

This one hits close to home, I'm the best equipped Paladin in my guild, and I pale, totally pale in comparsion to a defensive warrior for the name for tanking the named in Vxed/Tipt (and I know its only gets worse in Kod'Taz) The named seemed to be designed around defensive, or avoidance disciples, its rather lame monks/rangers are almost better tanks for some of the boss's because they can tank them w/o taking damage for a good portion of their life, when I have a VERY good chance of just flat out dying. Single group encounters should not have so much based around single class/disciples<br />
<br />
Solution: Either Give Knights a form of defensive somehow, which I think would be very hard to implement correct, (if they do I think it should be via shields, maybe have a disc that only works if you have a shield equipped that works as a defensive, but as I've said this owuld be hell to balance across all levels of game..<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Rebalance the named. The names seem to rely on fast spiky damage to be challenging, to do this they have fairly low attack, low DB and high DI, so you tanks mitigate most of their damage and other people get owned. On the named Increase the DB and decrease the DI What this would do is make it so defensive is less effective/required because it wouldnt do as much, (Defensive reduces DI) Overall boss DPS would still be pretty high, but it would make it so Knights can still tank them and not just get two rounded if they get a bad RNG, still very challenging, just makes it so we can tank them more effectivly.<br />
<br />

That was made about 1 week into GoD. Some things I'd change in retrospect, some things I'd clarify more. I dont think I said it was impossible tho, maybe I'm missing a post, its possible  but If you quote me, please A) make sure that you quote me right and B) Bring a copy of the Quote,<br />

Re Loot: Ya I have some, I didnt tank for any of it though. I got the loots sometiems by botting a cleric and zoning Madrone in after, some I got with Madrone in group, none with me tanking. I've done the entire KT quest twice, first I did it with a cleric because I didnt think it was fair to put getting Madrone flagged for raids ahead of getting anyone flagged for guild raids. After I completed it on the cleric I gathered up close friends in the guild to power me through DD (which by that time really wasnt too bad to be 100% honest, his HP was quite lower then the first attempt so it was easier to get by with my subpar DPS and stacked group.) (Cleric Druid Wizard Warrior Enchanter Paladin) I was not seeked out to do them, I built the group out of friends and people who wanted to help me - Not people who wanted my character there)<br />

Your post appeared in a long list of posts that asserted everything from Paladins have lost their group role in GoD to Paladins can't get through Vxed and Tipt.<br />
<br />
How many Paladins have gone back and posted that perhaps they were a little hasty one week into the expansion?<br />
<br />
How many have posted that they have gotten flagged past Vxed and Tipt. That they are raiding with their guilds. That they are sporting some loot that others said Paladins couldn't get. That they are tanking adds in Kod'Taz and Ikkinz raids.<br />

Virtually none.<br />

The majority of the vocal &quot;Knights need Defensive&quot; posters aren't even in the content yet. They are led by players that have posted in favor of &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (and Spellbook Superiority) in the past. At the same time many of those in a position to know better are silient and do not correct the record. Even worse, some who lent their voices to the &quot;Knight Defensive Crusade&quot; won't go back and correct the record.<br />

I think this all points toward an agenda to establish a new balance more than a desire to get real balance issues repaired. That's why Paladins fall silent rather that correct the mistaken impression they helped create.<br />

But Taragor, you know, I know, the whole EQ community knows that Warriors will be able to tank things at a somewhat lower gear level than Paladins.  If Warriors are geared in Elemental gear, more or less, then expecting Paladins to be in Time gear, more or less, isn't all that out of line.  And I think it's already been established elsewhere that if a Warrior is geared much below Elemental level, that while he might be able to tank the named, he's going to be chewed up something fierce by the trash mobs on the way to the named.</div></div><hr />

BTW, use /con with that level 1 Warrior. Matter of fact, you might want to use /con with your Paladin too. It'll tell you what the rishk level is.<br />
<br />
According to you /con on a red only says it's a death wish if it's a knight conning.<br />
<br />
And Madrone answered your question. He did get some of his items by being able to contribute to a group. (some of the items can't be gotten any other way, so it's hard to assert otherwise).<br />
<br />
You reading what ppl are saying or translating to BB speak? From what I read it says that some items he got from a drag, some items he got from participating. Which still doesn't answer class balance since his role for all intent and purpose could (COULD not WAS) have been meaningless. But of course, that doesn't compute in your brain.<br />

<br />
Again we're discussing BB's view that unless a knight is in full PoTime gear with FULL PoTime lvl type augs he shouldn't tank anything above blue in the whole expansion. With him it's not even a question of balance anymore. You can sit here and defend and counterpoint what I write to him at his level and the arguments between us will lead nowhere. Why? because he doesn't want that. He's made it perfectly clear over the past weeks that in his view a knight should not be able to tank anything that cons above white with a streak of luck being able to do a yellow every so often.<br />

What I'm saying is that if you look at well-equipped Paladins, they are able to do things you are not. And that's an outright misrepresentation to say they can't be done.<br />
<br />
Balance does not mean Paladins get to tank like Warriors. In fact balance demands Paladins do not tank like Warirors, otherwise they are Warriors with Spellbooks and there is no point to Warriors existing.<br />
<br />
Madrone, with many fewer HP's than I is sporting equipment I don't have access to. I'm not entitled to claim he has unfair advantages. I'm entitled to suck it up and attempt to acomplish these things too, given my class assets.<br />
<br />
I am I think entitled to point out that Madrone has items that suggest that contrary to his last statesments on PoN which he hasn't revised - these things can be done. That one-week into the expansion he was perhaps jumping on the &quot;Knight Defensive Bandwagon&quot; a bit hastily.<br />
<br />
Now if people want to complain that trials aren't fair, I'm willing to see trials made fair.<br />
<br />
If people want to complain Paladins can't tank red mobs like Warirors, I'll remind them that Paladins have not since Kunark been able to MT red mobs like Warriors. Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">Re: Silmare I think most paladins will agree with you that they love class cause of versatility, we're generally happy to step aside if a warrior needs to tank a boss, however when you take it down to 6 people, their just arnt enough warriors to go around in the typical raiding guild, in a 6 man encounter need to beable to perform our primary funcation adequatly enough that we arnt a large liability or risk to do so  Do you mean this post?<br />
<br />
i'ved tanked expedtion 1-6 and i'ved died few times but its possible if you set thigns up right but it is stupid how much better warriors are...<br />
<br />
either paladins need some form of defensive, trials need to be retuned to allow pal/sk to easier to tank (raise a the DB a little and lower the DI a good amount to make densive less effective) or make them returned and allow 2 groups, 1 warrior isnt that bad for 1/12, 1/6 being war/cleric/enc is dumb tho <br />
<br />
I made that post about 1 week into GoD also.<br />
<br />
Seriously find the post and quote it in its entirity (not a little snippet as it can prob be taken out of context) Otherwise don't quote me please<br />
<br />
or this one?<br />
<br />
I'm very happy with my raid role, hell I even like being the 2ndary tank in expeditions, I, and I dont like speaking for others, but I think MOST of the other Paladins do not like how well we tank against Vxed+ SINGLE group expeditions named  <br />
<br />
(I've changed my opinion a little on this, but just trying to figure out what post you mean)<br />
<br />
Or this one?<br />
<br />
Tipt boss isnt impossible to tank, I think it needs to have less DPS, but more consisent DPS, paladins just cant take the spike well enough.. I've tanked him but used monk to tank debuff him, and Charmburned him before RNG just went the wrong way (and had dru/cleric).. overally stacked group, for one of the easier trials... <br />
<br />
this one?<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 The reason why not being able to Tank the trials is a semi big deal is one of logistics.<br />
<br />
For Ikkiz Trial one, anyone who is in the trial when you first kill the entrance boss, cannot do Ikkizi with another group for 7 hours. (effectivly a full day except for the more die hard players) Once you win, you cannot enter the trial for 4 days (havnt won yet only done twice, but did do the entrance named wit ha 10150 warrior in basically elemental gear, /shrug)<br />
<br />
My guild, and probably most guilds my level have around 6-8 active warriors. This simply means that much of the guild cannot partipate in the trials some of the trials because the crucial class's will be locked out. (This will become less of an issue as all three are opened up to the said guild because you can rotate, but it is still a problem imho) <br />
<br />
I've been told that you only need one person in the raid to have all trials beatan, this does make the situation better, but it still sucks, guild is doing trials, a few warriors are in helping, the other half of the guild is sitting on their ass doing nothing, yay.<br />
<br />
Ok your saying you want to balance around defensive and dont want pretime guilds to progress through them....<br />

Re: I was wrong about the lockout, lockout is about one day, i musta been confused about raid and single group lockout, dont dissect the posts unless they are where I said we cant tank Vxed+<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah Maybe this was it, this was my responses to a debate between Graal and BB about Graal Tanking Named Pooka in Vxed, maybe you confused Graal the Dorf and MadroneDorf as a single poster?<br />
<br />
Graal has ~6400ish/1620ish HP/AC, which is pretty averagge for elementals, Vxed/Tipt are elemental level groups, which drop ~elemental quality raid AND/OR group drops....<br />
<br />
Graal isnt &quot;well equipped&quot; for Ikkinz, but hes not poorly equipped for Vxed/Tipt, hes pretty much what I would call the &quot;target audiance&quot; for the encounters - Yet he cant fill his primary job in the enviroment to any degree of acceptability.<br />
<br />
DS works up to level 68  <br />
<br />
If not that Maybe somewhere in here<br />
<br />
I'm not as elequent or whatever as some of the posters here but more or less defensive vs AC imo..<br />
<br />
I value AC a TON, most of my gear decisions are based on the fact of it having High AC and High HP, as opposed to highest HP (While trying to balance focus effects etc bleh!)<br />
<br />
AC makes you tank more reliable, the more AC you have, you get hit more in the lower DI ranges as opposed to the higher.<br />
<br />
It lowers Mob DPS, and somewhat lowers the spike damage, but the spike damage still exists.<br />
<br />
HP does nothing to reduces mob DPS, it makes it so you can take the spikes more easily. (This is why Pookas really arnt too great tanks, they have a ton of HP, but it actually takes more healing to heal them, if a mob is doing more DPS then the healer can heal, even with 25k hp the pooka can die.<br />
<br />
Defensive on the other hand is Guarenteed Mitigation, it not only reduces the spike possability, but it reduces the average DPS as well. (Most of this I'm sure people know)<br />
<br />
In the situation of a low HP/AC warrior under defensive VS a high HP/AC Knight, the Warrior wouldnt really be too concerned about spike damage, but rather DPS as a whole, while it would be interesting to see what the actual numbers would be, who would be taking more DPS, and if the DPS on the defensive warrior would be too much for a healer to heal in the time alloted (Lets say healer can heal 800 HP/S the Mob does 1200 DPS to the defensive warrior with shitty gear. So every second the healing disaparity on average would be 400, so he'd prob wouldnt last too long before the diminsing hp pool of the warrior was less then a round of attacks from the named.<br />
<br />
However it would be interesting to compared how long it takes that happens before the knight takes the round, or series of rounds (spikes) that kill him. <br />
<br />
As A side note I buff to ~10700/2350ish (depending on buffs, but 2219 ac buffed for a comparsion) With a Pooka doing dps I feel pretty comfortable tanking tipt/vxed names, however that really doesnt matter because its not my content level, its elemental level content. The grand total of my gear, AA Divine Arb, LH, HoP, (~2700ish base for me) and perhaps 'skill' althrough I dont wish to be have too much hubris is enough for me to overcome tipt/Vxed in a reliably enough fashion that I feel I am not too much of a risk to tank. But it not being my content level, its really doesnt matter, Caladel imo is right, Elemental level is nearly or as much imbalanced tanking wise in GoD, however due to both a lower level of noise because of both less public &quot;speakers&quot; on those levels that attempt the content, and because of crutches that we can depend on, that arnt avaiable later (Charmed m0bs, which might or might not stay in the long run) <br />
<br />
Nope not in there<br />
<br />
Well I Quoted every thread I can think of maybe missed one, My apologies for this large post of quotes but I really dont appreciate people quoting me when I said something I dont think I did. <br />
<br />
As a side note My posistion of course does change as I progress into GoD, listen to other posters etc, so I'm sure you can go through all my posts and find where my thoughts on something has changed, but I really don't ever recall saying we cant tank Vxed+, its always been we can't Tank it reliably enough at the level it is designed for</div></div><hr />

Websters dictionary definition for *same*:<br />
<br />
3 : corresponding so closely as to be indistinguishable<br />

Now I agree that if knights were requesting this you would be justified to yell, holler, make stupid remarks, demand our spellbooks, make irrelavant posts,etc etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Of course to *achieve* that same in *tanking* knights would require<br />

-45% defensive<br />
-Furious<br />
-AE Taunt<br />
-5% inate mitigation<br />
-Equal HP (btw *equal* means *the same*. If you're not sure what *the same* means, please refer back to the definition from webster)<br />
-Equal AC<br />

Now, from all the threads I've read the majority of the paladin community are requesting a partial mitigation around the level of 25%<br />

Heck, given that the major Warrior spokesmen are banned there, the opposite is true. Anyone can have their say on TSW. But if you as a Paladin or a Warrior don't parrot what the mid-Level PoN Class Balance Posters want to hear they are on you like flies on a cow patty.<br />

Hey, a moment of honesty Taragor!

I call BS Taragor. You aren't even affected much less concerned about class balance. You're just out to try to help achieve &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (and Spellbook superiority) the PoN poster's idea of what balance should be - let the Warriors log in on raid day (not that Paladins shouldn't be able to MT these mobs too) and be our pets for a couple of hours.<br />

Stop being a broken record. We've all read the reply, and we all know that they've stated alot of things that would *never happen* that are now in the game. If by the time they shut down the servers knights have no mitigating abilities whatsoever, THEN you can say you were right. <br />

We're not a primary healer. Nonetheless mitigating ability or no our heals do need looked at. But that's a whole different kettle of fish. This discussion is about damage mitigation, not how well I can heal someone. <br />
<br />
<br />
I've mentioned and supported these methods of solving the problem here and on PoN for months.<br />

That's not exactly true now is it. You made suggestions on PoN, which posters looked at, commented on, made tweaking suggestions and POOF a post from you then occurs saying knights are not broken and no changes need to be made. YOU have repeatedly changed your tune when a suggestion YOU made was semi accepted by the paladin community because all of a sudden you noticed that we might actually agree with this and it was something you never expected us to even consider.<br />

What the hell are you talking about. You're two facing between here and PoN. YOU not ME. Hell Frodin pointed out how not 2 hours after posting x on PoN you came here bitching y about the same thing. I'll have you and all the other warriors note that I have NEVER changed my tune between the 2 boards. I've defended, argued, couterpointed, stipulated exactly the same way on both. I'll have you note that I'm one of the only paladins that post in this forum knowing FULL well that it's the outhouse, knowing FULL well the replies I'll get, yet never chaning my tune. Why? Because to this day, not ONCE and I do mean not ONCE has a warrior replied as to WHY the suggestions made would break the game. Not ONCE have the suggestions been tweaked or debated. All you guys do is flame. Unfortunately for you I don't care about the flaming, I'm not a little kid who'll run off to his mother crying. I'll dish it  out as much as I receive it. The only difference is that atleast on MY side I made suggestions whereas the warriors here (some excluded) are just like you. They wanna be in BB's world where no class is worth anything except for warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heck, given that the major Warrior spokesmen are banned there, the opposite is true. Anyone can have their say on TSW. But if you as a Paladin or a Warrior don't parrot what the mid-Level PoN Class Balance Posters want to hear they are on you like flies on a cow patty.<br />
<br />
I'm not a PoN admin. Why are you taking this up with me? <br />
<br />
<br />
Hey, a moment of honesty Taragor! What new ideas have PoN Class Balance posters come up with that address these issues that don't mention DI or &quot;burst mitigation (code word for Defensive) since an SoE spokesman stated  - Defensive is a Warrior class defining abiltiy that won't be shared.<br />
<br />
Let's see. The MAIN issue for knights in GoD is mitigation, what exactly SHOULD we be discussing? How to be better healers? We're not talking our healing deficiencies here, we're talking our primary role as tank deficiencies. Of course, YOU and the rest of your possy don't WANT anyone else to be able to tank anything above a blue con mob, so to you any discussion in the regards of better tankiing even when it's in regards to the two classes that ARE primary tanks is a demand for your job. The fact that it isn't and that you've never been able to show concrete proof as to why it would be is where you come across as a whining child that's but thinking *me me me*.<br />
<br />
<br />
I call BS Taragor. You aren't even affected much less concerned about class balance. You're just out to try to help achieve &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (and Spellbook superiority) the PoN poster's idea of what balance should be - let the Warriors log in on raid day (not that Paladins shouldn't be able to MT these mobs too) and be our pets for a couple of hours.<br />
<br />
Hmmm let's see. How many times did you state you did NOT have aggro issues when they finally gave warriors the provoke line? It didn't AFFECT you yet you swear up and down about it. Why? <br />
<br />
As for this not affecting me you are partly right and mostly wrong.<br />
<br />
Partly right because I'm not in Uqua and do want to do PoTime before going to GoD. Unlike VT in SoL that I didn't mind skipping over to do PoP, I do want to see the end of PoP.<br />
<br />
Mostly wrong because it's a knight issue and guess what, I'm a knight. I may not be in the top 3 guilds on my server but I AM in a full time raiding guild, I DO put in 20+ hours a week JUST on raids. And I DO see warriors from guilds that are below mine (I'm in EP)  in GoD in areas that I as a knight at my level won't even bother attempting because it would be a complete waste of time.<br />
<br />
THAT BB is why it affects me. My call for a mitigation ability has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with me having a desire to tank the raids in my guild. I am in the regular offtank/addtank role for my guild on our raids and guess what, I enjoy that role. Contrary to what you probably think, I'm a defensive minded paladin on our raids. My primary concern when we engage the main mob is NOT to run in get aggro and die, or run in and start whacking at the mob because I want to parse a decent DPS. By my own nature (this has never been asked of me) I watch over the MT on my raids for close to 75% of the mobs lifespan with my finger near my LoH hotkey and my other fingers near my puny heals. Why? Because for *me* personally, I'd rather sacrifice my small dps contribution if it means my doing something when a hickup occurs will save our raids. This is why I laugh when you keep pointing at me saying I want to be a warrior. Because for me, that's never been my desire. I have 1 main and 7 alts. Guess what. NONE of them are warriors. If I TRULY coveted the role don't you think I'd have atleast a twinked one? Anyway, anything I say in the end doesn't matter since you can only respond to non warriors by saying we want what you have whether it's true or not.</div></div><hr />

 Dumbshit, there are more tools for mitigation than Defensive. Can you get that somewhere between the bone plates for future reference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">BB, I obviously chose to be a Shadow Knight - An adequate secondary tank. At the time, I could have tanked the hardest mob in the game, for the 30 seconds until he Death Touched me. Disciplines came out when I was in my mid 20s. They started meaning something to the uber guilds when I hit about 50.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, I have no problems being inferior to a warrior for pure tanking. I personally feel it's the height of stupid to put an effectively /defensive required mob smack in the middle of a progression path that's limited to single groups, but I don't make those calls. If I'm not tanking, though, I need something else to do. I can't heal, I'm third rate DPS over time, every single class with pacify can out pull me, my best buff is about as good over time as the ranger atk buff, and my best debuff is 40 points of atk. Pre-focus, my lifetap lands for approximately the minimum hit of the mobs I fight in GoD. I can alternate 5 and 8k nukes every 36 minutes. My spells have failed to scale with the environment. My primary damage suspension method was always capricious and dangerous at best, and is completely shut off on all mobs above level 55. Can't have a necro fear kiting Nagafen! Don't get me wrong - I like what I have, and it's a very nice boost while I'm tanking, there's just nothing to justify taking me as the sixth person unless, well, I'm going to be tanking that second mob in camp. <br />
<br />
You love quoting the class descriptions, well:<br />
Shadowknights are deadly opponents who use evil spells to slow and cripple their enemies. They steal the strength and life from their victims, using this stolen power to strengthen themselves and their allies. <br />
Why can't I cripple my foes in any meaningful fashion? Where's my ability to significantly effect the damage output of a mob? Fuck defensive, give me a 15 minute recycle spell that shaves a little DI off whatever I cast it on, so I can let it completely bounce off a warrior - Flag old content immune if needed. Give me something that lets me stack with a warrior in a fashion other than pure DPS, if I have to sit on the great tank bench.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">This is just for my own information.  I apologize, as I'm sure that the answer to my questions have already been posted, but I'm a little behind.  I've read so much in so many different threads on so many different boards, it's hard to keep track of anything.<br />
<br />
First off; where are knights having problems tanking in GoD?  I'm aware of Trial 6, Tipt I think it is?  Are there additional areas/zones/instances where the same thing is occuring, or is this issue mainly limited to that trial?<br />
<br />
This next is specifically aimed at the knights that post on these boards, eg. Madrone, Taragor, Arathena.  From what I can tell, according to the knights who are posting here, the most popular fix of this problem would be giving knights some form of burst mitigation, in the form of some kind of defensive.  To those of you who don't favour this approach, how do you think it would best be resolved?  To those of you who do favour this approach, I have more questions.  Firstly, many warriors, myself included, see giving knights a form of defensive as a loss of our class defining ability.  Do you also see knights gaining a form of defensive in this light?  Do you see it as simply a form of game progression/evolution?  Would you see a need for warriors to gain any of knight's utility, as a form of trade-off?  For example, possibly one or a combination of some form of healing/snare/stuns/LoH/HT?  If so, which abilities/utility would you personally think would be suitable for a warrior?<br />
<br />
Another question, for the knight posters.  This form of defensive, how would it be introduced into the game?  For example, would it be dropped, or vendor sold, or quested?  If dropped, where would it drop, how rarely, etc.  What would be the costs associated with it?  Would it be mana based, or end based?  What would be the refresh timer on it?  Would there be any drawbacks to using it, and if so, what?  Any limitations on use, such as only certain zones/expansions/mobs flagged useable?<br />
<br />
I have a pretty good idea on how most of the warriors here think, imo.  Now I'm just trying to see this from the knight perspective.  Not trying to flame, just looking for info.</div></div><hr />

Ikkinz single group trial nameds(Rav Interceptor, Pixxt Annihilator, etc.) were/are the biggest or loudest problems at the moment, with some people complaining about adds in Uqua, some people out of fear of the rest of the expansion's single group content, and some about Tipt(specifically Jhiru).<br />
<br />
This next is specifically aimed at the knights that post on these boards ... To those of you who don't favour this approach, how do you think it would best be resolved?<br />
Good question.  I don't really know how it should be handled, other than by not having put those type of mobs in single-group progression content to begin with.  Every solution I can think of has a downside, it would just be a matter of choosing the lesser of several evils.<br />
<br />
Would you see a need for warriors to gain any of knight's utility, as a form of trade-off [for knights getting a (modified) defensive] ?<br />
Not really.  IF Sony had decided to give knights some variation of defensive, it would have been because they felt knights needed it, not because they struck a &quot;we'll give you this ability for that discipline&quot; bargain with warriors.  <br />
<br />
But they have said that defensive is going to stay warrior-only, so the point is moot (at least, for now)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">Arathena/Partha.<br />
<br />
Pacify is capped at 55, there is very little content at 65, where mobs are 55 (at least that I do /shrug)  or lower, rendering pacify, more or less useless for me, I think you meed pacification, which is capped at 65.<br />
<br />
Zito: <br />
<br />
The Root of the problem is that named mobs are signicently more powerful then those around them, named, whether for progression/quests did not used to be much more powerful then mobs around then, yes this didnt always hold true, but generally the challenge was more holding a camp down and being semi ready for the named, if a named popped the tank could be slightly slow, knock around the caster a bit, didnt need FM, asap debuffing etc.  Named has shifted from that, to being solo, with nearly full buffs full mana fully prepared, as such, they are balanced around what class's can do at their best, in a small period of time, Full Mana Full HP, AA abilities disciplines etc etc. While these abilities did help, and if you ever treated a named in Sebelis or Lowerguk, like you did GoD single named you'd absolutly blow it away (at comparable level/gear etc)<br />
<br />
In addition, not only has tanking related abilties increased, but so has healing, debuffing etc etc, so if player Tanking has increased by a power of 2, and so has healing, then the mob DPS increase's as a power of 3, but this increase makes it so healing is so much more focused on a few rounds, rather then a more broad spectrum, so defensive skyrockters in use for single groups, when it never has been so needed/useful before. (IE it was a tool if things went wrong, a particually bad pull, useful on names but not required) and its changed to being whats its balanced around.<br />
<br />
Because of these two factors, its why some Knights think Knights need some sort of burst Mitigation, whether its Defensive like (DI), Vie like (Total) Shield Like (Blocking) etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">From what it appears to me, the ability of the knight to overpower encounters by outgearing it ends at about Ikkinz. This however, is to me, all second hand info. I've admitted that from the beginning. However, the issue reflects down through much of the expansion: Rather than the abilities of warriors being a nice bonus, they are required by high damage spikes on the parts of the mobs. This places knights into a rather nasty corner: We become the only classes incapable of fulfilling our primary role in tier-appropriate gear, while lacking sufficient secondary roles to justify our presence in a group with a warrior. A druid in a group with a cleric gets to play secondary healer, reducing the load on the cleric, as well as nuking. I get to pretend I'm a monk, and I'm pretty much inferior to one in every way when I'm pretending to be him. I can't play 'secondary tank' until the body hits the floor, in 95+% of cases. <br />
<br />
While it's tempting to jump on the bandwagon and scream, 'gimme defensive, cause I suck!', I think I'd prefer a solution to the problem that plays to my classes strengths, rather than to my weaknesses. I cannot make proper remarks for paladins, though a Vie-styled buff such as that outlined by Ciae elsewhere appeals to my aesthetic sense. One of my class defining abilities is supposedly using my dark magic to 'slow and cripple a mob'. For specifics, I would place the following spells: <br />
<br />
Nihil: Curse of Shadow: -5% Mob 'Penetration', -5% Mob Accuracy, +18? Curse counters.<br />
Tipt/Vxed: Curse of Luclin: -10% Mob 'Penetration', -10% Mob Accuracy, +36? Curse counters.<br />
<br />
Tinker with costs and recycles as needed, but I feel a mana-intensive debuff to allow me to survive like a baseline warrior, let alone an undisced one, is a relatively appropriate solution to the issues I see. Warrior tools are essentially passive, even defensive and evasive. My primary tools should be active, and tied to my spellbook. Moreover, they should stack with a warrior in the group. Currently, I've nothing significant to offer a group with a warrior but third rate DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">Arathena,<br />
<br />
A very nice post. I agree of course with everything you said except perhaps the specific spellbook oriented fixes - I'm not sufficiently knowlegeable.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that SoE could do a quick an dirty fix like Knight Defensive or Knight/Warrior automatic expedition assignment. I hope they don't take either approach.<br />
<br />
Admittedly starting with moving Knights to &quot;-1 DI&quot; (and Warriors to &quot;-2 DI&quot;) to distinquish plate tanks from other classes, spellbook revision and addressing any needed &quot;burst mitigation&quot; capability afterwards is a lot more work.<br />
<br />
However I believe Knight spellbooks have not kept up with mob difficulty. I don't believe Knights should be less effecive Warriors with ineffective spellbooks. That's clearly not a recipe for viable Knights.<br />
<br />
It would be a good thing if SoE was clearer about what roles it saw for Knights and make and adjustments needed so that they can perform those roles.<br />

Defensive both fail to address the basic problems, even if it squeaks us through places like Ikkinz - There's no compelling reason to take me for a progression group, period.  Mobs need to be balanced around a baseline, with each class exceeding the baseline in some manner, and falling short of it in others. Right now, the baseline is the warrior, not the conceptual balance point. Hence the unneeded swings in relative effectiveness from expansion to expansion.</div></div><hr />

The ATK and DEX debuffs fit with the cripple idea, lower ATK reducing spike damage and lower DEX reducing rampage/flurry.<br />
<br />
The problem is that since it's cast on the mob, it would stack with defensive and trivialize a lot of content. Future content would need to be balanced around guilds being able to, with many shadowknights, keep a mob &quot;virused&quot; for long periods of time. The Add Procs in Slots 5 and 6 were my attempt to circumvent that; Crippling/Atrophic Contagion would overwrite Defensive/Evasive respectively and thus Virus would not be used when a warrior is tanking.<br />
<br />
What *might* be a solution - I'm not exactly sure - would be to combine the &quot;kiddie trials&quot; idea of Sony's with that spell; mobs are the same in all versions of GoD trials, but something like Virus is only usable in a Shadowknight-flagged trial. Even if a warrior was /dzadded in, it wouldn't be possible to stack Virus and Defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">Much of the intent in what I'm proposing, Ciae, is -not- to replace defensive in this trial for SKs, though what you're proposing would solve that quite well. The primary thrust of the line is instead to create a new, secondary role for Shadow Knights. The parallel often drawn here on these boards is between the Cleric and the warrior, highly specialized roles - The cleric is pure healing, the warrior, purely tanking. In this case, the Paladin breaks down into being equivalent to the druid, bringing tanking and healing to the table. His heals are effective on the same line that a druid's nukes are effective: They work, but you really don't think of them as a DPS class. Here, I would draw the SK class inline with the offerings of the Shaman. They can heal, but the real strength of the class lies in that healing/tankage combined with their own debuff lines.<br />
<br />
Along that line, I would suggest that this debuff be made to -not- stack with slow. More, the presence of unslowable, unsnareable, as well as slow mitigating mobs points out that it is trivial to take a spell out of consideration for high end encounters. Much of the issue at hand runs far deeper than merely tanking a few mobs: There should be cases where knights do not have sufficient survivability, however, in those cases, we must be able to bring something to the encounter beyond tanking. Right now, the paladin brings exceptionally weak healing, mob positioning, and in isolated cases, stun mitigation. The SK currently brings third rate DPS and the worst pulling of all the pulling classes. The lack of effective secondary role needs to be redressed, preferably in a way that brings us up to par with warriors as offtanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">I haven't seen any changes go Live, so I'll assume nothing is a sure thing for now.  But as many others have said, gimping the trial bosses only for knights would be a HUGE mistake.  It would be virtually impossible to balance.  Would the trial be made more difficult in some way so that people wouldn't just take knights all the time instead of warriors?  Hopefully, but if they did that, why make a separate version at all?  <br />
<br />
If changes are made to reduce the extreme dps of the bosses in this SMALL number of situations for single group trials, it should be an across the board change.  What class you take is irrelevant.  The end of the trial is made difficult through means other than just a  massive defensive disc requiring boss whether you are playing a warrior or any other class.<br />
<br />
That said, for the most part I still fail to see the problem here.  The claim an earlier poster mocked people for saying, &quot;It's only 2 months into the expansion&quot; is absolutely valid.  When in EQ have knights been able to immediately tank the bleeding edge content that requires top end warriors?  Never.  But once they get enough gear upgrades, they can tank it.  See PoP for a prime example.  The difference here is that there's a single group situation whereas if it's a raid it's more tolerable to knights not to be main tank right away.<br />
<br />
By the way, just a question about the trials that cause this dispute... is there something making it unrealistic for you to take a warrior AND a knight on a trial?  Why not?  That knight adds utility plus a backup tank.  Is there some short timer making it so you have to go with dps every time in that slot that you might have put a 2nd tank in?  <br />
<br />
One last note... the top guild on our server recently mentioned that the first time one of their groups beat Ikkinz trial 3, which was also a server first, it was with a paladin as MT and only one cleric in the group.   :cool:</div></div><hr />

You could charm mobs and basically killed the named before he had a chance to do much, a bard could solo the names too</div></div><hr />

That statement doesn't support what you want, so you gotta try and find a way to minimize it. This is par for the course for paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u186"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p186">hmm... I don't think it was done when you could charm the mobs (that's been removed now, right?), but I don't know for sure.  I'm not in the guild.  The context was in response to someone's claim on our server board that you had to have the Holy Trinity to get far in GoD (warrior, cleric, enchanter).  They had no warrior, no enchanter, and 1 cleric, though they had a paladin with reportedly 8400+ unbuffed hit points. <br />
<br />
Anyway, given the context it was reported, I don't think they gimped it with some bard soloing the named before a nerf.  Of course it's just one example anyway and most people know that knight tanks HAVE survived these trials.  They just don't survive nearly as often as comparabe gear level warriors.  Duh.  It just so happens on our server that the first group to get through successfully in that trial had a paladin MT.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
It's quite reasonable to assume that as more paladins get outfitted in better than Time loot out of GoD, more will be able to tank these mobs with greater success.   Hmm... that sounds a lot like every other expansion.<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
By the way, since knights are complaining so much about not being able to tank these trials very well, what about druids and healing?  Is there a big outcry from the druid community about the fact that at least one cleric is pretty much required?  It's doable with a cleric and a druid as backup, but of course 2 clerics would probably be even better.  So I assume there are demands for druid upgrades to make them more viable as the main healers in the trials.<br />

<br />
Heh... no 'grats.  The &quot;kiting&quot; aspect of the game is broken and has been for a long time.  It's completely unbalanced and basically just highlights badly flawed game mechanics.  The band-aid fix in EQ is to make mobs unsnareable/unrootable and/or make them summon.  The real fix requires considerable design change to make this method of combat simply not very viable.  We'll probably have to wait for another game for that.<br />
  <br />
I'm not at all convinced the guild i was talking about had the bard kite the boss to death.  I think they tanked it.  But I don't really know.  The general points remain the same: just as knights more fully outfitted in new gear were able to start tanking PoP bosses during that expansion, in GoD I'd think they will become more viable tanks in the same manner.  <br />
<br />
And if dps is lowered on the bosses, it should be lowered no matter who you have in the group, including a warrior.  Simply change the encounter to rely less on huge dps of a single mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">A week or two ago I was messing around in Nadox.  And there was a bard kiting in the lugald area.  She, by herself, was killing every single lugald around and there was a pile of corpses rotting that had to be 15 or 20 mobs, easy.  Now, those lugalds aren't PoP mobs by any stretch, but they're not wimps either.  Using a Cleric/Warrior double box I can take on two of those guys at the same time, if I'm careful.  Maybe three if it really came down to it, but it would be very iffy.  This bard had killed literally dozens of mobs in the time it would have taken me to kill 2 or 3.<br />

Not really a fix, just slows down the better kiters. Plenty of mobs that do this can still be solo'd.</div></div><hr />

Soloed sometimes, yes, but as you said it certainly slows people down, so it helps some of the worst out of balance aspects of kiting.  Really fixing it will probably have to wait for a new game.  EQ has become too entrenched in its own stupidity to change that drastically at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kiting has been broken ever since the game was released.  The real solution is to make sure that mobs always have a way to retaliate if damage is being inflicted on them.  This could either be through increased offensive options or through something as simple as just making them 100% immune to damage if for some reason they are unable to inflict damage on whoever they have aggro on.</div></div><hr />

But what I think Knights are saying is that at GoD level, that spellbook is only helpful if you need toilet paper, or perhaps wish to make a nice little paper hat.  Spells are either mitigated or resisted outright, which essentially leaves them as watered down tanks.  However, Class Balance keeps being thrown around and it's laughable.  One expansion doesn't force a need for class balance.  It promotes a need for Expansion Balance.  Class Balance applies from 1 to 65, not GoD 65.  Knights don't have the problem they profess to have pre-65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no way you look at it ... no warrior has this kind of aggro.  a premature resisted slow or emergency heal will still leave a caster dead if the warrior gets unlucky with 0 procs in the first few crutial seconds.  i understand that some of this is useless in GoD, but its still applicable to the other 90% of norrath, and therefore cant be discounted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the addition of incite, warriors don't have to rely on the RNG any longer. Incite gives enough aggro to cover even a resisted slow.<br />
<br />
In short, while it still doesn't reach hybrid aggro capabilties, neither do warriors have much of an aggro problem at all any more.</div></div><hr />

To a certain degree I see the point and agree.  But much of the Knight arguement that their spells lack value is in relation to mobs clearly designed with very high DPS that warrant the use of a Warrior with defensive.  I doubt that their spells are as &quot;useless&quot; against most of the yard trash.  So I'd argue that shows not that the spells aren't powerful enough but rather that the mobs are too powerful.<br />
<br />
And I'd also point out that Warrior &quot;spells&quot; are even more useless all the time against all opponents.  Not just in one expansion against the hardest hitting mobs around.</div></div><hr />

lots of people still prefer knights to warriors in xp groups, Hard ldon, and GoD early trials because mobs can be slowed before they ever reach camp.<br />
heaven forbid warriors finally have a mob where the group benefits greatly simply by having them there.<br />

i still dont see why more peole arent crying that ench's can practically solo these GoD trial bosses.... imagine a pet which quads for 1200+ hasted and has 50k hps.  i had a trial run back a while ago where we had the boss mob at 20% health before my furious wore off.  2 spam heals from our single cleric was more than enough to ensure that the mob was dead and rotting.... and i'm wet toilet paper compared to some of the guys that try these trials.</div></div><hr />

Don't know what you're doing wrong, then. Ever since incite got added, I've had mobs turn on my slowers maybe enough times that I can count it on one hand.</div></div><hr />

Because charm doesn't work in Ikkinz, so enchanters can't &quot;practically solo these bosses.&quot;  Vxed doesn't even really have a final/boss mob, so at best, enchanters can contribute a pet on only the easiest of four boss mobs.</div></div><hr />

I whole lot of people have this problem then, can you tell us what we are doing wrong?  If I don't get at least 5 seconds of melee in (without a proc), I WILL lost agro on slow.  Since my guild has more Paladins than Warriors AND Shadow Knights combined, I guess I run into more people than normal that are not &quot;used&quot; to waiting to slow.  I only group with guildies, and I have a lot of guildies that &quot;enchanter tank&quot;, since everywhere except GoD, the majority of the enchanters can tank well enough to tank any 1 group mob in exp zones (like PoE, PoW, PoF, etc.)<br />
<br />
Just to be clear &quot;enchanter tank&quot; = &quot;I don't want to bother thinking or dealing with agro, since the mob is dead in 20 seconds and the mobs hit for at most double/triple 900 and that makes it not worth the trouble to think about agro.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The main problem is that incite is just too small of an amount of hate.  With good weapons you can do 120 to 200 hate per second, so 5 seconds of combat is an addl 1000 hate.  I guess they wanted incite to be around 5 seconds of combat and not much more, so instead of taking 10 to 15 seconds to be safe, with incite we only need 5 to 10.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to a very basic concept called Progression. If you skip a step or two, don't expect where you end up to be manageable. <br />

If you want to tank as well as a Warrior, make a warrior. If SOE changes content to meet knight gimpness, they better give warriors healing ability.<br />

<br />
Incite is a nice addition, but we're still dependant upon taunt.  Incite alone isn't enough hate to overcome a slow.  Taunt is, however, if it doesn't fail.<br />
<br />
Basically, we're still stuck with what we've been used to for years... hold hitting that taunt for the second you see the slow go off.  Additionally, I like to watch for the &quot;shaman starts to cast a spell&quot; message, wait a few seconds, then bash.  If it lands, the mob is froze for a sec, yawns as slow hits, can't run to the shaman cause it's stunned, taunt, incite, pissed off mob.  Keeps the mob from run'n for the shammy if he's not already within melee range.  Doesn't always work, nice when it does.<br />
<br />
Slow lands, taunt, incite.  Now you're 401 hate above the slow, if taunt didn't fail.  If you incite before the slow, you still have less hate than the slow as many people are seeing.  If you incite before the slow, then get a successful taunt, you're only 1 point ahead of the slow.  Just a waste of endurance at that point, since you just trumped your own card.<br />
<br />
I realize that this still leaves room for failed taunts and no aggro right off, but it's no worse than where we were before incite.  This is where a knight can help us out a lot.  They can generate snap aggro.  Have the knight catch it's attention first with some spell action, as he'll easily have more aggro than the slow before it lands.  Then a successful taunt, followed by incite, and all that aggro plus 401 is yours.  70 per tick over the next minute, on top of the procs you're bound to have in that time, and you won't lose it unless someone purposely wants you to lose it.  If it takes a few tries for a successful taunt, it's not as big of a deal since the knight can easily take the hits better than the shaman can.<br />
<br />
I love knights in this regard.  All that massive aggro they can generate is really mine muahahaha....<br />
<br />
If you don't have a knight in the group, well, the shaman is bound to get hit once in a while.  But at least not &quot;every&quot; fight.  Still completely hinged upon a successful taunt like we've always been.  If I get a few unsuccessful taunts in a row, while the shaman is getting beat on the whole time, I'll eventually break down and hit incite without the taunt.  But by then, I've had plenty of cleaving on the mob to have boosted myself in hate to where the addition of the extra 400 can now give me aggro.<br />
<br />
I think of incite not as an aggro grabber, but rather more along the lines of an aggro keeper.</div></div><hr />
