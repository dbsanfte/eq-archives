<br />
Unless the ranger is co-operating with you and working to not take agro off you ofcourse a ranger proc'ing a 50% slow and casting snares and nukes is going to be able to take agro off you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know all about timing and I was trying everything! I tried taunting when the spells went off, I tried taunting when the mobs turned, I tried just mashing the button. This wasnt over a 5 min time span it was an exp night and fighting!<br />
<br />
The point wasnt what spells he might or might not have had on... the point was that he was out taunting me PERIOD with out trying to and there was nothing I could do about it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure there was, pull another mob into camp, let him tank one and you tank one.  No reason to fight about it.   When I group with my BST friend I always bring two mobs into camp, one for me, one for him ... and Faedile (my enchanter) always likes not having to mez :P<br />
<br />
There's no reason that you can't let someone else tank, it shouldn't make you feel worse about your ability, it should make you think out side the box a little more.</div></div><hr />

There's no way a warrior can take aggro from a ranger that wants it.  Or even one that's not making any effort to control their aggro depending on your weapons.</div></div><hr />

Best part about doing that is it is just fun.  Been spending alot of time lately with a ranger friend, who boxes one of the better shaman on our server(the person who's account it is is taking a break from game)  Just us 3 will hang out in BoT, ranger pulling.  He hates pulling just one, so we normally have 2 or 3 in camp, each of us tanking one, shaman Qing happily, exp flowing quite nicely.  If Blakkwolf wants agro(and he does this sometimes just to give me hell), he can get it and keep it no problem.  If he is being a real dick, he has Brem slow, cripple, throw 3 DoTs on and and let Brem sit back and Q himself till mob drops(we have a real mean sense of humor, but I put up with it as only fair for all the ranger jokes I have made).<br />
<br />
Thing to remember about rangers...they do have jolt.  If they want to dump agro, they can.  If they are holding agro away from you, they are being a dick.  In pickup groups when it happens, I just stop taunting and go DPS.</div></div><hr />

POINT = MISSED<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone has missed the point here.  What everyone is saying is:<br />
<br />
Yes, the ranger will out agro you.  Can you do anything about it? No.  The ranger has the tools it increase his amount of hate - spells, choice of weapons etc or decrease it with jolt, your agro comes from your DPS, some random procs and a 40% chance of getting bumped up to the top of the hate list when you press the little red button only to be back down in 2nd place again the next time the ranger hits to mob.<br />
<br />
Bugger eh?<br />
<br />
Unless ofcourse I missed the point too :p</div></div><hr />
