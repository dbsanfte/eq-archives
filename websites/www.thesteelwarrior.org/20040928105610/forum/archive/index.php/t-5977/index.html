A time ago I started this quest, and upon attempting for the 8th ring which if you fail you lose the ring I did to a schmuck training the camp on our group.<br />
<br />
Been pestered about going back and start it all over again yet I  went and got a Vallorium Ring of Gallantry to replace the one I had.<br />
<br />
As I stated above I'm just looking for other people's opinion on this ring that have gone the whole nine yard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">definately a nice ring; esp for the single group usability.<br />
if you got time; go get it. it'll always be a beneficial thingy to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I wasn't lazy, I'd work on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I'm lazy, and won't have one for a while!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have the 9th now, and I think it is great.  Just need to pull a ring war together to finish it off.  It is nice to have another insta-clicky item, and the effects/stats are pretty swell too IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ring 1-8 can be done by 1-2 ppl<br />
ring 9 can be done with 3 ppl<br />
ring 10 a raid of 30+<br />
for someone with your gear<br />
<br />
Insta clickies is not something you can easly replace and the ring quest is my favortie quest in the whole game. Great story awesome events and its pretty easy especially if you have done most of it once already. I've done this quest like 5 times just for my characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did ring 1-8 in a couple hours with a druid friend......we were just lucky enuff to find all the necessary mobs up when we did it.  I found that doing it after 1am is the best time since no one is in EW at that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">See my Magelo.  It's the only Velious gear I am still wearing, but I am trying to replace it!  The fact that it has lasted me since 2001 should say something about it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am working on Dain faction now so i can finish this quest.....i killed Dain too many time with nothing to show for it, so now I watch KT spawn every chance so I can get a faction hit.  Even if I get better rings from EP I am still gonna finish this quest so I can have a instaclick and not lose too many hp by swapping out gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Was thinking of doing this for the clicky buff as I can do most of it solo, but I have a concern. Does anyone know if the 10 regen part of effect will stack above the 35 regen cap? <br />
<br />
I am very close to 35 regen if I wear my Fungi and would mainly use the effect to cut down solo downtime as I have some instaclicky buff items allready.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">regen is the spell effect not worn<br />
till you click the thing there is no regen happenin</div></div><hr />
