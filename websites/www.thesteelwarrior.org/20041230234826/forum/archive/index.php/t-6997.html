I wouldn't say that. (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Warriors&amp;message.id=500)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it's not really that we need it to hold aggro, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaiel_RN</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go figure a pally is just doing his EQ part to make sure that this gets fixed asap.  Oh there's a bug that benifits the warriors possable I have to run to EQ live to tell them so it gets fixed so warriors can't get better at holding Aggro.  That is one thing erks me is that when we wanted to get our aggro fixed we get called whiners and such by Pallies and SK now they complain to SoE over something thats not all that important.</div></div><hr />

Sheesh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't say that. <br />
<br />
I didn't see any devs reading our boards.  I saw a pally ratting us out.  I stick to my agreement with the statement that devs don't visit our board much.  Asshole paladins, however, seem to troll the boards regularly.</div></div><hr />

Erm, sorry, but this really struck me as odd.  Why would the SK be holding our family hostage to keep it secret?  We're the ones that want it secret.  It would be more like the SK would require us to give up our women and children in order for them not to tell SoE.  Sorry, I'm just a nitpicky bastard</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I had the rare opportunity to bend a dev's ear a couple weeks ago and was talking to him about itemisation and referenced a couple recent threads on this board and he had read both of them, so I know they come by here and read on a fairly regular basis.</div></div><hr />
