Go to Inkkiz Trial3 (Three Archers) Its AT LEAST 95% <br />

I've had Streaks of 20 to 30 fails while medding trying to pull him off a cleric.<br />
They are tauntable (cause one day i got a success message) but very resistant.<br />

So 30 40 50 60 70 80 90% Fail rate means absolutely nothing.</div></div><hr />

I didn't look at the link, but if you mean that you have one single string of 10 attempts to taunt with 8 failures, then you don't really have evidence of an average of 80%.  What you have is a bad run on fhe randon number generator.  Your next 10 combat rounds could easily end up being 8 successes and 2 failures.  It's an &quot;average&quot; of 60%, which means there will be good runs and bad runs.  That sometimes you'll fail in a pretty long string, sometimes you'll have some fairly long strings of successes.  10 attempts does not an average make.</div></div><hr />

There has always been speculation that taunt had different success rates for different mobs, but before we had messages we couldn't really prove it.  If what you're saying is true, and I have no reason to doubt your word, then it just shows that taunt is even more useless in exactly the circumstances it's most needed.  Which also just goes to prove how borked in the head SoE can sometimes be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did a number of Ruj adventures the other day.  The first one, taunt failed constantly.  Almost every single mob we fought, tuant failed about 4 or 5 times in a row before getting a successful.  The entire adventure was like this.  I commented to my SK buddy that it sure seemed like there was a tuant modifier in this particular theme that was taking the successes down.  Ruj was the LDoN theme that I've barely done, so this was one of my only experiences noticing how much tuant was failing in here.  But then the very next adventure we did, Ruj again, tuant succeed almost every single time I pushed it.  I only remember seeing 3 or 4 failed messages the entire adventure.<br />
<br />
Very streaky.</div></div><hr />

So you can either <br />
A) Camp clerics <br />
B) Chain taunt until it works (30+ Fails are not rare)<br />

I ended up using A) and AE Taunt when needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Originally I had planned to show where I fought and a general idea of how much I taunted mobs during the sessions.  However, looking at the numbers, we can see I'm at 60% success rate, across the board.  All sessions covered 6 or more zones, ranging from plane of power, velious zones, kunark zones and a lot of LDON zones and even some luclin action.<br />
<br />
All logs were done from feb 20th this year up to april of this year.  To get the numbers, I simply parsed my logs for the above matching phrases (you can do this in yalp as well).<br />
<br />
I taunt quite a bit as I have my #2 button do taunt,kick,disarm,etc, so I pump it a lot when I am tanking.  I have a bad habbit of smashing that button every chance I get, it keeps me entertained.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the above three samples show that the average is probably 60% success rate, overall.  Also, seeing as I did hunt in a number of zones, I have a feeling that  not many mobs might have different taunt values, perhaps only level matters as I pretty much always fight  dark blue mobs in all those zones.  I will parse some of my logging from GoD sewer trials as a number of those mobs are even cons at 65, so if the level does make a difference, I'd expect slightly lower success rates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
14845 Sucecessful Taunts<br />
<br />
5854 Failed Taunts<br />
<br />
Sucess rate of 71.718 % <br />

Now what I would really like to disprove is that charisma is tied to taunt in an inverse manner. My charisma is a mere 42. Gotta get me a few Charisma buffs and try out my taunt percent then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So assuming a level 65 Warrior with max taunt skill, we go from a 60% success rate against blue mobs (as testing has shown) to something less than that, perhaps dramatically less than that, when fighting mobs that are level 65 or higher.  Not surprising, but definitely a clear basis for why Warriors felt taunt was so utterly useless in PoP and beyond.</div></div><hr />

Time Phase 3, some of the later Air islands, and deeper in Water I guess is pretty much it.  GoD started with pretty low con mobs too until the recent change, which hurts taunt but also hurts the Paladin's ability to stun mobs to mitigate damage.<br />
<br />
Certainly most of the people complaining Taunt is useless isn't using it on a yellow/red because if you need a working taunt in an XP group to survive against yellow/red it's just a disaster waiting to happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
aabuster, are you sure about this?  I ask, because if perhaps you meant 14845 taunts and 5854 failed, then your numbers would work out to:<br />
<br />
5854/14845 = ~39% fail rate<br />
(14845 - 5854) / 14845 = ~61% success rate<br />
<br />
Just curious, because when you parse your logs you can only easily search for # of taunts and # of failed, success has to be determined by subtracting the other two values.<br />
<br />
Personally, It would be great if that was the case, because then that means blue cons would pretty much be ~60% success rate for a 65 war with maxxed taunt (I assume your skill is maxxed, mine is).  Also,  I'm inthe same boat for charisma, mine is very very low, plus the developer said only your level, skill and mob level matters.</div></div><hr />

Absoulutely positive. Over 20, 000 total taunts. Also did breakdowns in different zones, but really saw no big difference in my percentages. <br />
<br />
Have yet to do the chrasima buff test. Not that I don't believe ya about it not being caculated in the tuant, but I'd rather see the proof myself.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Just went thru my latest log.<br />
<br />
1149 Sucessful taunts.<br />
432 failed taunts.<br />
1581 TOTAL taunts.<br />
<br />
14 hours in Bastion of thunder.<br />
6 Hours in Plane of Air.<br />
<br />
1149 divided by 1581 = 72.675 % sucessfull taunts. <br />
<br />
Hope I get my percent right, I know the data itself is correct.</div></div><hr />

I dont have #'s to post, but paying attention i.e. running after ping pong mobs.   Its pretty easy to say, that warrior taunt works almost 90% of the time on green mobs, and very little on red con mobs.  I personally think, and stated long before it was placed in the game, that the Incite line taunts, were nothing buy eye candy and a simple way for SOE to slack off on fixing what they should have years ago.  <br />
<br />
Taunt.  You'd think that alone would say enough.  Why in the world would people want 2 part time taunts, that sometimes do what they are supposed to.  I'd have been thrilled had they just fixed the one that we all STILL depend on.  Incite is nothing more then a pulling tool, and an aggro retainer (on longer duration fights).<br />
<br />
Soe has never addressed the taunt problem, but like always put a bandaid over it hoping we wouldnt know that they had just performed heart surgery and seriously screwed it up.<br />
<br />
I think all this mana attached to the warriors has harmed them into being nothing but a Hybrid *excuse me, endurance dependant*<br />
<br />
And although taunt is screwed up, like many post, those reasons are why it wont ever get fixed correctly.<br />
<br />
Just be really happy, that heals dont fizzle/fail that much, cuz we'd still be back in blackburrow, trying to keep the clerics /shielded haha.</div></div><hr />

The SOE developer who just posted said that taunt is only dependant upon your skill and your level vs mob level.<br />

<br />
Biggwinz,<br />
Thanks for adding data to the post, that's helpful !!  I agree it doesn't feel that high.<br />
<br />
The reason I doublechecked with aabuster1 is that if you divide the numbers out you can get a percentage nearly identical to mine (60% range) vs the 70+% he listed.  I was hoping he had done his numbers wrong and that we would agree upon a 60% range value, instead of being off by a bit.<br />
<br />
Of course, the eq dev did post that mob level factors in, but I would expect EP areas to have higher level mobs than what I normally fight, so that my numbers would be the highest we'd see, but that isn't the case.  That was the only thing I found to be odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a max level warrior with 230 taunt a good sample size to determine success and failure is the following<br />
<br />
(((Zvalue)^2)(p*q))/e^2<br />
<br />
Where zvalue represents confidence level - 99% confidence would be 2.575<br />
<br />
p = percentage of of occurances that show up as true<br />
q = 1 - p<br />
e = error rate<br />
<br />
Thus, for a +- of 1% error rate on a 99% confidence level with the most conservative possible scenario(not having a basis before hand of % occurrences being true) you would have the following:<br />
<br />
Sample size = ((6.63)*(2500))/1 = 16,577<br />
<br />
The 2500 is derived from p = 50% or maximum unknown.<br />
<br />
Thus, testing taunt on a known level mob 16,577 times will yeild the appropriate sample size for percentage determination.<br />
<br />
It must be on the same level mob for the results to be representative.<br />
<br />
sorry if this is too much math for some, but sometimes I see people sitting for hours and hours hacking away on a mob or doing test results and the 100,000 + samples provide nearly zero improvements in a conclusion.</div></div><hr />

Wonder if SoE could be convinced to add in a &quot;taunt focus&quot; effect similar to the caster effect &quot;brilliance of ro&quot;, http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2200&amp;source=Live which purports to raise effective level by 20.

Niether high nor low cha help taunt successes, as well as a developer stating that the only factors in taunt success rate is player level, mob level and taunt skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for pasring it, if you have and say it has no difference, that's enough for me...although I intend on testing it myself as well...just for giggles...</div></div><hr />

No developer has ever said classes are balanced or that everything's fixed though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While many tests indicate an average taunt success rate would be around 60% if you look at a huge sample space across many and widly varying mobs in different zones I think what is totally ludicrous and what people focus on the most is how taunt can fail 5 time, 10 time, 20 times in a row.<br />
<br />
There should be code in game mechanics which shouldn't allow taunt to fail this many times in succession</div></div><hr />

Just waiting for no &quot;taunt fail&quot; message to appear seems kind of ridiculous   :rolleyes: , and can be deadly if you happen to have high lag on that night.</div></div><hr />

Can you conferm this? <br />
<br />
Any one else remember this?</div></div><hr />
