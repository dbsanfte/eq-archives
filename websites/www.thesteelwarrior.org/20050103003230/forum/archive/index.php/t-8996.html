<br />
in OoW there are several rune types that can be turned in by casters in exchange for a spell based on the rune type. it is my understanding that warriors get an incite/bellow-line upgrade and at least two new discs for turning in these same runes.<br />
<br />
if this is the case, could someone please list the skills/discs we get and the rune required for them? i'm moving into OoW for the 66-70 grind, and i want to know what i'm getting before i end up rolling against a friend on something they could make better use of.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance  :D<br />

edit: poor typing skill</div></div><hr />

New Incite looks pretty sweet. Not sure what the discs do, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyone have info on the Aura of Runes discipline? I checked Lucy's and other than learning it's a rune effect and recast is 900, I don't know anymore.  How many points is it?  Does it take effect instantly?<br />
<br />
I 2 box a cleric quite a bit.  I won a minor rune last night, but I'm trying to figure out if this disc is worth getting for my main warrior or if I should just have my cleric turn it in.  Any info on your experience with the disc would be great.  thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nonosassy</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sucks...<br />
<br />
It knocks off Pestilence Shock (or call of ---- proc buffs) and lasts 1 minute... In that time I proc 4 times on average.<br />
<br />
The rune is 400 dmg and goes into bard song window.  I have no idea how long it lasts because it wears off as soon as it goes up.<br />
<br />
All in all, not useful at all as it is completly unreliable as any proc is.  not worth the endurance drain.</div></div><hr />

Although nice, none of them seem like &quot;Must have&quot; discs compared to what we already got.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it doesnt have an as huge impact on our tankability as def or furious etc. Its just something more we are not used too, something we can use anytime without any restriction but end lost (no dps cost like def, no snare like stonewall, no huge timer like furious) and without really care at timer.<br />
<br />
So, it stays a minute, proc like mad 400hp runes that at least cut down dps of mobs or even allowed me in poearth to tank a mob without any hp lost at all.<br />
<br />
So, I was xping in proving grounds yesterday. The &quot;pulls&quot; were somewhat slows and it was taking some time to kills mobs I was full end all the time (not much incite usage).<br />
<br />
On each yellow mobs (I am 69) I used it and it made a difference. (I was 10khp, 2.2k ac, only virtue/haste available).<br />
<br />
I didnt parse it yet, but proc rate is huge, sometimes every rounds.<br />

a DS of 2s/70 stun would be the most overpowering tool ever put into EQ (after the perma invis crown maybe) ... so I suppose it works differently.<br />

to Fremen50, it was a crown for SK and NEC only that had a worn effect of invisibility. of course it has been change asap to a clicky (Circlet of Shadow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14730) 0.1s cast time).</div></div><hr />

It was, back in the days, a 0.1s cast time clicky. This item was eventually nerfed, as people slowly learned how to really use it, and no longer drops, though, like the manastone, it was not completely removed from the game. The item obtainable now is a 5.0s cast time invis.</div></div><hr />
