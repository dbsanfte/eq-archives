<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peddy</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi. I'm a level 55 warrior and recently I sold my CoCW and got 2 Mosquito Leg Earrings, a putrid belt of rotten hide, a cloak of greater pernicity and a SoTBS :D  I put on some SCHW 'cause I couldn't afford the Mask of the Forgotten that I want, and now I'm wondering how important haste really is? I mean, I know it's a must to have some haste at this level, but should I really save up 20k for a 31% haste mask with otherwise crappy stats, or just stick with the SCHW? I'm not really able to get much no-drop stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would get haste item just for haste. I got a coulscream belt, has some nice stats on it. Goes for about 25kish or you could do RBB. I think that a 31% item is about all that is needed with raid buffs, not sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rogue epic is 41% haste.<br />
Ranger epic is 41% haste.<br />
<br />
Do you really expect to be holding agro in your 60s with the SCHW? IMO, there's no need for great hp/ac/stats if you're not getting hit, so get 31% haste at least.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wratth</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am kinda new to the haste thing but here is how I figure it.<br />
<br />
Schw - 22<br />
CoCW - 36 (I have too)<br />
<br />
now lets say you have a del 20 weapon.<br />
<br />
with SCHW it is now 17.6 delay<br />
<br />
With CoCW it is now 12.8 delay<br />
<br />
Basically you get 8 SCHW swings for 11 CoCW swings while counting the same 14.08 secs.<br />
<br />
Is one extra swing per 4.67 secs in comabat worth the extra plat? Prob depends allot on how much plat you have but I think so.<br />
<br />
Also there is the question of haste cap, which quite honestly I do not know where it is at what level. I do know this tho, I tend to group more with sham then chanters(chanter buddy start school :( ) and I need the extra 14% haste. <br />
<br />
Shoot looking forward to getting 41% haste when I can.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edited SCHW to correct haste</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haste &gt; all, with no other effect do you get such a large gain in damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As several others have said, haste &gt; all.  Worry about hp/ac on all the rest of your gear but for haste just get the best haste percentage you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just another thought on this...  If it has been determined that weapon proc rates are based solely on dexterity, independent of attack speed; and most warriors rely on weapon procs for a huge majority of their agro;  would it not make sense to ditch a weak haste item, for a nice piece of HP/AC gear ?  I mean, you're getting the same agro *dps agro is minimal imo, possibly unless you have an incredibly high damage weapon, which is not in the reach of your average tank; only a select few*, so why not increase your tanking ability instead ?   I am mainly thinking of a raid situation here, where the extra DPS from haste would be minimal, while the extra HP/AC from changing from say, a FBSS to a Heavy Rubicite Girdle would be noticeable ?  In your typical single group situation, each person is a good chunk of that group's DPS, so that situation might be different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even using the incredibly gimpy FBSS as an example, look at it this way...if a haste item gives you 21% more swings, can you honestly say that replacing it for a belt with 25 AC and approximately 113 HP's (including STA boost) is going to lower the amount of damage you take by 21%?<br />
<br />
I know I'm kind of comparing apples and oranges with that example, but you get the idea that the benefit you get from 21% more swings of your weapons far outweighs the benefit you get from 25 AC and 113 or so HP's.<br />
<br />
Especially in raid situations, 113 HP's is maybe a quarter to one third of an average hit from a raid mob. I can count in the fingers of one hand the number of times that I can honestly say that an extra 100 HP's saved me from death. I *can* say with total confidence that 21% more swings in *each and every fight* has helped me immensely.<br />
<br />
Now, use a more normal haste percentage that you would have if you're able to use a Heavy Rubicite Belt (level 51...say a 26% or 31% haste item...they're getting pretty cheap these days...certainly within the price range of a heavy rubicite belt, if not less, and some of them have good stats as well), and the odds are even more in favor of a haste belt.<br />
<br />
The only reason to replace a haste belt is because you got better haste from a cloak or some other item in another slot.<br />
<br />
I must concur: haste &gt; all</div></div><hr />

Incorrect.  Dps is a very large part of aggro, one that many people overlook.  Procs are good aggro, but how do you keep aggro on the fights you only proc a few times?  Dps is the more reliable part of aggro, and contributes quite a bit, even if you don't have access to upper level items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going by my own experience here.  My DPS weapon is a windblade.  It has next to no agro.  <br />
<br />
Even in the fights where you only proc a few times, it is still that proc that keeps you at the top of the agro list, as well as proximity,etc.  It's not that your DPS is gaining you more agro; it's only that your DPS is helping keep you up with all the other damage dealers.  Factors such as taunt, procs *even many rounds ago*, proximity, etc. are what keep you holding agro.  Again, if DPS was much agro, no rogues/monks/wizards/druids/rangers would ever live past the first few rounds of any fight.  /shrug<br />
<br />
And as for the haste vs. HP/AC gear argument...  In a raid situation, is doing an extra 31-41% of an already extremely minimal amount of DPS *when compared to the over-all DPS of the entire raiding group*, going to benefit the raid more than say even a 1% increase in tanking ability ?   While it's true, it's almost never that a tank is healed with so few HP's that 1 item makes or breaks it; but when the benefits of that 1 item are added up over a very long battle, I'd have to wonder myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aggro for what you do is modified depending on class.  Look at a bard, they are tuned down to get very low aggro, even doing high aggro things (slow on inc, stun procs, etc).  Another example: I use the exact same weapon that our monks use.  They have the same amount of haste as I do, and more offensive aas.  The weapon proc is very low aggro.  Yet they rarely need to FD, even standing at the same distance from the mob that I am, and sometimes closer when we're being lazy about it.<br />
<br />
Dps is important, hell, I used to keep aggro with dual lammys.  Procs are very nice for a burst of aggro, but dps is what sustains you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll disagree with you on this.  From my own experience, I held aggro much better DW a frosty and a centi ls, than I did with windblade.<br />
<br />
As another comparison, when I was DW a frosty and a fleshgrinder, I main handed the frosty over the fg, as it gave me better agro, even with the fg's higher dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need to take into account the gameplay of the original poster. They are level 55 and are buying gear, so they are not in a daily raiding guild looking at it on the surface, so his DPS will be signifigant for an experience group, or a guild group in a place where 55ish characters raid such as Kael. They also said that no-drop stuff is beyond them for the moment. Raiding is a very small portion of the game for all but the upper end players, and it takes quite awhile to get to the upper end. Once a player is at the upper end, they will almost always have looted some good no-drop dragon haste along the way so the big trade-off of haste vs HP/AC becomes a moot point<br />
<br />
Peddy...Yes the higher haste is definately worth the plat to get it in your situation. I went from SCHW to a Spiked Seahorsehide Belt, which is 34%. With that, I'm set till I progress enough to get a no-drop haste item. The 34% plus Level 56 Enchanter or Shaman haste (min Celerity from Shaman) puts me at least 84% haste...more than adequate for experience grouping, close to the epic'd Rogues/Rangers who have the ability to dump agro should they gain it while I taunt agro back to me</div></div><hr />

how is 36% haste almost all of half of the delay<br />
<br />
remember: 100% haste= half the delay not all of it.</div></div><hr />
