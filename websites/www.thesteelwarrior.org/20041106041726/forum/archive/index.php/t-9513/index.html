<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I decided to go with a warrior. I know hybrids get both melee skills and a spellbook but I love tanking. I guess I am masochistic at heart.  :D <br />
<br />
Going with a human for race.  I know there are better choices but I like humans because of a RP feel, they look good in armor, and they are not too big nor too short.<br />
<br />
Since I am just starting, I have no cash so I will probably start collecting bone chips, silks, pelts, etc. and put them on a mule in the bazaar to sell.  I thought I would get some thoughts on what I'll try to buy when I get funds to purchase things and how long these things should last me.  Here is the list: <br />
<br />
Armor:  Newbie armor<br />
Haste: FBSS<br />
1hs: Silvery War Axe or maybe a Centi SS<br />
1hb: Blackjack<br />
2hs: BABS (someone was kind enough to give me this, Cracked Darkwood Shield, and a Nether Chitin)<br />
2hb: Abandoned Orc Shovel? (not sure of name)<br />
Pierce: Shimmering Partisan? (not sure of name)<br />
<br />
I know I am missing a few slots to fill so any friendly advice would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, the whole pelts/silks/tradeskill items t sell to make money is a great start; and no matter what the level you can still pull in a small profit from it....<br />
<br />
But in regards to armor; well; as a reference I wore bronze armor until my late 30's and got my first haste item on my first trip to Plane of Air ( old ) ; and, umm....things last as long as you let them last.<br />
you're on your way; and the items you listed will definately get some lng-term usability since you're starting rom level 1.<br />
<br />
Just be smart; don't waste your money on frivelous krap; and make realistic goals to accomplish and work towards them. Plan for each ten levels to have 'item' or 'skills' or to try new places out. keep an pen mind and thnings will come your way.<br />
<br />
best of luck with it !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm almost certain I tanked Naggy once with a shimmering partisan in my offhand. (I'm sure it was Naggy; not sure about the weapon. But I know at one point I would have considered it.) It's 17/39 20 Dex, 10 fire &amp; cold, I think. Strength in there too, maybe.<br />
Some of the newbie armor drops for the one character I've quested such things for are rarer than other drops. Consider some of the LDoN smithed stuff (gothic, frosted) for fill-in stuff. I found I that that untwinked alt had enough plat to buy that armor from camping (and failing to get) some of the newbie armor drops.<br />
Came across some bronze armor the other day while farming smithing stuff and meh, couldn't give it away. Found it oddly difficult to click the &quot;sell&quot; button on it at the vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was wondering if I should just start on a preferred server (Morden Rasp, Maelyn Starpyre or something close to that spelling  :p ) or just start on an old server?</div></div><hr />
