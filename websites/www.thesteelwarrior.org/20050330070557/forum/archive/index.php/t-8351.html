Best I remember the lil spiders stayed mez locked until after Sigis was dead.  Once you kill Dust a few times and complete your Xegony key... stay away, very far away.<br />

PoAir + Spiders = Death!</div></div><hr />

Be ready for them, they tend to reset for a few times if your guild finish the archwalker script in more than 30 minutes... One of the rogues told me you have to reaggro the spiders when kiting to keep them from resetting, I have no clue what he was talking about tho.<br />

Just have chanters CC them, or tank them if you have the resources too.  They're not too horrible, just inconvient.</div></div><hr />
