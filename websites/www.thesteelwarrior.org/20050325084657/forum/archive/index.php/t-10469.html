<br />
ok its too damn big to cut n paste it all into here (four friggin posts worth on the WoW boards), but some of this is funny<br />
As such, in response to the myriad of posts that offer the shocking revelation that DW has a higher miss chance than 2h or 1h+s, I’d like to say that it really isn't necessary to inform us of this. We know this, that's how we made it, thanks again for the reminder. ;] Also, it seems these revelations often imply that since DW has a higher miss chance, that the DPS isn’t as good as 2h, which (as explained above) simply isn’t factual.<br />
ahhh, bnet discovers dice!<br />
First, a few minor notes. Yes, slow weapons will be streakier then fast weapons, causing you to notice it more when you fail to hit the opponent. This isn't something that is likely to change, it's just a basic property of the psychology involved with having fewer random events in a given time versus more. It’s probably worth reminding everyone that you're also going to get a more substantial effect on a single fight from streaks of hits, which, after decimating the enemy in a few swift blows, you aren't likely to come to these forums to express discontent about. ;] <br />
oh noz there are roaches in WoW!<br />
Now, regarding improving the warrior’s overall rage generation. We've found that there are indeed a few issues with rage generation as a result of bugs. Warriors (and druids in bear form) are intended to gain some rage on block,dodge,parry events, but apparently this isn't working correctly. This needs to be fixed asap in order for warriors to meet their total expected rage generation. <br />
<br />
In addition, while our tests have indicated that players are getting the intended 5% miss rate while using a single max-skill weapon against even level enemies (yes, we've tested this exhaustively, and cannot reproduce the 9% miss rate you're reporting for normal swings), we have found the bug causing abilities (ie: heroic strike, sunder armor, etc) to miss around 9-10% of the time under the above conditions instead of the intended 5%. This does mean that warriors are getting the &quot;miss&quot; even about twice as often as they should. Obviously, this needs to be rectified asap, since it directly impacts the warriors DPS and rage use (since missing wastes 20% of the rage cost of the ability). <br />
oooooooooooooooo gooodie.... RE: Execute<br />
First, it's worth noting that the full consumption of rage upon missing is a bug that will be fixed. <br />
BURN NOW!<br />
Third, the reduced rage cost means that against key &quot;boss&quot; monsters, you will be able to use the ability as many as 3 times instead of 2 times. This can make a very significant difference in terms of how difficult it is to finish of a very difficult boss encounter.<br />
hitpoints? we dont need no steeking hitpoint!<br />
First, the way Health gain on level-up works is balanced between classes to get all classes to our target expected base Health values. The mere fact that it is &quot;working as intended&quot; for all classes means it's meaningless to imply that the system is unfair to warriors, yet somehow not to other classes. Of course we could change the methodology for how Health gain is calculated on level-up, but in the end warriors (and all the other classes) would still have the same amount of Health. <br />
<br />
So, while it’s fair to state your opinion that warriors should have more health, I don’t see any valid connection between that opinion and your jab at the methodology for arriving at the health numbers. Using that approach again smacks much more of an attempt to get “/signed” responses for a change you would personally like to see than it does of presenting constructive feedback. <br />
<br />
Second, as far as I’m aware, naked warriors do have more health then naked characters of other classes (they’re certainly intended to). To imply that WoW has some kind of wacky design where Warriors have less health than other classes strikes me yet again as another attempt to mislead other players into thinking that there is a design flaw when there isn’t necessarily one. <br />
<br />
That being said, you’re claiming an imbalance exists is because a warrior that focuses on getting gear with stats other than stamina gear can end up having a lower total health then another character that focuses on stamina equipment, I still don’t see the argument as entirely valid. That scenario seems more like a conscious choice on the part of the players involved, and evidence that WoW has interesting and meaningful equipment choices.<br />
/target Paladin<br />
/cast Nerf Bat<br />
it’s also worth mentioning that not only are there some balance issues being resolved with Paladins (ie: the fix to seal of the crusader which gives paladins both superior survivability and superior damage output), but there are some things I should clarify about the design intent of warriors and paladins. <br />
<br />
While paladins are indeed intended to be the most survivable of any class in the game (players sometimes assume warriors are, which is not the case), paladins aren’t intended to make the best “tanks” in the game, or to have superior offensive abilities then warriors. What this means is that survivability alone does not a tank make. <br />
<br />
The other key concept to tanking is the ability to hold agro on mobs (especially simultaneously on multiple mobs). This is the key difference between warriors and paladins in PvE. Simply put, warriors are intended to be the best at holding agro against multiple mobs (which will also be a more clear distinction once the Seal of the Crusader bug is fixed). So, assuming a group scenario that includes healers, a warrior’s survivability rivals that of a paladin’s, with the warrior having very significant advantages in terms of holding agro.<br />
*best Chef voice* &quot;Yes children, warriors are tanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Q u o t e:<br />
<br />
Uniqueness: Warriors do not have any specific traits or abilities which set them apart from other classes. The idea of Auto-Attack-And-AFK presides for the class, as there is generally little interaction required for combat. There are no perks to playing a Warrior. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No specific traits or abilities? You mean like stances? Rage? Disciplines like retaliation and recklessness? <br />
<br />
Auto-attack-and AFK? Um… yeah, I do really well when I don’t push buttons as a warrior. :/ I really can’t find it in myself to remotely agree with this statement… it strikes me as pure drama. If playing a warrior involves little interaction for combat, why is it that group success is often made or broken by the skill of the player playing the warrior. I would wager to say that even today, the success of a group is determined as much, and possibly more, by the skill of a tanking warrior then that of any other class. <br />
<br />
No perks? You mean aside from being an indispensable part of most instance runs? The ability to use ranged weapons (unlike a paladin)? The ability to both close distance on a target and slow the target once you get to them? Carrying out an opponent’s death sentence once they reach 20% health? <br />
<br />
Really now, you’re going to have a very hard time convincing me that warriors suffer from a “uniqueness” problem. <br />
i think this pic sums the whole thing up nicely:</div></div><hr />

Dear Kalgran, <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your long and thoughtful letter to the warrior community. Yet many warriors feel your letter was more alarming than reassuring. <br />
<br />
Your letter is alarming first of all because it appears to me that you are still unware the extent to which the warrior class is under-powered and how servere the problems that plague us (esp. in PvP). Instead, you seem to believe our problems are minor, and that a few cosmetic fixes will bring the us up to par. (Or as you say, a lot of our complaints are &quot;pure drama.&quot;)...<br />

That's probably my biggest concern as well.  As it stands Warriors solo very slowly compared to most other class and suffer more down time.  If they don't adjust that in some fashion, they're really not &quot;fixing&quot; the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm really curious where everyone is getting this conception, atm I'm just not buying it.<br />
<br />
Have you ever seen a mage actually soloing?  Of course not, he's acutally sitting on the ground there drinking as you pass by.  Ever seen a paladin solo?  Of course you have, because he's been figthing that same mob for the past 5 mins to get it to 50%.  Ever seen a druid solo?  Ever seen a druid?  I mean a real druid, not a motw bot.<br />
<br />
Once you get past the character masterbation that everyone has when they post on forums, classes that are non rogue/hunter do not solo much better, or even better at all, than warriors.  Given that  there are actually 8 classes, not 2, warriors are not in that bad shape.<br />
<br />
And since rogue/hunter has larger issues with group utility, having them ahead of everyone else with regards to solo isn't a really bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yaeh, people on bliz forums seams to forget that Warcraft was originally a RTS game : a fight between two armies, not a FPS (ala Doom) nor a HaS (ala Diablo) nor a duel gane (ala Street fighters) were it was you against the univers (or only one).<br />
The future of WoW is battleground which is a PvP environement but not a 1v1 (like it's growing on PvP servers) but an AvA (army versus army). The game will be (and should be) balanced around this; not around a PK  or &quot;Who's the biggest P****?&quot; contest. I was planing to play on a PvP server because I wasn't in the mood to limit myself into battleground, I was willing to extent the AvA all around the world, but seeing how many 'tard players plays on PvP just to mesure their 'int between legs' size I am really getting bad feeling of the ambiance on PvP server. Thus I might try a RP server if they are PvP (75% of RP players want them to be PvP, and since the decision isn't fixed yet in Europe, we might have a chance to got one).<br />
We, warriors, are lucky enougth to have been designed for large scale fights while Paladins have been designed for single encounters (thus the power diefrence in 1v1 and soloability). Indeed, the dev said Paladins are meant to have the larger survability but that warriors are meant to shine when tanking multiple mobs. That's why we will have a very large impact on battlegrounds were single pull has no meaning.<br />
After the few tweaks we will get from bugs' corrections and some talents adjustement (I hope tactical mastery will decrease to entre-tree) we will certainly be much more valid since our rage should increase faster letting us play has indended.<br />

Yes I have.  I've watched mages solo, yes they sit on their butts a lot, every second or third kill.  And I've watched Paladins solo,  going from one mob to the next for a number of kills in a row.  I don't know who you've been watching, but it sure isn't the same classes and players I've been watching.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it takes a mage about 15 seconds to kill a mob.  So even if they had as much down time as Warriors, they'd still be gaining xp at well over double the rate a Warrior would.</div></div><hr />

If you choose a protection build/ sword and board then dont be alarmed if you don't solo as well as other classes. Taking 15-20+% less dmg but extending the fight for 30+ seconds vs. dropping a normal solo exp mob (-2 to +2 ) mob in 10-20 seconds is gonna increase your down time. I know this isn't gonna work for high lvl instances, but we are talking about soloing here. Blizzard threw Warriors a seriously nice bone when they gave us a working fast healing First Aid, with first aid I (MS/SS dmg inclined talent build) go 6-10+ exp. quality mobs then drop a 600-1000+ bandage and go right back to grinding. So if you want to survive instances and or duo then be happy with a protection build, If you want to drop exp lvl non-elites in 15 seconds like a mage can then go MS/SS etc. build. But don't complain about mages/rogues being solo monsters when they go into an instance pull aggro quite easy and die because they solo too much.</div></div><hr />

I solo just fine.  In fact, until recently its been my prefered method of grinding exp.  Its a little tougher at 45, but only cause the fights last longer.  As long as I am able to keep it to single pulls, I can solo almost non-stop (a bandaid every few mobs aint enough to slow me down ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've got SS.  Doesn't do a damn thing to help you solo a 1v1 mob.  It works like this, when you fire off Sweeping Strike, any hit you make on your current target also hits it's closest friend.  So you effectively hit two mobs, like with a cleave, at the same time.  And you can stack cleave and sweeping strike together, so it's possible to hit the second mob for a cleave and the damage the cleave did to the first mob combined.   It has on a number of occassions pulled my bacon out of the fire when I've gotten an add.  Other than retaliation it really is the only way I know of possibly surviving an add.  But it's also just as likely to leave me facing a single mob with about half life, as my HP quickly dribbles into nothingness.  However, if the mob you're facing has no friend, SS does absolutely nothing except cost you rage.  If you had SS you'd know that.  The fact that you seem to think SS actually increases the speed at which one solos tells me that you don't really know much about the ability and that your claims of Warriors being able to kill mobs in 15 seconds is not based on personal experience.  The only mobs I've ever killed in 15 seconds have been casters.  And even still they usually manage to take me down to at least half life even if I've managed to pummel interrupt their casting every time pummel cycles through.<br />
<br />
Perhaps other Warriors who regularly kill mobs in 15 seconds can describe how they do that.  Obviously I haven't found that to be true and I'd be interested in hearing about their actual builds that they've personally experienced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course everyone's definition of fun is slightly or dramatically different.  It's great you're enjoying your Warrior.  That is of course why you continue to pay your monthly fees, to have some enjoyment.  Be that as it may, it doesn't disprove the fact that Warriors kill mobs more slowly than other classes such as Hunter, Rogue, and Mage.  And it doesn't disprove the fact that classes like Paladin have significantly less down time.  The combination of low DPS and high down time combine to mean that Warriors kill fewer mobs per unit of time and therefore gain experience, while soloing, at a much slower rate than most other classes.  If you're enjoying leveling at a slower rate than most other classes, more power to you.  I however would prefer that, unlike say EQ which stuck it to the Warrior class from the word go, that in WoW there be at least some parity between Warriors and other classes in the rate at which they solo.  Call me an enternal optimist, but just because WoW Warriors are better than EQ Warriors doesn't make them perfect.</div></div><hr />

Cool, what fucking level are you Haass?  And how do you keep fucking bandages in stock?

And one run thru an instance yields about 9 fucking stacks of silk, which equates to 4.5 stacks of bandages, 640hp a pop, and since I've only got about 3khp, I dunno what the fuck you're fighting that requires you to have so goddamned much downtime.  Bear in mind, that all of my mageweave goes to my tailor friend, so I could be making even better bandages, but choose to gimp myself purposely.<br />

I rarely drop below half life killing a mob.  2 mobs might take me to 1/3.  If I lose 1khp and drop a bandage, then go find something else to fight, I've basically regenned to full life.<br />

54ish mobs (talking non-elite here) shouldn't be hitting anywhere NEAR ~213 per hit.  I think I'd be hard pressed to find a non-named Elite that hit for that much, in fact.   Normal mobs hit me for maybe 40-50, which would make a heavy silk heal around 13-16 hits or so.<br />

Not saying Heavy Silk is the end all, be all of bandages (I use runecloth/heavy runecloth exclusively), but exaggeration is not helping your cause here.<br />

<br />
I'll admit that 213 a hit is probably a bit on the high side.  But I have been hit for as much as 180 by even con level 54 mobs.  Defensive stance reduces your damage taken, but also means that you kill slower.  Battle stance, which is what I prefer to use when I'm going up against a single solo mob, lets you kill faster but you take more damage.  If I'm going 1hander and shield, I may lose 1/4 to 1/3 of my HP.  But it takes significantly longer than 15 seconds to kill that mob.  And if I go battle stance, I'm still not hitting anywhere near 15 seconds and I'm more likely to be at 1/2 or less on HP.</div></div><hr />

And why wouldn't I expect to be able to solo level 54 mobs at level 54?  I imagine you're probably going to tell me I should be soloing level 51 or 50 mobs, and probably from a safety and xp efficiency stand point you're right.  But when I see other classes soloing 0 to +3 mobs without breaking a sweat, it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect to solo even cons efficiently.</div></div><hr />

You're right, the runecloth drops are decent.  But the undead are way over camped by the soloing Mages, Hunters, and Paladins that often times I have a hard time even finding a mob standing.</div></div><hr />

If you go dual wield/2h its entirely feasible to drop equal lvl mobs in under 30 seconds usually much faster. I said MS/SS earlier becuase SS usually goes along with an Arms build and works very nicely when your soloing and pull an add. Fighting lvl 46-50 ogres yields tons of mageweave and I usually end up selling off a stack or two every trip to Tanaris after making up for far and beyond any I use during my exp grinds. I fully intend to respec to a protection build once I hit 60, but for now I solo 90% of the time and with Arms talent build I have zero complaints.... only down time is when my bags fill up and I need to go sell off junk. The only time I ever get into trouble soloing is when I get a wild hair up my a** and attack a mob +3-4 lvls higher or pull and add thats +3-4 higher.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most efficient way to grind is with food or bandages and fighting stuff below you.  I grinded the whole way from about lvl 45-52 (lvl I am now).  I did it on &quot;squishy&quot; targets that were mostly casters.  Mind you, I fought mostly Naga type creatures for a good 5 lvls.  They drop good coin, but no materials for bandages.<br />
<br />
I'm an MS build and I tear thru them like paper.  It actually got faster when I was a few lvls higher than them.  My crit % was hovering about 18% so I was critting a LOT.   I would usually kill them faster than my charge could refresh, and I was able to pull singles.<br />
<br />
I can kill about that rate, perhaps even faster with my shadow priest now (lvl 35 last night).  Mind you this is against higher lvl, or even con mobs.  Casters you have to realize, kill things fast.  Priest do it slower than Mages, but we use less mana and have ways of regening mana.  You see, mana regens during the fight if you don't cast anything, health does not.<br />
<br />
Now mages can summon their own water.  This ability is huge, and offsets their downtime.  They can kill 2-3 mobs in about 8-15 secs each, then it takes them about 20 secs to sit and drink.  Since they summon their own water, you do all that BEFORE you go out and grind.  I usually get a stack of 100 water from them before I leave IF and move to my grind spots.  With the good water, I tell you that downtime is NOTHING.  Sitting and eating is about the same speed of bandages, but warriors usually kill things slower.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe me, try it out.  I'm not even going to go into rogues, they solo like nuts.  Hunters can use their pets and you can just fall asleep soloing.  Generally warriors solo ok, but they kill at a medium rate.  We are most efficient at lower lvl mobs, which means less downtime for us and less exp overall.  It sorta puts other classes above warrior solo ability because of their utilities.  You won't get single pulls all the time and if you play on a pvp server, theres no quick way of escape.  These two factors generally tip the warrior solo ability downwards enough to make the other classes solo faster than us.</div></div><hr />

Warriors in WoW are solo gods compared to EQ warriors but very underperforming compared to other WoW classes. To me, soloability is a function of three things: Survivability, Damage Rate, Escape options.<br />
<br />
Our total package of the above is far lower than any class I can think of with the exception of druids 45+ (I don't have enough data or experience with one to tell you either way). I have duo'd on and off with a 56 priest guildmate of mine. In self buffed shadow form (her solo stance) she is capable of tanking about 80% as well as I am able to in plate armor in battle stance with a high level blue two hander. Oh yeah, and mind flay does 200 dps RAW! This is not even including her dot damage. Combine this with the ability to self heal and shield if shit hits the fan, she is able to solo +2 to +3 with *ease* in her words &quot;sometimes elites give me problems.&quot; WTF sometimes??? Fighting elites for me is an epic battle of potion quaffing, stance twisting, and use of ever timer in the book.<br />
<br />
Perhaps with the rage boost we will be getting we can do enough additional damage to remain competitive solo -- we'll just have to see. I've always been of the opinion that our total damage output is far lower than it should be considering how weak our total solo package is right now.<br />
<br />
People keep pushing back on my suggestions with random incoherent 'WTF U WANT TANK ROGUE GTFO!!11~' argument. I don't demand to be a god damn tank rogue. I want to do as well, solo, on *even level* mobs as all other classes.<br />
<br />
Rogues do roughly 3x our dps or more on even level targets. Rogue damage on +1 to +2 targets are far higher than 3x. There is *plenty* of room between us and rogue dps levels for us to grow into to make us more viable solo and in PVP without disenfranchising the leather melee class.<br />
<br />
Until then, I'm stuck soloing -4s and -2 quests.<br />
<br />
Before you start laughing me off with &quot;your gear sucks&quot; excuses and &quot;you can't play a warrior&quot; BS. Here's my typical solo profile http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?28410 (well, except for the carrot on a stick -- usually this is a Mark of the Chosen). I can't prove that I'm not a shitty warrior to you though -- you'll have to either trust me when I say I'm not or ask the number of people I've annhilated in PVP with my &quot;gimp class&quot; or look through the list instances I've successfully tanked for my guild groups.<br />

<br />
I have sat down and watch other rogues (almost universally combat rogues) solo stuff and it is not as fast as you think it is.  Dagger can be faster but requires more effort than what should be necessary (have to mentally count energy ticks to get 2 backstabs in on every kidney shot).  But since I know that warriors obviously do quite a bit less damage than a rogue, that means warriors solo even slower than I think they do.<br />
<br />
You're not going to solo a mob in 15 seconds consistently as a Warrior.  That's roughly the speed of a combat rogue on things that you can almost kill by just dumping a bar of energy on Sinister Strike.  You might be able to kill a caster in 15 seconds if things go your way, but a rogue can do that in 5 seconds given the same conditions (e.g. crit ambush, kidney shot, crit backstab and dead).</div></div><hr />

An equal Druid, Priest, or Warlock solo slower than myself  at 32.  They even did at level 10.  I chose an Arms warrior for the ability to solo since that's how I choose to play 90% of the time.

You group with a priest that has 2k ac unbuffed?  I mean inner fire only gives 1-1.3k ac with talents.  Priests get +15% mitigation from shadowform, but don't get parry, so that's -10%.

<br />
<br />
Well first off, fighting elites, you can't use shadowform, since they have too much hps and you'll have to heal yourself.  So already knock off 15% off of your '200 dps number'.  Then when you realize that they take approximately 1.5x as much dmg as you (no not the 20% more dmg using your voodoo math, also no 15% from shadowform), you find out they spend half their time healing themselves.  So 'with ease' means 'not dying' but also totally means 'taking 500 years to accomplish'.   Which is about the same amt of time it takes a warrior to kill one given you go kill random little shits to get a full ragebar then fight the elite, repeat, etc.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I was about to make yet another reply in this thread to yet another glaring overexaggeration inaccuracy when I realized that no one would probably read it anyways.  <br />
<br />
If you're going to have any sort of discussion re: class balance, you have to first have a clue on what the other classes can do.  What your friend said someone else said, or what you read on b.net is so totally full of hyperbole, that of course you're going to feel underpowered.   Half the time when people report their 'normal' xp/min, it really means 'this is what i peaked at with full rest xp for 15mins until i ran out of mobs'.  While that fact is blatantly obvious to anyone that is in the class, spectators who haven't experienced it themselves seem to be easily fooled into thinking that's how it actually works.<br />
<br />
If i wanted to read how mages can kill 5 mobs in 20seconds blindfolded while silenced AND 2boxing a pg trial at the sametime in another window, i'd go read wow.com.  You actaully could convince me that warriors have solo issues, if you didn't use ficticious hyperbole to back up every single one of your 'facts'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your mindflay channeling shit doesn't hold much water. The sick amount of dps she unloads from just her dot and flay together result in a gibbed mob before it even gets to her. Your argument about the elite taking forever is valid. But note that it wouldn't take a similarly long time for me to kill the same elite -- nope it would never get to that point because I'd be dead or running. (Unless we are talking about mage elites that I manage to interrupt at key times -- the only kind i have any sort of success with).<br />

Oh and one more point: I played a priest in beta from the 2nd phase of alpha on so SHOCKINGLY I might actually know the feel and effectiveness of a priest solo right before release. Would you mind telling me what level your warrior is?<br />

Trust me, it was MUCH easier at this point in the game than it is on my retail warrior.<br />

Right now, we dont seem to get quite the boost we should out of our abilities and talents due to lack of rage.  When that and the known bugs are fixed I hope a lot of folks will be a bit more happy with their warriors cause they pretty much deliver on what they say they will do.  <br />

I know a whole world of combos will open up when we all actually have some friggin rage to work with.  Slam not resetting your swings will be a major boost for defensive warriors.

<br />
What math ? You didn't say how much mana it takes to kill things. Also, your out of combat mana regeneration rate is, what, 56 ? 70 mana a second ?<br />
<br />
In any case I would much prefer to spend 40 seconds killing a mob then 10 seconds bandaging rather than 10 seconds killing a mob and 30 seconds resting even though the latter is obviously faster levelling. Shrug, people's mileage varies, that's why there are different classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because i thought it was pretty obvious that you wait to drink until you're lom/oom to due to the 5sec rule.   Drinking twice in a row for 7k mana is way more efficient than drinking at two different times for 3.5k mana each.<br />
<br />
So i grabbed a fairly mediocre frost mage and ran some tests.  L60, 5.9k manapool, +3% critrate from items, crown of the penitent, shard of afrassa, spirit of aquementas, etc.  +28 from dmg foci.<br />
<br />
The absolute most efficient i could do (ie chain frostbolt, hit AM when clearcasting triggers, totally ignore dmg and use a boxed priest to heal) was 4mobs per manabar -- it's actaully fairly consistent.  It takes almost exactly 40seconds drinking from that point to med to nearly full (obviously you want to leave 200-300mana left over to regen while you run to the next mob).  Each mob took roughly 8 frostbolts to kill, so say 20-30secs combat each. <br />
<br />
Assuming fire mages kill twice as fast for a totally minimal loss of efficiency (it's closer to around 10% in this case, since he doens't have the +15% frost efficiency), you're looking at 10-15secs per mob with a 40sec med every 4 mobs.<br />
<br />
Which means, with totally optimal conditions on a -4 mob, (ie totally ignoring taking any dmg, resists, the +10% efficiency of frost) and assuming every pull is a singlepull from nearly max distance to avoid interruption time, then yes, it is possible reach the absolute low-end of your estimation.<br />
<br />

It comes from the fact that when we duo similar shit for hours her HP bar is 80% my HP bar's size after we both are done with the mob.<br />

Compare with<br />

<br />
56 priest guildmate of mine. In self buffed shadow form (her solo stance) she is capable of tanking about 80% as well as I am able to in plate armor in battle stance with a high level blue two hander. <br />
<br />
<br />
How on earth these are even remotely close to the same statements boggles my mind.  My point on gross exaggeration stands.  There's a total difference between actually tanking and whatever on earth you're describing on the first quote.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
Actually from my earlier testing with mages and the results which somewhat suprised me, i am now quite inclined to agree that you guys could use a bone.  That doesn't at all mean that your post saying that shadowpriests tank 80% as well as a warrior, or implying that they do xp grinds on elites is anything close to truthful.   Even your dps numbers are mostly exaggerated (unless you really think you're gonna have all 5 shadowvulns stacked all the time).<br />
<br />
I must say, you guys totally weaken your argument by using totally bullshit madeup facts to backup your case.  Especially when anyone familiar with the classes in question knows they aren't true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, you have to admit that killing 4 mobs in 60 seconds (15 seconds per mob) and then regening mana for 40 seconds, for a total time of 120 seconds beats hands down taking perhaps 30 seconds per mob, for 120 seconds, with a down time of perhaps 10 seconds between mobs, assuming you have a steady supply of bandages and can always immediately bandage after a fight, for a total time of 180 seconds.<br />
<br />
Taking 2 minutes to kill 4 mobs versus taking 2 minutes 40 seconds to kill the same 4 mobs may not seem like much of a difference at first.  But given that the 2 minutes 40 seconds is based on having an acquired resource available in large numbers (i.e. bandages) while the 2 minutes for Mages is based on self contained resources (they summon their own water) and you can see that the kill rate for Mages is much more easy to sustain than it is for Warriors. <br />
<br />
And in an hour's time the Mage will have killed 120 mobs while the Warrior will have killed only 100.  At something close to 200 exp each, those additional 20 mobs amount to an additional 4000 exp an hour.  In a four hour playing period the Mage is making 16,000 more exp than the Warrior.   Of course this is a &quot;class room&quot; example and doesn't take into account all sorts of variables for both characters that will impact their exp rate.   And the 30 second per mob kill for the Warrior is merely a gut feel estimate, I haven't really tested it.  So that figure could be off by a bit.<br />
<br />
Still the point stands, by killing slower than Mages yet having similar amounts of down time, Warriors will solo level at a much slower rate than Mages.  And personally I believe that in practice Warriors actually end up with more down time than Mages because of the difficulty involved with keeping bandages available.</div></div><hr />

On topic about the devs comments, I have to say, bravo! Its not often that you see such candid responses from development. I think many developers make a mistake by letting on like the players knows more about the world/class they create than the developers do. I for one like it when I'm told exactly why I'm wrong about something. Its one reason I come here, because I know the other posters here will tell me when I'm wrong, and how so, without candy coated generalizations.

<br />
Hunters, mages , rogues etc... your right all of them have greater dps and pretty much can kill faster but that's what they are a high dps class, you wanna kill fast play one.  In the end the best gears come from instances, i play prot war because i wanna be in instances or raids 95% of the time i play WoW and this is where warriors truly shine.<br />
<br />
I'm sure most of you have encountered horrible players playing all sorts of class (*cough bnet geeks*), well if any of  them played a dps it wouldn't be so bad as long as they didn't break any mez or saps etc (note i'm not even expecting them to assist), now if your healer or tank sucked then that group will wipe ALL THE TIME, so you can bitch and whine all you want fact is i'm quite proud of the way they designed the warrior.  Boring as hell solo (cause it wasn't meant to be), but godly in instances, so ya let those other dps class brag all they want about how they wtfpwnsors you by killing ghey mobs, cause this game is all about instances.<br />
<br />
It's not like we CANNOT solo, we can just a tad slower big deal.  I'll take having 6+ lvl 58+ elites constantly beating on me and keeping aggro on all of them over that extra 20~30secs solo ability anyday thx.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to what's relevant on why warrior are 'underpowered' let's face it our tree sucks ass, in fact it sux so much (compared to some other classes) that shitty ability actually seems decent, and yet we're 'playable' so any bones they toss at us can only make things better.  Aside from the fact that some talents (like T clap) are totally useless upgrades, fact is the only 'build' that's half decent is the MS one as MS is still playable and arms have useful skills in it.  Aside from cruelty trying to get to flurry in that fury line means for you to dump like 15+pts into asslike abilities.  My beef is prot has like no 3rd tier good skills (shield disc and 1h spec *yawn*), if only they made SD a passive skill ....</div></div><hr />

As it happens I am the 3rd highest warrior in my guild and when we do instances I have NEVER been the highest tank in the group. Since the pets can tank better than I can in instances, even your 'warriors shine in instnaces' argument fails. If you have a higher (4 levels i not uncommon in my instance groups) Wizard or Hunter in the group, you are not going to be tanking. <br />
<br />
I can tell you at 52 fighting 50-52 mobs I have never had to wait for charge to refresh. The Felstone Field does happen to have plentiful bandages and as an undead I will often eat my kills to keep bandages around for times when I am fighting non-humans. <br />
<br />
Canabalize is on a two minute timer.  Most of the time I can use it every other fight. If I hit a string of 50's then it probably wont be ready before I attack the 3rd.  As we get log parsers we will definatly get better numbers.<br />
<br />
-boy...just how do rogues suck in groupds? With CC, pulling and great DPS I can't see why you wouldn't want one in an instance/group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boy's got some issues, not sure what they are.<br />
<br />
He's trying to use numbers to prove that he needs two drinks to restore his mana.  Yeah 7k, 3.5k for 30 secs, you totally forgot about out of combat mana regen.  Your regen alone should cover the rest of the mana recovery that you need.  Basically you sit and drink for 30 secs (instead of my 20 secs), its still one drink.  And I was refering to lvl 30-50'ish where water is still more potent that higher up.  I believe higher lvl summoned water isn't as good the closer you get to 60, and I think they are going to fix that.<br />
<br />
Anyways, mages can kill non-stop inbetween kills.  You can kill about 4 mobs before having to sit and drink.  We usually have to heal/bandage/eat inbetween fights if we fight mobs our same lvl.  You barely get hit so its just mana mana mana for you.  Again, I watched a mage fight nonstop, only sitting to drink every few kills.  He wasn't sitting as long as I was.<br />
<br />
Shadow priests get a whole mess of +shadow damage talents and items.  The items alone add +10-+15 or so damage per spell per item.  It adds up fast.  We also get shadow weaving which adds 15% to all shadow damage, darkness which adds another 10%, AND shadow form for an ADDITIONAL 15%.  They add up to a whole LOT of damage using very efficient spells like mind flay.  You CAN fight elites in shadowform, if you speced discipline.  Being able to bubble yourself every 15 sec, plus vamp embrace, + 15% melee mitigation, + impr inner fire, + impr fort, etc make a shadow form priest pretty hard to take down my friend.<br />
<br />
Now Im not sure which mobs you are fighting.  There are mobs out there that are casters and have next to nothing for hp's.  I fight these mobs as my warrior because I kill them fast and I interrupt their spell casting.  As a DPS class, mages should be able to take them out super super fast.  That and since they have next to nothing HP's, you use a LOT less mana.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to make the argument that soloing is the way to go, or saying that warriors should be comparable soloers.  I'm just saying that warriors do just an ok job of soloing, other classes can do it much faster.  It's not just dps, its utility too.  When I grind out with my priest all I need is some summoned water off a friendly mage.  When I start out to grind with my warrior, I need sharpening stones, bandages, food, and potions for those moments I get adds.  Which is easier to deal with?<br />
<br />
Also according to that post by Kalgan on the WoW Forums, if you read it again we are plagued with 5 bugs.  Here's a link to a post I made about his response: Lore's Post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-warrior&amp;t=82872&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post82872).  It basically says that once those bugs are fixed, we are &quot;working as intended&quot;.  They have the time to nerf and stealth nerf certain abilities, but don't have the time to fix our bugs.<br />
<br />
And -boy, do you even play a warrior?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The arguement that it has always been that way is not a valid one that it should continue to be that way.  Blizzard seems to have done good things for Rogues, allowing them to solo very effectively.  It doesn't seem like doing similar good things for Warriors is an unreasonable expectation.  <br />
<br />
I don't know why people are making such a big fuss about faster kill rate etc.. like i don't give a rat's ass that X class can solo X mob for X secs faster (including dt), this does not have any bearing as to why warrior seems underpowered to some.<br />
<br />
It's actually fairly easily applied fundamental logic.  If a class has high DPS and therefore kills faster, then it should have greater down time.  If a class has low DPS and therefore kills slower, then it should have lower down time.  Balancing these two aspects equates to a more even exp rate for each class.  Having a class with a high DPS rate and low down time means you've given a significant leveling advantage to that class (i.e. Hunters).  Having a class with a high DPS rate and similar down times means you've also given a significant leveling advantage to that class (i.e. Mages).  Giving a class low DPS and high down time means you've basically screwed that class in comparison to the others (i.e. Warriors as they stand today).<br />
<br />
I suppose that much of this would be moot if Warriors were actually a blast to solo, but frankly they're not.  Having to solo against green con mobs to exp efficiently doesn't tend to make one feel &quot;powerful&quot;.  And knowing that most every other class out there can solo exp against even cons up to +3 just reinforces that feeling of being less powerful.  I spent 4 years in EQ feeling like everyone else's meat shield punching bag, completely unable to effectively do anything on my own.  And while WoW hasn't gone quite that far with Warriors, I'm not particularly pleased with seeing how gimped solo Warriors are in comparison to most of the rest of the game.</div></div><hr />

Actually is usually is that way, just not for the warrior.  Paladins dps is awful if they spec protection.  My bro's a thornadin paladin, relying on his shield and spike to dish out the pain.  His kill rate is incredibly slow, but he has zero downtime.  His mana regens DURING the fight so he can just heal up at the end and then pick a new target.  Its slow but its non-stop.<br />
<br />
It's not just grind either.  Doing quests and such are much easier and much faster with other classes.  The ability to heal is huge and will totally dominate pvp.  If you have a raid force of all dps vs another raid force of decent dps and the ability to heal, which do you think will win?</div></div><hr />

I have seen no eveidence that once I break lvl 50 I'm suddenly gonna stop being able to solo effectively. I mean am I suppose to believe in 3 lvls suddenly everything Ive been fighting will become 3 times as strong as the lvl 47-49's Ive been fighting? With my Arms build and Working weapon switch to get really big hits with my 2hander when Fury Abilities pop I can easily stay above 200 dps on mobs equal lvl or within one lvl of me. It's not uncommon to open up with charge and a normal round of dual wield attacks then weapon switch and pop MS/Overpower and Get another Big hit from my two hander then switch back... and see 25% or more of the mobs health gone. With high crits percentage I see up to 40% gone in 4 seconds or less. That 25-40% coupled with the speed at which an execute drops the last 20% that means I only need to drop 40-55% of the mobs health in the next 10-20 seconds.... not too terribly difficult. The only times I don't down mobs fast are when I get those anoying string of misses (Like for ten seconds while dual wielding every swing misses) Grrr I hate that. If its a mob I think I may have trouble with I usually sunder off 800-1100 armor then its back to dealing tons of dmg. Don't say it's becuase I twinked my weapons since I've seen plenty of Warriors wandering around with Thrash Blades/Phantom Blades/and Truesilver Champions. There has been plenty of times when I've been soloing near rogues/dire bear druids etc. around my lvl and dropped my mob first and been on to the next or half way thru bandaging before they finish their kill.</div></div><hr />

Namely, the part about our special attack's getting a miss rate fix and Parry's, Block's, Dodges generating rage and are not because of bugs.  These get fixed, I have little doubt it will make an impact.   <br />
<br />
However there was VERY dumb thing that he said that just is FLAT OUT NOT TRUE.<br />
<br />
He mentioned that balancing between 1h/shield, Dual weild adn 2h .. that the theory is that 2h + dual weild kill faster but that you have much more downtime than with a sword and board option so it evens out.  <br />
<br />
THis is simply false when soloing.   Even with mostly a protection build I STILL solo with my whirlwind sword in battlestance spamming HeroicStrike/overpower everychance I get because it's much faster kill with much LESS downtime than going sword and board.  This with a 25dps 1h weapon at 41 and 4k+ AC when shield is equipped(SHoudl be a lil above average at 41).  Even if I'm in defensive stance spamming shield block / revenge and slam every chance I get, 2h and battlestance = less downtime.<br />
<br />
Clearly if they expect the changes above to &quot;balance&quot; a warrior's solo ability, and it is their intent to have the 1h/shield-2h-DW options balanced as they say, then the sword and board option ISN'T working as intended at all and the mitigation for using a shiled needs increased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no numbers behind this, this is just my opinion.<br />
<br />
When using sword/board vs a two hander, most everyone kills faster with a two hander.  I find that if I use a sword/board that I take perhaps 20% less damage, but take twice as long to kill the mob.  Clearly the winner would be to just use a two hander, for a dead mob CANNOT damage you anymore.<br />
<br />
I dunno, maybe Kalgan does play a rogue.  Maybe he's a designer.  Whats good on papaer, sometimes isn't good when carried out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have shield block in defensive stance and are you using it regularly?  Because I freely admit it makes a huge difference in the amount of damage taken over the course of a solo fight.  Problem being that you're still going to have at least a minimal amount of down time between mobs and you're going to kill very slowly indeed, perhaps at half the speed of battle stance with a good 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah .. I picked up on that early.  Spamming shield block not only increases mitigation, BUT it allows you to pop revenge, which with the improved revenge talent gives it up to a 40% chance to stun the mob for 3 seconds....on paper this should = NICE mitigation boost.  However, keep in mind a shiled block in WoW ISN'T like a shield block in EQ ... it doesn't totally absorb the blow, only a portion of it (depending on the block rating of your shield).<br />
<br />
The problem is that even with a mostly protection build, you can kill fast enough with a 2h in battlestance to EASILY overcome the increased mitigation proveded by defensive stance/sword &amp; Board.  IMO, Shield's need thier block rating's looked at.  They need doubled accross the board to make them worth it.  Even with shield block to near guarentee blocking one attack per round.<br />
<br />
My current build is a   protection/ arm's build, maybe this proves that arms' is alot more powerful than protectoin.  Basically in arms I've maxed the Parry one, the Tactical mastery one, anger management, and improved over power(thought it was good &quot;bang for the buck&quot; to help DPS).    All other point's have and are planned to been spent in Protection as I am likely to be our guilds MT when we start raiding....though I plan to throw 5 points into Fury for the increased Crit rate.</div></div><hr />

I still don't understand why you want uber solo ability to go along with uber tanking Kaylin... you do realize war was 'designed' for instances right?  If  you noticed my thread it was referring to end lvl instances you know like everyone 60, so i fail to see how your 'if you have dps  class 4 lvls higher you won't be tanking etc..' is relevant at all.  Please elaborate how a pet can hold aggro on 6+mobs 58+elites, sure they prob can tank 1 really well 1on1 (i don't even know if they can), but the warrior's greatest ability is to generate and hold aggro on MULTIPLE mobs.  Ya really they do, that is why a properly played warrior really SHINES in instances.  Tanking a mob is irrelevant if the other 5+mobs beat your healer/groupmates to a bloody pulp.  I think before you start complaining about how we 'suck' solo you should try to understand the role of a warrior, and if  your still unhappy with solo then go make a solo class.<br />
<br />
War solo isn't that HORRIBLE, like you guys make it all sound it's unplayable almost.  Even if we are the WORST soloing class, it's due to 'class balance', our ability to survive and be 'wanted' in instances offsets that solo ability.  I'd rather get useful group related upgrades such as better aggro generation/rage generation etc.. rather then deal 20more dmg on Rend or some other ghey upgrades so i can solo better.<br />
<br />
I know the point is moot (depending on friends/guild) but i find the fact our solo capability is worst then a lot of class gets compensated with more random invites from strangers because they desperately need a good tank for end game instances...  It's easier to be noticed since they 'need' a tank so building a rep is easy, whereas if  your dps # 5673 on the server (even if your the god of all rogues/hunters etc..) i highly doubt u'd get random invites from strangers as much as a warrior.</div></div><hr />

Krun you don't have the chops here to take that tone with me. I am not some poor deluded fan-boi looking to build an uber tank mage. And overstating my desires is a good way to piss me off. I never said that we need to be uber-soloers and uber-tanks. There is a whole world of differance between soloing better and 'uber-soloers.'<br />
<br />
Great for the narrow window when we are max level and doing instances we will have our 3 minutes of glory. Fairly quickly you will have everything you need from the end game instances because the instances are always there and there is low competition for loot. When raiding tanking is about the least stackable trait, and for raids it seems to me that the Alliance has the better off tank in the paladin. Instance tanking is not likely to be a perminant roll for any given warrior, but a phase. (Not to mention most warrior probably won't raid and even amoung the ones who do, there is only one lead tank...)<br />
<br />
Of course your uberness at taunting and agro won't amount to a hill of beans in PVP--which is at least 1/2 the end game. That is about movement, survivability and burst damage...of which we may have one. <br />
<br />
If you are happy being a one trick pony, fine. I want a class with more depth and not a joke class in PVP.</div></div><hr />

I do, and I agree with him.<br />
<br />
We solo fine.  We're also the core of ANY fucking group that wants to succeed, especially Horde side.  I fail to see how warriors are &quot;Struggling&quot; at all, and after the rage generation gets bumped up in the next patch, we're gonna be doing even better.  MS warriors are going to be generating more rage for MS, I'm gonna be generating enough to hold aggro better against higher level mobs in instances, and everything is gonna be peachy.<br />
<br />
Due to my current schedule limitations with my normal play group, we do instances when we're all online, and mostly solo the rest of the time.  I've encountered none of these fucking issues anyone speaks of.

It is usually not my style to be this out of date with my gear but recently (past 3 levels) I've been questing/grinding xp as fast as possible so I can equip my min 58 BRS gear ;)<br />

On the other hand, I can't find a better two handed weapon atm so this is what I have. Could get a Dreadforge Retaliator but with a Doomsaw in the backpack it is kinda pointless. Or do you mean my HP total lacking horribly for a 56 or something hehe?</div></div><hr />

Spam heroic strike maybe. You need rage the most when a fight starts, not when it ends, especially in PvP. At the end it'll only give you high blood pressure (especially if you eat mutton chops or wild hog shanks). It's dangerous :eek: . I'm not going to respec to MS again. I'm happy with Fury spec and i'll eat banana bread.<br />
<br />
I totally agree that Warrior PvP is pathetic at high levels. Why is that so hard to understand. Everyone who has played WoW and knows warriors will fully agree. Now don't bring that shine in raids bullshit again please. I play on a PvP server and so I'm concerned about PvP. More rage is going to make it look shameful cause you'll be dying with a full rage bar. Frankly I don't care if our solo abilities get altered. I want some kickass ability I can rely on to PvP better.<br />
<br />
If you don't agree that warriors are weakest at PvP then name the class that is the weakest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We solo fine.  We're also the core of ANY fucking group that wants to succeed, especially Horde side.  I fail to see how warriors are &quot;Struggling&quot; at all, and after the rage generation gets bumped up in the next patch, we're gonna be doing even better.  MS warriors are going to be generating more rage for MS, I'm gonna be generating enough to hold aggro better against higher level mobs in instances, and everything is gonna be peachy.<br />
<br />
Due to my current schedule limitations with my normal play group, we do instances when we're all online, and mostly solo the rest of the time.  I've encountered none of these fucking issues anyone speaks of.  Yeah, sure, it'd be fucking nice to mow thru shit like it's candy BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE THE CLASS WITH THE BEST MITIGATION IN THE FUCKING GAME DO THAT.<br />
<br />
Jesus fucking christ.  You'd think some of you whiners never played a MMO before.<br />
<br />
No one is saying warriors aren't good in PvE.  I solo fine, I group fine, I sometimes see paladin tanking and stats and I shrug it off.  We have good aggro control and in instances we do good.  <br />
<br />
Here's the part that a LOT of people do not understand.  We are horrible in PvP.  Just because you can win a few fights doesn't mean we are fine.  Taunt and aggro control does not apply to large scale pvp.  What can you do to the 2-3 rogues that are kicking the crap outta your healers and casters?  You can't MAKE someone attack you in PvP.  You cannot shield them with your awsome hitpoints and such.  You might be able to intimidating shout them every 3 mins (if they are undead it wont work), or concussion blow them for a few secs.  Other than that, your casters are going down and theres absolutely nothing you can do about it.<br />
<br />
The other classes have at least something to offer.  Stuns, Fears (that they can use more than once every 3 mins), Crowd Control, Poly, Heals, Bubbles, something.  If you still don't understand try this. . . <br />
<br />
This is a generalization, but people don't seem to get it.  Take a group of 5 of the same class.  5 warriors, 5 priests, 5 shamen, 5 paladins, 5 rogues.  Who do you think will win?  You can state how 1 vs 1 doesn't have anything to do with group pvp, but its wrong.  Group pvp is based on YOUR contribution to the group.  Do you think they would want you in a group pvp fight because you are a warrior?  Why would anyone pick us when you could have a rogue that can sleath - backstab, a mage that can poly - insane nukes, hunters with the kiting and pets, warlocks with fear and charm, priests for their group heals - fears - shadow dps, shamens with close to the same melee as us AND spell casting heals and nukes, or paladins with their almost close to invincible builds?  <br />
<br />
PvE we are &quot;ok&quot;, PvP we need help.<br />
<br />
Some people play this game for PvE which I have no problem with.  The rest of us will be on the battlegrounds and trying to kill others to get the PvP rewards.  This game revolves around PvP like it or not.  PvE imo is only the road to equip yourself and lvl in-order TO PvP.</div></div><hr />

I am starting to think that you are poor at PvP or just like to whine. yes, we need work, and we are often ignored for the priests and mages, but we are not the helpless mewling kittens you think we are.</div></div><hr />

Could it be that Horde warrior's are NOT seeing the competition on a nightly basis for groups like Alliance warrors are?<br />
<br />
I can tell ya, I've seen more than one &quot;LF Tank, Paladin preferred&quot; in general when folk's are putting together instance groups.  <br />
<br />
My complaint however is not any of this.  My complaint,  IF THEY DO WHAT THEY PROPOSE ABOVE is merely to give shield weilder's a lil more luv'n.  <br />
<br />
XP rate from grinding between 1h/sheild and 2h or Dual weild should be roughly the same even though 2hander's are killing quicker, they are also taking more damage and have to take down time more frequently  where as a 1h / shield user is killing slower but can kill more mobs between rest/heal periods.  Right now this is out of balance and to have the fastest XP rate we're forced to go 2h.  This is the only thing I didn't see much of in the dev's post ... except that it IS how they intended it to be.  I just think they don't see that balance as being out of whack when in fact it is.  Someone using a 1h / shiled will typically have atleast as MUCH downtime as someone that 2h's, not less..... and the xp gain rate suffers from the slower kill rate.   <br />
<br />
Personally I don't think it matters THAT MUCH except in Gold/DKP you have to spend to get a good 2h as well as a good 1h+shield set up as every warrior has this option available to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I PvP a lot, mainly because Im on a PvP server.  I was kicking major butt from my 30's - 45ish.  Killed many horde players in raids, ganking them, getting ganked, etc.   I was all for warriors and had absolutely zero problems with them.  I defended the class, told lvl 60's they had no idea what the hell they were doing, and that I didn't see a problem at all. . . <br />
<br />
Then I hit 50 and for some reason it started to suck.  I had been upgrading my gear the whole time, using potions, etc.  We just don't really hold our own at higher lvls.  The only way to think that warriors are ok is if you DO NOT compare yourself with other classes.  Don't believe me then, you might have to experience it on your own.  PvP at 50-60 is pretty bad for a warrior.  I'll shutup now.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't do a damn thing to help you solo a 1v1 mob.  It works like this, when you fire off Sweeping Strike, any hit you make on your current target also hits it's closest friend.  So you effectively hit two mobs, like with a cleave, at the same time.  And you can stack cleave and sweeping strike together, so it's possible to hit the second mob for a cleave and the damage the cleave did to the first mob combined.   It has on a number of occassions pulled my bacon out of the fire when I've gotten an add.  Other than retaliation it really is the only way I know of possibly surviving an add.  But it's also just as likely to leave me facing a single mob with about half life, as my HP quickly dribbles into nothingness.  However, if the mob you're facing has no friend, SS does absolutely nothing except cost you rage.  If you had SS you'd know that.  The fact that you seem to think SS actually increases the speed at which one solos tells me that you don't really know much about the ability and that your claims of Warriors being able to kill mobs in 15 seconds is not based on personal experience.  The only mobs I've ever killed in 15 seconds have been casters.  And even still they usually manage to take me down to at least half life even if I've managed to pummel interrupt their casting every time pummel cycles through.<br />
<br />
Perhaps other Warriors who regularly kill mobs in 15 seconds can describe how they do that.  Obviously I haven't found that to be true and I'd be interested in hearing about their actual builds that they've personally experienced.<br />
<br />
<br />
No offense man but if you can't even take something you lvl either your skill or your gear is lacking. I can solo 2 58s or a 58 and a 59 or 60 at the same time and this in easter plaguelands ( they are the tougher mobs i faced). I solo them with SS btw SS rocks, if you think otherwise you are a fool.  I can solo mobs in under a minute 1v1 esp things lower than me. I think warriors do just fine compared to everyone else. I can kill 60 rogues most the time...60 hunters 90% of the time and most warriors higher than me I am currently 57 about to be 58 (4 bubbles). Also I have 120 heavy runcloth bandages and the rest is 2148 health food except for mount and hearth stone in my backpack. Its not that hard to get silk/mageweave/runecloth if you can kill something. SS does help you solo technically...if you can kill 2 at a time everypull then your xping faster. It would be easy for me to kill 2 things 3 lvls lower every fight without much rest, but I havent been fighting things lower than me lately cause im trying to get a damn Brain Hacker from 58 mobs and thats taking up all my time. Just wanted to say you or whoever said warriors cant solo are very wrong. I can solo things upto 4 lvls higher than me...in Easter Plaguelands, and they are stronger than average mobs, sometimes i have to use retaliation, but I can still kill em. Anyway...<br />

I have almost everything Bear and have 4085 hp at lvl 57 and it seems like most classes have hp that are too close to mine whether they use sta gear or not. I have almost 300 stamina, and my bro is a hunter and has i think 3400, personally i think this is too close i should have ALOT more hp, but maybe not I dont mind I can actually PvP now. When I was lower I couldnt touch other classes, but now with a little xp I know how to take most classes, priests, pallys and mages are tough. Well pallys are just gay I rock them easy, but then they stun me and heal to full...or shield and heal to full not much i can do. I try to run and bandage but they hit me from a mile away somehow. Anyway warriors should get a like 200-500hp bonus at 60 or something, that would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My gear is the best I've been able to acquire and since I SOLO most of the time, I don't have a lot of instance gear.  But every other class in the game solos just fine (except perhaps druids) without instance gear so claiming that is what it takes to solo well is a load of crap, if you were to claim such a thing.  Do I suck at playing my class?  I like to think I don't, but there is certainly no way I can convince you of that if that's what you want to think.  Maybe you have a better build.  Maybe you've got more blue gear.  Maybe you reached a point where the suckiness begins to peter off.  Maybe you're just super uber player.  Who the hell knows?  But my experiences are still my experiences.  And apparently I'm not the only one to have had them.  Can I solo an even con?  Sure I can.  But I lose lots of HP in the process, usually suffer a chunck of down time as a result and still don't do it half as fast as most of the other classes in the game.</div></div><hr />

What weapons are you using?<br />
<br />
What's your mitigation level at?<br />
<br />
What is your &quot;Normal&quot; tactic for soloing mobs? (I can solo mobs in my sleep, I pretty much do the same button sequence every time, I'm assuming other people do the same).<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think maybe because you solo, there has just got to be something you're not doing that other people are.<br />
<br />
Secondly, just because you can't solo evens efficiently doesn't mean your class is broken.  Fuckin plow thru shit 2-3 levels lower, it's not the end of the fucking world.  Class balance is not based upon how well you solo, so it's entirely reasonable that some classes do worse than others.  Not sure why this is even being discussed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The arguement that it has always been that way is not a valid one that it should continue to be that way.  Blizzard seems to have done good things for Rogues, allowing them to solo very effectively.  It doesn't seem like doing similar good things for Warriors is an unreasonable expectation.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's actually fairly easily applied fundamental logic.  If a class has high DPS and therefore kills faster, then it should have greater down time.  If a class has low DPS and therefore kills slower, then it should have lower down time.  Balancing these two aspects equates to a more even exp rate for each class.  Having a class with a high DPS rate and low down time means you've given a significant leveling advantage to that class (i.e. Hunters).  Having a class with a high DPS rate and similar down times means you've also given a significant leveling advantage to that class (i.e. Mages).  Giving a class low DPS and high down time means you've basically screwed that class in comparison to the others (i.e. Warriors as they stand today).<br />
<br />
I suppose that much of this would be moot if Warriors were actually a blast to solo, but frankly they're not.  Having to solo against green con mobs to exp efficiently doesn't tend to make one feel &quot;powerful&quot;.  And knowing that most every other class out there can solo exp against even cons up to +3 just reinforces that feeling of being less powerful.  I spent 4 years in EQ feeling like everyone else's meat shield punching bag, completely unable to effectively do anything on my own.  And while WoW hasn't gone quite that far with Warriors, I'm not particularly pleased with seeing how gimped solo Warriors are in comparison to most of the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I could have been more clear. I'm not against warriors being able to solo and at a comparative rate to other classes. I think WoW has achieved this in all its classes. Warriors are not broken soloers.<br />
<br />
My statement was meant to highlight that a melee/tank class in rpg have not traditionally fared well solo. And as such, it shouldn't be a huge revelation when WoW warriors are slightly less efficent solo than they are in groups.<br />
<br />
Your exagerations only serve to further discredit your claims. Warriors do not have to solo green con mobs to exp optimally. Other classes do not exp grind on +3 mobs unless they are notably well geared and even then I'd have to suggest that grinding on white/yellow would still be the best choice.<br />
<br />
Like the dev said, you don't need to exagerate. Yes, there are some bugs that are effecting warriors in a more profound way than I think many players realize. I think you'll find many of your concerns have revolved around those issues. The remaining issues will have to be chalked up to the warriors superior groupability in instances/raids. I'm not gonna pretend to know the devs philosphy, but we did see it much more appearantly in EQ. Warriors lose out on some soloability for a much larger gain in groupability.</div></div><hr />

The rest of your questions I'll have to answer when I have a chance to log on the Warrior and take a look at his stats.  But come on Haass, you know this is a bullshit response.  There is no fucking reason, none at all, why it should be this way.  Saying suck it up and deal with xping on greens, thereby gaining drops and gear far below your level range and thereby reinforcing the fact that you'll only be able to exp on greens is lame as hell.</div></div><hr />

You know what, blow me Vikken.  I have exaggerated nothing.  The fact that you want to claim that a pile of shit is a bunch of roses doesn't make that pile of shit smell any better.   You don't think Warriors are broken in the solo game?  Good for you.  Apparently we disagree.  Oh freaking well.  You won't be the first nor will you likely be the last to disagree with me.

I'll admit it's bullshit if you admit that it's fucking ridiculous that all classes be exactly the same.<br />
<br />
CASTERS NUKE SHIT DOWN FAST.  They also die fast.  Shit hits them for 5 times as much as it hits me.  That's called a TRADEOFF.  That's also called balance.<br />
<br />
You, are the goddamned core of any group, you have the best mitigation in the game, and the flexibility to either be a better tank, or put out some reasonable DPS.  <br />
<br />
I'm wearing full heavy mithril.  I haven't bought a goddamned motherfucking thing in the auction house.  As I hear it, you're a smith, and seem to have issues upgrading your gear.  I'm REALLY having a hard time believing your claims of completely inefficient experience gain when I can't see them, and I actually have to stop playing my warrior so much because the couple hours that I can put in a day after work is just making the distance between me and my play group larger.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think there are probably some inefficiencies in either your gear or your playstyle or what you're hunting or what you're doing or something.  You seem to be soloing for the entire time you play the game and maybe you're not interacting with people who you can discuss what works and what doesn't.  Instead, you're sitting here like a whiny bitch insisting that your class is broken when you haven't exhausted all of the other possibilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me clue you into something.  Mithril is great in the 40s.  By the 50s it's starting to lack, considering that the majority of the pieces are level 40 required.  So guess what, you don't want to be in heavy mithril in the 50s if you can avoid it.  And I got a whole two, count them two, additional plans in armorsmithing when I finally mastered it.  That would be the truesilver BP, which is a very nice BP I am still gathering components to make, and the truesilver guantlets, which are okay.  And I'm not having issues upgrading, at least no more than anyone else in the 50s who isn't hitting instances regularly.  There just fucking isn't that much around to upgrade to.<br />
<br />
Instead, you're sitting here like a whiny bitch insisting that your class is broken when you haven't exhausted all of the other possibilities.<br />
<br />
And you can blow me too.  I get really tired of your self righteous bullshit about how you know it all and anyone who disagrees with you must be a whiny bitch.  Your shit stinks just like the rest of ours stink o'might Haass, so take your superior attitude, stick it in your pipe and smoke.  I've tried to be reasonable with people like you, but apparently unless I goose fucking step along in agreement with you, you're just going to be a disrespectful pissy little prick.</div></div><hr />

I will have to go play with the ogers in the steppes, but the undead casters are horrible to solo against. You interrupt one of their spell lines and they immideatly start casting the other. And getting one as an add is even worse. <br />

You guys have such raging hardon's for armor problems post 50, and yet when I stand around in the AH inspecting level 55+'s, I see a bunch of people who can not possibly have higher AC than me.

That means that their survivability is EVEN LOWER than mine, and still, there they are..sitting at level 55, 58, even 60 wearing fucking garbage.  They still appear to be playing the game.  Explain how it can be the case that I can not have any survivability issues with what I'm wearing, but yet there is a major class problem when people not even wearing the standard gear that I am are managing to be max level.</div></div><hr />

I think we've pretty much established that Glat has been stubbornly soloing mobs inefficiently due to relative level. yes, perhaps we should be able to solo even cons more efficiently. we fucking heard you three times before and I really don't want to see you go off on another crusade here. in the mean time, you can either suck it up and, like, try to enjoy the game while you tell the people who matter what you think, or roll another character or play another game. we rock in groups. we're not the best solo. personally I can deal with that while improvements are being made.</div></div><hr />

It's unfortunate you don't want to hear it again.  I have pea brains come along and tell me that I'm clueless, exaggerate, have crappy gear, and don't know what the fuck I'm doing as a Warrior, and guess what, I'm going to react to that.  People are always coming up with justifications why Warriors should suck at soloing.  Well guess what, Warriors aren't that much better in instances than any other class, so the &quot;price&quot; we pay isn't a particularly reasonable one.  You obviously can see that, but you're willing to live with it.  Fair enough, that's certainly a decision you can make.  However, the bone heads who want to prattle on about &quot;trade offs&quot; and &quot;balance&quot; while obviously having a group they're hanging with regularly and therefore really don't need to solo all that effectively, really get under my skin.</div></div><hr />

Go ask an unguilded rogue or hunter how much fun it is to be told for the 10th time that day that when they wanted &quot;more&quot; for their group they were only talking about mages and paladins in the &quot;extra&quot; slots. At least warriors play an essential role in groups due to paladins sucktastic hate generation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Point taken.  If Rogues are that unwanted in instances then certainly that explains why they solo so well when compared to Warrors.  Trade offs and balance, that I can see.  It however doesn't explain why all the extra slots are being filled by Mages and Paladins, who not only solo well but also seem to be highly desired in instances, taking what you're saying as being correct and accurate.  Where is the trade off and balance there?  Sounds like trouble in &quot;balance land&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I had a full set of heavy mithril but have recently bought upgrades at the AH.  Most of the upgrades can't be worn till 52+ so there seems to be a hole missing from 45-52ish.  After Heavy Mith is the Thorium set and all that does is add + resistances to all.  Does nothing for tanks at all, maybe has a purpose in PvP.<br />
<br />
After Thorium is the Dark Iron pieces that we can make.  To even get the materials, you need to go into the BRD instances.  They take a shitload of dark iron to even make so those upgrades you prob wont be seeing till 56+.  The only other thing is to run instances inbetween, Maraudon, Sunken Temp, etc to try to get something that's an upgrade.<br />
<br />
As for warrior's in instances, you folks don't play alliance side.  The Horde have one class that wears plate, warriorrs.  The Alliance has paladins and since they hold aggro ok, esp when well played, groups regularily look for them to tank instances.  When the shit hits the fan, they can at least res the damn priest.<br />
<br />
Now the higher instances like Scholomance are mostly all undead.  Paladins really shine and their aoe aggro is on par with ours.  They do just as good of a job as us, plus theres like 10x the amount of paladins than warriors.  It's a totally different view from the alliance side.</div></div><hr />

I am fairly sure that you are talking about something different than Haass and I are. I would be very surprised if Glatius is not Stance dancing and making the most of the tools avalible to him. I get the feeling that Haass is much more talking about gear and getting into the instnaces, doing the group quests, taking on a profession, etc.<br />
<br />
I would maintain that level of commitment should not be required of a warrior, particulalry considering the 'casual' nature of the game. I don't think I know of a single serious warrior who is not also a smith.</div></div><hr />

And for the devs to boost warrior power to pacify those who choose not to utilize the class would put alot of warriors far far over the top. I very much agree that if your not willing or able to go to instances to aquire the gear then you better be willing to mine/blacksmith to make lvl apropriate gear. I broke into armorsmithing finally only to realize it's not gonna do me any good til Dark Iron so... now I just mine alot and sell it to purchase upgrades in the AH or from higher lvl blacksmiths (Usually find the needed materials myself). If you still find you can't do that then you better find a very generous guild who doesn't mind supporting your gimped ass. WoW is a fuck ton more generous to casual/non-hardcore players then EQ ever was but it doesn't mean Devs need to give them everything they want because they are too casual to play the class to its fullest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then again, I'm not too serious either =O  Hehe, I do enchanting/tailoring.  I like to log in and farm to make money so that combo suits me nicely.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the tank classes should be the slowest soloers out of all the classes.  So that a WoW warrior solos slowest, esp when all prot spec'd, seems exactly like it should be.  There are a number of a problems plaguing the warrior class right now that get in the way.  Some are bugs, some are design.<br />
<br />
I'm waiting to see how the bugfixes on rage gen and the ability miss rate change things for warriors before I get too worried.  I'm really more interested in what they do with the talent trees cause thats where I see most of the problem.  The prot tree is great, but end game warriors are not getting nearly as much benifit as they should from the tree in raid settings where mobs are immune to stun, disarm, and have so much AC that sunder doesnt help all that much (coupled with the 8 debuff limit on the mob).  I dont think folks using the arms tree (Mortal Strike folks) are getting the full benifit either but to me it seems more due to the rage/miss issues than anything.<br />
<br />
When the bugs get fixed, I'm confident we're all gonna be a LOT happier with our classes performance.  Of course if your gear is lacking, you too will lack.  Nature of the beast =)</div></div><hr />

Gear you get from completing those quest/dropsfromboss is more then enough to push you through 60.<br />
<br />
How many times do i have to repeat this:<br />
<br />
War was DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO TANK INSTANCES<br />
<br />
Ok, we can pvp, ok we can solo, ok blah blah blah, but the war's best ability is INSTANCES so if your whining about oh we suck pvp or oh i can't mow shit down as fast as rogues then make a fuking solo/pvp toon.  This ain't a game where all classes play the same and do the same thing, considering how EQ warrior was DEPENDANT on a healer past lvl 10 (non twinked) i thought a lot of you would appreciate the fact WoW war can solo a lot better.  Heck even if WoW war required a healer everytime i'd stil play one because like i said i wanna do instances and get better gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whatever Krun.  It's not like your opinion has all that much value to me.   I see some flaws with the class.  I'd like to be able to do some things better than I now can as a Warrior.  For example, I can take a level 40 hunter with a level 39 pet and take on, not one, but two level 42 mobs and handily come out on top.  A little dinged up perhaps.  But it really isn't a question as to whether or not I will prevail 90% of the time.   With the Warrior it is really isn't viable from what I've seen to take on two +2 mobs and expect to walk away.   Not unless I have an incrediable streak of crits or retailation manages to really beat them down.  Not very reliable, much more prone to failure.<br />
<br />
But like Unclebong says, the upcoming fixes could be enough to turn it around.  It's hard to say.  We'll see.  If not, I'll continue to play the hunter, because he's just a hell of a lot more fun for my play style.  Has a lot more survivability.  Has a lot more escape ability.  Has a lot more DPS and kills faster.  And can, and I state this as a cold hard fact beyond dispute because I do it all the time, take down +3 mobs with relative ease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is if you are a protection spec warrior using sword and shield and defensive.  To many folks believe the hysteria from the WoW warrior forums that protection spec is &quot;teh gimp,&quot; then spec arms or fury and complain about how underpowered they are. <br />
<br />
The trade off for protection spec's slower kill rate while solo is that we can handle multi-mob encounters far better than our thinner-skinned arms or fury spec comrades.  At 42 I was able to consistently handle two level 44 rock elementals in Badlands while questing.  Sword and shield + improved demoralizing shout, shield block, and revenge slows down the damage you take substantially.  Of course, I'm already spec'd out in other defensive skills as well.  Last night, at level 45, I had no trouble handling two level 47 trolls at a time, or even one level 48 wolf, solo in Hinterlands.<br />
<br />
That said, regardless of your class, your a moron if you are trying to level up on mobs +2 or +3 levels above you.  The best XP is now, and has always been, on mobs your level or -1 or -2 below you.  Faster kill rate, less damage taken, fewer resists on spells, less downtime.<br />
<br />
I was in the WoW closed beta, and Blizzards line on solo class balance has always been that if you can solo +2 level mobs, one at a time, consistently with reasonable gear, you are balanced.  Warriors easily pass that test (and if you can't do it, you have a weak spec, crappy gear, or poor tactics).  Beyond that, whining about kill rates compared to other classes is going to get a response from Blizzard's dev's something along the lines of &quot;cry me a fucking river.&quot;  And they should.  As they will point out to you, this is a multi-player game.  The intended WoW to be solo and casual player friendly, but not solo focused.  Some classes were intended to be better solo than others.  As the dev pointed out in his post, warriors from the start have been designed to be a group-oriented class. <br />
<br />
This is my first time posting here on Steel Warrior, but I've been a lurker for a bit.  I go back a ways in EQ (with a warrior and a paladin to 65, I remember Kailyn from the days when EQ Stratics warrior forums were the go to place for warrior info).  Glatius, I also remember you from the big flame fests you used to start on the Paladins of Norrath message boards over your desire to see hybrid agro abilities in EQ nerfed.  If you are not having fun in WoW either,  I don't think balance problems with the warrior class or WoW as a game are the reasons.</div></div><hr />

It's just like how combat rogues will swear they do the most DPS because they're not capable of perceiving anyone else (namely dagger rogues) doing more damage.  But hey, at least they're all happy.<br />

This is what you guys are bitching about?  Fucking 55 seconds to kill a mob and then 8 seconds of downtime to slap a goddamned bandage on and be ready to fight again.  This is what's so fucking impossible about soloing in this game?  I understand some classes solo faster, BUT YOU CAN'T PUT MASSIVE DPS ON THE CLASS WITH THE BEST MITIGATION IN THE GAME, so we deal with killing a little slower.<br />
<br />
Oh nos, so you only kill one even con mob per minute rather than 2 in 40 seconds like a mage and then have to drink twice.  It's not the fucking end of the world, and it's not the insurmountable fucking wall that you people are trying to make it sound like it is.</div></div><hr />

I dunno what your problem is, but we solo just fine.  It's not as fast as some other classes, but we're also very desirable in the 5 man group where A LOT of other classes aren't.  I see no issues with any of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there are in fact money mobs that are either underpowered for their level or give such good exp or loot that any extra downtime is offset. a lvl 45 in badlands may be much stronger than a lvl 45 in feralas.</div></div><hr />

I think the problem here is one guy thinks taking 50 seconds to solo a mob is okay and the other thinks it isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, are Thisleshrubs undercons?  I soloed the Thistleshrub faster than the Brute.<br />
<br />
How do we know that everything else isn't an overcon, what with the special abilities and all?<br />
<br />
The ability to kill 60 mobs per hour, including downtime, seems more than acceptable to me.  If it's not to you, feel free to go back to EQ, let me know how that downtime works out for ya.<br />
<br />
If you listen to glatius, we can't even solo an even con at all...only green mobs, and only if they don't get lucky and kill us.  Neither case is true, as you can tell by my health bar.  I can probably take 2 brutes at a time no problem, without retaliation, and I know for sure i can drop 2 dew collectors without it because i have before.<br />
<br />
If it's not as fast as you'd like, that's one thing, but claiming that we're fucking broken and need work because warriors can't solo at your desired rate is a completely different beast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SebastianDesoto</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, newbie warrior Sebastian here. I have been sifting through this post trying to find things that will help me learn to play my class. If anyone knows a thread, forum, or site that can break down some of the best tactics in a fight let me know. <br />
<br />
Its hard to sort through what’s real logic and what real BS being a noob, but I am taking all this into consideration to help define my character. I am currently lvl 27. I have recently respec my character from Arms tree to Proc tree to be a better team player. I find my self changing philosophy of play while soloing.  I always keep two single hand weapons and shield so I can alternate. This is usually based on how I feel at the time and not strategy. I will even keep a two handed weapon on me too if the weapon is good enough (I prefer axes cause they look cool, even though war specializes in swords and maces). <br />
<br />
A typical Defense scenerio for me no matter what level.<br />
Sometimes I will hang back at a distance with my shotgun, pull of a hit, run backwards while being chased until I can pull of another shot and then stop and switch to defensive stance. So I just got off two shot gun hits without being attacked (this tactic only works in open fields or with enough distance to move back with no other mob behind me). Once the battle begins, I'm in Defensive stance and simply start melee until some rage builds up. I use all defensive tactics, like shield block, until I can successfully use disarm and another damage talent in a row. It’s them all about damage until he gets the weapon back. Sometimes I throw rend in early, but I always try to use it late so if he runs, he'll die soon. If he runs and rend is not enough, shotgun time. <br />
The problem I am having is when two +2 lvl mobs come in and then I'm usually banking on few to no misses. It seems to be only the misses that really screw me in this situation. Otherwise, I can take 'em.<br />
<br />
A typical all out offensive scenario.<br />
Charge. Rend. Hamstring. Heroic strike, if possible (I really should blood rage then battle shout first but having a hard time making it a habit). I am usually dual wielding too. I then repeat Heroic strike as it is available and debuff when they wear off. <br />
I will absolutely not last with these tactics on more than one +2 or over mob unless I have good heal potions. <br />
<br />
I think my warrior is more versatile than it’s been made out to be, but yeah, they do seem a little weaker. I think Blizzard hit the nail on the head with their fix proposal. I do not deny my problems could be based on lack of game experience though, so my critics can go no further than that.<br />
<br />
By the way this is not meant to be an attack on you Krun, it’s just a side note...<br />
<br />
For all the whiners who want more: You can't have the cake and eat it<br />
<br />
I never really understood this saying. Who really wants cake if you can't eat it too? I just hate that saying.</div></div><hr />

Just reading thru your combatlog you posted.... Seems most of your hits come 3 seconds apart assuming no misses and are usually under 200 dmg. I get the feeling from your Deep wounds that you went MS/arms route.... Now don't take this the wrong way I agree completely with 99% of your statements even the occasional fucks and shits you throw in and this is in no way meant to be disrespectful, but I can see room for improvement in the amount of dmg you could be dishing out.... if your willing to add just a little bit more complexity to your normal combat sequence. You could really cut down on your combat time. See you can be dealing dmg during the 3+ seconds that your waiting for your 2handers speed to refresh or the 6 seconds it takes mortal strike to refresh. I'll see if I can post a /combatlog or two after I get off work or in the morning maybe it will give people who solo or want to solo more efficiently some ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm protection, up to shield bash, currently arms only up to level 3 of TM and Deep wounds (no impale), and Cruelty 3.  So no MS.<br />
<br />
The reason my hits are 3 seconds apart is because i had to take the counterweight off my Truesilver champ and put my weapon chain on last week :p<br />
<br />
The only viable method of dealing damage between swings is slam, and I highly doubt that slam in it's current form adds enough DPS to counteract the fact that you're not swinging.  Getting hit interupts the slam timer, making the cast time substantially longer.  Furthermore, between Demo, Sunder x5 and rend, with 15 for execute when the mob hits 20%, I'm running rage pretty thin.  Notice the disarm in there too.  There's not much rage left over for more DPS, nor am I trying to demonstrate that I have the best DPS currently possible.  I'm saying that I can solo, and I can solo efficiently, so the class being broken is clearly not the case.<br />
<br />
Edit -- Sebastian, I'm not trying to blow you off, nor am I trying to be a dick, but start a new thread man.  You'll get better answers to your questions more directly than having them diluted in this already pretty hostile one :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
also, learn to make Battle Shout a priority #1. it should always be up while you're killing stuff. it's harder at lower levels and w/o talent points in Charge but it's a good habit.<br />
<br />
Kermey I'm interested in the ways you fill in gaps between swings.</div></div><hr />

you wouldn't happen to have a template for your build would you? I just feel very reluctant to put points into tactical mastery, which i'm sure is not uncommon. I'll check allakhazam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can give a quick break down, but you wont see its true beauty til I post a combat log. It requires two sets of weapons one fast set Thrash blade seems a common upper end weapon and its along the same lines as the flurry axe I use. Now I choose to dual wield and it wasnt until about 3 lvls ago that I started doing this and my dps has literally gone nuts. I hunted the AH for the highest pure dmg 2 hander I could lay my hands on speed is irrelevent I think the Executioner Axe I chose has a 3.8 speed god awfully slow but hits like a mac truck 30ish more raw dmg then the Truesilver. There are other less costly alternatives like Ravager from SM or that Stone.... can't remember its name from Uldaman.  The faster the first set of weapons is the smoother the transition. I usually open with charge and a big 2hander.  the rage I get from the charge and hit usally allows me to pop off a Mortal Strike immediately. Then as soon as MS is popped unless I have overpower available I'll immediately weapon switch. There was a link to a really simple AddOn linked on one of the posts in the Inn that allowed me to bind a key (I chose E since its right next to my forward finger) I'll immediately begin dual wielding. Even before the graphics load showing I have two weapons for the next 3-6 seconds Ill dual wield then MS or Overpower will refresh and I'll immediately go 2h and hit. I not only get the Big Mortal Strike hit I also get a swing with my 2hander. basically the dmg goes like this charge 170-250 dmg hit (assuming no crit) MS 200-400 then immediately a string of hits 60-200 for the next few seconds then 170-250/200-400 back to back then a string of hits 80-170.... etc. thats assuming no Overpowers become available. I've worked my crit % up to around 21% with axes so my hits tend to be really high when I weapon swap to 2h for my MS and Normal hit combo it's not uncommon to switch and get back to back 400-800 dmg hits. Those dmg calculations don't even include Deep Wounds dmg with Impale. I've tried both dual wield and 2h but neither comes close to the dmg I deal working a combitination of the two into one unbroken series of hits. I'll post a combatlog so you can see in real time how this works.... I can't find any other way to even come close to this dps as a warrior. Thats why seeing hits 3+ seconds apart I can see room for improvement.<br />
<br />
Note* this will also work Sword and Board in defensive stance ie. revenge pops up weapon switch to big 2hander get the revenge hit and a second 2hander hit then switch back to sword and board without waiting for the 2hander to hit again you will be right back to attacking and blocking.<br />
<br />
I've posted this idea before but I really feel showing a combatlog will help, and it takes no more effort then it would if you had one more fury slot to click. think of it as a Double Mortal Strike hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically, the gist of what you're saying is that you're exploiting the delay on 2h weapons.<br />
<br />
Use it while you can, because that's going to be gone, I can guarantee that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a game mechanic to be able to switch weapons. I just choose to equip a 2hander for my fury talents then unequip it rapidly and re-equip my dual wield combo... If I choose to be a MS/Arms build I'm gonna be the most damaging MS/Arms build I can be until such a time comes that I wish to go protection then I'll find out how to be the best protection warrior I can. It's not an exploit to weapon switch via a macro. It just happens to work really well for a Arms build warriors who like to solo.... it's also quite nice in instances dual wield in between WW/Cleaves to generate faster rage then pop in 2hander to get 2-4 200-600 hits then back to dual wielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my build is pretty simple. really you can choose lots of paths to get to Mortal Strike. after that it's a tossup between Imp Revenge/Block in Prot or Piercing Howl and the like in Fury.<br />
<br />
5 in Deflection<br />
5 in Tactical Mastery<br />
2 in Imp Charge<br />
2 in Imp Overpower<br />
1 in Anger Management<br />
5 in 2h Weapon Spec<br />
1 in Sweeping Strikes<br />
5 in Sword Spec - note that this does limit you<br />
3 in Imp Thunderclap - not recommended for most atm, I AE a lot.<br />
1 in Imp Rend - kind of a junk point<br />
1 in Mortal Strike<br />
<br />
I was reluctant to spend a full 5 points in TM but I am very pleased with it. I can switch stances with near impugnity now. rarely do I have more than 25 rage at any time.<br />
<br />
also a lot of people go the Rend-Deep Wounds-Impale route which is rather nice for soloing but is counterproductive to mezzes and fears. it's your call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I'm saying that's it's not how the devs intended it to happen and I guarantee it will be changed.  Here's the situation.<br />
<br />
You swing a weapon with a 1 second delay, then equip an axe with a 4 second delay, and swing the axe immeidately.<br />
<br />
How it's GOING to happen as soon as someone at blizzard realizes that this is happening, is that as soon as you equip the axe, you're going to stand around for 4 seconds before you swing.<br />
<br />
EQ worked the same way and it's the only way to avoid exploiting high damage weaponry.  It might be a game mechanic, but it's a game mechanic that's going to change as soon as enough tards post about it on the BNet forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krun</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya lately i've seen a lot of people using custom macros to do quick equip changes, most popular one is switching gear to do a quick shield bash in battle stance etc..<br />
Not really sure if they had planned to designed it that way or if people are just taking advantage of game mechanics.  Thing is 95% of the people are still cluless (myself included) on the advanced macro commands etc.. mostly due to the fact they require add-ons or specific ui's  etc..<br />
<br />
<br />
Glatius, my original thread was designed to show that not all classes are suppose to be played the same or have same capabilities, if you think we suck because we can't solo 2+higher lvl mobs as well as your hunter then you cleary need a beatdown from the clue stick.  As Gwain stated any farming/grind xp comes best from mobs 2~3lvls lower then you, in fact the game was designed to discourage the good ol EQ grind system of sitting in 1 spot and abusing the same mobs over and over and over and over ..... by giving us quests.  I've never grinded in WoW the way i did in EQ, i just finished all my quests and sure some classes like rogues will finish them earlier solo then myself but it doesn't matter when you have friends and guildies who will help you get there just as fast.  Those who solo ahead become stuck in the elites and that's when you have a chance to help them get through it...  <br />
<br />
For the record how is hunter 'fun'? pet attack, shoot,shoot,shoot,shoot,shoot,shoot,shoot,shoot oh loot mob, repeat x 99, omg i wtfpwnsors all these mobs with hardly no downtime i'm so leet.  Come time for instances i find people want a dps that have utility over hunters, unless they have some cool critical ability i have yet to see.<br />
<br />
I have a true question for some 60 offensive talented warriors, can you guys tank instances like brd, brs, strat, school etc? i mean MT not OT, my thinking is they can with 2 healers probably.<br />
<br />
As to Tactical mastery, i'm a big fan of it whoever was asking.  Was very sceptical at first (since i mainly wanted anger management), but i find the whole charge (improved) gives 25 rage right off the bat which is very good.  I wish the new changes to thunder clap increases the slow attack speed further instead of increased dmg.<br />
<br />
Lastly, is anyone using shield disc the way it is atm?  I firmly believed we do not have the rage to support the disc but i'd like an outside opinion...</div></div><hr />

I use Shield Discipline occasionally in instances, mostly against named mobs.  In that case, the threat from a couple of shield bashes is mostly why I bother.  It can help when you're taking 3-4 elites, since the 50% block increase stacks up fairly quickly, but I don't usually bother.  On the other hand, when you're tanking that many mobs, you usually have enough rage that the cost is negligable.<br />
<br />
For bosses, I usually wait until I stack 5 sunders on them, then pop Shield Disc once I have 25 rage so I can immediately throw a Shield Bash.  While the disc is up, I use Shield Block/Revenge, making sure I have 10 rage when Shield Bash is available again.  Damage mitigation is not that amazing, but every bit helps sometimes...  I find the threat to be pretty solid like that, but it's possible that  it would be just about the same without the Disc.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that it is not amazing for the end-tree talent, but it's OK...<br />

Easiest solution I see to weaponswapping is frontloading the delay if you weapon swap in combat. Switch to a 2h? your next swing will come in the 2h's delay.</div></div><hr />

I see that currently to some exent.  I'll be going DW and get overpower to light up, switch to battle and hit my overpower macro which is /equip big ass 2h /cast Overpower (hehe roughly).  once I see the yellow numbers over the mobs head, I hit my equip DW macro and reequip my two 1h'ers.  <br />
<br />
Thing is, they almost NEVER swing right away the way things are now.  The pause before they do swing is inline with the delay of the 2h I switched in and out real quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure you already have to pay the delay of the new weapon you equipped when switching, otherwise you can get free rounds just going swing with a 4s 2hander, switch to a 1.5s dagger, and then switch back to 4s 2hander when the 1.5s delay is up.<br />
<br />
The problem is that attacks like overpower and mortal strike are instant, so even though you can't swing for 4 seconds, you get stiill use MS or Overpower for about 2X the damage you should've had.  <br />
<br />
I don't really think anything that requires a macro to do more damage should be valid.  I remember in EQ there are people who do stuff like bash in between swinging delays so you get the stun on bash (if you can't slam) while DWing.  It may be a cute trick but it's definitely not how the game's intended to be played.  If it's just sneaking in a bash I guess it's fine to leave it in, but if it starts to be a real viable form of increasing DPS, then either the game should do it automatically for you (for example, attack automatically stops when you Gouge so you can backstab), or not be allowed at all.<br />
<br />
I think someone once posted something like use a 2H and then have a macro to put your shield on before an enemy swings to reduce damage taken.  If it is actually possible to do things like that, it has to be nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't see why not, I tank a lot of fights in there in berserker stance so I can whirlwind the trash mobs. Prot vs arms isn't a question of 'Can you do it', just a 'how well can you do it'. <br />
<br />
I have to say though, I'd be interested in the experiences of any offensive spec guys doing the two sets of 3 flameguards just past Argelmach in BRD while level 55 or under. Especially if you didn't have access to a fire resist totem. Those things laid down a beating on my group like you would not believe the first time we tried them ;p<br />
<br />

<br />
Constantly. The aggro it produces is unbelievable and quite simply cannot be beaten for the cost. If you can't spare 10 rage over 20 seconds you aren't fighting hard enough mobs ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Revenge is fixed damage - switching to a two-hander is pointless. <br />
<br />
Macroing it so you can switch to battle stance, equip a two hander, overpower, switch to s/s switch back to defensive stance is, in my opinion, not only cheesy but a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frankly i am baffled that an offensive tank can do so well in berserker stance in those instances, does your group have heavy CC+rogue sap etc.. how many mobs can you handle on yourself at a time, 3,4,5?<br />
<br />
Since we're talking about shield disc, can anyone correct me if i'm wrong but i seem to recall that the refresh on shield bash = 12 sec or something like that and the shield disc is something like 20sec?  Not exactly sure about the seconds but i am pretty sure that you can only land 1 shield bash during the disc last time i checked.  So this increased aggro thing from bashing is kinda moot since you get 1 shot.<br />
<br />
Gotta be honest i never tested that disc (already respeced 4 times sigh due to experimenting asslike talents), but on paper it is not appealing atm, the theory is the disc would shine if you kept spamming shield block and thus get max benefit during the disc from block, but considering the rage cost of activating and spamming shield block, not sure if it's worth all the trouble.  Usually on most boss fights i'd charge in, switch stance then start my sunder routine with a quick demo in between (i have TM), then proceed  to do my luxury abilities (if boss is still alive), such as rend line, and shield block (spam revenge whenever it pops).  <br />
<br />
I just don't see where you'd activate shield disc or where you'd get all that rage unless you mean to not spam shield block during the disc and hope for passive auto blocks, in which case it wouldn't be very many during a 20 sec disc..<br />

I could hardly be offensive specced *and* have shield discipline.. My suggestion was that, as a prot spec, if I am able to switch to berserker stance to tank some fights, then there is no reason why an offensive spec warrior would not be able to tank.<br />
<br />

<br />
The question isn't as relevant given your assumption was wrong, but my regular group has a single mage for CC and a druid as main healer, with a shaman as backup healer. I generally only use whirlwind for groups consisting of, for example, 1 elite and 6 trash, or 2 elites and 4 trash - that kind of thing. Essentially any situation where keeping aggro in defensive stance is difficult for reasons other than heal aggro. For groups of 5 or less whirlwind isn't really necessary for solid aggro, and it's more efficient to stay in defensive stance. Note that there isn't any reason for an offensive specced warrior to not use defensive stance, given that flurry, enrage, mortal strike, deep wounds, impale etc all work perfectly fine in defensive. <br />
<br />

So this increased aggro thing from bashing is kinda moot since you get 1 shot.<br />
<br />
The timer for shield bash starts counting down *after* you use it. So you discipline, immediately bash, then 12 seconds later bash again. And yes, even if it was only one shot it would be worth it. Shield bash alone is considerably more hate than a sunder armor, shield discipline bash is double that - for 25 rage you get the threat of at least three sunders, which would cost you 45, immediately, and then get to do it again 12 seconds later for only 10 rage. <br />
<br />

<br />
Not worth it really except if you have rage to burn. Shield block messes with your global timer and makes it more difficult to hold aggro. That's not to say using it if you have the rage and nothing better to do while shield discipline is up does not help, but I wouldn't try to plan it that way.<br />
<br />
Usually on most boss fights i'd charge in, switch stance then start my sunder routine with a quick demo in between (i have TM), then proceed  to do my luxury abilities (if boss is still alive), such as rend line, and shield block (spam revenge whenever it pops).  <br />
<br />
While shield discipline doesn't hurt on a single powerful mob, it's not at it's best there - it's when you are trying to keep aggro on several very hard hitting mobs that I find it most useful. That being said, using it gives your dps types a much larger margin for burndown. If they could never take aggro off you anyway, they probably need better weapons ;p<br />
<br />
I just don't see where you'd activate shield disc or where you'd get all that rage unless you mean to not spam shield block during the disc and hope for passive auto blocks, in which case it wouldn't be very many during a 20 sec disc..<br />

<br />
When you are about to attack something, bloodrage then get the healer to dump a hot on you. By the time you reach the mob you will be a full health, they will be at full mana, and after the first swing you can shield discipline and bash, giving you a tremendous aggro boost on your initial target - one large enough that you can usually switch to every other mob and sunder it before switching back to your main target without losing aggro.</div></div><hr />

How it's GOING to happen as soon as someone at blizzard realizes that this is happening, is that as soon as you equip the axe, you're going to stand around for 4 seconds before you swing.<br />
<br />
Surely enough tards have posted by now, then, as it's been on the boards for months.  Beta times, and junk. The Blizzard team has been aware for quite some time, the trick is SOP for many. Since there's already code in the game to block hot swapping of gear, it should only take a few moments to glue a server side hotfix into place, presuming of course that the development team intends it.</div></div><hr />

Maraudon is hardly a test of anything, the place is way too easy. I really wouldnt take runs through that place to measure anything about tanking except your ability to taunt 3-4 mobs at once. <br />
<br />
Ive done princess runs with a single paladin healing a lvl 51 warrior and the rest of the group being dps classes. The princess fight wasnt very pretty, but it certainly wasnt hard, even with noone healing 3/5 of the group except their own bandages.<br />

Sunken Temple provides a much better (low 50s) test of your build when you tank Eranikus (provided you have a backup tank to get sleeped all the time).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with you Kailyn. A friend of mine plays a rogue and I've been through every instance from Deadmines to Sunken Temple with him, and he's a huge help.<br />
<br />
Does something change in Scholo/Strath or something?<br />
<br />
Tinuvas<br />
<br />
Well yes. It does.<br />
<br />
Almost nothing is sappable, which removes our CC ability. <br />
<br />
The main thing is that the vast majority of your time in those last instances is spent clearing bunches of 5-6 elites at a time. This makes AE damage extremely powerful, and polymorph on a pull also quite powerful (where it works). On the other side there is paladins who supply very useful backup healing and a handy offtank who can agro 1-2 things provided noone is hitting them aswell.<br />
<br />
What this boils down to is classes that ONLY bring dps and weak tanking to the table (rogue hunter and warlock) are going to suffer when youre talking about pickup groups.<br />
<br />
I got groups all the time in instances upto and including Sunken Temple. Everything past that is currently almost impossible to get a group for due to:<br />
<br />
1. there is about 2.6million level 60 rogues/hunters/mages on my server<br />
<br />
2. other classes provide more group specific utility/AE dps so that the extra 50-100dps that a rogue can bring isnt anything special<br />
<br />
3. pickup groups build &quot;carefully&quot;, in that they will almost always take classes which add to group survivability .. ie more tanking/healing/ress/sheep</div></div><hr />

Damn dude, you are quite the baby. Did you notice the little talents button on the bottom of the screen maybe you should use it, maybe that is your problem, something is obviously wrong with you if you can barely solo things your lvl. Also it would be alot more productive to solo things say 3 lvls lower cause you should...well most warriors should rip them apart and need a break maybe every 2 bubbles, thats how it was for me. Also I am lvl 58 now...never did I have a problem soloing things higher than me or even to me, so it wasnt really my gear. Maybe try this...here is my button sequence: charge, demo shout, rend, battle shout, heroic strike, hs, hs ,hs, Mortal strike (if i have the rage), hs, hs, hs, MS, hs, hs, execute! Usually works pretty well. If i get an add I use sweeping strikes on the mob with the most hps. If I need to run from the 2 mobs granted I have the Hp to run, I piercing howl and get outta there. The only mobs I have trouble with are the undead in Eastern Plaguelands, and only a couple of em. The undead flayers disease you with -10% to hit chance and it lasts 10 minutes, but they are pretty easy, the scourge champions hit hard have high ac and alot of hp, and the wraith chicks fear you and disease you for like 7 seconds with a -40 or -60% chance to hit( dont remember how much its for but its a high %). I am mostly arms and some fury, improved rend\charge\overpower\hamstring\demo shout\battle shout, Deep wounds and impale, 2h spec, axe spec, mortal strike, enrage, piercing howl, cruelty, deflection, and sweeping strikes. I do absolutely fine. I can PvP very well, and I can solo very well. Not saying im so cool or anything, but I win alot of my duels, and horde fights, so I must be doing something right. Do you have your talent point scattered all about, or mostly in 1 category? I don't know what your problem is, BUT WARRIORS ARE NOT BROKEN...AT ALL. I have also seen many people that are 60 with crappy gear and they made it there. My gear is not the best, I do have some instance gear but that DOES NOT make the warrior, so for you to use that as an excuse is just gay. I have Avenguard helm, vicegrips of the bear, elemental rockshard leggings, Bloodsomething necklace (superior from ZF 13sta 5spirit), Gatorbite Axe with +7dmg, Oh and Hydralick Armor for chest. I guess thats what makes me what i am now considering I didnt have any of this from ohhh lvl 1-56. Anyway dude. Sorry if you suck at warriors, try a pally, they have high survivability.<br />

I tend to agree with most of what you've said, but still find it hard to justify spending those pts to shield disc in its current form.  My usual group is very high dps (war,shm,rogue x 3) so my tactics slightly differs from yours.  In a typical situation of 2~3elites and 3~4 trash i'd charge in, TC,switch to defensive,demo, start sundering the elites, 1 of our rogue is the Main assist (not sure if others have thair main dps as main assist as we do, since i constantly switch targets), and usually the 3 rogue+shm will rape the trash so fast it's not even worth for me to switch to sunder.  Since the rogues end up doing insane burst dmg with their backstab crits i ended up putting 2 in imp taunt for 8sec refresh, and sometimes the buffer timer before taunt fades is enough to kill the mob before i do anything (*stupid rogues!*)  I just don't see how shield disc could fit in reg trash fight, and like i said against boss fight...<br />
<br />
I still find it hard to believe if an offensive speced using 2H or DW could tank well enough to make the end instances workable as MT.  Maybe i'm wrong but i have yet to see one in action in those instances.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, that string of combat moves is pure bullshit ... if you have MS you dont fire strings of HS's .. what you can do is use HS and MS simultaneously when you have enough rage cause MS is an extra swing.

Once you get MS you should never use HS (unless you are always capped on Rage).<br />
<br />
HS is next swing, uses rages, and causes next swing to NOT generate rage.<br />

MS is instant, can be used anytime esp inbetween hits, cost 30 rage.</div></div><hr />

First warriors can't heal mid combat, and second their DPS isn't anywhere near what the other classes have that can't heal themselves. <br />
<br />
Every example I've read about &quot;warriors soloing fine&quot; has people soloing lower level mobs. I don't think people realize that many other classes can solo +3 mobs or even multiple +2 mobs regardless of talent build just as efficiently as a warrior can solo a even con mob. <br />
<br />
You know, I think they could fix a lot of the problems by making it so warriors didn't have to channel bandages in combat. I doubt it would be totally over powered if you could only self target with it, especially with the bandage cooldown time.<br />

In a typical situation of 2~3elites and 3~4 trash i'd charge in, TC,switch to defensive,demo, start sundering the elites, 1 of our rogue is the Main assist (not sure if others have thair main dps as main assist as we do, since i constantly switch targets), and usually the 3 rogue+shm will rape the trash so fast it's not even worth for me to switch to sunder.  Since the rogues end up doing insane burst dmg with their backstab crits i ended up putting 2 in imp taunt for 8sec refresh, and sometimes the buffer timer before taunt fades is enough to kill the mob before i do anything (*stupid rogues!*)  I just don't see how shield disc could fit in reg trash fight, and like i said against boss fight...<br />
<br />
I still find it hard to believe if an offensive speced using 2H or DW could tank well enough to make the end instances workable as MT.  Maybe i'm wrong but i have yet to see one in action in those instances.<br />
<br />
I assidently tanked flamelash the other day in BRD with a 2 hander.  We had a low damage group, I was 56 at the time.  It was pretty horribly ineffecient, but he got dead nonetheless.  I'm arms/prot/fury build at the moment, but if I was able to tank him without problems, then I can't imagine how a arms/fury build would have any problems with a sword/board setup.  That being said, I wouldn't want to do it again.</div></div><hr />

I don't think people realize that many other classes can solo +3 mobs or even multiple +2 mobs regardless of talent build just as efficiently as a warrior can solo a even con mob. <br />
<br />
I can solo even level mobs, or mobs +2 levels above me, just fine.  Heck, if I pick the right mob I can solo +3 levels above me.  Solo'ing 2 +2 mobs at a time isn't that difficult with sword and board + defensive, just slow.  This is as a level 47 protection spec warrior.  My wife plays a priest with a hybrid shadow/holy spec, she can do the same thing (though two non-undead mobs will overhwelm her quickly if she's in an area she can't use fear).   Two of my regular group mates (49 warlock, 48 hunter) can do the same, and can indeed do it faster than I can.  One of my regular group considerably longer to kill anything than it does me.<br />
<br />
That said, they would all tell you trying to XP grind on +2 level mobs is retarded.  You can gain exerpience much more quickly and efficiently by focusing on mobs your level or a couple levels below you.<br />
<br />
Hunters solo faster than we do.  We solo faster than paladins.  So what?  Again, since beta the Blizzard dev's have said this is a multi-player, group oriented game designed to be friendly to people who only have an hour or two to play and want to solo.  If a class can reliably kill +2 level mobs while solo, Blizzard considers it balanced.  Been that way forever.  Some classes are more solo oriented, others are more group oriented.  Warriors are, as noted by the dev in his post over the weekend, a group oriented class.  If you don't like that, or are unhappy with solo'ing at the pace we do, you picked the wrong class.  Roll a hunter or warlock (two classes that are great solo, and weak in groups).</div></div><hr />

Some people still don't get it.  You can NOT put the best DPS on the best mitigation class.  Don't you people remember Monks?  I don't care what your goddamned &quot;Vision&quot; for a warrior is, it's not going to happen in an MMO because IT CAN'T.  You want to be Conan and deal out ridiculous DPS?  Then you get a fuckin loincloth pal, because that's how games like this have to be balanced.<br />
<br />
The warrior, in every game, is designed to be the class who's tanking the bosses, and tanking everything up until then.  They have the highest survivability against every single mob in the game and it has to be balanced against something.  If you make it so warriors can do rogue or hunter DPS, and keep them at the same mitigation level, THEN YOU JUST ELIMINATED ANY REASON TO PLAY ANY OTHER CLASS.  Fucking christ, I don't know why this is so impossible to understand.<br />

<br />
Hehe &quot;the ability to drop even cons&quot; is not the main problem among most of us I believe. If you can't do that with a full HP bar something is horribly wrong at any level.<br />
<br />
The problem is our effeciency when doing so is dramatically lower than other classes that don't have healing. Other than hamstring + pray or challenging shout (and pray for no dot from criticals) we are limited in our escape options. This impacts our soloability. Not our ability to be able to beat them 1-1 if we must.<br />
<br />
There is a difference here, Haass. As I posted elsewhere: investing in crit talents and gear selection really helped my solo effeciency -- give it a go fellow warriors if you have not already. In my case it allowed me to solo well enough to complete Winterspring quests at 57 at a very decent clip.<br />
<br />
My lesson: ac/defense/some HP is far inferior to +% crit on slots. +5% crit from talents is superior (but still painful at times) than maxing out tactical mastery.<br />
<br />
Of course, now that I'm finally 58 and twinked out in gear I've been saving in the bank, I'm having absolutely 0 issues plowing through level 59 and 60 mobs so getting to 60 should be a breeze :)</div></div><hr />

As it stands in order to get the extra dps or what not to make solo more 'efficient' the way Hunters are for example would mean that warrior would need to be 'nerf'ed somehwere to even it out, places like lesser mitigating or lesser aggro generation else if they own tanking and own dps then really what is the fuking point of having different classes?<br />
<br />
If blizzard offered a deal where they'd up dps so we're more solo friendly  but reduce our tanking or aggro generating ability for instances would you guys take the deal?  I sure as hell wouldn't, i'd be a gimp tank with gimp dps like WTF is that i'd rather do 1 thing great then do 3 things pathetically.  All you solo freaks make some friends or stalk some healers, you guys make it sound the game is a single player game like geez.<br />
<br />
As to tanking, i will be switching to full offensive MS arms/fury and will test out 2h and DW in BRD and see if my group can make it to emp.  More info wil be posted with some combat logs for those interested...<br />

This I don't understand.<br />
<br />
You've been pulling in EQ for years right?  You understand mob pathing right?  You can spend a minute or 2 watching mobs move to find a good spot to kill them right?<br />
<br />
I don't have any issues with survivabilty.  If the pull looks suspicious, you tag with an arrow.  If you aggro 2, you turn tail and leash them.  You lose 200hp, they reset, you try again.<br />
<br />
Even if I get an add mid fight, it's not an issue.  If I don't think I can kill it, hamstring it and run.  If you're really low on HP, you switch to defensive and click your shield in.  The shit's not gonna kill you before you leash it.  I guess I don't understand where this survivability issue comes in, becuase it's not like a mob that you don't see can fucking destroy you like it can destroy casters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue of escape varies a lot on zones.  For example in Tarnaris it's pretty much impossible to get ambushed unless you're fighting just below a hill.  On the other hand an area like Ungoro I have fought like 6 mobs back to back just because stuff roams all over the place and a lot of time even when you see stuff coming one way you can't avoid it because backing up the other direction just means you bump into another roamer elsewhere.<br />
<br />
And depending on the area, some areas simply don't have a good escape path to escape to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This I don't understand.<br />
<br />
Some zones have roamers all over the place, at times you may get an add you didn't expect. Obviously, setting up an encounter and moderating pull rate can greatly improve your survivability. However, these measures *do* slow down your mob pull rate and thus your solo xp rate.<br />
<br />
Again, the discuss/debate isn't the ability to solo... it is the relative effeciency of the warrior's soloing ability compared to some other classes.<br />
<br />
Maybe there are just some zones and some level ranges where it is just hard and otherwise it is simply trivial. For instance, the plaguelands have been much harder than say burning steppes or tanaris. Ungoro crater is harder on me than Felwood. I'll go ahead and say that now that I've actually found some excellent places to garner xp my solo gameplay isn't as poor as it was.<br />
<br />
On the whole I am pleased with playing my warrior. But I still posit that warrior dps is unbalanced in solo and pvp scenarios compared to where it should be. I eagerly await the rage related bug fixes to go live and hear back from warriors on how it helped them solo mobs and quests. I've come to grips that I won't be able to benefit from them by the time I hit 60 and that's fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What constitutes a typical trash fight changes fairly drastically as you go along. You start to get things like 5 elites, 2 of which are healers, or 3 elites with 100% armor piercing damage. At that point the main problem with aggro is not assisters getting aggro from dps, but healers getting aggro from heal dps. <br />
<br />
Also, to some extent you will not face one of the more pressing problems with large pulls, as you don't have an AE'er - that's not necessarily a good thing though 8) Lyceum or strat spiders with 3 rogues and a shaman is probably not impossible but damn, I can think of better ways to spend my evening ;p</div></div><hr />

He's not exactly gimp dps.  He was hitting 400-450 in a rather quick fashion, granted, as I said this was 2h, and in battle stance most of the fight.  Shield plus defensive probably would've brought this down to a more manageable 300-350ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kireiina</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm almost entirely protection specced (arms up to anger management and cruelty in fury) and of course i'm an unimpressive soloist. I frequently have DPS classes wander over to see why its taking me so long. And the rogues generally get bored and finish the mob off for me. I don't care though, I can solo productively which is something an EQ warrior could never claim. And I will reach 60 (57 atm) at which point the value of soloing drops.<br />
<br />
However I can see that PvP is going to be a major part of the game and I'm wondering what my role is there. It's my expectation that PvP will be mobile, fluid and ranged. Kills will have to be quick because taking too long means the near certainty of interference. The warriors lack of range, of front loaded damage, high DPS, mobility and resistance to mobility impairment seems likely to make them under-performers on the battlefield. Not to mention the entire rage mechanic puts a limit on the pace I can achieve. Nor is the warriors durability overly impressive, the only people likely to be bothered by my armor are other warriors and perhaps hunters. The majority of the rest of the damage will be magic against a hit point pool that is not massively larger than anyone elses and which I have no unique tools to shield or renew.<br />
<br />
The warriors primarily ability is aggro management and stable mitigation of melee damage. I don't see those two things transferring at all well to the battlefield. Stable mitigation is only good when you have someone healing you, yet all the heal classes are stronger in PvP than I. Will they shackle themselves to me? I suspect not, even if the battlefield is table enough to achieve such co-ordination.<br />
<br />
The biggest surprise was that Kalgan, who is the PvP dev unless my memory fails me, did not cover PvP where most of the real concerns lie. Although his assumption that all warriors have access to mortal strike (heroic strike is such a poor substitute, but it is the baseline ability) indicates a greater familiarity with PvP builds than defensive ones.</div></div><hr />

As a matter of interest - what do the rogues actually do ? I was thinking about it and figured jumping the keepers, looting and vanishing would probably work fine, but how do they manage to light the torches ? Do they get the third rogue to train off while they do it then vanish ?<br />
<br />
I am intrigued... ( I really want to get an ironfoe, but the lyceum is still easy to screw up in even now, so anything that made it more farmable would be a great help - if you don't know, can you ask them for me please ? )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find myself in the position of being an Australian ex-EQ player who spent the vast majority of his time in a US timezone guild, and can no longer play in the timezone that all my in-game friends play due to work etc. Plus my old guild didnt swap wholesale over to WoW or anything like that. So im basically stuck relying on pickup groups because there is no Australian timezone guild presence on Cenarius. <br />
<br />
Getting those last 1-2 group spots over the mages and paladins (and the vast army of other rogues and hunters in the same position as me) is basically impossible.<br />

If you have experienced rogues that go with you, it shouldn't be too difficult once they figure out the key position.  Early on our rogues wiped repeatedly trying to find the spots (always a price for knowledge), but now it's a joke just need 2 rogues to do (solo rogue is also doable just takes more time and he needs to be able to tank fairly well etc..) <br />
<br />
Worst case rogue tries to train to a line of sight spot for your resser at a fair distance and repeat process, it sounds tedious but trust me once your rogues have it down pat , the wholy lyceum event is like 5min for rogues to open door and another 2~3min to clear to door it's a joke.  Classic approach can give headaches etc...  hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

I have no doubts that it works, but it's clearly not intended to.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I wouldn't get all fuckin cozy with it, because it's not gonna be that way forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-04-2005, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reviewing the combatlogs I've done... it does appear to be working as intended... since it's roughly 3 seconds before I hit again with my dual wield combo, it's just not noticeable in real time since I hit with my 2hander as son as i switch then the MS pops and I switch back it only feels like a 1.5 second delay once im back to my dual wield combo. It appears to be intentional on the devs part to allow weapon switching and macros so why worry about it. Its not a bug Haass... you go off the delay of your last swing so I hit with Flurry .5 seconds go by I switch 1.5 delay is up the 2hander hits .5 seconds go by MS hits another .5 seconds I switch 1 second goes by i pop rend or something like it one more second my DW setup is hitting again. Rinse and Repeat. Thats a rough break down, but If I immediately switch back to Dw as soon as I hit MS the delay is more noticeable, then if I pop MS then switch back on a calm smoother basis. <br />
<br />
   So NO I don't think the devs see this as a bug that needs to be fixed since it appears to work off the delay of your last swing as it should. Since delay of your attack doesn't come at the beginning of a round of attacks or warriors would charge with a  2hander and stand arond for 3 seconds while the stun faded before they hit again.<br />
   <br />
   Just as a side note the Brute +2 lvl higher then me took 36 seconds to down I dealt 2884 dmg with 1 MS 2 Overpowers and one Sunder Thrown in. The Brute did 1114 dmg to me roughly 1/3 of my health (one heavy silk band aid) I didn't use Demo Shout or Battle shout both of which would have altered those numbers for the better.<br />
<br />
   I'd like to see a log from a rogue to see how their dps holds up in a fight with a +2 con upper 40's to this technique and how much dmg they recieve.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I gotta disagree when they put a programming language (http://www.lua.org) in their UI macro's for just this sort of thing.  If it bothers em that much, something like a 6 second delay after switching before you can switch again would be perfect imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">02-04-2005, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other way around Lorre, just wanna make sure everyone knows that's a typo.<br />
<br />
Thanks Haass, went back and editted it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Some people still don't get it.  You can NOT put the best DPS on the best mitigation class.  Don't you people remember Monks?  I don't care what your goddamned &quot;Vision&quot; for a warrior is, it's not going to happen in an MMO because IT CAN'T.  You want to be Conan and deal out ridiculous DPS?  Then you get a fuckin loincloth pal, because that's how games like this have to be balanced.<br />
<br />
The warrior, in every game, is designed to be the class who's tanking the bosses, and tanking everything up until then.  They have the highest survivability against every single mob in the game and it has to be balanced against something.  If you make it so warriors can do rogue or hunter DPS, and keep them at the same mitigation level, THEN YOU JUST ELIMINATED ANY REASON TO PLAY ANY OTHER CLASS.  Fucking christ, I don't know why this is so impossible to understand.<br />
<br />
Remember the monks.<br />
<br />
This is the core reason why we cannot get upgraded.  They deem us fine in PvE and essential in the instance/raid role.  We are the tanks and to boost us for PvE would mean that those instances will be easier, etc.  They cannot change us in a way to benefit PvE for Kalgan clearly states that a boost to us would mean they would have to boost all the mobs and such to make it even.<br />
<br />
Now here's my idea, give us more usefull PvP or escape tools that we can use that we CANNOT use for PvE.  Example is Intimidating shout, no one is going to use it in an instance if they want anyone to survive.  Its a great ability for PvP though.  We need more useful PvP/horrible PvE abilities that can boost us back up to the killing fields.<br />
<br />
Priest for example do wonderful in PvP AND they are essential to instances.  Why can't warriors have that same effect, awsome in PvE instances and pretty darn good in PvP.  My big gripe is on PvP mostly because I'm on a PvP server.  The guts and glory of the battlefields are gonna be based on how many people you kill.  <br />
<br />
I can solo even level mobs, or mobs +2 levels above me, just fine.  Heck, if I pick the right mob I can solo +3 levels above me. <br />
<br />
That said, they would all tell you trying to XP grind on +2 level mobs is retarded.  You can gain exerpience much more quickly and efficiently by focusing on mobs your level or a couple levels below you.<br />
<br />
The point your missing is that other classes DO solo +2 mobs efficiently.  Just because we can't doesn't mean they would be better off doing weaker mobs.<br />
<br />
I guess people are bitching because they dont have a warrior version of vanish or feign dead type ability. Hate to break it to you but vanish fails very often and feign dead seems quite unreliable also. :P<br />
<br />
True, but they both have speed abilities that allow them to run away.  Rogues get sprint, hunters get pets and cheetah.  Sick pet in and run, revive him later.<br />
<br />
However I can see that PvP is going to be a major part of the game and I'm wondering what my role is there. It's my expectation that PvP will be mobile, fluid and ranged. Kills will have to be quick because taking too long means the near certainty of interference. The warriors lack of range, of front loaded damage, high DPS, mobility and resistance to mobility impairment seems likely to make them under-performers on the battlefield. Not to mention the entire rage mechanic puts a limit on the pace I can achieve. Nor is the warriors durability overly impressive, the only people likely to be bothered by my armor are other warriors and perhaps hunters. The majority of the rest of the damage will be magic against a hit point pool that is not massively larger than anyone elses and which I have no unique tools to shield or renew.<br />
<br />
The warriors primarily ability is aggro management and stable mitigation of melee damage. I don't see those two things transferring at all well to the battlefield. Stable mitigation is only good when you have someone healing you, yet all the heal classes are stronger in PvP than I. Will they shackle themselves to me? I suspect not, even if the battlefield is table enough to achieve such co-ordination.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors in the battlefields will have a role.  There will be npc type encounters, mobs and bosses that we must kill inorder to take over an outpost.  We can be used to tank these bosses while the rest of the raid force kills them off.  My brother is a paladin and he hopes to tank the giant summoned elementals and such if the other side does summon them.  I personally would rather do the role of killing other pcs.  Which role do you want in the Battlegrounds . . . NPC Tank or Horde/Alliance Vanquisher?</div></div><hr />

It runs them in the direction the mob came from... ie. If you pulls add from the room your heading to and pop I.S. your very likely gonna to get every mob left in the next room. Had a warrior grouped with me in Uldaman pop I.S. on accident we ended up with about 15 elite Troggs beating on us. Intimidating shout is great for areas you've been exp grinding in that are cleared or wide open. It's great for PvP especially with Hunters or Warlocks who use Pets since you can fear the pet Hamstring the hunter and laugh as he slowly flees before you, but please for the love of god don't pop it deep in an instance or your group will likely hate you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said, I wouldn't get all fuckin cozy with it, because it's not gonna be that way forever.<br />
<br />
This IS Blizzard, the makers of Diablo where weapon sets were built into the game.  If they were to make a change to this system I would expect it to be to make it part of the default UI.  However, since there are already at least 3-4 different UI mods that accomplish this, not to mention the relatively simple task of making your own /script commands all of which you can find linked/explained on the warrior boards if you spend ANY time looking, I doubt any such change will happen.  <br />
<br />
I would be HIGHLY surprised to see them do anything to actively block this since its been around and widely used since very very early in the beta.  Finally, I have to agree with the &quot;If they didn't want us to do it they wouldn't have the lua system in place&quot;.  In beta I watched them change the functionality of the lua system to prevent some things they didn't want happening(autobuff) as well as integrating some UI customizations into the default UI(quest share, batch tradeskill combines), most likely if they were going to prevent weapon swapping via scripts they would have done so at the same time they made these other changes.  I haven't seen anything of that nature changed in retail which would lead me to believe they've ironed out most of the kinks as they see them in what the lua system allows and aren't likely to touch it again unless something gamebreaking pops up(there are alliance/horde translating tools out there but most UI modders smartly stay away to prevent a UI modding nerf) or the desire to add more features.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-04-2005, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the fuck.<br />
<br />
Where is the communication breakdown here?  I'm not talking about your fucking macros for weapon swaps (Which by the way, are lame as hell.  Who the fuck is incapable of opening their bags and right clicking on a weapon?), i'm talking about the fact that YOU CAN DUAL WIELD AND USE A 2H AT THE SAME TIME.<br />
<br />
Kermey, there's only 2 ways this can be.  Either your 2h waits for it's delay to cycle before it swings, and you ARE NOT GAINING ANY DPS OTHER THAN FROM THE EXTRA WEAPON DAMAGE ON THE SPECIAL ATTACK, or the 2h swings as soon as you equip it and you can essentially wield 3 weapons at once, which is a bug.  <br />
<br />
Now, I've been trying to determine which one it is for 2 goddamned days now while you talk in circles.  Figure out which one it is, because whatever way is true, half of what you are saying is wrong. <br />
<br />
I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT WEAPON SWITCHING OR MACROING.  I AM TALKING ABOUT THE DELAY BEFORE A TWO HANDED WEAPON HITS WHEN IT'S EQUIPPED.  <br />
<br />
Since delay of your attack doesn't come at the beginning of a round of attacks or warriors would charge with a 2hander and stand arond for 3 seconds while the stun faded before they hit again. <br />
<br />
Never used a weighted axe in EQ did you?</div></div><hr />

macros are faster than you.  MUCH faster.  If you can switch weaps from your bag while cycling through 5 targets then more power to ya man.  My hands are busy pushing ability buttons and mouse clicking on targets.  And in PvP (even if you dont care about PvP, it is very much a part of WoW), you're gonna get owned pretty hard by the folks who do choose to use macros to maximize things like weap dmg + X instant attacks.<br />
Either your 2h waits for it's delay to cycle before it swings, and you ARE NOT GAINING ANY DPS OTHER THAN FROM THE EXTRA WEAPON DAMAGE ON THE SPECIAL ATTACK, or the 2h swings as soon as you equip it and you can essentially wield 3 weapons at once, which is a bug.<br />
You just about got it.  The 2h waits for his DW weap's delay to cycle before it swings.  Same's true when he switches back to DW from 2h, the game makes you wait for the 2h delay to cycle before it starts in with DW rolls.<br />
<br />
Its only good for maxing damage output on your instant attacks.  It doesnt up your normal melee.  If anything it slows that down.  Its just a way to geek out more dmg on the MS or Overpower instant moves.</div></div><hr />

Kalgan stated that we should be getting rage from parries, blocks, and dodges, and this will be fixed, that will provide a nice PvE boost.<br />
<br />
Mostly it seems to be in the realm of PvP that warriors are lacking. And I don't even care that much about 1v1 pvp, I'm concerned about battlefields. Right now there really isn't any reason to not just ignore a warrior and go right for the squishier and far more dangerous member of the opposing force. I would like to see some minor tweaks like taunt working in PvP (swtiches your opponent's target for 3 seconds or somesuch), maybe some kind of knockdown ability if you are behind an opponent. A warrior should be able to dive into the fray and harrass people into wanting to kill you instead of leaving you to last becaue they really represent little threat.<br />
<br />
But my warrior is still a major lowbie, so we'll see how it all plays out by the time I catch up with you guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
THAT is a really good idea.  Maybe a lvl40ish ability that knocks down the opponent for 2 seconds and interupts casting, etc.  That would put the fear into someone.  Put it on a 30-60 second timer and you have winner.  I'm not sure about having to be behind a monster though.  Would kinda gimp it for anything other PvP , since most likely the monster is going to be facing you the entire fight even in a group.</div></div><hr />

That's a battlefield role, but I don't know i'd call it PvP. From what I've read this is how DaoC was on launch as well. You'd bring along some warriors to tank fortification NPC's, but that was about the limits of their involvement.

<br />
As Unclebong pointed out, since you're basically incapable of seeing it, your delay on your 2h is being applied, it's just being applied after the swing.  Which basically means that once you equip your dual wield combo again, you're standing around doing nothing for 3.8 seconds while you wait for your delay to come up.  <br />
<br />
You keep telling people that they need to see the difference between raw damage and DPS, when you can't see it yourself.  Raw damage =/= DPS, and it is not an indicator of DPS.   The fact that you Mortal strike and then get a swing after that before going back to low damage, fast weaponry does not instantly mean that you are producing more DPS, it means that you just hit for more raw damage.  Of course, I don't expect you to learn this doing your l33t farming of the auctionhouse, so believe what you want.<br />
<br />
As for your DPS compared to mine, I'll give you a clue.  You have a different build than me, one that involves (omg!) Mortal Strike, which is only there for damage (What a shock).  Any differences between our DPS are coming from 3 things --<br />
<br />
1) Mortal Strike (or other talents)<br />
2) Weapon Difference.<br />
3) and finally, the miniscule amount of damage you get from swapping in a 2h before overpower.<br />
<br />
IN THAT ORDER.<br />
<br />
Get a clue.  Mortal strike is the reason your DPS is higher than mine.  The fact that you dual wield purple weapons as a result of your conquering of the mighty auctionhouse contributes another portion, and finally the 2h swap for overpower (since I'm already using a 2h to solo, genius).<br />
<br />
Any other differences exist only in your mind.</div></div><hr />

If my MS build allows me to do 1700+ more dmg then yours in 17 seconds compared to your build and kill 19 seconds faster and take less dmg from the same mob but my cahracter is two lvls lower... then you have no room to give advice on warrior soloability... I will from this point on listen to more skilled players then yourself. Because that much difference in our warriors isn't &quot;Only in my head&quot; but in your combatlog... I would like to think your gear isn't exactly gimped since your wielding a truesilver Champion... so our gear choices can't be that different. Seems to me you didn't go full protection build since your using 2hander and you didn't go dmg since you dont Have mortal strike... so your combatlog must serve a purpose to show what happens when a warrior chooses not to be particularly good any anything... mediocre dmg and mitigation. btw.... I can still get 2 MS swings and 2 2hander Swings in every 6-8 seconds on top of any hits my flurry does in between MS refreshs vs 3 hits every 6 seconds (Assuming one to start one in the middle and one at the end) so... you do the math in your head and tell me how it plays out for you.</div></div><hr />

Which basically means that once you equip your dual wield combo again, you're standing around doing nothing for 3.8 seconds while you wait for your delay to come up.  <br />
<br />
You keep telling people that they need to see the difference between raw damage and DPS, when you can't see it yourself.  Raw damage =/= DPS, and it is not an indicator of DPS.   The fact that you Mortal strike and then get a swing after that before going back to low damage, fast weaponry does not instantly mean that you are producing more DPS, it means that you just hit for more raw damage.  Of course, I don't expect you to learn this doing your l33t farming of the auctionhouse, so believe what you want.<br />
<br />
As for your DPS compared to mine, I'll give you a clue.  You have a different build than me, one that involves (omg!) Mortal Strike, which is only there for damage (What a shock).  Any differences between our DPS are coming from 3 things --<br />
<br />
1) Mortal Strike (or other talents)<br />
2) Weapon Difference.<br />
3) and finally, the miniscule amount of damage you get from swapping in a 2h before overpower.<br />
<br />
IN THAT ORDER.<br />
<br />
Get a clue.  Mortal strike is the reason your DPS is higher than mine.  The fact that you dual wield purple weapons as a result of your conquering of the mighty auctionhouse contributes another portion, and finally the 2h swap for overpower (since I'm already using a 2h to solo, genius).<br />
<br />
Any other differences exist only in your mind.<br />
<br />
Actually, the log shows how his 2H delay didn't reset when he swap his weapon, so he's also doing more damage by swinging his weapon faster than it should have been able to, which I think is what accounts for the considerable difference in DPS, not that he uses 2H to overpower/MS.<br />
<br />
Of course, the 2H delay not resetting when switching weapon is most likely a bug, and being able to do more damage via bugs doesn't really say much.</div></div><hr />

not sure where you seeing that.  It looked to me like the first normal 2h hit occurs aprox 1.5 sec after his last DW hit lands.  So its waiting for his 1h delay to finish before hitting with the 2h.<br />
<br />
I cant remember now, but it seems I usually hit the mob as soon as I turn auto attack on and then the weap dealy kicks in.  Maybe I'm smoking too much of the halflings weed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do use MS!!!!It says MS in there, but I don't like to save my rage up forever and ever. So I heroic strike then after a few, I MS. I don't get enough rage to use it often. Not until recently atleast. I am not new to the game :P. MS is garbage anyhow, it should be cheaper or the lame effect it has should last longer. But to answer your question lorre I do in fact use MS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, that string of combat moves is pure bullshit ... if you have MS you dont fire strings of HS's .. what you can do is use HS and MS simultaneously when you have enough rage cause MS is an extra swing. You forgot to mention that you also keep praying that these attacks hit the target.<br />
<br />
Indeed you do pray they hit. My MS misses more than I would like. And damnit I do use MS. But whatever I have a 59 war on burning blade if you want to duel! :P</div></div><hr />

yea there's a lotta stuff like that re: our talents and skills.   I would love to see MS knocked down a spot or two in the talent tree so that we're not quite so forced into going one way or another.<br />
<br />
right now, the benifits of MS in the over all game play are &gt; than prot right now if your PvE goal is to raid.  Just not enough oomph in the prot tree against mobs that are landing 800+ after mitigation =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">strife__26</div><div class="date">02-05-2005, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You see, I read about 3/4 of this thread and I've come to the conclusion that 90% of the warriors can't even comprehend how much worse they are at soloing than any other classes and it pretty much comes down to the fact that warriors can't do two things. First warriors can't heal mid combat, and second their DPS isn't anywhere near what the other classes have that can't heal themselves. <br />
<br />
Every example I've read about &quot;warriors soloing fine&quot; has people soloing lower level mobs. I don't think people realize that many other classes can solo +3 mobs or even multiple +2 mobs regardless of talent build just as efficiently as a warrior can solo a even con mob. <br />
<br />
You know, I think they could fix a lot of the problems by making it so warriors didn't have to channel bandages in combat. I doubt it would be totally over powered if you could only self target with it, especially with the bandage cooldown time.<br />
<br />
I think soloing is my only beef and thank god I don't have to do it anymore, I haven't had any problems holding agro grouped or mitigating damage since I switched to a defensive build.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can solo +3 easy! +4 maybe +5 if its a caster with retaliation. I do not think anyone solos too much better than a warrior. The only one I would say solos faster than most is a mage, but I'm not 100% on that I see how they beat me in duels pretty easy, and how they AE mobs in instances and think they must solo pretty quickly as long as they are not resisted, but warriors (atleast I do) do just fine soloing. I get alot of crits in a fight so that ups my dmg quite a bit. I have got 5 crits in a row, and I get 4 crits in a row quite often, esp. on lower lvls mobs. I get them on higher lvls too. I've been fighting in eastern plagues since 55 and I've been killing 57-58s the whole time trying to farm a brain hacker. Ofcourse I've had my fair share of deaths, but usually cause of trying to fight adds or being feared by death singers into other mobs. Anyway I do fine solo!</div></div><hr />

You are right in one thing though - number of posts is meaningless in and of itself, the reason it's used as an insult is mostly because it is kind of suggestive that you created the account to post - and creating an account to post something starting with calling someone a big baby is really not the best way to introduce yourself.<br />

Whatever! MS is gay. I do in fact use it though. I don't know how many times I HS I was just saying i use it alot. Its half the cost of MS, it is not instant yeah so, it adds close to the same dmg to the swing while MS is 30 rage instant and has some lame ass effect on it. I usually MS the HS, IF I have the rage, which depending on what lvl and where you are fighting you may or may not get alot of rage before something is dead. I never had rage at end of battle. I can't stand seeing warriors who have 50+ rage when a battle is done. I can beat most warriors higher than me and Ive beat more 60 rogues than have beat me, so I don't care if you think I'm the better warrior. I was just being a dick, cause hes talking about mr 3 posts like that matters. I have been beat by rogues lower than me too though I won't lie, they use chain stuns and that gets me sometimes, but usually I win! I beat a horde 60 def warrior 2 outta 2 last night, I thought that was cool, cause I hate defensive. Sorry for all the posts, and if I'm rude.</div></div><hr />

Heh, no it's not.  Considering you don't gain rage when using it, HS costs average from about 20-25 rage depending on your weapon type/speed.  It's good for a rage dump, and burst damage with a fast weapon, but MS blows it out of the water for effeciency.</div></div><hr />

Awesome, so you can solo a +3 mob once every ten minutes if it's a caster, where a shaman, mage, warlock or rogue could probably do five +3 mobs back to back without a break. I'm sure warriors solo just as efficiently.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse I've had my fair share of deaths, but usually cause of trying to fight adds or being feared by death singers into other mobs<br />
Fucking exactly. If you get a higher level add you have to run or die. If you want to bring up any other class I'm pretty sure I can tell you how they can deal with it regardless of talent build.<br />
<br />
I don't have problems soloing now, nor do I have to solo anymore, I was just saying it was a bitch to get where I am today. I've played other classes at 55+ since I have access to a few accounts, as well as a level 40 shaman myself, it's not like I'm just making shit up. Try playing another high level class and you'll see the difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though, what you can solo isn't really the issue, but how efficiently you can do so.  For example Hunters and Paladins don't solo particularly solo very fast but their survivability is quite a bit higher so that makes them better soloers in that regard.<br />
<br />
The Warrior class certainly has to work a lot harder to do the same thing, and it's not too obvious how this pays off in the endgame either especially if you're on the alliance side.</div></div><hr />

I started a warrior in the beginning of retail FOR MS.  Then they changed it and I was sad, but I still use it.  Try this, you might see some difference in your solo speed or dps.<br />
<br />
Charge into the fight, demo shout, (battle shout if you dont have it up), then do nothing but attack and MS.  I kill much much faster useing nothing but MS.  I use to sunder, rend, hamstring, etc.  I find the most efficient, fast, highest dps way of fighting mobs is using just MS.  With a two hander, rage comes pretty fast.<br />
<br />
And as for adds, as my priest I can usually kill the second mob IF I get an add during a fight.  I'm fighting in practically the same spots with my warrior and my priest.  The priest solo's much faster and there is almost no chance of me dying.  I have 21% mitigation with my gear, with inner fire up.  When Im in shadow form, that bumps it up to 36% mitigation with a cloth wearer!  Thats getting close to leather, even chain armor.  And I am mainly +int geared, mostly for soloing.</div></div><hr />

Dude I said I can solo +3 mobs easy. Probably 5-10 before i need to bandage or rest. I said +4 or +5 with retaliate. I can solo 2 usually, depending on lvls and the situation. I'm using MS more now, just for all you peeps :P. Its hard in instances, things die so fast and or rage just doesnt come fast enough when im trying to aggro because I am an arms war so i have to get aggro with thunderclap, cleave, demo shout, and or sweepstrikes so that hogs the rage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slitz</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My background: I've played a mage to 45 (yes I know, far from 60 so you may ignore this post if you don't think I have enough background to be apart of this discussion) and I'm currently playing a warrior (which will be my main once the EU retail version arrive). <br />
<br />
Since everyone seem to think mages are so good soloers, I just wanted to share my opinion of the matter. <br />
<br />
First of all, the solo ability really depends on wether we are talking about a Fire specced mage or a Frost specced mage. The 10-15 seconds killing you talk about is either a fire specced mage or a very stupid mage. <br />
<br />
In order for a mage to kill an even level mob in 10-15 seconds he either have to burn all his mana or be fire specced and use his instant spells. <br />
In either case he burn a lot of mana and the only really good solo mage is the frost mage (fire spec deal more damage, but is far from as mana effecient as the frost mage)  He can kill 3-4 mobs before drinking (4-5 when frostbite is full), but then we certainly aren't talking about 10-15 seconds kills, more like 25-30 second ones (if lucky with frostbite and crits it can be a lot lower though, but the average is around 25-30).<br />
<br />
If you however decide as a mage to kill a mob in 10-15 seconds you pretty much waste 50-60% of your mana, and that certainly isn't a valid solo option. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to bring up some speculated numbers since, they are just that, speculations. But it's my belief at least that the warrior, while not as good, is very close to the kill rate of a mage in solo situations (included downtime). <br />
<br />
I pretty much kill as fast with my warrior as with my mage (unless I want to spend a lot of mana) and we pretty much have equal downtime. <br />
I use bandages on every other mob and eat every 5-6th mob perhaps while I drink twice every 4-5th mob (yes I know about the manaregen outside combat. But lets be realistic, who focus on spirit and thus have the [X] optimistic amount manaregen so many people here bring up? Perhaps 60-70% of it is more realistic)<br />
In the perfect world, a mage would probably get 20-30% more xp than the warrior would in the same time. However, a single sidestep with for instance two mobs in a pull instead of the desired one, will drain the mage mana drastically even though they have polymorph (which will not drain a warrior as much as a mage if it occur due to the mana/hp and rage nature).<br />
<br />
So it's at least my conclusion that a mage get aprox 10-15% more xp than the warrior solo for the same amount of time. <br />
While it look like the perfect solo class in theory it certainly isn't in practice.</div></div><hr />

At first, I was Engineer so I could use bombs for that AOE aggro at no rage cost, but it seems like every mage I group outside of guild just loves to overnuke and blow all of his (and the healer's) mana away. So fuck 'em. Let their reckless asses die, I'm going for extended survivability.<br />
<br />
Anyway, with an endless stock of potions, I can give myself a rather nice buff and even heal myself for those adds. If you sell cloth, you're fucking up - bandages are the best thing that could happen in the light that you can enter the next fight fully healed with a good amount of rage.<br />
<br />
I've solo'd a rogue to 38, warlock to lv44, and warrior is 49 - while warrior still isn't as easy as simply mashing the Vanish button or sending my pet in/sacrifice, I still find it to be much less of a headache than it was with other professions.<br />
<br />
Note: I'm Arms/Fury build with axe spec and a 160-190ish damage two-handed axe. Gear is STR primary and AGI/STA secondary. Basic tactic is to use improved charge, hit once, mortal strike, berserk stance, berserker rage + whirlwind, then MS again once it's refreshed. At this point, if I just wait to execute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krun</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just wondering why people are still so obsessed about solo capabilities.  I mean leveling in this game is a total joke, those who've played EQ since classics know what i'm talking about, you can do 1 lvl a day without even trying i can't imagine if you did a full grind of quest for xp (EQ style 18 hour straight grind) how fast you'd level.<br />
<br />
What i'm saying is the 10 sec extra downtime or what not won't kill you, in fact you'll hit 60 in no time unless your mentally challenged.  Then what happens? It's like watching &quot;Groundhog day&quot;  the same shit over and over and over, there's not extra timesink dump the way EQ had with AA's, everyone becomes equal in terms of skills at 60 and all about gear to differentiate 1 toon from another, and that's where people get obsessed about the last 4 instances and doing raids like onyxya etc..<br />
<br />
So unless they drastically change the way xp works (which they should to an extent, i'd say 50% slower then what it is atm would be perfect but that's just my opinion), or unless they introduce AA's or what not people should just move on from the 'we can't solo as well as X class whines'... trust me you'll get there more sooner then you'd like.<br />
<br />
The real question is will they introduce some form of AA's while maintaining balance and that's prob the BIGGEST question i want to know from their plans 2 months from now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought hero classes were going to be the &quot;AA's&quot; for WoW. From everything that I've read, the devs want team based PvP to form a central activity in the game. They expressly decided that leveling would be fast, fun, and rewarding, not a grind, since to PvP in any game you nearly always have to be at the level cap to have a full range of tools. Toss in PvE raids and instances for when you don't want to PvP and that completes the package that is WoW. At least, that's what I've gleaned from various information that I've read about WoW from the devs.<br />
<br />
They kept group size low at 5 players to help battle from becoming gankfests like they were in DAoC. Downtime low to facilitate  players without much time to stare at thier health/power meters for 30 imnutes at a time. (I think it took my EQ druid upwards of 15 minutes without KEI to med 0 - 100% when she was leveling.) Kinda hard to feel like your going anywhere when ever kill (or 4 per quad for my druid) takes over 15 minutes and the reward is so low that you'd have a hard time telling a difference in XP. Don't get me started warrior health regen.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that there's no downtime in WoW, or that you should just be grateful that we don't have the EQ devs making this game. I am going to say that any less downtime and there would even be a such thing as down time in WoW. I mean, really, it only takes a moment long enough for you to breath and select the next target and your ready to go, if you've prepared yourself with level appropriate food.<br />

Personally, WoW instances are challenging enough for me atm to keep me occupied in PVE. I wish I was in a PVP server though.</div></div><hr />

except this, I agree with Vikken, and emphsize even more what WoW is meant to become: TEAM PvP, so to all the forums 'tards that whine about their poor 1v1 PvP power, I will tell &quot;stop anoying us and the dev with your stupid whines, this is Warcaft (originally a RTS) not QuakeX, it isn't you agaisnt the universe but your army agaisnt the other one!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to actually play on a PvP server to comment about PvP mechanics. It's not very often that &quot;armies&quot; of heroes assemble to have PvP fun. Mostly it's much smaller like 1 vs 1 scenarios. I have no issues with team PvP. I have no issues with grouped PvE. I just want to be able to survive, if not win, in a 1 vs 1 scenario. I still sometimes win duels vs other classes but they are still unpredictable, doesn't mean my class is powerful, does it? You simply can not compare classes unless you play on a PvP server or have VAST PvP knowledge from duels, the latter you still can't have duelling carebears on your RP servers.<br />
<br />
I've asked this question before in this thread and people eluded it for obvious reasons while maintaining their claims based on their experiences from PvE (which I'm sure are quite intoxicating). <br />
<br />
Question is: Name the class weakest in PvP. Another question while we're at it is: Name the weakest overall solo PvE class. Question #2 is optional by the way.<br />
<br />
I'm telling you the PvP situation is BAD. People laugh at warriors, make jokes about our weak PvP. They say &quot;There is no such thing as a good warrior (in PvP)&quot;. And they are right. Potions will help but they won't get you too far. Isn't this fucking ridiculous that warriors have always been the weakest patheticly dependant class in all popular MMORPGs till now? I know the problem with most of the EQ veterans here. They are used to playing a shit warrior AND most of them are from PvE servers so they generally have no idea about PvP.<br />
<br />
Now please don't bring in that Conan shit again. Or the &quot;shine in instances&quot; trade off argument. Doesn't a healer really shine in instances? Or a mage? Use you fucking head. And all the noobs you are welcome to reply to me but it wouldn't mean I'll heed your opinions too much. My suggestion is: Give us warriors &quot;Windwalk&quot;. If you have played Warcraft 3 you should know what that is. Grom Hellscream had this ability and he's a warrior. What it does is, it gives you about 40% increased run speed while also turning you invisible to hostiles, allowing you to escape from encounters gone bad. This will atleast allow us to survive PvP encounters. As for offense they can either adjust the timers of some of our abilities and/or give us more talent points, whatever to make PvP BALANCED.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totally agree with Marshall, PvP servers are a different beast.  I think the majority of people that say warriors are ok are playing on normal or RP servers.  You may have dueled people in front of IF or SW, but PvP is a constant duel.  You get jumped at the worst times, and usually outnumbered too.  My damn healing class (priest) have more methods of escape than my warrior does.  Its gotten to the point that I believe most people don't even attack me anymore.  They see warrior, they feel bad for us, they usually leave us alone.<br />
<br />
My my priest gets jumped ALL the time, but I usually escape.  I have actually turned the tide a few times and killed the person that jumped me while I was fighting mobs.  And to say its 1 vs 1 and this game is group pvp doesn't apply.  In group pvp, the reason you aren't dead so fast is because we aren't too much of a threat.  Would you go after the mage casting aoe, polying your group members, and nuking the crap outta your healers or go after the warrior with limited abilities, and moderate dps?  Which one is more of a threat?<br />
<br />
Being a tank in PvP is very limited.  You cannot taunt the other side from attacking the robe classes.  There's no way for you to make them attack you.  Thus the tank class is good for PvE, and really has no ultility in PvP.</div></div><hr />

I never found warriors to be the weakest patheticly dependant class in all popular MMORPG's till now.  In fact, just the opposite.  I picked warrior in the first place because he was the only mofo getting out of dodge (to the zone line in EQ ; ) when the trains showed up.<br />
<br />
You play on an mmo pvp server.  You did this by choice.  You (apparently) also knew how bad off warriors have had it in past mmo's, and how bad off they have it WoW, and yet you still play one.  (Honestly, wtf are you doing playing MMO's if player versus player is your bag?)  Many folks I know who enjoy mmo's enjoy because its NOT a frag fest.  They dont like playing PvP becuase for the most part, its gay to the fucking Nth degree in any mmo.  The whole idea is you cant do it all yourself, that you gotta have friends watching your back.<br />
Question is: Name the class weakest in PvP.<br />
Warrior.<br />
<br />
Find me an mmo that had any kind of raid content where that wasnt the case.</div></div><hr />

DAoC?  UO?  <br />
<br />
Armsmen in DAoC did pretty well in PvP, they were far from the weakest class.  Those polearms hurt!  UO warrior builds did some kick butt, but then again they could pick up healing and spells and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cant comment on UO, didnt play it.  Did they have the sort of 40man PvE raids in UO like what we got in WoW or had in EQ?<br />
<br />
DAoC? HAHAHA give me a break.  That game had damn near zero PvE content.  It was a linear grind iirc.  Of course, I quit after a month because it was boring me to tears.  I did hear they finally got around to adding some real PvE content a while back.  Wonder how thats doing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors are not the weakest in PvP.... we have the highest AC and HP and tons of tricks to use in PvP. We can close distance on casters and stun for 3 seconds, hamstring so they cant run away, we have extremely hard hitting abilities can fear pet users, and if you don't have Deep wounds fear your target and heal back to full with one bandage. Spent 5 hours last night dueling/pvping... I'm going from a MS/Arms perspective so my comments may not effect your protection spec PvP play... I understand this. First off Tactical Mastery is a must in PvP being able to go berserker and close the distance when you get rooted or sheeped makes it insanely easier, switching back to battle to pop Overpower on rogues who dodge alot, defensive to disarm, back to berserker to pop WW for an extra instant hit if you have enough rage and MS isn't back up.<br />
<br />
Warlock and Mages are evil... Let's get these out of the way first. Sheep is just plain degrading for warriors in dueling, but if you remember to switch to berserker stance after your initial charge then you can close the gap and stun. They have very low hp and armor so they can be one or two rounded. warlocks are not so bad to duel. Mages absolutely suck to duel they teleport all over the place and will make you dizzy trying to follow. Pummel helps stop those big damaging casts. Hey warriors cant beat every class consistantly but mages will drop if they arent ready to teleport away or arent expecting you to stun or hit as hard as we are capable of hitting. Also remember Berserker Rage makes you immune to Fear, Warlocks hate you for it.<br />
<br />
Hunters f-in hate dueling warriors. even if they get a trap and freeze you as soon as it ends you can be right on em hamstring and they drop f-in fast, if the pet starts to hurt  you Initmidating shout and the hunter is left alone with a superior melee beating on em.<br />
<br />
Rogues do alot of dmg on thier initial stun abilities. As soon as thats over most warriors are left with very little hit points. Just pop Intimidating Shout as soon as the initial burst dmg is over bind back to almost full and then the playing field is significantly leveled. Was dropping rogues 2-4 lvls above me by using this tactic.<br />
<br />
Druids only stand a chance if they can root/nuke you... pick up a pair of ornate mithril boots and they want to cry. Dire bear druids can't out melee you and if they can't root you to back up for healing if you have mortal striked them they can't heal fast enoughat 50% healing ability. Has anyone pvp'ed a druid lately? For some reason my Execute was becoming available really early in the fights I was wondering if anyone has noticed this bug? Especially in Dire Bear form I can execute almost immediately.<br />
<br />
Warriors who are +2-4 lvls higher then me give me the most trouble. Higher AC and Weapon skill means I hit for less and They hit me more often and harder. This is where my tactics shift. I invested in a slow big hitting axe and it helps. I'm sure alot of you who were eq veterans rememer jousting in PvP. The idea is the same. Hamstring Hit move out of melee for a second turn back run past hit in the process continue on past while your weapon refreshes run past MS Hit you get the idea. I can go toe to toe with equal lvl or lower cons using my normal Dual Wield Weapon switch tactics but not very well vs higher lvl warriors. Disarm is the bane of Warriors especially if they use a 2hander. Duel wield warriors dmg is cut drastically but they can still hit with the off hand weapon.<br />
<br />
Paladins are the most annoying in PvP their dmg is usually not a big factor but their  healing and immunity buttons will drive you crazy. These fight tend to be long and drawn out, but if you watch for the right moments warriors survivability can really increase. First off I charge if possible build rage and  MS as soon as I can this cuts their healing effectiveness and drops their health a good chunk. Then I switch to dual wield my hits are smaller and the dmg evens out making them comfortable with the timing of when they need to heal. I use as little rage as I can during the time I drop the middle portion of their health. At about 30-40% I've built up alot of rage I switch weapons and MS then Switch to Berserker and WW this usually drops them to around 10-15% health just enough for me to Execute the last of their health. If my hits don't land as hoped I don't panick.. at this time they pally is cuaght off guard. Sometimes they manage to get their &quot;I win&quot; i mean immune button off so I back up and Bind wound this usually causes them to attack me after only one weak heal to themselves since I used Mortal Strike. Then I continue to MS Execute if the fight gets close and I'm loosing I will pop Intimidating Shout then back up for a 3 second stun in berserker stance and the fight is over. Lay on hands is annoying but they cant use it that often so 9-1 isn't a terrible record for a warrior whom some of you consider to be the weakest PvP. Also you can pummel if they try to cast healing spells in combat.<br />

Hope any of this helps your pvp woes. Probably not Haass' but hey he's got the uber group to back him up......</div></div><hr />
