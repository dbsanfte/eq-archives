J/K ... I see all these warriors absoulutely distraught over which weapons to use for maximum efficiency (most I've never even heard of) I just thought I would take us back in time 3-4 years.<br />

Was lvl 13 with 2 Langseax :) full bronze :)</div></div><hr />

Man those were the good 'ol days.  :p<br />

Not because I resent those folks having it so much easier than so many of us used to, but just because there is any question in their mind as to whether weapons that are better than anything that existed when some of us were newbies are good for their level. :)<br />

Beo</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I hate is the &quot;fake help&quot; post.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a level 15 Warrior, should I have my 28/30 in main hand or my 16/19&quot; or some such, which translates &quot;Look at what I have&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slaag</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the funniest thing is when absolutely UBER warriors come to the board asking ... &quot;what weapons should I use&quot; then they proceed to list these weapons from the elemental planes or better, and are so very &quot;confused&quot; with what to do!<br />
<br />
ROFL F**K OFF!!!! <br />
<br />
98% of warriors will never even see any of those weapons! you are just trying to stroke your own **** and get people to say &quot;OMG dude!, those weapons OWN!! you must be a god!&quot;<br />
<br />
You could care less what most warriors suggest! (Not all cases, but most)</div></div><hr />

SBH was the first drop I ever rolled on and won. Damn thing is still in my bank, won't even think about destroying it. <br />
/sigh, HHP, hitting level 20 in bronze and banded...it's true, we never can go home again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh i has dual langseaxes until 41 than upgraded to dual EBW's. than got my first SSoY at 46<br />
lets see who remembers wtf an EBW is :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
not like there were many weapons back than to choose from. i think the ballsiest was the razing sword of skarlon ( took a lot of mofos to go kill fire giants nevermind naggy himself..used to just toss fools at the thing and pray )....exe axe, err, 1hers were either the SSoY or an EBW if you could get in line to camp the maid/butler...err, demon claws off AoF in old CT...err, i can't remember anything else that was as defining as the langseax/langseax of the wolves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slaag</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember wanting a Brazen Brass Kilij so badly, I would lay awake at night trying to count the people I knew in EQ that would help me kill the Sand Giant required for one of the items hehe.<br />
<br />
400pp was just SOOOO out of reach that it was pointless to even try and save for it. MUCH easier to try and get 6-8 friends together and drop what they were doing to go kill a giant hehe.<br />
<br />
What was it 10/34 1H Slash?? This was going to be my upgrade to dual weilding Langsaux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow that does bring back a few OLD memories.  The first I ever heard of one was in an auction in ec, had to have it and gave just about every thing I hand to get it.  Checked out the quest and ran it at least 50 times, if payed for armor.   Most of the time I had a shaman with me for the Frostie runs but some times I had to beg a sow off a passing druid, and what a bummer to have the sow run out half way into the run or have some peep kill em before you got there. Yep its been a long long time.  Was a warrior in pigie heaven when I got my first 2hs langseax.<br />
<br />
Thanks, sorta makes me want to do the lion meat run once more.<br />

I was going to have all kinds of warm fuzzies for the person wanting to know which of these ancient weapons to use.<br />
<br />
I did the Lanseax quest 43 times to get my Lanseax of the Wolves.  Because of it, I was level 17 for two months.  I was so proud to own it!</div></div><hr />
