<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RazorEdge</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is &quot;riposte damage&quot; and why is it such a big deal when dual wielding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Riposte = avoiding an attack and counterattacking at the same time. Warriors get it at level 25. Mid-high mobs have riposte as well.<br />
<br />
The theory is that, since two fast weapons attack more often than one 2h weapon in a given time frame, you will be riposted more with dual wield. It was a widespread concern in the beginning of PoP but has been more or less debunked and trivialized since then. In other words, it's something to think about if you at 4000 HP are tanking an 800 hitter, but dual wield does not automatically equal suicide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zhakran</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It certainly doesn't equal suicide, but the fact is EP mobs DO riposte a retarded amount. You can see this, if you're ever for example NOT tanking, and hitting from the front of a boss mob, to counter push or some such. I mean, wielding a 2hander, attacking from the front, not tanking, you get hit pretty often. <br />
<br />
While it's not suicide, if you're talking about MTing EP boss mobs and up....it will certainly increase your survivability to use a 2hander as opposed to 2 really fast 1handers. Then again, the slower the 1hander is, the less of an issue it is. I mean DBoTW has a higher delay than a lot of 2handers that are considered top weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both Iskandar and zhakran have good points. I think it's safe to say that for the average joe warrior riposte damage is NOT a major concern though there is a LOT of hype about it. <br />
<br />
It's more of an issue when you are fighting mobs that hit HARD. In those cases, when you're tanking it may be wiser to use a 2hander with a slower delay to smooth out what can be spiky damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you are the MT how can you tell when the mob just hit normally or riposted you. I have never seen the message or maybe I have it turned off and am not aware of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you've likely turned off that message. I forget which exactly; someone can prolly help me out here.<br />
<br />
You can call a riposte if a mob hits you &quot;out of turn;&quot; that is, if they hit you while their delay is still refreshing, or if they hit you an inordinant amount of times (say like 6) in one round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Riposte is under 'my misses' since when enemy riposte by definition you miss.  A hit from Riposte is not distinquishable from a normal hit but you can sometimes tell by when you get hit (especially if mob is slowed).<br />
<br />
I remember seeing a shirveled mummy riposte.  Doesn't happen often but mobs get these skills way earlier than we do.  Heck, a level 5 Orc Centurion can double attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">riposte to me in earth is dual wielding and get 4cheals a mob, vrs using a 2hander for 2. <br />
<br />
Yeah and I aint shitting you either.<br />
<br />
Kadah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While ripostes contribute little DPS overall of the course of an encounter, its not really DPS that we're concerned about - mobs can hit up to 6 times in a single combat round - that'd be a successful dual wield with double attack, a kick, and a riposte. While its unlikely to happen, its a nasty damage spike, and in the case of tier2+ it can kill you if your low on HP (whether your low from waiting on a CH or bad equipments).<br />
<br />
It only gets worse as you progress through planes or harder raids. If you've got the AC and HP to dual wield, by all means go for it, but if your low on either I suggest you either pray the clerics got enough mana for you or to use a 2 handed weapon. Slow 1 handers also work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually a mob can potentially attack 11 times in one round.  It can do 4 + kick/bash, and then you can dual wield, double attack successfully and flurry successfully and then the mob riposted all 6 hits for a total of 11.<br />
<br />
Not that I've ever seen this happen unless it's on Enrage.  But 2 riposte hits do happen often enough to worry about them in spikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A mob can't attack 11 times in a round.  The most you will get is 4 +kick/bash, and flurries...<br />
<br />
Repostes are from you attacking, and thus are not occuring during the combat round, but can occur at nearly the same time, close enough to make it seem that they are part of the combat round, but they are not.  If you had attack off, or were out of range, etc, they would not happen, and are thusly not part of the mob's attack round.<br />
<br />
For that matter, kick and bash are not part of the attack round, as they are on a seperate timer from the attack delay.  They just may happen to occur at the same time as a attack round, but are not part of it.<br />
<br />
Hell, same goes for flurry.<br />
<br />
If you mean the greatest number of attacks that can occur in the same 1 second period, then its 14...<br />
<br />
4 attacks from the mob<br />
2 from its flurry<br />
1 from kick/bash<br />
4 from repostes of your attacks<br />
2 from repostes of your flurry<br />
1 from repostes of your kick/bash/slam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok thanks for the tips. Right now I need to upgrade my 1 hander setup. No proc weapons atm except for a Frosty. 2 Handers I have a Double Edged Gaknak (spelling) and GSoT for aggro weapon. Probably going to save up for a CHoS and SoTB. The planar stun seems to hold aggro real well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever I bite off more mob than I can chew is when the 1h'er go in the backpack.  For me, this is currently Hard LDoN mobs.  They hit me for 900+ sometimes, and I have seen 4500 of my HPs disappear instantly from a few max hits and ripostes.<br />
<br />
It was the same way when PoP came out, and I was fighting PoS minis (with a SBoZ, lol) and again when fighting greater puslings in CoD at about the same time.  Pulled out Frostreaver and things got easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to see a mob's ripostes against you, you have to turn the hitmode for your misses to &quot;Full&quot; or whatever, not &quot;Abbreviated&quot; or &quot;Number only.&quot; This option is in the right-click context menu for your chatbox.<br />
<br />
Also note that when it says, &quot;You attempt to slash a_mob but a_mob ripostes!&quot; the line immediately BEFORE that indicates that riposte attack against you. Like:<br />
<br />
a_mob slashes YOU for 1000 points of damage! &lt;---this is the riposte<br />
You attempt to slash a_mob but a_mob ripostes! &lt;---but it tells you on the NEXT line here<br />
<br />
Personally I would think it should be the other way around, but I guess that's just the way the EQ combat engine works /shrug</div></div><hr />
