<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been thinking about the year to come, and the various MMORPGs that are going to debut.  Same time, I'm looking at how SoE has dealt with competition in the past, and I think we might see some things this year that would have been unthinkable a few years back.  So, just for yocks, here's a few predictions on what we will see in EQ in the year to come:<br />
<br />
1. Epics V2.0 - the Berserker Epic and the Fabled &lt;whatever&gt; drops foreshadow this, imho.  Fabled mobs are a brilliant idea, they tap right into the nostalgia of the long time players.  A chance to upgrade our epics would have the same effect.  At the same time, the clearly out-of-line stats on the Berserker Epic have already generated a lot of griping, which SoE can then appease and look like good guys by providing Epic V2.0 quests.  More than likely, these new quests will be tied to a new expansion, maximizing the bling factor.<br />
<br />
2. Expansion #1 &quot;Legacy of Lost Dungeons&quot; - Aimed at lower to mid level casual players, will be a combination of LoY and LDoN, with lots of instanced small raid content.  For whatever reason, SoE has decided that 72 man raids are a bad thing, and will continue to force feed us 36 and 54 man raids.  New over-powered mid-level spells for all the casters, twink weapons for the melees.  A new system of portals to the last few remote zones will connect Highpass Keep to Western Wastes to Burning Woods to Rathe Mountains.<br />
<br />
3. Expansion #2 &quot;Steel Cage Match of Discord&quot; - Trash mobs that hit for 1500 and have less HP than a Crushbone Orc.  Level limit will be raised to 70, trivializing 80% of GoD progression.  Single group flagging trials that will require Berserkers to succeed.  Flag progressions that make getting to the Elementals look like getting keyed for the bottom floor of Befallen.  Each copy shipped with a fresh syringe.<br />
<br />
4. Two more old world zones revamped.  My candidates are Mistmoore and Kedge Keep, since they are the most underutilized dungeons I can think of.  Mobs will be elemental level hard, loot will be appropriate for 40th level twinks and will have a recommended level of 60.<br />
<br />
5. GM events and upgraded customer service will magically re-appear in the months before and after the opening of WoW.  Similarly, the Devs will appear on the melee class boards again at about the same time, but refuse to discuss class balance.<br />
<br />
6. Progression in GoD will remain broken for three more months, at which time it will be fixed in stages so as to allow Afterlife to complete GoD one month before the release of Expansion #1.  <br />
<br />
7. EQ2 will be an overgrown bunker-buster bomb.  EQ itself will suffer serious and permanent subscriber losses as its players escape to WoW and Vanguard.  EQ will finish the year with about 75% of the playerbase it started with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have been predicting the death of EQ since the release of Kunark.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you why EQ isn't going to die anytime soon. Once the system requirements for WoW, and eventually Vanguard, are released the huge majority of casual players who can't keep a system updated with bleeding edge technology are going to say &quot;Screw it...EQ runs on my comp. I can't afford to upgrade.&quot; and happily stay where they are. <br />

<br />
Not everyone believes in EQ's fucking &quot;It has to look good in 10 years, so fuck everyone's system now&quot; philosophy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I have every intention of finding out for myself if this is true. I know that's what Blizzard's intended goal is. But given the choice of upgrading 3 computers (one for each player in my household) and staying with what already works I know which one I'm going to choose if Blizzard can't deliver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Epics V2.0 <br />
<br />
There are dozens of them already in the game. Just because they aren't classified as &quot;epic&quot; and take a long ass quest to complete doesn't mean that they don't exist. Hell, you can single group a duel wield/2 hand combo better than the warrior epic for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Well, yeah. They started development in 2001 and haven't had two graphics updates since then, I HOPE it'd run better on lower systems. Either that or I hope they'd have fired the programmers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason this is true is because blizzard actually has programmers who know wtf they are doing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where's the prediction relevant to the EQ graphics engine update (still assuming it comes out this year)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looked pretty decent on test. Like I could run new models + medium texture on my old tnt2. The graphics engine that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New graphics engine on test runs...smoother...not necessarily faster, just smoother. There seems to be less of a slide-show for the same actions as there are on live right now. Also, the graphics don't look any better, so I think the pic that showed up on PC Gamer some months back (claiming it was new graphics for the new engine) is for something that may come to pass in the more distant future.<br />
<br />
There is no sky on Test right now (or at least, many peeps, myself included, are not seeing sky...just that plain gray background), and I'm not sure if that will affect the smoothness when it gets put back in, though I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First I'll weigh in on your predictions:<br />
<br />
&quot;1. Epics V2.0 -&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe. That's actually not a bad prediction. The fabled stuff is going over pretty well. People are at least talking about the zerker epic. It wouldn't be a stretch for them to finally give in to the players who want this. They've made worse decisions.<br />
<br />
&quot;2. Expansion #1&quot; and &quot;3. Expansion #2 &quot;<br />
<br />
If they up the level cap, it'll be in the very next expansion, not two expansions down the road. Outside pressures from competitors will be a huge catalyst in them wanting to rev the treadmill up again. Unfortunately, the game &quot;design&quot; for the past few expansions has been more and more like a first person shooter than an RPG. You know, beat Bad Guy A to get to Level 2, so you can start working on Bad Guy B to get Key to Level 3. That's a big time departure from Everquest's original &quot;vision&quot; and so, I don't know how your predictions are going to hold up.<br />
<br />
&quot;4. Two more old world zones revamped. &quot;<br />
<br />
I agree with Mistmoore. I disagree with Kedge. Here's why: The pathing and the aggro in Kedge would really work against them as they revamped it. As you've seen in all their other &quot;revamp&quot; work ... they can change the polygons but they can't change the framework of the zones. And Kedge would be a tweaking nightmare.<br />
<br />
&quot;5. GM events and upgraded customer service &quot;<br />
<br />
The cynic in me is screaming to agree with you on this point. However, as we've seen with their bold new steps in the area of CS lately, it's more than likely that their customer service is going to continue to go into the crapper. Look for CS to steadily become invisible in the world of EQ. In fact as EQ2 launches, EQ is going to become more and more and more automated with its CS. That's the direction they're going in.<br />
<br />
&quot;6. Progression in GoD will remain broken for three more months&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh. That's not really a prediction. That's more stating the obvious.<br />
<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
&quot;7. EQ2 will be an overgrown bunker-buster bomb. EQ itself will suffer serious and permanent subscriber losses as its players escape to WoW and Vanguard. EQ will finish the year with about 75% of the playerbase it started with.&quot;<br />
<br />
I quoted all of this one, because it's the one I agree with the most. Which is odd, because for the most part, I've been in the &quot;EQ hasn't been killed yet&quot; camp.<br />
<br />
But this time things are very very different. The game, for me, has peaked. It's beyond boring now. And I myself am looking at other games to fill my time. Not even MMORPGs. Just other fun video games.<br />
<br />
And as I mentioned above, the actual style of the game has shifted so much recently from &quot;the vision&quot; to the &quot;beat monster A to get key B to go to place C&quot; style of game. And that style of game isn't what I wanted to play when I started with Everquest.<br />
<br />
Which gets to Vanguard. The VISION. If anyone can beat EQ at what EQ does ... it's the guys who created it in the first place.<br />
<br />
So don't count them out. Especially with MS in their corner. That should really help them with keeping that game working on odd system requirements and the like.<br />
<br />
And Worlds of Warcraft, also, has a strong group of people who could give EQ a run for its money. And graphics are the last worry I'd have with that game.<br />
<br />
In short, I don't know if they'll KILL EQ as others are thinking, but I certainly agree with your prediction that they'll cut into the EQ market like you say.<br />
<br />
What do I think will kill EQ? EQ itself. The devs are out of ideas. They stats are beyond pointless. New gear is gaudy beyond belief. The carrot just isn't fun to chase anymore for a lot of people (me included). That's dangerous for a game that hinges on the carrot chase like EQ does.<br />
The competitors won't have much to do with killing or keeping EQ afloat. It's all SOE themselves. They need to rethink the directions they've gone with EQ. Remember why people liked this game in the first place (or at the very least ASK the people who have left the company to join other companies, why the customers like the game so much back then, before the new employees got there).<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Sorry to ramble. I liked your post. And your predictions.<br />
<br />
Now for my predictions:<br />
<br />
1- I'm going to play City of Heroes for at least a month, hardcore.<br />
<br />
2- I'm going to find myself jonesing for NFL football on Sundays really soon.<br />
<br />
3- I'm going to try and play EQ again, and fail miserably. Gates of Discord just turns me off that much.<br />
<br />
4- The Phillies are going to make the baseball playoffs this year! I'm going to be super duper happy.<br />
<br />
5- Arsenal is going to finish at the top of the table the premiership. (Bold prediciton indeed! hahahahahahah)<br />
<br />
6- I'm going to play Worlds of Warcraft, and it's going to be a great game, but I'm going to get bored with it really fast and not play it more than a month or two.<br />
<br />
Lately I've been finding myself missing NASCAR Online racing. It's been a weird week.</div></div><hr />
