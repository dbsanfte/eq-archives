<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all!<br />
In an effort to help my guild and perhaps many others, I am hoping to compile a list of weapons that have any knock back effects to them. In some raids it is important to maintain mob Placement, and these knockback weapon effects prohibit this. Anyways, here are 2 weapons that I know have the knockback effect on them, if you know of more please add them here.<br />
Thanks!<br />

After looking up all the stun proc weapons I can think of, I'm reasonably confident that nearly ALL stun proc weapons have push back of some sort... BBotE has a pushback of .5, as do some others.  I think stun component in itself has a pushback component to it.  Because of this, the only non stun proc weapon I can think of that has pushback is GSoS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cornering the mobs is the best way to avoid them moving, in the case of G/E, they are cornerable so knockback weapons should be a moot point.  If the mob is not cornerable however, the best way to deal with the mob moving is to put push on both sides the mob, with the dps behind it and the knights infront and to the sides to counter any push.  As far as knockback weapons, I don't know too many, just thought I'd add my thoughts.  Feel free to shoot me a tell in game if you wish Naralli.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My GBoS sure does push even when mob is immune to the stun...so that isn't true.<br />
<br />
Basic stun immunity is also 56 and higher mobs (unless you're talking giant flagged mobs which are immune anyway).<br />
<br />
Ykesha proc weapons have a push back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gelding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think from ~1day of using GBoS i can tell that it does push mobs slightly in BoT, (regular non-named giants), but doesn't seem to always do it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Geneya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A weapon with a knockback proc of 1 is hardly noticable, and certainly will not overly effect mob positioning. It is only for added aggro and spell interrupt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">every guild gets lazy, at least mine anyways, and doesnt position mobs right, ppl try their best to push mobs as far away from healers instead of vice versa. <br />
<br />
really if its that big of deal, you should tell your raid the mob has to stay &quot;here&quot; and they need to make it happen. i would say close to 95% of the mobs you kill can be cornered though, if you work at it. afk and come back when its dead.<br />
<br />
other than pets(really have uber push - esp bst pets), the bgt, stronghorns horn, and norgtal, there really isnt any weapon i know of that has a knockback you should worry about. all those stun procs have minimal push, something you can easily compensate for if ppl pay attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing tho on this:<br />
If you have 5 people all using a Knockback 1 weapon you will see significant knockback if 2 of them happen to proc together.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If,While you are tanking a mob,that is being engaged by melee and your 1 foot knock back is somehow seriously compromising the postion of the mob....<br />
<br />
You need to not blame your weapon,and look to how your guild postions things...<br />
<br />
Every aggro combo I have used in the last year has had a KB in iether hand or both and positiong whther in corners or out in the open has never been a problem,A guild taht can balance well will have little toruble with KB's....<br />
<br />
Now if you are tanking and you have 7 melee standing beside you using KB and no one behind the mob to counter it then yeah your going to have issues,but removing the weapons will nto instantly stop the mob from moving,You iwll always have push on a mob beming engaged by a dozen people...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The real problem with cornering these mobs in Ssra is the curved wall tops, mobs have a tendency to pop up to that little roof like area and summon just the MT up there.  Also, walling mobs can suck a bit when you have 4 AM3 rangers on hand.  We're really not having much of a problem with the big ones (exiled, glyphed, etc.etc.) however, it's the yardtrash on the first pull that's concerning.  When I'm behind the mob trying to help maintain the mobs position and in an instant it gets blasted back behind me I'm sure it's not just normal push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Norge`Tal has a 6 ft. knockback. Very nice for interrupting casters and keeping your rogues on their toes. Very bad for raid positioning.<br />
<br />
PoP mobs and many non-pop bosses are immune to the stun but the knockback still takes affect and you still get lots of aggro from it. If it were a slightly better ratio and not quite as slow I'd still use mine. Grats bank for nasty CRs.</div></div><hr />
