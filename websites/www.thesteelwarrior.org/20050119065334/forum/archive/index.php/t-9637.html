<br />
I was playing around with my java files to try and work out a streaming music channles format so I could load it up in winamp instead... and I did not back up my files.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I need a fresh install of java but its built into IE service pack 2 I think, not to sure so I am looking for a safe way to get rid of it and put a fresh cup of coffee out.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

&lt;Alanna&gt; Saying that Java is nice because it works on all OS's is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders<br />

    Uhmm... yah anyway you can install the java vm from the sun site, but it will have to load up the first time you view a java.  But while you're at it you might as well install firefox.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to tell internet explorer to use virtual machine.  I'll check it out when I get home from work.</div></div><hr />

I know just removing it would probibly kill my IE, while I love foxfire I can not use it for every website.</div></div><hr />

Erh ... but it was Sun who developed Java.  :confused:</div></div><hr />

I work on Sun Sparc machines at work that have some of the originals.  But now that it is seperate from IE it doesn't seem to run as smoothly.  The old MS version that ran inside IE never gave me any problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to Sun's site under download products (search for Virtual Machine).  In order to install the new VM you will need to follow their directions regarding registry edits you will need to make in Windows OS.  It will not damage your instance of IE if you edit correctly (suggest registry backup before though heh).  Its also a smart security thing to do as without SP2 there is an exploit in the old VM that will enable the :blank spyware to install.<br />
<br />
What files were you modifying specifically?</div></div><hr />

Was trying to add a new rightclick menu that would include the stream data links.<br />
<br />
Got it fixed a few hours ago tho.</div></div><hr />
