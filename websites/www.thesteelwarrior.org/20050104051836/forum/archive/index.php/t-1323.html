<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, all the weapons I own are on my evil eye backpack but, to make it simpler.  I own a Barnacle Covered Axe, Jade Mace, Guard Captain’s Mallet, Centi Longsword.  I usually for most agro situations wield Jade Mace/Mallet.  If I really really need the proc then I’ll wield BCA/Mallet.  For DPS I used to wield Jade Mace/Mallet until yesterday I asked in serverwide.thesteelwarrior and was told that Mallet/Centi would be better.<br />
<br />
So, what is my point on posting.  I need to know if this is correct?  And also suggestions on semi-final upgrade.<br />
<br />
Jade/Mallet = Agro?<br />
BCA/Mallet = Agro?<br />
Mallet/Centi = DPS?<br />
<br />
Now, I am a member of a pretty much friend only guild.  So, we are definitetly not ubber.  Cash, up to values of 100k are usually not a problem.  So for a semi final upgrade.  What at 65 should I aim to be wielding for agro?  What about for DPS?  Is there a weapon that can do them both?  I am looking to either buy this setup or hunt for it if its possible.  Our guild believe it or not consists mostly of only 6 dudes.  Yes all of us have 2 accounts so 12 on guild for guild checks.  Make up of guild is 60 cleric / 60 enchanter / 55 BST / 55 necro / 55 Paladin / and me.  Sometimes we can also get a 60 rogue / 60 mage / 65 mage / 55 druid.<br />
<br />
For history purposes I was told that ultimately I should shoot for a GsoT or wavecrasher/frosty combo.  Is this correct?  At 65 in as small a guild/group as I can make that’s best I can have?</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't be all that expensive either.<br />
<br />
I was never a big wavecrasher fan.</div></div><hr />

Not to sound like a broken record, but if this is true, then chuck all those weapons and get the Greatstaff of Thunder. <br />
<br />
It has strong DPS and strong AGRO.<br />
<br />
You should definitely be able to get one for less than 100k. You can wield that thing for the rest of your EQ career unless you find a way to kill AoW, Xanamech or Cursed with your small little guild :)<br />
<br />
or if you find enough cash for a SoD and BoC...But I bet you will still be fine with the GSOT.<br />
<br />

edit - btw, the first thing I would do if Cash is really not an issue is take the remainder of the 100k when the GSOT is purchased and fill out the rest of your slots with Fierce Heraldic :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very good.  Will solely save for GSoT which is not that expensive.  I am filling out the rest with FH before I press with weapons of course.  Playing 500 or even 400k for a BoC is out of the question.  Now, having a couple of other friends help out with Xanamech might actually fly.  But will not worry about such things until I hold the CHSD on my hand and go.. shit.. what now! hehe  Anyways...  Thanks for the suggestions friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
guy in the other thread said it drops off minor named in the south wing, allakazam says it drops off the wing boss in the south wing too, maybe drops off both them. either way, both are one group killable and bot xp is the best you will find in teir 3 anyways while u wait for them.<br />

 Gaukr  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10622)<br />
<br />
Gaukr spawns in the very back of the south wing(earth part), no clue where Rorek spawns, the post just says earth side at UE camp, whatever that is heh.</div></div><hr />
