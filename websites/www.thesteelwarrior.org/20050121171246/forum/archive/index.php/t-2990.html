<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been reading up on this new technology, and it sounds very promising. It uses the 110V power outlets already in your home to create a network. Right now, it can get around 14 mbps, 3 mbps faster than 802.11b WiFi. Still alot slower than wired, but with no added hassle of wiring. This seems like a great option for those of us who are struggling with the range of our wireless networks and do not want to tear the walls apart having wires run through.<br />
<br />
These are some good reads:<br />

My question is to anyone who has or knows anything about these networks. <br />
I currently have a very unreliable Wireless Network (my computer is the farthest from the router, I constantly lose my connection and DHCP-assigned IP address.) As is, whenever I can get online long enough to patch and stay in EQ, the lag-meter is having a field day, bouncing around the yellow/green 40% mark. We tried a directional antenna, which didn't help; we thought about a bridge, but there is no logical place to put one. The unreliability of my connection is really starting to piss me off, and since we really don't want to pay to have the house wired, this seems like the best option.<br />
<br />
The Netgear E602 seems to be the most widely recommended product and line conditioners seem like a good investment as well.<br />
<br />
The only problem I see with this is the reports I have read of massive bandwith loss when using 3 or more computers on the network. This really worries me because there would be at least 3 computers on this network.<br />
<br />
If you know anything or have some good links, please share :)</div></div><hr />

My guess is that you would see a lot of packet loss with it.  Power wires typically cause a lot of interference with data lines (I have had to travel to sites to fix industrial equipment when the only problem was that someone replaced a data line and ran it in a trough alongside a power cable).<br />
<br />
With that said, it is possible that since in this case the power line is carrying the data signal and it isn't just an external influence, that there is no/negligable distortion, or they have a decent solution for cancelling it out.<br />
<br />
Best case is find a place that has a good return policy and try it out.  If it stinks, you should be able to see it immediately.</div></div><hr />

The synchronization is quite hard to do and require some expensive gear, which is why you would probably not see it as a homeLAN anytime soon.<br />
Sweden tried to use it as an ISP solution and are still trying doing research in the area to improve the technology to a reliable and up-to-date working state.</div></div><hr />
