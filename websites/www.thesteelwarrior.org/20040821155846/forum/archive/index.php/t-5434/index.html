<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Izudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Comparison of Warrior/Mage pet tanking (http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=11182)<br />
<br />
As you may know, mages have asked for improved pet mitigation for a while now. The main reason for this is that in the high end, our pets lose their ability to reasonably tank mobs on their own (in all previous expansions mages could use a pet to offtank an add for example, while burning down the main mob). PoP tier2+ mobs destroy even the highest lvl mage pets in few seconds.<br />
<br />
To get some info to back up our wish, Ylaine took the work to log and parse some, and presented the results on the MageTower. I dont know if this will be of use to the warriors, but it sure is interesting to read and see the comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting.  I assume your personal aggrevation is that Mage pets are not great offtankers and are only situationally main tanks?<br />
<br />
Mage charmed pets certainly are so that can't be it.  Still, I find it odd that a Mage summoned pet is really not that bad of a tank compared to any non-plate class and you are still upset about that.  Sure, the hate-list restriction is annoying, it causes groups to form with no melee at all regularily.  Still, I am not sure what makes you annoyed.  Your thought that &quot;PoP tier2+ mobs destroy even the highest lvl mage pets in few seconds&quot; really is not true and I am not sure why you would point that out either.  I tend to drop in a slighly longer period of time than a mage pet against an unslowed t1-3 mob but not that muck longer I assure you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Comparing a summoned pet tanking abilities to those of a time-equipped and AAd warrior is not a fair comparison. A time-equipped warrior has dedicated a lot of game time to improve their tanking abilities, and the time-equipped warrior is undoubtedly the best damage-taker in the game.<br />
<br />
If you want to be fair about pet tanking, compare that pet to a warrior who has the title of &quot;Baron&quot; and the equipment equivalent to Ornate or NToV. This will give you a more accurate idea of tanking ability.<br />
<br />
Expecting your pet to even be in the same league as a time-equipped warrior (who has probably over 10K hits unbuffed and who knows how much % in shielding) is about as ridiculous as expecting a warrior to become a pet summoning class. That your pet even stacked up at all against the warrior just shows how strong pet tanking is, and just how close melee tanks (at least at tier 1-3) are to becoming obsolete.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you realize that an all pet caster group really plays a different game than the rest of us peons who actually have to hit the mob. How many AA and hour can you make in the HoH GY?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While I'll agree that summoned mage pets suck compared to charmed pets (mage or enchie), I don't think this analysis is valid.  If you are comparing to a time equiped warrior you should use an equivalent mage - and that mage will most likely be using a charmed pet whenever possible.  If you want to compare apples to apples use a warrior without little or no defensive aa's, 1250 ac and 5k hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">haha<br />
so you want pet that tanks just a bit worse then time geared warrior with full AAs<br />
<br />
Summon me already I say so I can skip spending hundreds of hours raiding/improving my character and then be just a little bit better then summoned pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hate to say it, but everyone here has a valid point that comparing a pet against a time geared warrior skews the results way to far.  Mage pet's have problems(and charm pets are rare, not too many zones with mobs that mages can charm), they do not scale well at higher levels, but the comparison to a time geared warrior makes it look like you are forcing the test to show what you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Izudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe this is not MY test, I just thought it might be interesting. I didnt want to make it sound like I'm whining about mage pets on a warrior board :)<br />
<br />
The point of the test is not really to compare a  time-equipped warrior to a pet, but rather to the mage...that pet is near the best a mage (in time gear) can summon (only LDoN raid focus makes the pet better). The real problem with pets is that they do not scale in power with the mage (to give another example, a mage recently posted a log where he tanked a Droga mob without a pet up and won...yes, high end mages tank better than their pets :)<br />
<br />
Obviously our pets are not bad when you compare them to bazaar equipped and none or few AA's only tanks, and I am generally pleased with their performance. In GoD there will be some new AA's that will make pets better (pet ND, CA and shared buffs). There still is room for improvements tho :)<br />
<br />
Again, this is just some info that I thought would be interesting. Dont read much more in it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shmashed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol, seeing this makes me sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pet: 196.84<br />
Warrior: 101.72<br />
<br />
Edit, I guess these numbers are how much DPS the MOB did against the pet / warrior. So NM, I'm a dork.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Really the problem is that mages want MORE and are not happy unless they get MORE which is the same of every class in eq.  However they use any means possible to make it seem as if they are not a good class (as this applies to any class trying to make a point.  It is very easy to set up tests in your favor to make a point).  Whatever vision was used for mages in the kunark era disappeared when the new managment took over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, the pet is no longer the entire magician package. It may have started out like that, but now a mage is a very significant nuker with the added bonus of a pet. I don't really understand what mages are looking for... They have a pet that does very decent damage, and can take some hits when buffed. It doesn't tank like a PC tank, which is good.<br />
<br />
  Mages scale like everyone else. They get more equipment that makes them nuke better, faster and more often through focus effects and FT. This test only looks at a portion of a mage, not the fact that they can heal their pet and nuke the mobs. How could their pets' strength be increased without making them overpowered? Would mages trade their nukes for a pet that tanks better?</div></div><hr />

Well, imagine your armor was set fix at a certain level. For example, say you get ornate at lvl 61 and have to stay with that for the rest of your career then. Great for older expansions, good for lower tier PoP zones...but would you like to go to PoTime with that setting? This is the situation mages are in.<br />
<br />
Yes, pets are only part of the package. But they always were a very significant part of the whole, and in PoP their usefulness decreases drastically, mainly due to defensive weakness (of course we realize that PC tanks share similar problems with mob power, but they CAN adapt somewhat with better equipment). New AA's will only help this innate problem to a degree.<br />
<br />
Mages never said that we suck as a class (except for a few who want the world). We are pointing at a weakness in our class, which is justified I think. Its up to the devs anyway to decide if they agree.<br />
<br />
Again, please accept that I do not want to call for support here on the board, just wanted to present a view on something different :)</div></div><hr />

I don't think mages even had a charm before level 65 and now you're complaining lack of ability to charm hurts your class?  Be glad you can charm anything at all because for a long time you didn't.</div></div><hr />

  That's an improper comparison... Warriors ARE their gear, little more. <br />
<br />
  You are not playing your pet, you're playing a caster that summons a pet. If you're looking at your pet in isolation, you are creating a false idea of its lack of power, especially compared to a very top end warrior. <br />
<br />
  Show me parses of a warrior of an appropriate level, compared to an earth pet. In fact, if you can find someone to run the tests, compare your pet tanking to other classes as well. I seriously doubt your pet, even a time focused pet, was meant to tank like a plate class.<br />
<br />
 However, if they were to change earth pets so that they could tank better, I'd hope they'd decrease the damage considerably. I always was disappointed that there was such a small difference in the elemental pet types. I really wouldn't mind seeing them a bit more extreme as long as it didn't increase their overall power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What you're saying is that your pet only tanks as well as the AVERAGE lvl 65 warrior.  Cry me a fucking river.  Tell you what, why don't we just make all the pets equal to a time geared warrior and then just remove all the pure melee's and hybrids from the game and leave nothing but pet classes?  'Cause if you're pets get beefed up any more, that's what we might as well do.  The number of encounters in PoP that have been defeated by pets while the melees and hybrids sat back and (with the exception of rangers) did piss poor DPS and watched the casters kill stuff is sickening.  By all means lets make the pets better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For that example, warriors are two parts: defense and offense. Even if you had armor that you could not upgrade really, you would still have your weapons and offense which can be improved. That was what I wanted to express, because it describes a mages situation pretty well.<br />
<br />
Of course pets are not meant to tank like plate tanks. I am not sure exactly HOW well they should tank...if you look at the data from that logs, it seems that the pet tanks about 50% as good as the warrior (takes about twice the damage). Note that this is against a tier 2 mob, which is not really hard compared to higher tier mobs. Perhaps that is as the devs want it...I only know that pets used to tank a lot better (closer to PC tanks). Perhaps its just a wish for the good old times :)<br />
<br />
Ohh, and btw. that idea with different pets (earth pet = true tank with low damage output) is a great idea. Would love that personally.</div></div><hr />

You don't get it, honestly the dress wearers are dedicated to screwing tanks out of groups. They want to buy their stupid pet and have it out-tank the very best warrior out there. Let me fill you in on some history:<br />

Of course Abashi was removed as player rep, he was HATED. Of course the Necromancer did nothing but sit on his butt and watch the pet. Everquest has never had many bright &quot;Programmers&quot;, don't give them credit, it isn't due to them. THERE IS NOTHING NEW ABOUT THIS.</div></div><hr />

I tried charm once, I died shortly after charming, died again shrotly after restrying, died again shortly thereafter...and I have since to even mem CotAM.  In truth i consider it kinda a nonfactor...it's nice, but I don't plan on using it much, or foresee it being a big part of mage arsenal.<br />

The game was designed to screw warriors, make it more profitable to solo, then don't allow  warriors to solo. Oh, I forgot, [sarcasm on] 6 month ago they gave groups an exp bonus (out of 55months the game has been out). Nothing parnoid about it, people are greedy, they act it out in EQx100, and the Programmers are morons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">personally i find it sad that a 65 necro pet, or a 65 BL pet can kill a warrior without any help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd wager it's easier to get charm going relatively safely for a mage than it is for your random pickup group to understand not to do things that'd get themselves killed.  <br />
<br />
Also with the pet issue you conveniently overlooked that a pet automatically gets Enrage.  This is adds a significant time to how long they can tank, assuming no heals, and they never mess up using it unless one hit drops them from above enrage to death.<br />
<br />
Also when the pet dies you summon a new one.  When a Warrior dies we lose XP and it takes a few minute before we're up to our normal capacity.  It's actually worse for Knights since they have to wait for mana (it's hard for me to imagine a Knight will be at full capacity without mana, even as broken as they are).<br />
<br />
I've seen pets offtank slowed mobs pretty well.  If you want to tanked unslowed stuff, most low to average tanks can't exactly last long on those either.</div></div><hr />

Some low return, though eventually effective AAs for improving pet defense would not bother me, provided they in fact lesser in effect. Considering that we need to spend 86 AAs for 17% mitigation, avoidance and HP, I could live with mages having to pump 170ish AAs into pets for the same effect.</div></div><hr />

He was inferring Crafted was not being worn by warriors, well 100 Hate raids later, most warriors had exactly that, Crafted. How much fuggin effort do you put into getting your pet? 100 8hr raids?

<br />
Mages with the right gear and knowledge can do wonderfull things with charm.  My mage is an alt, and will most likely not see that gear any time soon(I have an aversion to bidding on items for an alt when a main is bidding on it).  I don't know of any mage that complains that we get charm, but many of us don't really use it.  It is still a tool available to us tho, and cannot be overlooked.<br />
<br />
I've seen pets offtank slowed mobs pretty well. If you want to tanked unslowed stuff, most low to average tanks can't exactly last long on those either. <br />
<br />
Against slowed mobs, with the right pet up, pet's do pretty well.  The biggest problem that mages have as far as pets goes is that they do not scale well(nor can they really).  For 60ish levels, mages exp one way, then at the end, we all of a sudden have to change completely.  Gone is most of a mages ability to solo, and we become very much group dependent(with the downside that we tend to be less desired in groups than many other DPS classes).  It is not an insurmountable problem, but a frustrating one.<br />

I in fact think that is part of how I think Soe is going, plus mages get a 20 point aa coming with GoD(tentaively of course) that will allow buffs that land on us to also land on our pet.<br />

Mages have Protection of Calliav. Although the effects are not understood by Lucy it's assumed to be a mitigation buff similar to Vie for pets. <br />
<br />
My mage does not have this spell, but from what I have heard on it, is that it absobs three(?) hits on a pet.  Mostly usefull in AE type encounters, by keeping PoC on pet, it can survive the AE's.  I think that is what it does.<br />

<br />
It is natural to want to be able to solo from level 1 to 65 when you play a class that is(was) considered one of the best solo classes.  Admitedly, that is not the case, nor will it likely be the case, and mages do have to adapt.  As far as greedily hogging plat and exp spawns...huh?  Any person or group who camps or farms an area is hogging plat and exp spawns.  It is not greedy, it is how the game is played.  Thank you tho for your support in wanting us to be able to group.  I personally almost strictly group my mage, and hope to be able to continue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Mages are useful in groups already.  Add in pet damage it's almost certain that a mage will eventually outdamage a wizard.  Healers always want mod rods and you also have the best damage shield in the game (excluding bards since their DS depends on too many things).  You can even mez on LDoN Normal Tak missions.<br />
<br />
Mages bring plenty to a group.  It's not Sony's problem that most groups do not recognize what a Mage bring.  Actually that sounds a lot like why people don't feel comfortable with Warriors.  I see Necros get passed up in groups a lot too and they're probably the most damaging int-based caster (excluding charm).  You can't expect to get more powerful just because the average group is too ignorant to pick you up, especially since mages, as a class, are already pretty powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=2447  Groups because you soloed don't want you, with good reason.

Of course hardly anyone knew him, thus having problems getting groups.<br />
<br />

<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=2201<br />
Class Balance, it is SUPPOSED to be balanced between soloability and groupability. Druids and Wizards lose a lot of their ability to solo also because mobs summon. The high end game requires you to develop new skills soloing and grouping. Maybe as article #2447 says, you should have developed some ingame friendships to assist getting groups. The ability dimishes greatly to solo past level 60, no Class was promised level 60+ level to easily solo.</div></div><hr />

Accurately describes what you think is &quot;normal&quot; and not greedy behavior. Maybe thats how you play the game. It is called &quot;bottom feeding&quot;, leave those greens, low blues, and light blues for groups that should be killing them. Camping was never designed to be in the game, thats how players decided to play. I hate camping, thats why I only play LDoN, along with many others who had quit EQ and come back.</div></div><hr />

Don't make level 60ish+ level then, its that easy! If players don't like the way their class plays above a certain level, don't obtain the level. There is a whole bunch of people out there that are to stupid to figure out what that means. The game changes at level 63+, DON'T LEVEL THERE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT! It changes for EVERY class, not just Mages. I Deleveled to be with my Cleric friends, I was level 62, to high to LDoN with a 51 and 54 Cleric. I deleveled via Necromancer (for essense emeralds) making some nice plat in the process. I don't have a BoC or SoD, so I can't compete aggro wise level 63+, but I am not that level! Level 57-62 Warriors don't have that equipment either. I don't need a BoC at my level, and I won't level much until I have the equipment. I also HATE PoP, only one account has it. I am NOT buying GoD, Sony wants to cater to the high end guild people (1%), let them buy the expansion! There is NO reason to obtain a level that makes you unhappy with your char class, or forces you to exp in zones you hate.</div></div><hr />

I see Necros get passed up in groups a lot too and they're probably the most damaging int-based caster (excluding charm).  <br />
<br />
I agree for the most part with this.  I know that when I can get a group with my mage, I can contribute alot.  It is just frustrating because we don't get the chance often enough.<br />
<br />
Groups because you soloed don't want you, with good reason. I made a bet with someone, he claimed he didn't solo much, I claimed he did. We tracked it for a month, he soloed 70% of the time! Of course hardly anyone knew him, thus having problems getting groups. <br />
<br />
So, some one who has a hard time getting groups is forced to solo....thank you for sharing.<br />
<br />
This player describes why soloing is important, Warriors have been repeatidly denied the ability to solo. <br />
<br />
As are rogues, monks, clerics, pallies and SK's(note that some can solo a small bit, but not effectivly).  Some classes can, some cannot.  As you pointed out earlier, 'no class was guaranteed to solo forever'.<br />
<br />
Class Balance, it is SUPPOSED to be balanced between soloability and groupability. Druids and Wizards lose a lot of their ability to solo also because mobs summon. The high end game requires you to develop new skills soloing and grouping. Maybe as article #2447 says, you should have developed some ingame friendships to assist getting groups. The ability dimishes greatly to solo past level 60, no Class was promised level 60+ level to easily solo <br />
<br />
That being the case, more group desired classes should be less able to solo.  Lets check.  Enchanters are loved by groups...but can solo extremely well.  Shaman also fill the slow nitch...and can solo.  Wizzies are extremely group friends, very high DPS...and can quad without issue right up to 65 max aa's.  Druids bring alot to groups, both as a healer and a damage doer and as a buffer...and can solo AA's in no time.  Need I go on?<br />
<br />
Accurately describes what you think is &quot;normal&quot; and not greedy behavior. Maybe thats how you play the game. It is called &quot;bottom feeding&quot;, leave those greens, low blues, and light blues for groups that should be killing them. Camping was never designed to be in the game, thats how players decided to play. I hate camping, thats why I only play LDoN, along with many others who had quit EQ and come back. <br />
<br />
Any time a player or group of players camps an area(as they do any time they are hunting outside LDoN, they are hoarding and monopolizing the exp and drops from that camp.  That is natural and fine.  Soloers are not some devil because they can do this by themselves(overpowered maybe if they can keep a spawn clear, but that is a seperate issue).  I have no idea what linking an article from 4 years ago about people farming greens has to do with anything.<br />
<br />
Don't make level 60ish+ level then, its that easy! <br />
<br />
Oh wow, so to enjoy a class, all I have to do is stop advancing in that class...brilliant.<br />
<br />
I don't have a BoC or SoD, so I can't compete aggro wise level 63+,  <br />
<br />
You do not need a BoC or SoD to compete agro wise at 63.  You can easily farm CHoS and SotB or buy them cheaply in the bazaar and compete quite well.  GSoT will do you wonders as well, and people are all but giving them away.  I suggest stop reading all those aged castersrealm articles(castersrealm is the devil), research your class a little bit, and learn how it works.</div></div><hr />

I agree for the most part with this.  I know that when I can get a group with my mage, I can contribute alot.  It is just frustrating because we don't get the chance often enough.  <br />
<br />
I think any class that solo's well suffers from the same 2 problems when they try to get in groups. <br />
<br />
First, since people haven't grouped with them before they don't know what they can do or how to work with them...so they go with classes they know.<br />
<br />
Second, solo and group tactics are vastly different and soloers often don't realize this the first few times they get in groups.  Consequently, they give their class a bad reputation.  I think druids are probably the best example of this issue.  Good druid soloing tactics will cause groups to fail...and it takes awhile before an individual druid can learn to change their tactics.  (I'm speaking from experience here...my first character was a druid, as were the characters of 2 close friends that play...we all had the same problems grouping initially.  ;) )<br />
<br />
However, from an individual perspective, the &quot;bad rep&quot; for the class issue solves itself fairly quickly as you get in a few groups and show that you are a worthy addition.  (or if you are not :D )<br />
<br />
By the way, I found the original post on the mage board to be extremely dissappointing and much to narrow in focus to draw any valid broad ranging conclusion about the mage class.  It may be useful as one component or a much larger evaluation...but by itself it's garbage.  I put it equivalent to warriors that only look at initial agro tools when evaluating melee class balancing.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Silverblade-T-E</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Me = lvl 65 mage here who gave up playing his dorf warrior years ago cause EQ &quot;fighter&quot; class is boring as hell, or was, don't know about now with the changes. (wishes EQ wa smore like D&amp;D and thus warriros woudl be a damn sight more FUn to play..anyway...)<br />
<br />
1) Mages have ALWAYS been solo capable, it even says so in their description...until PoP.<br />
<br />
2) Mages relied on their pets to tank. As anyone knows, especially pure melees, since PoP, mobs crazy damage output put the total bite in any hope of melee soloing. Sicn emages relied ont heir pets to tank, mages were shafted. Mages cannot snare, root, mezz, slow, stun, heal, rune, FD etc. Mage soloing techniques comprise of: pet tanking, aggro kiting (p*ss the mob off and run aroudn as pet smacks it), chain casting pets (mage pets mana cost is cheap but 10 second cast time). Those three methods got blasted because pets last about 20 to 5 seconds (including enrage, which isn't always sure fire) depending on the zone. Aggro kiting doesnt work well sicn emobs will rengage the pet sooner or later and kill it since mage nukes are slow casting (except the 450 hp Scars of Sigil, which doesnt do squat for aggro)...oh if you have Spell Casting Subtelty AA to help survive nuke aggro, this makes aggro kiting harder sicne you cause LESS aggro.<br />
<br />
3) Mages are the ONLY casters with no defence form *at all* bar their pets. Mages get Gate, SHielding (same as all int casters give aorund 350 hp, some AC,  and MR), Phantom armour line (gives some AC, mana and 5hp/tick regen). Please go try playing that style compared to other casters, k? You cannot cool aggro off with FD, Boggle or COncussion, so if you over aggro or MT dies, you die. If oyu say &quot;Well don't nuke so hard&quot;...ah ok, drop dead MT and all othe rmelees cause if the nukers aint nuking, DPs isnt high enough and...you die. <br />
--Spellcasting Subtelty helps reduce aggro but its not THAT much, nice, I can actually use PoP nukes if I'm careful without getting plastered on raid trash mobs :/<br />
--I've heard melee moaning lately about how casters get &quot;too many hit points now&quot;..WTH are they smoking? You try soaking up 2k AEs and mobs that FULL ROUND YOU'RE bathrobe-covered no-defences butt for 800 a pop ;) A mage in full Time gear is about 5k hp unbuffed, same class of warrior is about 11k? So in PoV, as earlier perosn was talking about, yes the mage can take the damage for bit, but guess what? Having diddly squat for defences (Skills or spells) he's going to take a HUGE load more DPs than a tank will; he may have the initial hit points, but he can neither heal them, rune himself, ditch the aggro, or nullify the mob.<br />
<br />
4)  The best Calliav spell is, iirc 500 mana, lasts 30 minutes, long recast time (30 seconds+?), blocks 3 melee, DD or DD-AE spells (not DoTs). Mage pet heals are slooooow cast, very long recast, best one heals 1200hp. Nice on Pre-POP xp mobs, but no use except to heal pet after a fight elsewhere...mayeb pathcing on LDON easy. I can post links to Lucy if you wish :) Suffice it to say a mage cannot keep a pet healed against a seriosu mob anymore: if you have an Improved Heal4 item, mount, FT15 and lot of AAs, you can heal/tank a pet versus Tier 1 mobs and possibly Tier2 (you need quick buff AA for latter). THat will drain your mana brutally.<br />
<br />
5) Since aggro is a total PIA, I often use the Epic pet, yes from Kunark era, because it aggros like a SOB, even if it's too low lvl to land its procs and its melee is reduced, at least HE will get summoned before ME, usually....How'd you like to use a Veeshans' Peak sword nowadays, huh? Epic pet by way is awesome on Pre-PoP  and Easy LDON stuff for damage. PoP pets do better against high cons but can't aggro enough. High lvl fire pets are..well...AI NPC wizards...ick. <br />
<br />
6) Pets were MEANT to be the tank for a magician, their effectiveness as tanks could be equated to a poor geared warrior or a so-so geared ranger. They are also *dumb* and pet aggro code as you know stops them tanking. This worked perfectly well until PoP and after because mobs DPs and nuke sensitivity went nuts. After 4 years of play it was a kick in the nuts, SOE *had* to bring in the Calliav spells because group spells don't hit pets, and as you know on raids, group heals and cures are vital. So pets were getting whacked out constantly. Hello gimpness. Ergo they had to bring in Calliav spells, which still don't block DoTs...note mobs who use AE DoTs....*face screws up like kermits* :(<br />
<br />
7) Mage class summoned items are craptastic now. Mod rods are far less needed now, I get asked a lot for &quot;pet toys&quot; by low lvl pet casters, but apart foorm making arrows or lev rings on a few raids, my summons are not required. Oh, CoH is nerfed to hell in PoP. How would you like defensive nerfed in 80% of the Planes, hm?<br />
<br />
8) Mages inflict a sh*t load of damage on mobs, provided the mob is not resistant to nukes, pet can survive, tank can keep mob off mage, mage stays alive*. Another little point is mages, while we can debuff similar to shamans, do not have low resist or lure nukes, we only get fire and magic: exception to this is Anti-Summoned spells, but there isn't a lot of summoend mobs in the game, is there? (bizzarely all mobs in plane of fire like the fire elementals had the SUMMONED flag turned off, this sucks)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, are you trying to convince us that mages suck? This post started about mages wanting their earth pet to tank better, now here you are claiming that you are a weak class? I know for a fact that mages kick ass, especially in groups. It's true that mages can't solo in PoP very well, and perhaps a pet that could tank a bit better for that end wouldn't be bad. But you are seriously claiming that every strength a mage has is actually a weakness. Good luck with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The honest truth is, he is probably a two boxer playing a Cleric and Mage and can't farm all the leet crap he wants cause his pet doesn't tank as well as a Time equiped warrior (obviously it should, right).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">ok are you saying pets didnt improve in PoP?<br />
Thats crup. Not only you have new pets of lvl 60+ and new focus items and new items to &quot;equip&quot; pet with and buff it more. No single class in game can tank well unslowed pop mobs. Check out that same warrior against pop mob and you'll see he will drop in under 30 sec without healing in toe to toe combat.<br />
<br />
So what that you cant solo in pop. Sony always did say that we are paying for dynamic content and they never guaranteed that everyone will be able to do exactly same shit in every expansion. I personally think its a good thing.<br />
<br />
On mage tanking better then its pet thats fucked up the ass itemazation and casters geting tank's AAs. Everyone knows that all/all pop items did nothing for class balance.<br />
<br />
Pet is just a part of the mage package and mages currentley are up there in desirabilty. Since they can deal both mele and magic damage both in very decent ammounts. Your buffed pets can tank slowed mobs just fine too I bet, but plate classes tank better.<br />
<br />
Everything regarding mage pet is as it should be.</div></div><hr />

Thats not a class issue, if you had a large xp hit against the group for including X class then yeah that needs to be fixed but thats not a problem anymore.<br />

I don't think the game should be made dumber, and I don't think you will get much support from Warriors in general about not having your solo abilities reduced either =/<br />

Btw that study lists the Mage pet as doing 164 percent more DPS than a Warrior.   So if your a Mage you don't see a problem that your pet could do that much DPS and could tank as well as a Warrior ?</div></div><hr />

Lol, get a clue jeez.<br />
Standard facet of fantasy RPG is the caster who can summon elementals or raise undead. Elementals in any other fantasy setting kick major ass. Go play D&amp;D and moan about your *friend* summoning a Huge elemental, and get laughed at by everyone else.<br />
<br />
--Pets doing 164% of warrior damage, sorry but in such instances the warrior is either way under levelled, or geared, or unbuffed, or all three, compared to the mage. Mage pet buff  +85% haste +40 ATK, love seeing melee complain about pets outdamaging them when the melee aint even got a haste buff...WTH do you expect in such a case? Mages can themselves keep a haste buff up on their pets, so don't compare melee and pets unless both are equally buffed.<br />
<br />
Maybe you need to go read things again, that test the original poster gave was of *INCOMING RECIEVED DAMAGE FROM THE MOB*, not the outgoing damage from pet and tank. So the PET was taking 200% of the warrior's damage, capische?<br />
<br />
Casters with too many hit points...*rolls eyes*. How often do you get 1 rounded by mobs? For me, it's pretty freakin' common. Mobs in elementals hit 600 and up, I love PoW, but many of the mobs hit 800+. AEs  in Tier4 tend to be 1500+ with nasty resist modifiers. So, that's why caster items get lots of hps too. <br />
<br />
Pets replacing tanks...where? Like WHERE does this happen? *looks around for this mythical event* Nope, can't see one, you ARE aware of pet aggro rules? If not, please go educate yourself. Once in a long while I see a &quot;pet only group&quot; doing dillos in PoS, sure as hell doesn't happen in elementals that I've ever seen. Ah, are you still moaning about Rak Ashiir in City fo Mist? Like, fire pets aint beem IMMUNE to fire since they changed resists 2 years ago, and if that ONE event was the problem...duh?!<br />
&quot;Ok lets start and adventure! we got all places filled but need a plate tank...can't do hard with no plate tank...&quot; Not mages fault if they made knights better aggro than warriors for xp, still need a pretty dern good knight for the harder stuff while a less equipped warrior is still suitable. <br />
DPs is dime a dozen, but plate tank/healer/CC/slow is still vital.<br />
<br />
Tried duelling a mage high end? We can't land jack squat in PvP, no lures. I beat a warrior a year or more ago who was a loud mouthed twit...I duelled him cause he was bad mouthing folk, he was a twit cause he dual wielded on the epic pet and expected me to stand still and be meleed on...&quot;What a maroon!&quot; in the words of Bugs Bunny! Tried duelling a monk pal lately, gave up, couldnt get his hps down below 40% and that was after blowing all AAs etc. If warriors are poor in PvP, again, not mages fault.<br />
<br />
Go play a mage and get back to this subject with a broader view point, please. :)<br />

Age old pet complaints are VALID, go whine to your Mage buddies, we don't want or care to hear it. BTW, since you brought it up, Warriors in AD&amp;D could have hirelings, why not in EQ? I challenge the Programmers to do it, then you will see real whining, from the casters! Its the age old anti-melee bent EQ stuff, I sure don't feel underpowered as a Barb in Diablo 2, or I bet in WoW. In Diablo 2, &quot;Diablo walks the Earth&quot; means, WOOT another SOLO kill by my Barb! How about they redo the sad mob AI? Instead of running after a caster the mob can't catch, get a caster mob to assist! That would mean no more AE groups, kiting, or any CRAP that ruins the game.</div></div><hr />

If you guys really wanted to improve the performance of pets I would suggest you start pushing to make melee mean something again.  Right now EQ is so anti-melee I'm not surprised players ignore their pets.  Placing a player in melee range of a monster is somewhat dangerous.  Placing a pet is just as silly.</div></div><hr />

PoP mob DPS skewed alot of things and mage soloing / pet tanking getting screwed at the same time was just a side effect.<br />
<br />
Im not really sure what mages are asking for here, but I'd make a guess that they are asking to be able to solo in PoP using their pet as a tank, at the same time they are not suggesting that their pet should be a better tank than a warrior.<br />
<br />
Heres where the problem is... back when I was levelling from 60 to 65 I XP'd in PoV, I had recently left a guild of which I was MT and I was well geared up for the level that guild was playing, at the time they were doing Halls of Testing, Vindi, WToV named, Rhags, Kunark dragons, Epics etc. Not uber by any stretch, but my gear should have been a step above the non-raiding warrior.  I had 20AAs - ND3, CA1.  Used my epic 2hs, had a bit over 4khps unbuffed, usually 6-6.5k buffed with Virt and whatever shm/bst/rng/pal buffs I could get to, and about 1300ac buffed.<br />
<br />
So I wasn't a gimp tank, but I wasnt an uber tank either.<br />
<br />
Against unslowed PoV mobs - golems / razorfiends - druids would go OOM real quick keeping me up, and clerics would have to be on the ball.  Once slowed it was more manageable, but there was still the occasional scary moment.  <br />
<br />
Killing PoV mobs using the tank them and beat them down method when at the appropriate level with average gear requires a dedicated healer and a slower and a plate tank to do it.<br />
<br />
What it looks like here is that mages are asking to have a pet capable of tanking mobs that an average geared warrior of appropriate level can't tank for more than 10-20secs without the backup of both a slower and a healer, and having the pet be able to do this well enough that they can solo these mobs for XP using the pet as a tank.<br />
<br />
Silverblades, I can see your point about how your class has lost power compared to mobs and maybe you could use a little &lt;3 from the Dev team, but suggesting that pets should be able to tank where tanks themselves have difficulty isn't going to win you much favor in this forum.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem is that a warrior's tanking ability increases dramatically as you add AA's and gear, I've progressed along way since I was XPing in PoV and believe me I know the difference between how an elemental tank with 200+ AA tanks vs a tank in velious armour with only a few AA.  Comparitively a mage's pet cast by a 65 mage in a non raiding guild wont differ that drastically to the pet of a 65 mage in a time guild.<br />
<br />
Maybe high level pet focus's could be improved, or more ancient lines of spells dropping at the high end so a time level mage would have a pet that tanks better than a bazaar geared mage, but as it stands there is no way a mage joining a PoV group should have a pet that can tank an unslowed mob for 15 secs without a heal, because if those pets existed the 3 plate tanking classes would be even less desireable for groups.</div></div><hr />

Only if they make the spells no drop, like our stuff, and drop in PoT. We can't get the stuff, and casters have it WAY to easy buying spells compared to how hard it is to get ANY caster cooperation raiding. The highest raid attendance is universally by warriors, the casters don't show, make them utterly gear dependant and maybe we can get some cooperation out of casters to show for raids!</div></div><hr />

*nods* Yah, that's the WHOLE point *bows* :)<br />
Ok, in TIer 1 with NTOV/SSra gear, I used 61 air pet normally.<br />
Now, in Elemental gear I use the same pet....<br />
I have the Diamond Prism of Companionship pet aufgment any mage can earn in LDON. This improves pets by about 2-3%<br />
We amost never do VT as we are concentrating on the Planes ergo no GLoves of Dark Summoning Pet focus. The Time pet focus drops from Bertox, improves pets by 5%.<br />
<br />
So, I have went from, hm, 1700 hp unbuffed to 3k unbuffed, plus FT , focus etc, but the pet is almost still the bloody same, gah! :(<br />
Yes since our pets tank, we noticed the difference, mobs DPs now is NUTS. Now on raids, mage nukes do 2/3rds of the total damage, or even more, which is totally out of whack to what it used to be (varied between 40 to 60% of damage was from pet). This shows the improvement the MAGE himself gets, but the pet stays the same.<br />
Oh, that is considering of duration of fights say when TIme mages parse stuff over each trial.<br />
<br />
Pets shoudlnt be able to out tank players, never asked for that, that's well obviously nuts :&gt; But getting crippled soloing bugs the hell out of mages. Having out 4k hp pets vaped by mobs sucks etc.<br />
One can hope GOD will give better pet focuses etc *sigh*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excuse me? <br />
1) I never once heard a tank moan about recieving buffs that the caster got from spells, if you are reffering to Ethereals, spectrals and runes. Yes I can agree there should be &quot;ancient&quot; spells again, that was logical and fair. Without spells equal to the mobs they face, casters are shafted. Don't blame casters melee drops in Tier 1 and 2 were mostly poor. If you didn't have the casters with the SPELLS to help you get through Tier 1 and 2 it would have sucked, wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
2) If you're casters don't help you, they suck, but don't EVER moan about ME not helping melee. For RP reasons I stayed COV when everyone went Kael faction, to help my guilds and others melee I went cohing in TOV again and again and again...when I could get NONE of the drops. I never *EVER* got Skyshrine leggings, though a WARRIOR pal tried organizing raids to help twice cause I had been so helpful for so long (just bad luck there with wipes and drops).<br />
--I remember melee moaning their heads off about not doing Velketor cause he only dropped &quot;caster crap&quot;, and folks always doing mobs that drop gear for MTs. So *BELT UP* about casters not helping tanks, grrr, the ones you know, alas, must suck :/<br />
Jeez, whether it was pallies in Kedge, rangers in City of Mist etc etc. I and other casters helped, and still do.<br />
<br />
3) Casters don't show? Then how do you do anything?  Get new casters!<br />
<br />
4) Swings and roundabouts. Velious destroyed casters, damn  near every mage and necro I knew, and a lot of enchanters quit because of the moronic resists on mobs. Luclin mobs have stupid melee mitigation, though that weakened melee, the mobs' hyper inflated hit points made melee shine again on upper mobs due to duration, but casters rocked on lower cons, &quot;god rods&quot; were a bloody farce. PoP brought about short furious fights, but the mobs DPs and short life spans meant melee got smeared and so did casters, but you got more bang for your buck, in many ways.<br />
Now, going by LDON, it looks like not only do mobs get hellish DPs, but their resists are rising again vs spells.</div></div><hr />

Eodin and Silverblade:  To my mind, part of a solution is better mage pet heals.  It kinda sucks that a pet hybrid(BL's) has not only slow, but also the best pet heals by far.  Mages best pet heal is 1200 and has a terible cast time/recast time.  I don't think that mages want to replace real tanks with pet's, just that they want a little more ability to solo something for exp.  Unfortunatly, the basic flaw in the test that was linked here made thewhole thing look bad.</div></div><hr />

As someone else said in this thread....mages are just feeling the hit to melee soloability (or complete lack thereof) that is pop.  To compensate for the effectively weaker pets (as tanks only...the mage pets still rock for dps), mages got increased dmg dealing via spells.<br />
<br />
I really don't think mages need anything from an overall perspective, but I can see where someone that started a mage several years ago could be ticked off because the class/game dynamics have changed significantly and the class plays significantly different than it did a few years ago.  Then again, so do warriors with knights having snap agro and agro lock...;) <br />
<br />
To the mages - times change, classes change...I have no problem supporting increased mage pet tanking abilities as long as it comes at the expense of mage direct damage abilities - otherwise mages would become way overbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">So to summarize mage complaints:<br />
<br />
1. your pet doesn't take hits like a Time equiped Warrior (which is common and should be the comparison point)<br />
<br />
2. Holds aggro poorly and should have aggro lock, or must use the &quot;sucky&quot; epic pet<br />
<br />
3. Even though the pet does 164% of the DPS of a warrior, that is meaningless.<br />
<br />
4. Want to buy the pet at your local spell merchant for 50pp.<br />
<br />
Now you see why we think you are idiots? I'm sorry EQ isn't easy enough for you. Let me tell you, I play a Necromancer at times, do I ACTIVELY look for groups? NO, esp Tanks, Jabar works fine thank you, and I will NOT level him to 65 and be forced to go to PoP. Just like the idiot Shaman bitching they put lfg on and go solo. WOW, so much effort put into finding a group! WOW, let me group with him! When EQ first came out, it wasn't populated by so many MORONS.</div></div><hr />

As for mages well I can see that their pets haven't scaled the way our gear has increased from NToV to Ornate to Elemental and now Time, but its a little odd how they neglect to admit the power of their nules has increased a lot... to the point Wizzies have complained about them infringing on THEIR territory.

They want to put LFG on and get 10 tells, cause they so Uber.  Or go solo BoT named or PoT if they want. Thats all they want. Your gear may have scaled up, have 101 in my guild, 19 show for a raid.......and thats best attendance yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">&quot;Actually more here think LDON was a worse expansion than PoP. &quot;<br />
<br />
No way. People here all seem to agree that Legacy of Ykesha was a horrible expansion.<br />
<br />
People for the most part kinda dig LDoN, except high end raiders, because the raids suck. I don't see those high end raiders, however, talking smack about the 40 hit point augments that allow them to upgrade their overall hit points to amazing levels. Nor do I see much smack being talked about Anger 3 augments.<br />
<br />
People also still have a love affair with Velious. It took loot to a whole new level, promoted high end raiding, and involved everyone's favorite adversary, DRAGONS (not to mention a hefty serving of everyone's second favorite adversary, giants).<br />
<br />
However, I contend that the only reason people haven't fully revolted and shit all over Planes of Power and it's stupid-ass design constraints, is merely the gear. Raex's Chestplate of Destruction ... Darkblade of the Warlord ... Shinai of the Ancients ... Bow of the Tempest ... this is some pretty nifty loot. People like big numbers and PoP has lots of them all over the loot.<br />
<br />
Take that away, or tone that down, and people would be right back to decrying PoP for the OTHER aspects of the expansion ... many of which people remember with hate, invective and malice in their hearts (hey, Rathe Council unbeatable remember that? Heeyyyyyyyy ... backflagging! ... Hey, lost flags, or ill-placed planar projections! On, and on and on).<br />
<br />
If it weren't for Legacy of Ykesha, people would probably hate on PoP more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Says who?  I couldn't disagree more.  PoP is such a huge improvment over Luclin that you would need log paper to graph it.  PoP fights are by far the most challenging, exciting and diverse of any expansion.  The only critisism I have heard of PoP was the flag system, which is annoying, but really most servers have pretty good flag agreements worked out, and really guild relations have improved a ton by forcing people to cooperate on backflagging mobs.  My friends in the top Time guild on Tarew Marr have been able to get their alts elemental flagged in a couple weeks without any cooperation from their guild, so I don't see that as a huge problem.  Ditto for new members in time guilds.  A couple weeks of paying attention to the lower guilds flagging for elementals and you will be fully elemental flagged just by virtue of your guild tag and the backflagging agreements between guilds.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, the Rathe being broken for so long and the recent borked time instances are the only complaints I have heard about PoP.  Personally, I would put PoP at the top of the list for raid expansions.  Some would put Velious above it, but I certainly haven't seen this anti-PoP sentiment by &quot;Most&quot; of the people I have talked to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think that hits the point of this thread right on the noggin.  Mages want thier soloability back, but what they arent realising that they arent the only ones who lost it.  Before PoP places like Velk's, Fungus group, occasionally seb had pretty high numbers of melee solo'ers.  Warriors with stacks of bandages could solo pretty well in velks even without a fungi or invigorate BP.  Monks could solo better, knights even better again.  On Tribunal it got pretty bad when one group would be sitting in a camp somewhere and the rest of the zone would be 20 soloers all fighting over spiders.<br />
<br />
Boohoo, mages lost out on soloing, well so did everyone who's solo strategy didnt involve some method of never getting hit by a mob.<br />
<br />
On the bright side tho we can all still solo velks / seb for crap XP.  I made 40% of an AA, 2k in gems and a couple bits of bazaar trash in 2hrs or so at the chef camp in Seb last week.  Much $$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Very true.  Soloing in FG and velks was my primary means of doing exp during luclin.  Not because I liked it, but because it was faster than grouping for exp.  I can't even solo a light blue anywhere in PoP so obviously I need my hitpoints and DPS doubled and bandages that heal for 300 so I can fall asleep killing one mob at a time for hours on end again.</div></div><hr />

Thats what needs to happen to get melee soloability back into the game, but I dont think thats what warriors are asking for.  What we are really saying is:<br />
<br />
&quot;Mages can't solo with their pets as tanks anymore because melee can't solo any more, suck it up like the rest of us did.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>wayshaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I feel i must respond to this thread.. first a bit of history..<br />
<br />
I started a mage back in may of 99, and played him solidly up until september with the LDoN release.  I loved playing my mage, but got tired of takeing it up the arse by sony.  The LDoN beta was the last straw.  I created a warrior,  hes now lv 62 most PoP flags, decently geared.<br />
<br />
One person mentioned about seeing 10 warriors on the LFG list to 1 mage on the LFG list,  possibly cause warriors out number mages (at least on my server) better then 10 to 1.<br />
<br />
Pet tanking, Pet dps,  no, i never wanted my pet to take the place of a main tank,  currently with the agro issues of pets, its not a very safe option as pet taunt does not work.  This can be proven... Take a shaman pet and a mage pet, have both tank mob X, mob X will go for the weaker npc pet dispite taunt being on or off.  In groups taunt from pet is not a viable means of agro control usualy.  Ive never been in groups were my pet was main tank, i have never witnessed groups with pet as main tank,  the use of pet as a main tank would be, in my opinion, very limited in what you were killing and were. &lt;&lt;Charmed bets is a totaly different issue, lets keep charmed pets out,  most mages dont bother with charmed due to the inhierent danger,lack of defense, i personaly rarely charmed, and only in LDoN,Nro adventures, still dangerous, and the exp that charmed pets suck up is wacked insane&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
In THEORY a mage should be able to out dps any class except a wizard, in actualy use, 90% of the time, most melee will out Damage the mage (when i refer to mage, i refer to mage + pet) &lt;note, this is my experience in elementals with my mage&gt;  the reason that this occures is due to innate lack of defense on the mages part, no runes, no nothing for defense,  even with spell casting subtilty 3 i cant nuke more then a couple times per mob or insta agro, usualy which means insta death.<br />
<br />
I love playing my warrior, now i have the advantage that my IRL wife also playes EQ and plays a Shaman so our groupability is set,  grab a cleric and some more meatshields and we are ready to rumble, have never had grouping issues with mage or cleric.  So for those that do not have this advantage i can see your point of argument about getting groups. <br />
<br />
<br />
The magician Class needs a serious Fix overall,  the pet cannibilization nurf that occured has seriously hurt alot of mages.<br />
With the canniblization mages were just barely under wizards for damage output, this loss of canniblization at least on my mages part as put a major decrease in the amount of damage output i can do on an adventure.    Lv 1-50 mages rocked soloing back in the old era, and even more so nowadays with pets always summoning at max level, and with the summoned focus items,  51-55 the ability to solo takes a turn, much much harder, but still viable,  56-60 mage soloability for exp takes a much serious turn for the worst and gets even more longer / painful to say the least,  in the 61+ game mage soloability for exp is almost non existant.   I would watch wizards and druids soloing in plane of fire and be ready to puke at time. (i think that no one should be allowed to solo in teir 3+ PERIOD)<br />
<br />
My personal view... the same as monks and rogues lack in the defense department but get major boost in the offense department,  mages due to lack of defense should have a  major boost in offense department.  Most mages would prefer this boost to come in the form of pet buffs or upgrade in pets.<br />
<br />
pet scaleing with mage... the same pet a mage gets at lv 61 and grinds with in plane of innovation,valor,nightmare, is the same pet a mage will be useing in plane of fire,air,water, time.<br />
<br />
Pet focus, with the intro of the pet augmentation in nroldon and it being on par with the vex thall pet focus, 95% of mages will have the nro pet focus augment so that is a non factor, only those ultra rare mages with the plane of time or the near mythical ldon raid pet focus will have a better pet (as it should be, but the upgrade of the pet vs the content these mages are doing is insignificant)<br />
<br />
In short, i love my warrior, i play him full time now and mage is retired (well semi retired, i use his tradeskills for odds and ends stuff, to keep my warrior nicely equiped)  Problems with my warrior? none realy,  yea, paly and SK may be decent main tanks, but you wont see them main tanking gods much will ya?  Warriors are here to stay,  yea, knights might be closer to us in ability, but i dont see em takeing my place anytime soon.<br />

Doomflayer, warriors are not a solo class.  Face it, accept it and get over it.   No where in any game description anywhere that I have seen does it say warriors are supposed to be able to solo.  Mages on the other hand are described as a solo class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">No warriors are not a solo class, but a different group of &quot;Programmers&quot; could have decided they were, and could have decided Mages aren't! Am I saying the &quot;Programmers&quot; are wrong, yep, they are out of touch with what their player base ENJOYS playing. The ones in charge play Casters, I HATE playing a man wearing a dress! Plain and simple, the BIGGEST mistake in EQ was deciding &quot;A&quot; class would be able to solo and &quot;B&quot; can not. It also is NOT a requirement a melee class is equipment driven, a group of &quot;Programmers&quot; decided we would be (and they do NOT play Warriors). <br />
Those same &quot;Programmers&quot; decided at level 65 NO ONE can solo in PoP well! So the ones that need to get over it are the Mages and Shaman who had it EASY soloing through levels. I have heard so many preposterous things on this board &quot;quading is dangerous&quot;. LOL, gimme a break, I quadded with my Dr00d and it is EASY. If you lag and die, that is your COMPUTER equipment that sucks not the Dr00d or Wizard class. The computer can be upgraded the class can not be rewritten by you at home! PoP was not made for soloers, if you soloed for 60+ levels why the hell would I group with you? Why do you think (like a Shaman noted) you can go fly &quot;LFG&quot; and go solo in a different zone and expect me to group with you????!!!! That is LAZINESS, I form my own groups and know people cause the dr00d is an alt, who makes great plat btw, something the warrior can not do because  had to group.<br />
Tell the Shaman and Mages to make a Necromancer, they are WAY better soloers for the most part and mana regen is not a problem. I group with people I know, not strangers that think &quot;LFG&quot; flag entitles them to some special divine ability to have people clammoring to group with you.<br />
BTW, Monks were told they were a soloing melee class, fix them too then! NO CLASS WAS TOLD THEY COULD SOLO AT LEVEL 65, in fact, the &quot;Programmers&quot; hinted you may not want to level up if you planned on soloing. My Warrior can solo many mobs at level 58, I rather do LDoN adventures. ;) I am more concerned Clerics are nigh impossible to find for groups, on my server, at the times I play, and good ones even harder to find. :o<br />

Some of you don't seem to get it, Brutul suggesting they double Warrior hps and DPS is a JOKE, so was my reply. Anyone even courting an idea like that is nuts. Evertime I log online with my Necromancer a pet tanks! &quot;Jabar&quot; is the reason I do not group, it is a lie tanks don't get left out of groups because of pets. I have a pet, hence why group with a tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">People always like to claim 'I'm go at solo but I suck at groups' but that's simply not true.  How do you suck at a group if you can solo?  Do you kill mobs really really slowly?  That's certainly not the case with the classes that commonly solo.  Does a group take a mage or a necro or druid and then say, &quot;This sucks we got a (whatever) we could have got another grouping friendly class like a Warrior who will be doing 3 times the damage of this useless soloer?&quot;  Of course not.<br />
<br />
In fact I'm not aware of any classes that is capable of soloing doing significantly less damage than a Warrior, if at all.  Maybe if in a group a soloer somehow has to tank or otherwise lose XP you'd have reasons to not want a soloer, but there's someone else to take the damage so you only have to do damage, and all solo classes are pretty good at doing that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it is an excuse to solo, and when they make level 65, and not a single person knows them in EQ, they can now complain their class &quot;can't get groups because of such and such&quot;, the truth is I will group with friends long before someone I don't know, I could care one wit about DPS or other things! You wanted to solo? Keep doing it! Can't because suddenly you are 65th level and must go to PoP to get decent exp? Let me cry a river for you now because you made it to 65th making no friends in EQ while you soloed through! Don't expect groups.</div></div><hr />

Second, take a deep breath and relax a bit.  You will feel better for it.  <br />
<br />
Programmers as you mention actualy designed all of EQ, and to my mind did a pretty damn good job.  If it was not so entertaining, we would not be at this message board discussing it.  Let's give them a touch of credit.<br />
<br />
As far as soloing well in PoP at 65...several classes do it quite well.  Wizzies, necro's, druids all solo for exp quite effectivly in PoP, including in higher planes.  A few other classes can solo, but less efficiently.  If you can do your damage, and not get hit, you can solo in PoP.<br />
<br />
Tell the Shaman and Mages to make a Necromancer, they are WAY better soloers for the most part and mana regen is not a problem. <br />
<br />
This cracked me up.  You have been going on about how unjust it is that warriors cannot solo...then suggest that if some one wants to solo, they should ditch the character they have put much time and energy and devotion into, and just make a necro.  Thank you so much for that advice.  <br />
<br />
Phantrom, good point.  A solo class can excell at grouping.  Biggest thing that some solo classes loose when grouped is DoT efficiency.  Mobs don't last long enough for DOT's to really rack up the damage.  Mages don't even loose that.  The only thing I think mages need to help with grouping is a little better mana regen(mage mana regen sucks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Gobsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I have looked at the parces from my guilds raids and the warriors are generaly behind the mages when compareing the warrior to the mage alone before a pet is added in.<br />
<br />
If a warrior is doing that much more damage than you then I am guessing that you had a group that was melee friendly with members that will increase melee damage but not caster damage like shaman.<br />
<br />
Haveing a BL and Druid would give you close to a 100% damage increase if you had a high agro tank, same with a bard.<br />
<br />
For short burst damage warriors are almost on par with mages because we have dis's that add a lot of damage but since they have such long refresh overall they dont add much.</div></div><hr />

Well, that'd be a player issue and not a class issue.  And we have a few in our guild who fit the description perfectly.  They don't pay attention or communicate in group, they don't use their abilities appropriately (guild druid dotting in LDoN at 20-30% and frequently going OOM, or t'other one who DoT's mezzes, for example).  People who I enjoy grouping with, and do it well, are prepared to adapt to the group - partly gear, but mostly mindset.   <br />
<br />
To say *My class is good at solo but sucks at groups* is nonsensical.  But to say *I am good at solo but I suck at groups* is mebbe misguided, but at least it's honest - and good to know before yah click *Invite*. :p  It looks to me like that's what you were getting at - the reverse misconception (i.e. *Druids are bad for groups*) is a pet peeve of mine and I felt compelled to comment regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Well obviously people can be good at soloing and suck at grouping but that's a problem on the person playing not the class.<br />
<br />
Even on the issue of dots, there's plenty of fast dots to deal with the efficiency issue.  Like I said, if there's a time where you picked up an extra warrior for DPS (who pretty much revolves around grouping and by that logic should be one of the best group classes) instead of a soloer because in a group setting they suck, maybe the soloers will have a case.  <br />
<br />
Even when melees (typically non solo types) clearly beat casters, like long XP grinds or LDoN, I don't see casters not being able to get a group, and they at least have an option to go solo while most melee do not.</div></div><hr />

Mages don't need an *increase in potential DPs*, they need:<br />
<br />
1) A pet that will survive.<br />
2) A pet that will take aggro off them.<br />
3) The pet damage to nuke damage ratio is out of whack, it's far too high towards nuke.<br />
<br />
Currently my pets get whacked out way too easily. I get killed a hell of a lot and yes I *DO* know how to play my class well, and our tanks have BoW and Anger3 augments. (Spell Casting Subtlety 3 as well)<br />
<br />
PoP nukes generate stupid amounts of aggro, necros and wizard FD or concussion that off, mages *cannot*. So I have the choice between chain casting Luclin and Kunark Nukes, or using a few PoP nukes.<br />
<br />
I've tested this several times: <br />
if I use the epic pet I don 't get smeared as much cause it's an aggro machine, but it's too low level to be greatly effective in PoP. it is miles better for keeping aggro off the caster than any other pet.<br />
<br />
Ideally I think mage nukes should only have gotten +200hp more damaging in PoP, but the pets got +1khp per Tier beyond the 1st if you get the correct focus (say each god drops a pet focus in each tier) and better aggro by procs or casts somehow. A summoned weapon that procs snare, stun, snare or aggro DD perhaps?<br />
<br />
I play with aggro a lot on raids to test it. I can use old nukes fine, no problems, however, on boss mobs in PoP you need to unleash as much DPs as possible. I've tested with an epic pet armed with gnoll whips, this worked *great* for aggro, alas the pet gets summoned and destroyed if melees pull away too fast, and with epic's very long recast it's a pest--it also has much lower DPs in PoP. An air pet armed with gnoll whips and focused is also pretty good for soaking aggro off the mage, but not nearly as good as an epic, air pets also push. Water pets have hardly any push, have the best DPs but very low hit points.<br />
<br />
Chaining rains is less agro, but they have problems with resists, range and the fact they are AoEs.</div></div><hr />

I'm fine with mage pet changes as long as there is a corresponding decrease in mage nuking power.  Mages are second to none (equal with wizards and rogues) in dps.  Increasing pets without decreasing nuking would be unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Note:  my comments are pre-elemental.  But, since most players are pre-elemental I don't want to see elemental geared changes screwing up the game for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would mages trade their nukes for a pet that tanks better?<br />
<br />
Trust me, I've asked.  The answer is no.  The smart mages who wanted to continue the pet centered solo play style re-rolled beastlords 2 years ago.  These are the &quot;me too!&quot; mages that complain now.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you can't solo as well as you did at 49 in the original EQ.  You were grossly overpowered.  every expansion since then has slowly brought you back in line.  Since kunark you've solo'd by bottom feeding.  you can still do this all the way up and at lvl 65, just the same as you could in Kunark, in Velious, in Luclin.    You are upset solely because you can not solo tier3+ like kiters can.  Kiters were always capable of soloing tougher things than you could, the game hasn't changed.   You haven't lost your solo ability.  The classes that have always been able to solo better than you (since kunark) simply have access to a better zone experience modifier than you.  All the cries of imbalance comes simply from a less exp/hour reward, that has always existing between mages and necro/wiz/druid, but not to the extend that it exists today.  Give Droga the ZEM of PoFire and all mage cries of &quot;weakness&quot; will suddenly disappear.<br />
<br />
Instead, mages want the ability to solo tier 2+.  Whether its through slows or pet mitigation, Mages simply want the healing/slowing abilities of the beastlord class, without having to give up half of their DPS like beastlords have.</div></div><hr />

10% XP penalty for being a caster, 10% for being an erudite, did you pay that?

Each class has its ups and downs.

Your way off base how easy it is to get the warrior epic, imo the warrior epic is much harder to get then all others. Warrior epic required going to all 3 planes and getting rare to super rare items, 2 dragons that were instant kills when they poped and a nasty mob deep in chardok that few ever tried to kill and one that would wipe at least two thirds of all raids that went to kill her. Every mob that warriors needed to kill had a nasty AoE, death touch or some other nasty proc.<br />
<br />
At the end of all that bullshit warriors received a substandard weapon that did not have any intrinsic value at all aside as a crappy agro weapon for mobs that required resists out the ass. Un like your 10k hp epic pet that you never need to worry about lousing that even today is a great tanking pet if you need to have a pet tank.</div></div><hr />

Warrior epic when released WAS good, just shows you how items improve quickly but spells do NOT, i.e. warrior epic was soon outdated. Mage epic is one of the rare spells that didnt get outdated because, since  it was so hard, it was berserk.

<br />
None of you have proven any of my points wrong, you just carp, so please, if you think I am wrong, PROVE it. I'll go get figures on silk drop rates etc if you want ;)<br />
<br />
Warrior epic does have only one hard part: green scale. That was a pain in the butt for warriors. Little fact for you, we had two *SK* epics in guild before I got the mage epic (much thanks to friends for their great help by the way), and IIRC 3 warrior epics. Anyone saying mage epic isn't hardest is talking poo and any HONEST person will admit it. How often did I help other guilds go through sky, and they would stop and farm Wingblades, but not progress futher BECAUSE of the warriors demands, so, the necros and mages got screwed. You do recall the mage crowns drop on isle SEVEN, not Isle 4 like yours do? Any of you old timers remember the joys of Bee Isle?<br />
Warrior epic is EASY except for that damned green scale.<br />
Mage epic is a nightmare cause ha ha ha, random rare drops on every major piece, pardon me while I check in for therapy ;) Try green scale x Magi Ptasi, Neh Ahsiir, Phinigel Autropos etc. Fortunately most mobs on mage epic are on relatively fast respawn compared ot Severilous and Hoshkar.<br />
<br />
Wanna talk over powered: Hoshkar, grr, 7/2 kills in his favour, that dragon likes eating my ass :&gt;<br />
<br />
Oh and please dont try telling me rogue, monk and cleirc epic are *hard*, oh boo ho hoo :D Now, when they were FIRST out, yes then they were hard, now, they are gimptastic, they don't call it &quot;Freebringer&quot; for nothing you know :/ That's actually a damn pity. <br />
<br />
Personally I'd love ot see warriros still using their &quot;Lightsabers&quot;, because earning an epic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fat lewts. The developers don't realize this. Be honest, if they brought out Warrior Epic 2.0, made it hard, made the result not just uber stats but, WOW cool, wouldn't you REALLY preffer it than just another drop off some mob...?<br />
<br />
Yah grass is always greener, but it's also sometimes concrete, patio, garden, library...classes are not the *same*. Chanters die a lot and get buff beggar hell but they are highly desired and can solo like a bandit. Main tanks get pampered with drops to allow guilds to complete hard mobs (yes it's true don't deny it), but aren't as loved in xp groups as knights and have far less choices for play styles. Necros are brutal damage dealers but almost no one knows this. Everyone wants clerics but the poor shmucks have to waste raid time in CH rots. And so it goes.</div></div><hr />

Hand in PoH was uncommon drop. Also compare number of warriros who were after bottle necks to number of mages. PoFear balls are rare drop. The whole war epic is pain in the ass. I've done monk and druid epic and if you were saying those were easy I'd agree with you. Warriors epic is a major pain in the ass and that is the reason I still dont have mine even thought I've worked casually on it for 2+years.

Silk vs Plate look up how many plate classes are in your guild vs silk. I rest my case.<br />
15war+4sk+6pal+20cler+5bard=50ppl<br />
8ench+6mag+6nec+9wiz=29ppl<br />
<br />
thats almost twice as many plate wearers in my guild vs silk. Plus after pop you are able to wear same gear as fucking warrior and get almost all defensive AAs our class gets. Thats fucked not your pet tanking ability.<br />
<br />
You whine how your spells dont scale whith mele weapons. Thats total bs. Look at your nukes... You got tons of upgrades there 61-65 also there were pet buff upgrades there too... As well as AAs that made pet(s) better but not overpowered as you are asking it to be.</div></div><hr />

I probably should take your advice in that first sentence, but just cannot resist.  Mages epics will do much more good for a guild than a warrior epic.  Warrior epic in this day and age is just for showing off mostly.  Mage epic is actually usefull, tho limited.  Most guilds that I know of tho that still do epics for people do not base it on what class.  Most family guilds do epics, and they don't care much what class it is for.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">for those of you just tuning in, magicians basically are whining for a 65% slow as well as 2100 hp pet heal, exactly what beastlords have.  When bringing up the point that magicians do comfortably double the DPS of an equally geared beastlord, magicians simply claim that beastlords are &quot;Hybrids&quot; and therefore deserve to be a lesser class by comparison.  While at the same time during raids they'd like to continue to challenge wizards in burst DPS, dishing out triple a beastlords dps conveniently enough outside of AE/ramp range...<br />
<br />
As to the laughable &quot;parse&quot; concerning a 65 earth pet vs a end game geared warrior, i have no idea why they bothered to post that here.  Perhaps its because their whining and cries of nerfing has already alienated them from any support from both the beastlord and necromancer class, not to mention from druids and wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Yep. Mages are seriously underpowered. Quite possibly the weakest class in the game.  I can't imagine how tough it must be to have a pet that only tanks marginally better than I do at level 65 with my mere handful of defensive AA's, and have nukes, damage shields, and utility spells.<br />
And here we had all those devs wasting time halfway fixing melee issues when they could have been doing something meaningful like fixing the glaring problems mages have.<br />
Tell you what, why don't we give them a pet that tanks like a time geared warrior with max AA's, a 75% slow, and a pre-nerf cleric complete heal?<br />
Coming HERE of all places and whining about the fact that your class doesnt solo as well as it used to so you're forced to either bottom feed on low blue/light blue cons for xps, or (GASP) group for xps, is like going to the Jimmy Hale mission's soup kitchen and complaining that the filet mignon you had for dinner last night came out medium when you ordered it medium rare.<br />

warriors arent planned as solo class i saw this at about lvl10 coming and now i am able to solo a tree in pon with all defensive aas and well ok gear. this is good enough for me and i love to play my warrior - in groups, with friends...<br />
i had bandage groups in velketors(monk, warrior, rogue all 50-52 with crappy gear), i had no slower groups in sol ro tower(cleric, warrior, warrior with ssra,vt and ornate gear) i duoed with a cleric a lot of times between 52-65, i loose nearly every roll on drops and i cant get it by myself - who cares so long i have fun!<br />

Thanks, exactly my thoughts :) I really dont know why this thread turned into such a whine fest, but after the first page I stopped commenting just because it became just unproductive.<br />
<br />
After all, just look at the facts:<br />
A time equipped warrior tanks a tier 2 mob twice as good as a pet cast by a time equipped mage. You can assume that the pet will not fare so good if you do the comparison in a higher tier plane :)<br />
<br />
There is nothing for warriors to fear, they will always be the supreme tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We weren't always, and the Mages are willing to screw Warriors back to the point where there pets can destroy a Warrior just so they can leet solo. They were like that, a lot would LOVE to see it again. Let me quote a necro &quot;hahah, I can solo guards and you can't, cause warriors suck&quot;, yep all the two year olds will be happy again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">A LDoN raid augment focused pet has something like 8000 HPs according to the pet casters in my guild.  I don't know what kind of mitigation those pets have, but that's an awful a lot of HP for something that you can potentially have two of (suspend minion).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Silverblade-T-E</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">65 earth pet with the Cherished Companion Shard augment dropped in Time+ LDON raid has 6470hp, with Time drop Ancient SYmbol of Summoning 6200hp, with Gloves of Dark Summoning from VT 5500hp, with Diamond Prisom of Companionship LDON bought 5,300hp. Go check the rarity of those items, DPOC = common; GODS and SOAS bloody rare (top end guilds only, GODs are rare drop, grr); CCS = rarer than a nerf being reversed (dont think there is even ONE on my server).<br />
*NO* pet focuses drop in the whole of POP except for Time from Bertoxx, can you imagine the only gawd damn decent melee weapon for you dropping from him in the WHOLE expansion, but you can get a ton load of haste, hp, AC, regen, resist gear?<br />
<br />
But since when the flip did mages use *EARTH PETS* on raids, hm? Most use air or water (waters best for two reasons: almost no push and better DPs). Air and water pets have LESS hps than Earth, and nobody uses the screwed up fire pets.<br />
LDOOn Time+ focus (CCS) water 62 pet has 4,200hp<br />
LDON Time+ focus (CCS) air 61 pet has 5,000hp <br />
If you are Time level you'll probably see a 4,200hp SOAS focused Water 62 pet, or 4,900hp 61 air pet.<br />
<br />
Mages can add 600hp to these totals with summoned items. Please note how long it takes a mage to set up, especially after a rez (which is why I pre-summon 3 sets of pet items when logging in).<br />
<br />
So if you were dumb enough to use an Earth pet 65, CCS focused (which is one of rarest items in the game), gave it pet weapons it would have 7,070hp. *YOU WONT SEE THAT* because mages dont use bloody earth pets except solo or in dire situations where you need root.<br />
<br />
Then remember pets take double the damage a warrior does *including the fact pets don't get riposted on*.<br />
<br />
So please get the *FACTS* right. Ain't seen 99% of you show FACTS :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Silverblade-T-E</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Doomflayer,<br />
You seem self obssessed that casters are &quot;out to get you&quot;, I could be wrong *shrug*<br />
WTH would I want warriros NERFED? They are the Joes tanking the mobs on raids and groups, like DUH! Hello, the better you do that better I LIKE it :)<br />
<br />
I play a mage cause it's fun, it's hairier than other caster class cause you have sweet sod all between you and getting smeared EXCEPT a tank and you're pet. Mages don't have concussion and FD, we get SMEARED on raids CONSTANTLY because of that now.<br />
if you are in a Time guild it's not so bad 'cause a real tooled out warrior can aggro like tar paper, but me and most other mages don't have that luxury (Elemental myself).<br />
<br />
I constantly have to watch aggro, and if the MT dies 9/10 *MAGES* all die next, not the clerics. BOW+Anger augmented tank using clickies and you can STILL out aggro them, hello, thanks Magmatron yesterday for splattering me , ouch.<br />
Traditionally mages were one of the LAST classes to get aggro on a raid, because our nukes damage/time/DPs ratios were so low compared to our pet's DPs etc.<br />
<br />
Before POP a pet was usually half or more of a mage's damage output, depending on setting. Now pet is 1/3rd, and usually a hell of a lot less on raids. That's nuts! PoP boosted nuke DPs but not the pet as you progressed, so aggro for mages became a downhill ride.<br />
<br />
My pet is  SUPPOSED to help with this, but now it DOESN'T. Pet *HAS* to be able to tank XP mobs sufficiently well to offset no defences for the class (note this can include heals, defencive spells and presummoned gear) But it DOESN'T anymore. When doing hard camps in Seb, common practics was to have the pet offtank, do you really see this happening on &quot;hard&quot; stuff now? *NO* cause pets get smeared like cream. All melee got hit by the hyper DPs of mobs, including pets, but pets do not scale up, k? How many hps did oyu gain. and *reduced damage intake* did you get from going lvl 61 to 65? <br />
Compare this to pets basiclaly unchanging from when you get the spells, and the mage's hp, mana regen and spell focuses increasing.<br />
<br />
Does the pet aggro off for the mage? *NO* The ONLY pet that generates sufficient aggro to get IT'S ass summoned and not mine, is the Epic, the epic that's what, FOUR years old?<br />
<br />
On another subject: epic numbers. Considering that the mage epic is still done and even at the time (Dec 2002) this poll was conducted, very valuable, while the warrior epic had been in decline for over a year iirc.<br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/fippy_facts.jsp?id=53736<br />
Three times as many warriro epics to mage epics and that's when the Warrior epic had been abandoned ALREADY for better weapons<br />
Mage epics: 2,724<br />
Warrior epics: 8,200<br />
Think about that regarding difficulty to obtain, use garnered from it, and fairness. Epics should NOT be just casually replaced, but that's one problem with melee: they had been so GEAR driven. Now there's more emphasis on abilities, still not nearly enough IMHO. So the Warrior epic was VERY quickly out dated, which was *DUMB* :( Do you see Excalibur being out dated in a year? :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Silverblade, you do realize that on the same page that you linked the epic data, they admitted to counting the totals for ranger and warrior epics as the combined amount of blades?  You could have up to three warrior epic blades at the time of the counting, resulting the actual number of completed epic quests being lower than the first number that was listed.  The actual number would be somewhere between 4000 and 6000, somewhat pathetic considering the high population density of warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Maybe someone else posted this but.....Mage pets can currently reach 8.7 or 8.8 khp's.  That isn't much under what I have.  It destroys any common joe warrior.<br />
<br />
Maybe SoE is purposely trying to get players to choose any class BUT the warrior with these repeated snubs.<br />
<br />
This isn't so far fetched an idea.  Tanks don't stack.  DPS stack.  Get your players choosing DPS roles and it keeps them busy and happy with the game.  No one wants to play tank_class#08 LFG all day.</div></div><hr />

From what I can see they took a survey of all epics *currenlty in use*.  You do have a valid point though.<br />
Since warriors can make their epic weapon again using the scabbard, some folks would have only ONE of the epic single handers, yes? That's shown by the figures, numbers having Tactics or Strategy blades isn't the same. Unlike the ranger epic, you can destroy a warrior epic blade without consequence and make another. I recall most epic warriors only using the off hand blade???<br />
<br />
So it looks like they took the total number from *anyone who had one or both epic weapons*, so the total is valid. Check out the numbers in the mini-table for warriors and think about it for a bit, 8,200 must be the total number of warriros with epics after all??<br />
<br />
<br />
Course I maybe wrong :)<br />
<br />
Mercurinor,<br />
I posted the exact figures for mage pets, info can be found here:<br />
http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=9418<br />
By the way, I just spent 20AAs so my pet could get hit by group and MGB spells *grinds teeth*.<br />
So as an elemental mage with 260 odd AAs, my pet of choice on Raids is Water 62 with DPOC focus, plus items+buffs.<br />
3,800 (base hps) +910 (Khazad's Mark) +618 (PTo9) +544(Focus7th and pets don't get hps from stamina by the way) +600 (items), + 330 (BBS)<br />
TOTAL : 6802 hp.<br />
That's fact, not rumour, and 99.9% of mages dont Have Pet Affinity AA to let group spells stick, though that number will rise now, it's a new GoDs AA, so the AVERAGE pet on raids doesn't get *any* group buffs and never has up to now.<br />
<br />
With the same bufds *I* have 5710hps, so my pets got 1092 hps more than me. Do you see the problem? :/<br />
<br />
Hope the info helps :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">Silver Blade, why are we even discussing epics? Those are GROSSLY out-dated and no warrior in my guild even looks at them with current bazaar bought crap. Considering there is at least 6x the number of Warriors playing as Mages, the Warrior epic BETTER be more common. It is not 6x more common. So it is HARDER for a Warrior to get their epic, case closed.<br />
Yes, I do indeed think many casters (including you) &quot;are out to get melee&quot;. It started with piss poor class design decisions at Verant, continued at Sony. Which class can solo is a prime example. You are just another lying caster when you say your pet doesn't take away groups from melee because:<br />
1. There is a limited number of DECENT exp mobs/zones, with reasonable loot, exp for the difficulty of killing them.<br />
2. Casters come in and SOLO them <br />
3. Those hence are not available for a group/get this LIMITED numbers of mobs/how many it takes to kill them. (one player is entertained for the evening or 6, Sony will take the 6xmonthly account money way before)<br />
4. Many servers are still overcrowded (like Tunare which is constantly in the top 10 24 hours a day).<br />
5. My friend WAS booted from a group, one doing a GREAT exp/loot camp, DIRECTLY because the Mage pet could out-tank her SK.<br />
You are just one of the greedy, SOBs that populate the game with your BS that because you play a Mage, you want to hog exp zones solo and farm.<br />
Get this straight, THIS IS A GROUPING GAME! GET OUT OF EQ AND PLAY ANOTHER GAME. Warriors have NEVER been able to solo well, and you get what you want?! I DEMAND WARRIOR BE INCREASED IN POWER TO DIRECTLY COMPETE IN ALL ASPECTS WITH MAGE: IE soloability, DPS, survivability, give us gate spell, and everything else.  <br />
To make a class soloable, it MUST be over-powered. I and MOST others are sick of seeing the twelve year olds, soloing crap and greedily hogging spawns (all while claiming they only play EQ 1-2 hours a day, when I see said players on 8-10 hours a day, LEET farming).<br />
Besides, you aren't getting the point because I guess you are to STUPID. PoP mobs had their melee output increased to the level they did to make it a challenge, FOR A GROUP. You can NOT solo these because they put out to much DPS/High AC/hps or several of these combined. If you don't like it, move zones! You take your greedy soloing butt, to a piss poor exp zone and do what you do best, clog bandwidth.<br />
Coming here a bitching &quot;whine, I can't solo LEET anymore&quot; is a bunch of crap, and we could care less, and are actually happy you have to group too! Now for the problem you have caused yourself, I WILL NOT GROUP WITH THESE SOLOING JACK OFFS WHO I HAVE WATCHED HOG EXP/ZONES/LOOT THE ENTIRE GAME NOW THAT THEY CAN'T SOLO. Overall at my level a Ranger does much less for a group than a Druid. Do I pick Druid over a Ranger? Hell no, let the soloing little jerk keep doing it, it isn't my problem he gets more benefit grouping now and has no friends.<br />
You picked a Class with a HUGE flaw, you get a sizable amount of your classes power from melee. So did we. But you picked a class with a problem we don't have, you could solo and did, and now no one cares to group with someone they don't know, when they can group with friends they do know.<br />
Verant/Sony answer has always been to increase mob melee out-put to make the game more challenging. The AI would have to be upgraded to make it challenging in any other way, like mobs immune to any type of pacification who run for help when a con RED attacks them to pull them. Or when you kill a certain number of guards, a kill team comes out from town to put a stop to it, like some of the AD&amp;D games do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">8.7k pets are focused with LDoN raid augment plus HP buffs.  You won't see those very often, but I seriously have to ask why pet classe are complaining about their pets if they have at least that HP.  When you factor in enrage that 8.7k pet is almost certain to live longer than me (at 11.8K hp) if the healers screwed up on heals in any kind of XP situation.  Yeah it mitigates worse than me, imagine that... a time-level focused pet is quite inferior a time-level warrior at tanking...<br />
<br />
With seemingly huge attack on every mob in Gates I wouldn't be surprised if pets tank even better than they are now (high attack = less advantage to mitigation).  I'm sorry, when I see a time cleric go down in 2 or 3 rounds, I don't really have sympathy that your pet can't last more than 2 or 3 rounds either.</div></div><hr />

You should spend less time thinking and more time reading and using a calculator it seems :)<br />

I hope you mean 4800 and that was just a typo...no way beastlords 64 pet has more hp than mage's 65 pet.  This ends up with 7802hp, not 6802.<br />
<br />
With the Diamond Prism of Companionship (LDoN focus), Rathe's Son hits 5300hp, a 500hp difference.  This makes it 8.3k<br />
<br />
With the higher focuses you can even break 6k hp unbuffed, putting the pet close to 9k.</div></div><hr />

And that augment is one of rarest items in game, and again, NO one uses earth pets...Don't think there's a SINGLE Cherished Companion Shard on Karana, most folk can't stand LDOn raids :/<br />

<br />
Doomflayer,<br />
Er, wow, you must have had some bitter experiences or been sniffing hydraulic fluid... :D<br />
*boggles*<br />
I don't give a RATS if warriors could solo at high lvl. It doesn't bother me if warriors SOLO, go have fun, that's what the games supposed to be for. If warriros cna solo who does it hurt? Me, no, if it wmakes warriros happy *good*.<br />
<br />
Warrors should have the absolute best tanking ability, to compensate for that they should have less DPs than other melee classess...yes, right, that's common sense way it should work? No worries there?<br />
K, whole problem comes down to *MOBS*, Verant screwed the pooch by making mobs hyper inflate versus PCs and relying on items rather than skills and abilities.<br />
So a warrior should be able to go solo mobs for xp if he wants but he just shouldn't have the DPs to finish 'em off quick like a monk could. Problem is of course, mobs DPs go totally crazy after they hit aroudn lvl 45 and up, and later expansions.<br />
And then you have cosnider which is best: mitigation or avoidoance on lwoer ons (for soloing coparison fo rmelees) etc.<br />
If a warrior could go solo seb lower and Droga at 65 without needing half an hour to regen after each fight, would that be bad? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
That's VERANT'S fault and SOE later on, NOT caster players. So you're hostility is crazy.<br />
<br />
Damn near every group *needs* a tank except on easy stuff.<br />
I've only every TWICE heard &quot;need a mage for group!&quot; So I suggest YOu think about that (one was 'cause they needed COh in the King room in Seb)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">Doomflayer, most casters in this game are just like most pure melee, ie people just looking for a fun time.  There is absolutely no validity to your idea that casters are 'are out to get melee', in fact, many casters also play pure melee, as either an alt or main(my warrior is my main, mage is primarly alt).<br />
<br />
I agree, soloing is something that should be more limited.  In fact, mage soloing is probably about right.  We can solo, but it is slow and inefficient(outside charm, and you need high end gear/AA's to make that viable).  I would like to see charm soloing and quadding type soloing made less effective, both in terms of experience and ability to get loot.  I would also love for warriors to be able to solo, tho I do not think it is likely to happen.<br />

Actually, this thread was started just to show test results comparing a pet to a warrior in tankability, which the author thought we might find interesting.  The flaws with the test and results where logically pointed out(comparing a time geared warrior to a pet was bad).  Silverblade pointed out what he thought where legitimate mage issues(and all classes do have some issues, the question is how drastic the issues are).</div></div><hr />

3800hp for *lvl 62 water pet with DPOC*<br />
NOBODY every uses earth pets on raids, 'cause their DPs is about 10% lower than air pets and they root. <br />
mages only EVER use air and water pets at high end on raids :)<br />
  <br />
<br />
So do you want pets to be able to tank raid mobs now? WTF?!<br />
Face it dude there are plenty of zones where mage pets do just fine for your leet soloing skills. You can not solo in high end zones. Get it into your heads no one suppose to be able to solo there. I understand some can, but no one is going to go out of their way to make it so mages are one of them. This is a group based game. You need tanks to tank hard shit and we need you to do DPS. Bitching and whining you cant solo mobs that hit over 600 wont get you anywhere, because they were not meant to be soloed and most definatley not meant to be soloed by anyone who relyes on tanking the said mobs without group support.<br />
<br />
Just to give you an example me and my druid can duo tactics mobs but sometimes it gets hairy. My gear is no where uber, but I always thought I was doing ok. What you asking for is that you and a pet do same thing me and a druid can bereley handle. <br />
<br />
Mind you druid can solo those same mobs without me tanking, but so can mages if they really wana kite shit. Dont even start with me we dont have snare or some other shit. You own a druid when you wana go cash pharm in OS or even CT with your pet that can tank those mobs. Guess what it is suppose to be that you better then next guy in one situation and he has an upper hand in other.</div></div><hr />

The spoiled bizatch is to dumb to see how arguing that his pet should tank at least as well as a Time equiped Warrior is impossibly STUPID. He is a dress wearer, he has been handed the game set to &quot;easy&quot; mode. Now it aint easy, now he has to group. Now he is mad, he can't leet solo. He continues arguing the point, this post should be moved to the Outhouse, I am already treating it as if it was there! EVERYTIME I log my necro on and have that rare day I want to group, you know what? Warrior/Paladin/SK are removed from the list of group members I am looking for! THE PET IS THERE TO TANK, A MAGE PET TANKS EVEN BETTER THAN NECRO PET. So all he wants is to cut us out of the group. He can peddle his cr4p to his fellow l33t d00d Mages, at least the ones that won't call him an idiot.<br />
<br />
BTW&lt; the Necro pet is overpowered to the point we had a 53 Warrior shooting arrows to stay out of melee while my pet tanked. It regens hps way faster, it hit harder, and if it died, who cares? I make a new one! We had no healer, we had no slower, but we did okay anyway. Thats what this idiot Mage want, at level 65, vs Raid mobs even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Avoidance is generally MUCH better than mitigation. I am getting combat avoidance before combat mitigation, as do most warriors. <br />
<br />
  It is the same approximate damage reduction, it's just a tad better due to some mobs having an innate proc that can't go off on a miss. Saying it's MUCH better is rather misleading.</div></div><hr />

Are you noobs or something? Do you still play in Seb? Using a necro pet for tanking WTH HAVE YOU GOT FOR GEAR?!<br />
*checks their magelos* <br />
Doomflayer sure seems a noob ...low lvl and gear don't mean noob but with what you just posted, yah noob...Casia hm, I'll assume you're comment is based on ignorance.<br />

Look, do I have to sit down and EXPLAIN how the game operates? I'm ELEMENTAL level, right? Lvl 65, been playing since start of Kunark, 260 AAs.<br />
Don't want pet to TANK raid mobs, but it is supposed to be able to survive reasonably well and to aggro off the mage reasonably well: they do neither currently.<br />
<br />
Mages ARE meant to be soloers it's in the offical CLASS description from Verant and Sony. The intrinsic problem is, as I've pointed out, is that mobs have totally inflated out of the values of players, this is one reason why charm is so utterly overpowered now. Pets are based on relations to players, hence they have been left in the dust AS WELL.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior using necro pet to tank...yah right, either the necro was way higher level, the pet was buffed to hell or that warrior had CRAPPY gear and seriously needs some help, jeez....</div></div><hr />

What I found interesting was the avoidnace skill seemed to help a LOT on low cons, but almsot not at all versus high cons.<br />
Any melee gurus know why? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you even read my post? The whole point is that very few classes are able to solo in pop. EQ is a group game and no one gives a shit that mages can not solo in pop with their pet. Especially not warriors, who think mage pets already do what they are suppose to do well enough.<br />

<br />
the &quot;mage's plight&quot; is so laughable that I no longer even notice when they are bitching anymore.  mages are the worst at staying on topic and using/understanding logic/reasoning during arguments it's not even funny.  check out their mageboards (http://forum.magecompendium.com), it's downright scary.  i swear every single mage player must be an asian female :p (date one for 5 years you'll understand)<br />
<br />
The earth pet has a ton of hp aug'd with pet equipment but you can't use them raiding or grouping, even tho your complaint is about the survivability of your pets when you are soloing.  Then the discussions changes without pause to how hard your 4 year old epic quest used to be, because that's valid how?  I swear the biggest group of whining sniveling little punks ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">Well i dun no, Mage pets should be the bestest! beat warrriers up and stuff! I wanta solo la~ you understand, huh?!<br />
<br />
I understand perfectly, they want to solo without effort, not understanding that kiters avoid melee and thats the only way they get exp not being grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Casai, what he was saying with not using earth pets on raids is that to get these hit point totals, pet needs to be raid buffed, and you don't use that pet raiding.  He did not mean that he wants his pet to be able to tank.<br />
<br />
Doomflayer, if you honestly thing that being a caster of any sort is being handed the game on easy, I first suggest you play one to 65, you will discover that in fact casters do have a set of challenges.  Second, I would level a warrior to 65, and discover that it is not exactly a hard class to play.  It has it's challenges, and does take skill, the same as any other class.<br />
<br />
EVERYTIME I log my necro on and have that rare day I want to group, you know what? Warrior/Paladin/SK are removed from the list of group members I am looking for! THE PET IS THERE TO TANK, A MAGE PET TANKS EVEN BETTER THAN NECRO PET. <br />
<br />
Then you are either seriously low level, or doing serious gimp content.  Not only does any classes pet not takethe damage as well as a real tank, but they are dumb.  They cannot react like a real person.  Understand this, pet's are not a threat to tanks, and unless they seriously gimp mob DPS, they never will be.  This has not always been true, but it certainly has been since PoP.  Obviously, this excludes charm pet's(which is a seperate issue, and needs much more substantial nerfing to my mind).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">The problem is that for mage pets to be able to tank as well as mages want them to, they would need to out tank warriors.<br />
<br />
It is true that Mage pets can't tank PoP mobs as well as they tanked Seb mobs, but warriors also dont tank PoP mobs as well as warriors could tank seb mobs.  <br />
<br />
The game has moved on, no class can tank effectively without a slower and a healer and if a plate tank can't tank them there is no way a mage pet should be able to.<br />
<br />
Boohoo... mages can't solo anymore? reroll as a wizard / other kite class or charm solo in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Your right, I have played not played a caster to 65, but I have played a Dr00d and Warrior to 62, hands down the druid had it WAY easier, and took half the time to level! Didn't have to spend a zillion pp for equipment to get groups, or do anything really. I have also played a Shaman to 57th, it is soooo hard soloing evens, yawn. It is much easier grouping with the JACK ASSES that can't play their toons because Sony FORCES my warrior to group. Like today, grouped with an enchanter, a two pull meant he died! We finally had him just Tash and let the Swarmcaller proc slow (ranger) because he was a moron who would chain cast slow. Then he sat near a rooted mob after it had been announced 3 times by the druid, and he got yelled at to move, till he was dead. Or the fine cleric who got in an arguement with the monk in the group, then the enchanter, then me, and gated after we had three mobs so we would die. Grouping gets you dead 1000000more often than soloing if you have half a brain. I used to take bets how many WEEKS it would be between deaths for my dr00d.  My druid often killed 8 blues at once, Rotting, plz about casters not having it easier. Peddle your lies to each other!<br />
Lets talk pre-PoP when my druid would charm wolves in ME and I would park my warrior off safely out of the way. The wolf got us an AA an hour or two soloing for my druid (with Warrior there just to suck off exp and stay the hell out of the way). Could my warrior/druid team do that? HELL NO.:eek: :eek: Lets talk old content, I been playing my warrior since 1999, lets get a group, outdoors pre-Kunark, LOL, Casters soloing all the hell over, go ahead yell for group for 4 hours, not gonna happen. Okay, we belong in dungeons! Sol B, LGuk, 100+ people, many of them MAGES and Necros soloing. No camps open, well screw this, lets log on Diablo 2 where the Barb is not such a fuggin GIMP and CAN solo too! Repeat in Seb, gotta love Tunare, one of the most crowded servers in the game. PoV now has 100+ everynight, let me repeat a lfg in ooc by a warrior:<br />
<br />
(warrior X) /ooc LFG 65th Warrior 200AA's (links BoC and SoD)<br />
<br />
Yep he bought the SoD/Helm of RZ/Boots of the Storm on Playerauctions for $300/$250/$150, let me jump right out and buy all that too so I can compete for groups, SCREW THAT(BoC sells for 800000pp on Tunare, whoopee). Heard from casters in my first guild, &quot;oh we don't need to get our Warriors better equipment, we will just group with the ones that already have it&quot;. After every tank left that guild, it died, no surprise. Next guild, &quot;we will never do NToV&quot;, all the tanks left that guild till they started canning the crap head CASTERS who  didn't want to raid, and are NOT equipment dependant due to poor design by Sony. <br />
My druid doesn't have a SINGLE piece of raid gear and can kill 8 blues at once, my warrior has a TON of raid gear and can't solo a PoP blue. Casters got it WAY easier, you are just both LIARS. <br />
Oh, I can get gear in LDoN! Can I? Can I get the NON-EQUIPMENT gear dependant casters to go? NO! Can I solo it? NO! You had the game set to &quot;easy&quot; mode, maybe your Warrior had an easytime, but I sure the hell haven't. Will more than 18 show for a raid in my new guild? Maybe, maybe not, lets change guilds yet again to get gear, yyyyiiiiiipppppeeeeeeee!</div></div><hr />

Give the pet credit, they are dumb, MANY players are dumber! I have grouped with them (due to being forced to by Sony) and so have you! They watch TV, they go AFK, Mommy makes them camp, they don't listen, they screw around, they don't care, they greed before need. Thats why you want pets improved, thats why I want to solo too!</div></div><hr />
