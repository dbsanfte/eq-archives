<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31270 <br />
<br />
Question is, should I keep this for my currently 55 warrior until he can equip it, and throw an anger III aug on it and use it?  Or should I stick it on my bazarr mule and try and turn a little profit?  I currently am wielding a BoC and a Bygone Buthcer Cleaver.<br />
<br />
The ratio is the best dang ratio i've seen on a tradeable weapon to date.  18/20 is amazing for a non-raider.  The proc isn't that hot, as its only a 100 point rune, but I have an anger III I can strap on it.  Would that make it worthwhile to use then or would I still be better off using a BoC?<br />
<br />
Any advice appreciated.</div></div><hr />

The runic proc is a 100 hp Rune combined with an 80 HP heal, so would make a decent solo weapon and a dps weapon.  <br />
<br />
My current inventory of weapons to choose from is<br />
<br />
BoC - 15/20 - Enrage<br />
BBC (Bygone Butcher Cleaver) 14/18 - 30DD + AC debuff proc<br />
Granite Scepter of Cruelty - 18/20 -  Rune + Heal proc<br />
CHoS - 13/20 -  Force Shock<br />
<br />
If You had to choose two of those as an everyday weapon setup, (add in a couple of anger3 augs) which would you choose.</div></div><hr />

The proc on the Scepter has some amount of aggro to it (runes have been shown to draw a little aggro, and heals obviously do) and it has fantastic DPS aggro for a tradeable weapon. But it will never give you as much aggro as you would have with something that procs a stun, debuff, pure hate, etc. That isn't to say that you couldn't use it, just that you might be sacrficing a little hate for it.<br />
<br />
That being said, when I get WA5 I might not be opposed to throwin A3 on a Granite Scepter and using it. Swinging that and an A3'd BoC would be enough hate for the XP grinds that I do, I am sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd swing it over a CHoS any day.  Btw the BBC it's kinda a tossup really.  It's rumored that runes work on a 1.5 aggro rule so maybe 150 aggro per GSC proc.<br />
<br />
I would honestly anger3 the BoC and the GSC.  Mainhand the BoC offhand the GSC unless aggro is trivial for you ... in which case swap them around for neato dps.  18/20 is certainly nothing to sneeze at considering that a large portion of the aggro you generate is still dps aggro.  Your aggro will probably be weaker than one with an innate aggro proc ... but no more weaker than using duel yak vs dual anger3 on a SoD BoC combo.<br />
<br />
I find it funny that some people are willing to comprimise for less aggro on a yak proc but never on weapons with procs themselves.  Boggles my mind  :confused: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arganax</div><div class="date">10-09-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is no doubt a great weapon for soloing, duoing, etc.  I just think I look at agro a lot differently than some people on here.  Until I can hold agro with a wizard chain nuking a mob (which will never happen) I won't feel like I am holding &quot;enough&quot; agro.  With c6, a new SD, better spells, better dps weapons, etc., the amount of agro a warrior needs to generate in order to maximize the effectiveness of the group has increased by a good amount.  The idea of trading agro for dps or any other reason just seems like a bad move for me.  Just my 2cp.....</div></div><hr />

Could help.  I played my brother's cleric in a group in North WoS the other day and the only thing I used to heal the warrior was his cleric time hammer's proc.  I literally used CH maybe 3 times in 3 hours on the warrior.</div></div><hr />

EDIT... Well I guess its still good to know about, but I guess the whole argument is poitnless for me now.  I threw the weapon on my trader overnight priced at 325k thinking that only an uber rich non-raider would buy it, and the chances of that would be slim, but lo and behold I look I check my mule this morning and the scepter was bought.  Oh well, I turned a tidy profit, and I will continue to use my BoC and BCC until I can possible get an SoMV to replace one of them.  Thanks again for the help guys :)</div></div><hr />

uh huh.<br />
<br />
We got a whole generation of folk here who denegrate the fungus covered scale tunic because it doesn't make a lick of difference when mobs start hitting for 500+, and now we got them claiming than 80hp taps and 100hp runes are useful.<br />
<br />
I say it again.  Yeah right.</div></div><hr />

I know ratio wise, this will generate more aggro but i'm more interested in how do the 2 procs compare aggro wise?  would they be about equal?  or will does the force shock still win out on aggro?  I would prefer runic since the rune aggro doesnt have a &quot;level limit&quot; as to aggro generated and the aggro generate would also be an AE aggro, but I really hate to have to cough up aggro for those benifits.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-09-2004, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People with rune3 weapons as well as chanters have determined that rune aggro is btw 1 and 1.5 the rune value for hate.  A 300 hp rune is btw 300-450 aggro.  This proc is a 100 point rune which puts it at 100-150 aggro + an 80 point heal which should add another 50 or so hate.  All of these are ae + to aggro (ie if there are 3 mobs in camp that have you on aggro list it adds equally to all of them). CHoS proc is around 400-450.  1-1.5 procs per min offhand depending on WA level.<br />
<br />
Assuming the mace thingy has about 150-200 aggro tied to it thanks to the rune and the heal ... you're looking at about 250-300 less aggro per minute from procs with no WA ... and 400 or so less with WA5.  From procs alone you have an aggro advantage per minute of less than 1 stun.<br />
<br />
My question is how much dps aggro would an 18/20 offhander have over a 13/20 offhander per minute?  Just a guess is it is pretty close if not more than the aggro lost per proc.  In the end your dps aggro will close the gap if not swing the scales in the other direction.  There isnt much comparison btw CHoS and this mace ... the mace steamrolls it in pretty much all areas.<br />
<br />
Some of these arguments are just plain retarded.  Which would you use?  A JoS with a debuff and godly ratio or a BoC with a very strong aggro proc and a lesser ratio?   Copper hammers of striking are nice and all, but a 13/20+stun vs an 18/20+rune/heal?  Especially when the weapon in question will be in the offhand and anger3 aug'd.  Haass as long as you're sporting the stun-guns with dd-procs on them or yak augs instead of anger3 you're a hypocrit ... unless you haven't upgraded your magelo heh.  You're doing the very thing you're calling stupid ... sacrificing a little bit of aggro for more dps.<br />
<br />
That said you'd probably be best off with the 14/18+debuff buyable weapon from OoW.  You'll have less dps and less utility and your weapons wont generate ae hate, but my guess is a bit more aggro on singular targets.  If this thing is offhand, though, the difference is gonna be really really small no matter what.</div></div><hr />

Agro and survivability are our bread and butter, but in some situations &quot;enough agro&quot; is just that...&quot;enough agro&quot;.  At times like that why not seek to up your DPS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think if you go by the proc it is obvious that the rune isnt going to turn too many mobs heads. However the melee adds a &quot;little&quot; aggro. I would say this would cause less aggro, but in an exp group it would be best since you are going for a mix of dps and aggro. With anger III added in in most exp groups that arent full of insane dps, you might be ok.<br />
<br />
IMO GBoS would give you the better aggro lock.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and by the way, if DPS has been such a huge portion of our aggro, them feel free to explain to me why before Stun + EB weapons were readiliy available to almost all gear levels of warriors, we, as a class were hurting something fierce in the aggro department.<br />
<br />
DPS aggro doesn't do jack fucking shit in the grand scheme of things.  In case you haven't noticed, we don't out DPS anyone, and that taunt button doesn't cut it by itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For DPS classes this is better than any other weap you can buy in bazaar. Better than anything you can get in Velious by far.  Better than anything out of Luclin. Far better than anything you can build or loot out of LDoN. Nothing close in early GoD. There is literally nothing short of Elemental Raid targets that drop anything this good. (The merits of this weap for warriors is still under debate in this thread. Personnally i think it would make a fine offhand once augged, but this is immaterial to the point of this derail).<br />
<br />
The point of this derail is that i find it completely depressing to see 60-80 people experiencing in WoS and not have Shadowhunter die more often.  There is zero clearing involved, literally none. The &quot;pull&quot; is a joke, he will walk right to you. Clerics can bind right in the zone you are fighting in so &quot;CR&quot; is a joke. He is like a 4 hour spawn (not sure of respawn after death). He can be killed very easily with around 2 groups (as always mileage will vary depending on classes/skill/gear/aa's/etc.) In my opinion this mob is unique in EQ as far as effort versus reward goes. And to see him spawn time after time, wipe a few unsuspecting groups, then despawn is sad. To not be able to rally enough of the people exp'ing there to kill his ass because he's &quot;too hard&quot;, &quot;not worth it&quot;, &quot;he's a raid target&quot; is a shame. It speaks volumes about what many players are settling for in regards to adventure, teamwork, spontaneity, and trying something new. It speaks volumes about what the general idea of &quot;fun&quot; in EQ is nowadays.<br />
<br />
Baby jesus cries when Shadowhunter spawns and is not killed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">10-10-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*Back on Subject*<br />
<br />
While doing a quick glance-through of the thread. I find it interesting Haass is saying DPS has nothing to do with agro. Very Interesting, lemme tell you why.<br />
<br />
First off, I am in a TIme/Qvic guild. Second off, I don't have a Darkblade, or a Fleshbiter, or any good agro weapon besides Edge of Eternity. My Secondary Weapons are GBoS and Agnarr sword. Now back to why I find it interesting saying DPS has no effect on agro.(O, i have WA 2)<br />
<br />
Last Week during Time, I was picked to tank TT, and obvious surprise to me since we had 7 warriors there with Darkblade, and 2 without.I started the engage with Fish Sword+Furious, and Switch to EoE/GBoS(14/18-149dmg+Stun) While in middle of Enrage(Fish sword for little extra damage before I had to get tons of agro). After Enrage I stonewall, and Go at TT, at 50% i lost agro, and had a hard time getting it back till 29%ish %, where I died, and raid leader called Flee.<br />
<br />
So, they let me tank again on our 2nd Try(They are trying to break me in).I engage the same way I did before /w FUrious+FIsh sword. But this time I use EoE/Agnarr Sword(17/19 125straight DD) because i figured if im gonna lose agro, might aswell do more damage. Well, funny thing is. I kept agro for the entire fight till I died(at 26%). So apparently, DPS does have something to do /w it. O, and I parsed twice as much procs on My Agnarr sword offhand than GBoS was doing, and EoE was near the same amount, maybe .5 more ppm.<br />
<br />
Now, REALLY Getting back on subject.<br />
If Rune's  or DPS don't affect agro that much. Why the hell can warrior's old agro /w SEWS over warriors /w BoW?<br />
O, and I have Raex BP(Echo of Anger,15% hate)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah no shit sherlock.  It does have SOME bearing, but not as much as everyone is trying to claim it does.<br />
<br />
I used a windblade for a long time.  Before that, I used dual fleshgrinders.  I've gone the DPS route, and that route fucking sucks, and I'll never go back to it.  DPS doesn't allow you to do jack shit except stay closer behind the fucking rogue or the monk.  You're not gonna hold aggro on shit thru a slow, thru a tash, thru an early spot heal, or anything.  I've been there, I've done that, using what were considered the best tradable DPS weapons of the era. <br />
<br />
18/20?  Pretty fuckin nice.  Course you can be a complete gimp of a rogue and still get a 16/19 with Triple goddamned backstab these days.  You think you're gonna hold aggro up against that with what you like to call &quot;DPS?&quot;  Have at it.  I personally won't ever go back to that bullshit again, warriors spent WAY too long looking for the best ratio they could find and getting their asses kicked in the aggro department.  The smart ones were using shit like the Truncheon of Doom, the Anklesmasher, hell, even the sarnak warhammer and the snare whip -- all lower DPS for their time, but they did the job.<br />
<br />
You wanna use shit like this and hope you can hold aggro?  Be my guest.  I spent way too long hitting for 325 with my windblade wondering why the fuck the monk was the shit beat out of him to ever go back to that again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes ... yes you are STILL a hypocrit.  Why are you going for yak augs vs anger3?  Yak is weaker than anger3, so you are comprimising some aggro for some DPS ... which is what jo blow here is wanting to do as well.  There is nothing wrong with this but check the baggage at the door and take a look in the mirror.  You're going with duel 150 less aggro per proc in both hands for what?  More dps?  More aggro?  If you're hanging your hat on stun being more aggro than Anger3 you're sorely mistaken.  Perhaps in endgame GoD and omens but certainly not anywhere in PoP, lower gates (up through all single groupable content -- been there), or lower-mid omens.  Maybe you'll see it some day but not anytime soon is my guess, taking into account for your hatred of raiding.  You've sold your group's dps potential output out for more dps on your part.  My guess is you can still hold aggro over them ... but my guess is that this guy could still hold aggro in his groups assuming the mace was less aggro.  Before you jump on your soap box take a long hard look towards home-plate.  Your advice is sound but the way in which you present it contradicts even yourself.  You should be unlocking EF ldon not guk.  Do as i say not as i do?<br />
<br />
Back to the weapons themselves:<br />
*13/20 + stun in offhand = how much aggro per minute?  450 + melee aggro.<br />
*18/20 + rune/heal in offhand = how much aggro per minute?  150-200 + melee aggro.<br />
<br />
We're not talking huge fucking megalithic differences in proc aggro here batman.  A whopping 250 less aggro per minute from procs ... which isnt even equal to one stun.  The real question is how much dps aggro a 18/20 offhand will generate vs a 13/20 offhand.  My bet is that the dps aggro is sufficient to make up for the proc-less aggro ... and probably even enough to make the 18/20 even stronger.<br />
<br />
I'd be more inclined to be sympathetic, but it was YOU who traded in your Blade of Carnage for a SoD.  Apparently the dps upgrade was worth the aggro loss.  Instead of blindly following proc vs proc take the rest of the weapon into account please.  This is why a JoS is better aggro than a BoC ... or why an EoE is better than a BoC.  Both have lesser innate procs but the ratio is sufficient.<br />
<br />
Honestly 15/20 + EB vs 20/20 + stun?  about 250 difference in proc aggro<br />
Look at   13/20 + stun vs 18/20 + rune/heal?  gosh ... interesting.<br />
<br />
Btw ... what helps a warrior hold aggro btw a tash/slow when procs aren't forthcomming?  Yes that's right incite + dps aggro.  Once you get the first procs aggro is generatlly trivial ... the problem is always getting the first proc usually.  The more you have the better chance you have to hold aggro when procs just dont want to fire.  Even with WA5 and duel ldon procs with duel innate procs it's still very possible to go the first 30-45 seconds of a fight without anything.  Times like those are where using a GSoF4 would yield superior aggro to what i'm currently wielding now.<br />
<br />
GBoS would outclass this, as would the 14/18 + debuff from oow or something like an OSoW, but i'm really not sure about a droga weapon. Take the extra stats/saves/hps/ac out of the equation and just look at ratio and proc ... the mace would win imo  ;)  .  Considering that the weapon in question would be offhanded with anger3 ... this argument is pointless.   You're telling him he can't when he really can, and that, sir, is wrong.</div></div><hr />

No Apolyon, you're an idiot, and I'm done arguing with you.<br />

Your fucking bullshit tests with the most unreliable class for aggro in EQ don't prove shit, and since more credible people than you say otherwise, I'm really very unconcerned with your &quot;Informed opinion.&quot;  So suck it.</div></div><hr />

When in doubt resort to explicatives.  Three cheers for maturity  :rolleyes:.<br />
<br />
For the hundreth time: my tests did not conclusively prove anything and were by no means flawless.  They did, however, reinforce a notion that myself and about 99.9% of warriors out there had found to be reasonably true.  You have Frod coming here with his uber-leet inside info and some SK bloke saying otherwise .. and that's about it.<br />
<br />
Before i quit everquest, however, i tried my weighted axe + anger 3 vs axe + yak augments.  Slow both warriors for a proc on 1 swing and tested with a 3rd party pulling in MPG, PoFire, PoInnovation, Vallon zek in tactics, Tipt, Kod`Taz, and even in Ikkinz.  Every single time aggro belonged to the other warrior (I had yak on mine he anger3 on his).  <br />
<br />
3rd party: bard<br />
We had a shaman and cleric with us as well as the duo of warriors.  The bard would pull a mob pre-slowed and let the mob hit him once or twice.  Both warriors would turn on autoattack from the sides.  Both warriors would get 1 proc + 1 round off.  One warrior had aggro .. the other one didnt.  Bard would mez ... cure slow on warriors and kill the mob.  Rinse and repeat 5 or so times per zone/mob-type.  It was obviously a 1 shot deal on vallon zek though.<br />
<br />
We both had all pertinent offensive aas.  Neither of us flurried on any pulls .. and we logged swing to make sure someone wasnt scoring a quad while another only swung once.  Both buffed 330 dex lv 70 and WA5.  I'll repeat it one more time:  every single pull the other guy held his aggro.  Anger3 vs 125 yak.  Mobs ranged from lv 50 all the way up to 73 red-cons with over 100k hps.  I cant speak for endgame gates or oow as i never saw them.<br />
<br />
So yes ... you are selling yourself short with stun.  I find this ironically funny as you're such the advocate of warrior aggro vs dps/utility.  You're doing the same thing yet too blind to see it.  <br />

<br />
I doubt they anger 3 / ykesha their weapons, if it is even possible to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Simple, they're putting out 3-8 times the DPS you are.  Doesn't matter how much of a head start you get in a Model T Ford.  Eventually the Lamborghini is gonna leave you in the dust.  Yes, it's possible to ykesha aug rogue weapons.  I have Force of Ykesha in my Gleaming Obsidian Shard.  It's a situational tool only.  I do enjoy breaking it out when the tank in my group has dps weapons and can't hold aggro for shit.  I figure if I'm going to be tanking most of the fight, I might as well lock aggro down solid so the slower doesn't have to be nervous.  The cleric usually doesn't mind either since I take less healing.   :D <br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you're mainhanding a Time weapon (EoE at the least), the minor rune proccing offhand isn't going to help much.  I've yet to see a warrior using a Chaotic Black Scimitar.  I've only seen a few with the Sword of Primordial Energy, and every one that I've grouped with, has had some big aggro problems even with it anger 3 augged.   It really doesn't matter what your DPS is.  If your slower slows and or tashes early and you haven't procced, you're going to lose aggro.  That's what taunt is for.  By the same token, that rogue chewing away at the mob for 400+ dps is eventually going to build up hate far faster then you can.  Until you proc.  By all means get one and anger aug it.  But don't be surprised when you contemplate bagging it.  In my experience, if you have a BoC or less, you still need a solid aggro tool to compliment it.  This is especially true if you plan to XP in KT, WoS, MPG, or RSS without waiting for the group to get rezzed and rebuffed every 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tohkin, in all honesty you did very well in Ferubi keeping 2 high end rogues happy without us getting whacked all that much.  Neither of us were using our DoDs.  I can count several warriors on our server toting around BF and a BoC or GBoS who can't hold aggro half as good as you were.  I was actually impressed, and I told Trag so.   ;)   I'd suggest a GBoS as a quick and easy upgrade, and work on your epic.  I'll send ya a tell in game and see if we can get something set up in BoT for ya.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What are the good applications of this weapon besides low aggro dps?  Weathering AEs.  Combined with shielding, it can really help cut down on the amount of healing you'd need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, I spent last nite thinking about it, and you're in the same pool as Battleblade -- it's a fucking detriment to this board to have your bullshit go unchallenged, so here you go retard, listen up, this is the last time I'm spelling out the blatantly obvious for you.<br />
<br />
First of all, in no way at all does my magelo influence my credibility on issues.  You seem to think that it does, and we'll get to that in a moment, but I'll explain why first.  I like lifetap augs.  If I had my choice, I'd have a lifetap aug on every weapon I own.  Now, unless I come here telling everyone that lifetaps are the best thing since sliced bread, I'm not doing anything wrong.  I'm telling you that aggro weapons, and aggro procs are going to do more for you than Rune procs and lifetap procs, which is the truth.  <br />
<br />
In everquest, people have many choices.  The most important of these is &quot;Am I having fun?&quot;  A lot of people don't care if they are or not, and just want to create the most efficient character that they possibly can.  These are people who insult people who have Marshall titles with unfinished defensive AA's, or people such as yourself who see a DD aug on my SoD and assume that I don't value aggro.  As usual, you assume too much, and basically look like the jackass you are.  In the end, none of this matters as long as YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOUR CHARACTER.<br />
<br />
Now, what does this mean for me?  It's simple.  I'm not the one coming here asking if I should have got Marshall at 42 AA's like I did, or if I should augment my shit with DD or Tap augs or what have you.  I know what the fucking answer is, and I don't give a shit.  I got Marshall early because it was important to me, and I bought 2 cheap DD augs for my XP group weapons because I didn't really feel like grinding out the 30 or so fucking adventures to wait for my Yak augs (again, something that you have no fucking personal say in), and getting absolutely nothing for it.  I also don't come here and give advice to do what I've done, because it's not the most efficient route, which is what people ask for.  If someone asks me if they should get Marshall at 42 AA's, or if they should put 150dd procs on their weapons, I tell them &quot;No, you probably shouldn't, but if you want to, there's nothing stopping you.&quot;<br />
<br />
What does this mean about you?  It means that in the short time you've spent on this board, you still have not learned one fundamental fucking rule..and that is that you can't judge people by what level of gear they're at.  I don't know who you performed favors for to get where you are, but it certainly wasn't thru any of your own doing.  You're a dipshit, plain and simple, and your magelo doesn't have anything to do with it.  I could easily tell you that you don't know jack shit because your warrior is just a twink who hasn't even been around as long as some people on this board have had their Marshall titles, and you'd just blow it off, saying it doesn't mean anything.  Likewise to you, and your fucking &quot;e-penix&quot; comparison.  You strike me as the kind of dumbshit who gets caught by his boss flirting with the chubby cashier chick, and gets told to get back to cleaning the restrooms, and then walks away muttering something about how you don't think that guy even has a level 65 character.  Guess what?  No one gives a shit.  On this board, your reputation is earned by 1 -- Knowing what you're talking about, and 2 -- Being able to carry on a logical discussion.  You fail in both categories.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I've ALWAYS been against pure hate weapons.  The blade of Carnage does not create significant aggro above and beyond what the Sceptre of Destruction does TO JUSTIFY IT'S COST.  1 EB proc holds aggro thru a slow.  1 Anarchy proc holds aggro thru a slow.  The difference is that I pump out an extra 15 damage per second with Anarchy and the associated proc AA's than I do with the bullshit, zero damage, zero way to tell if it's doing anything, Enraging Blow.  Here we have a similar situation with Augments.  The Yak augs are 510 and 760 points, for a grand total of (drumroll please) 120 more points than a SINGLE ANGER 3 AUGMENT.  That means in the time that it takes to grind out a SINGLE SOLITARY AUGMENT FOR ONE WEAPON, you could have both of them augmented with Ykesha, doing the EXACT same job, AND generating extra DPS for your group.  Anger 3/Enraging Blow is the biggest fucking scam in EQ, and I can't believe how many people have fallen for it.  I could dig right into the A3 vs Yak debate and provide a counterpoint for every single little bullshit exception that you guys come up with like &quot;Well, it's a proc, not a spell, they're different&quot; (which by the way, is funny as all hell, and if you actually think that logic thru, you see where it fails), but the end result is going to be the same.  You and everyone else is just going to go back to the &quot;Feels&quot; argument, which is the same tired bullshit you pull in every thread.  Apolyon feels that 2h outweighs Dual Wield.  He feels A3 is better than Ykesha.  He feels he's mistreated on the boards.  He feels he's more uber than everyone else.  Yeah yeah, no one gives a shit.  Feels =/= facts, and never will.<br />
<br />
The difference between a copper hammer, and this 18/20 deal (yeah, forgot name, don't fucking care enough to scroll back up) is NOT, as Apolyon put it --<br />
<br />
Back to the weapons themselves:<br />
*13/20 + stun in offhand = how much aggro per minute? 450 + melee aggro.<br />
*18/20 + rune/heal in offhand = how much aggro per minute? 150-200 + melee aggro. <br />
<br />
Is a proc from the 18/20 going to get you aggro if it's not on you, and push you farther ahead if you do?  The answer, is no, it's not.  The mob is going to keep laughing at you and keep beating on your rogue while he asks if you're one of those EBayed warriors who doesn't have a taunt button hotkeyed.  <br />
<br />
And yes, like Shredder said, feel free to take your DPS &quot;aggro&quot; weapons and go find a Rogue and see how well they do for you.  I guarantee that 18/20, 19/20, even 21/20 isn't going to be doing jack shit at keeping that mob on you against someone who's putting out REAL damage.  Procs are the mainstay, and always have been.  The only change is that now people are getting bored with their Copper Hammer, Sword of the Bloodsworn and Greatstaff of Thunder...and rightly so.  Aggro weapon itemization blows ass.  But you've got what you got, it works good, so keep using it. <br />
<br />
If you wanna use the new weapon of the week, be it Soulpiercer, or this 18/20 rune I proccing trash, then fine, go ahead, use it.  But don't come back here in a week and say we didn't tell you what was going to happen.</div></div><hr />

The same mob would laugh even harder while you try to gain aggro with a CHoS.   Which is greater Hass 500 dps aggro or 500 proc/spell aggro?  Which weighs more a ton of feathers or a ton of bricks?  Are you too blind to see the difference?  We're talking 200-300 difference in proc aggro AT MOST per minute.  How much more aggro will an 18/20 produce vs a 13/20 in 1 minutes time?  200?  300? 1000?<br />
<br />
But please .. lets dodge the point at hand yet again and attack the person.  At this point there's no point defending myself as i'm clearly an ebay twink who doesnt know shit compared to a genius such as yourself.  Your problem is you assume everyone who hasnt frequented this particular board as long as yourself in a newb ... that anyone whose played 10 other classes (all to whatever &quot;endgame&quot; was available at the time) other than warriors for 4 years before switching to full-time warrior must not know his ass from his elbow when confronted with such perplexing anamolies as the taunt button.  Certainly such people must have bought their plat on ebay ... or performed random sexual favors for their leet quested and nodrop gear.<br />
<br />
Since i wasn't a TSW member back when some of you guys hashed out how taunt or proc aggro works ... i clearly dont know what i'm talking about.  After all, it's not like it takes less than 3 hours to read up and learn about game mechanics thanks to the readily accessible information archived here on the boards.  Or does it?</div></div><hr />

Once again, you prove that you really don't have any idea how this game works, and that you weren't around when all warriors had was a taunt button and a DPS weapon and a prayer.  You don't think what I'm saying didn't happen?  It happened every fucking day, and everyone on this board who had a 50+ warrior when the Droga Revamp went live will tell you it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I know good and well a windblade wont hold aggro against a rog .. or anything for that matter.  An GSoT without its aggro proc will hold aggro better than a windlblade.  The proc on this does have some aggro .. and for an offhander it works just peachy.  I'd bet it's stronger aggro than a Droga weapon.<br />
<br />
I know enough about this game to know that an 18/20 ratio vs a 13/20 ratio will make up for ~200 less proc aggro per minute.  Apparently you dont.</div></div><hr />

Would you consider an EoE a stronger aggro weapon than a BoC.  If so please re-explain what you just wrote in light of this.<br />
<br />
Sorry guys ... we'll just have to agree to disagree.  The GSoC outclasses mr droga hammer in pretty much all fields.  If you honestly think that offhanding this with a BoC + anger3 mainhand with an anger3 offhand as well  will make any difference whatsoever... then there really is nowhere to go from here but up.<br />
<br />
Assuming, after the + to dmg dps in calculated in that this hammer is still 100 less aggro per minute offhand than the CHoS, then what is the tradeoff?<br />
<br />
100 less hate/minute for:<br />
More dps<br />
More hps<br />
More ac<br />
A nice little rune effect (ae aggro + utility)<br />
A nice little heal (ae aggro + utility)<br />
A few extra stats<br />
<br />
And you traded 400-500 less hate per minute and a substantial chunk of hps/stats for what Haass?<br />
<br />
That's right ... just dps.  Do as i say not as i do?<br />
<br />
I'm done with this thread.  Some people are just plain stubborn (hell i know i am) and trying to make 1 see the other's way is about like trying to break a porcelain toilet with nothing but your head.  Anyways we'll just have to agree to disagree.</div></div><hr />

A warrior with this 18/20 offhanded with a good aggro weapon mainhand, and a pair of aggro augs will absolutely keep aggro over a similarly equipped rogue.<br />
<br />
I say this because I play both a warrior and a rogue, the rogue was my main until GoD where I needed to focus on the warrior for my group to succeed.<br />
(Rogue - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20720)<br />
 Warrior - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=509704)<br />
<br />
The rogue has all pre OoW AA's maxed, max worn atk, and roughly the best ratio weapons available at this level of play, both with proc augs.<br />
<br />
Until I got the SoMV, I used Loathsome Bludgeon of Depravity (15/20 no proc) offhanded, BoC mainhand, both with anger3 procs.<br />
<br />
That being said, aggro was never an issue.  The 3 hate procs + DPS on the warrior weapons were always enough aggro for my non-raiding group.<br />
<br />
If a 15/20 could keep aggro fine in this environment, then 18/20 + minor proc can keep it as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would you use that 18/20 runic proccer(runic is the suck for aggro imo) mainhanded without an aug over an unauged BOC or GBOS?Your aggro would be the suck.<br />
<br />
You can use whatever you want that keeps your friends/groups happy.If you want to offhand a dps weapon it's often not a huge deal espcially with augs and lower offhand proc rate.It's not better than a real aggro weapon though.Using it in offhand just mitigates the aggro penalty to a more workable level with a decent mainhander.<br />
<br />
PS.My friend used dps weapons with a3 augs in EP's and did fine.However,my auged hate weapons tore aggro from him np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mainhanded is a completely different story Gunnar and it was never an issue in this thread so far.  <br />
<br />
CHoS = 900ish proc aggro per minute with no WA<br />
Scepter= ~400 proc aggro per minute with no WA<br />
<br />
DPS aggro means something ... but it better be a metric assload of dps for a 500+ aggro tradeoff per minute.  Considering the weapons have the same delay, the dmg bonus aggro is the same.  If i were looking for a mainhander and aggro was an issue, i would mainhand the stun-gun.<br />
<br />
Weapon affinity will allow the CHoS to pull ahead even more.<br />
<br />
Offhand is a different story.  The aggro-gap from procs is fully half the afformentioned, and the procless aggro leans much much more towards the scepter seeing as the dmg bonus ( = in both cases) is no longer in the picture.  In any case the poster was very specific to state that this weapon would be offhanded to a BoC, and that all weapons would have anger3.<br />
<br />
I'd bet that offhanded the aggro btw the 2 weapons is pretty equal, but that's just one man's opinion.<br />

While all this is true, LDoN does exist, this weapon will be offhanded, and WA5 has been added to the game.<br />

agro/dps etc. All I know is what I see in the field. I have been offhanding the Granite Sceptre since the first week of OoW. I replaced the Great Blade of Storms with it and mainhand the BoC. The GSoC is Anger 2 auged. I have not once noticed a decrease in agro generation and if anything it has improved. I am SA for my guild behind Flair, and step up quite often on the big boys. Awesome weapon, awesome graphic, glad I own it. <br />

<br />
Leaf can regularly outagro me with this weap (all other things being equal) on mob clearings...you all are being silly in this discusion its solid agro for a NON TIME WARRIOR IN THE OFF HAND (subjective observation).<br />
<br />
As far as Reparm/water rares whatever (the targets that PRE TIME warriors tank)...if you setup the mob properly AND your raid is disciplined...you can hold agro with any 4x eb/stun/rune combination (with WA5).  I think introducing mob names is just a red herring to obscure the actual arguments.<br />
<br />
And yah Haass is usually right but I think Ap has made some good points.  Settle your argument through logic not reputations IMHO.</div></div><hr />

Ideally, you have a solid hate weapon in both hands.  When your main weapon isn't proccing and you badly need that initial proc, it's nice to have your offhand pick up the slack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can setup a disciplined raid with a lot less and hold aggro fine.It's all relative.Haass ,suggested that he prefers some extra dps over a little more costly aggro and and it suits him fine.I'm certainly not suggesting you cant use the 18/20 offhand to good effect.I believe the uber guild on my server has a tank that used a shield offhand through eps and time...big hairy deal.It's the relative comparison of proc/ratio aggro we were talking about.<br />
<br />
I was MT all through pop as well and saw lots of differant combos used.On clearings aggression and position count for a lot on aggro.Also ratio is often better on engage imo.Although the 18/20 offhand wouldn't impact that strongly.I'd say use it if you like it and it works ...no biggie.People have used a lot worse than augged dps weapons successfully.Still don't agree it's as good aggro though when you get down to it.</div></div><hr />

...looks to me like it's a lot closer to being a top-end weapon for DW dps in situations where you are *not* taking melee damage but are subject to AOE damage or even the odd riposte. It's not that you can't hold aggro with it if you offhand this, aug it, and have a really kickass mainhand aggro machine. But I don't think it's a weapon that would be at the top of a list of great 1H aggro weapons. If that's correct, I'm not sure I'd seek to aug it for better hate, but rather for dps. Because the best use of the weapon doesn't look to me to be aggro.<br />

The Chaotic Black Scimitar (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68834) is a good example.

If dps is such a small part of agro, why does a 26/21 with runic hold significantly better agro than a 18/20 with runic?<br />

Droga hammers used to cost 50-100k on my server when they first came out.  Now they are 5-10.  You can bet that once the mudflation sets in this will be relatively cheap.<br />
<br />
I'd never buy a BoC 300k.  I'd never buy this hammer for 100k.  If one fell in my lap and it was a choice btw this and a droga weapon i'd wave goodbye to my old weapon and never look back.<br />
<br />
PS- the CHoS isnt really 4+ expansions ago.   The revamp occured post-PoP, and by all accounts GoD doesnt exist for weaponry unless you're an uber raider.  Anywho it's about like saying a Blade of Carnage and Bloodfrenzy shouldnt be compared to the new droppable/attunable weapons ... you know ... because they are so old and such?  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anywho it's about like saying a Blade of Carnage and Bloodfrenzy shouldnt be compared to the new droppable/attunable weapons <br />
<br />
<br />
The answer's already evident.  The new weapons don't compare given the purpose of the BoC and BF. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, you can A3 the new weapons.  But you can A3 a BoC, or BF too.  There is simply no logic behind comparing a solid aggro weapon versus a mediocre one that has to be augged just to reach the same level.  SoMV for example.  If you intend to compare, the OSoW would be a much better comparison.<br />
<br />
Another comparison that just came to mind.  Which is better?  SoTB or Fleshgrinder?  Which is better A3 or Yak augged?   Do you see my logic?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't disagree that offhanding that 18/20 hammer would be a bad deal.  Provided you had a very strong mainhand like a BoC or BF.  Less then that, and things will get dicey.  Warriors with a DBoTW or Fleshbiter have the luxury of being able to offhand anything.  How they do against 75+ mobs with the new hate reduction proc on the MT, we shall see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really it boils down to how you want to play, and how hard you want to push or can push your group.  If the slower dies on incoming and you have to go defensive, can you put out enough aggro to keep the cleric from becoming a grease splat because he/she is spamming fast heals?<br />
<br />
For me, it's a no brainer.  I take good care of my clerics.   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
ugh, dont you realize, that is only possible if you are using crap ratio one handers, with absolutely no AA, while the other DPS class have 800+AAs with their qvic+ weapons. <br />
<br />
Also, if dps is no aggro, then 3-8 times your dps doesnt do shit. (reminder: 8*0=0) An incite or two should lock the mob to you, right?  Empirical evidence suggests that, with a fine steel weapon and incite, you would still lose aggro :P<br />
<br />
If you are going with the dps set up and do around at least 80 pct damage of another dps class (rogues excluding, they can evade anyways), any aggro aug on your weapon would keep your aggro easy enough.<br />
<br />
It is definitely not easy to outdamage a warrior with something like sews/bow and max offensive AA.. back in the days, at least.<br />
<br />
Back to topic, if you use the whatever equation available in forum, a 5 damage difference with a 20 delay would prolly do around 240 more hate per minute assuming you are 60% hasted. (excluding flurry) So, yeah, the damage more than offset the 200 hate from proc hate difference.</div></div><hr />

Hummm... well you want to increase total PPM moreso then hate over time cause you want agro instantly if possible.<br />

2.5 and 1.0 is 3.5 ppm<br />

2.0 and 1.25 is 3.25 ppm<br />
<br />
So you have a bit less PPM, even if there is an edge or not in the hate over time department. <br />

Also its far fomr clear that the OSoW proc is only 450 hate, could be 350 or could be 550.... Probably I assumed like 550 when I put it in mainhand. <br />

<br />
  And Tamov, no one is suggesting that DPS aggro is non-existant. The key is that proc aggro is MORE aggro than DPS aggro. That's why warriors can have worse ratio weapons and MUCH worse DPS than say, a rogue, and still hold aggro. If you try to go for pure ratio and DPS to out aggro a rogue, you *will* lose every time. This weapon has a proc that just doesn't add enough aggro to make the increase in DPS aggro beat out a rogue. And because you will never straight out aggro a rogue with DPS, that means that you won't hold aggro well enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm counting comparable gear from the same area(s), and the AA to go with it.  A lot of my perspective is from the high end.  A rogue with Ifir and a GRMK or better in offhand is going to smoke a warrior with a BoW.  Neither will really replace what they have till time (unless the rogue goes for the Sword of Primordial Power, or Hammer of Crashing Waves.)  Sinister Strikes widens the gap even more.  By Tacvi, rogues can have a 27/21 (auged) in mainhand and cause the wizards to blow a gasget (right Mitnik?)<br />
<br />
I'm starting with PoP as the example because that's when weapons for both classes really start to scale upwards.  GoD just magnifies it to an extreme.  I'm almost afraid to see how ridiculous Omens will take it.<br />
<br />
  <br />
That 18/20 hammer is basically the new and improved Cudgel of Wrecking, which is hardly an aggro weapon.  I can really see monks, beasts and rangers going nuts over this.  It's a huge boon to them.  Less so for rogues and warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Runic doesn't begin to compare to Rune3 on BBB and SEWS, or even the Stone Edged Mallet.<br />
<br />
Most tanks that I know quickly ditched their BBB or SEWS when they got a BoW.  The only ones I see using SEWS anymore are knights since most aspiring EP guilds are actively farming RZ for their tanks.  I'm not saying that they are not decent weapons.  There just seems to be a lot less experimentation going on like when PoP was new.<br />
<br />
<br />
From what I've been seeing of Omens so far, they have added some viable (though NODROP) alternatives to the a-typical BF/BoC combo, or the BoW.  Sell the attuneable junk and camp the NODROP stuff.   :D <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I ran across this and think this is definitely much more suitable as a Warrior weapon, and would be downright silly for a rogue.<br />

its not worth the time to do ikkinz4 or 6, but 5 is definately something to consider with all the random ppl KT flagged now. maybe too hard to get a pickup raid going with everyone in oow though.<br />

450 X 2.5 = 1125  plus 1.0 X 700 is umm 1825 plus 137 (about 2dps) for more dps is umm 1963.<br />
700 X 2.0  = 1400  plus 1.25 X 450 is umm 1962<br />
<br />
He SHOOTS! He Scores!<br />
<br />
Lowering mainhand delay by 1 isn't gonna make up for the lost aggro.<br />
<br />
I really am not trying to be mean, Sam, but you are completely wrong.  Even though i've very sure that the OSoW proc is not 450 hate (~stun hate), we'll round up just to hammer this point home.<br />
<br />
Mainhanded with WA 0<br />
OSoW= 450 x 2.5 = 1125 hate<br />
BoC= 700 x 2 = 1400 hate<br />
OSoW is 275 less proc hate per minute here.<br />
<br />
Mainhanded with WA5<br />
OSoW= 450 x 3.75 = 1687.5 hate<br />
BoC= 700 x 3 = 2100 hate<br />
OSoW is now 412.5 less hate<br />
<br />
Fact is, the OSoW proc is much less hate than 450 per proc ... so the gap is actually much much larger than this.  Just as i can feel the difference btw my EB and stun procs (it's pretty significant) i can very well feel the difference in aggro drop from stun to this debuff.  Even so, though, 300-400 less hate per minute will NOT be made up due to lowering the delay by 1.  Adding anger3 to both decreases the % difference, but the raw number difference is still there and is unchanged.<br />
<br />
To tell the honest truth i would place this debuff proc btw 300-315 hate ... which makes it a worse aggro weapon than the GBoS which i have bagged (comparable but slightly weaker than).  This weapon for me was a comprimise.  I liked the stats and graphic on it, so i was willing to give up about  50-100ish hate offhanded a minute for it over my stun-gun.<br />
<br />
So really ... instead of saying &quot;He SHOOTS! He SCORES!!&quot; ... i believe the proper phrase was:<br />
<br />
Swing and a miss .... <br />
<br />
You did get one thing almost right though:<br />
  Hummm... well you want to increase total PPM moreso then hate over time cause you want agro instantly if possible. <br />
<br />
The only benefit of the OSoW mainhand vs BoC mainhand is the slight increase in chances at the first proc.  Overall it's gonna be less hate over time every single time.  Since you box 3 wizards for dps ... that's a poor choice imo ... but i'm sure either way your setup is more than enough aggro.  I've played with it both ways to notice a rather large aggro difference in hardcore groups when i offhand the BoC for the scim.  Maybe you don't but i'd wager that has more to do with the fact that you 6box and therefore your group never changes.<br />
<br />
This is why i offhand my scim to the BoC when aggro is an issue.  When aggro isnt an issue i just use my 14/18 stun gun for the dps perk.  Duel dd+stuns and ingenuity3/WA5 = fun stuff.  Honestly i cant think of any situation where i would mainhand the scim over either of my other weapons.  It really is nothing overly special in aggro generation.</div></div><hr />

No doubt it is less then EB for sure. <br />
<br />
Well I havn't ever used the weapons the other way, Ill give it a try and see whats up ... I think when I made my decision I was assuming the hate to be like 550....  If you have used them both ways and say BoC in mainhand is better then you are probably right.<br />
<br />
At any rate I keeping what I got untill something better comes out of OoW (I am sure we have seen just 1/2 or less of all the items that we will be seeing).<br />
<br />
Ya my group is constant and they do the exact same thing all the time (just when I do named I toss in Stonewall and Celestrial Regen), the tash/slow is timed with a delay and the nukes are also timed so if they take agro I just up the delay a 1/2 second or so untill I get to where they never take agro.</div></div><hr />

OSoW offhand:  700 x 2 + 350 x 1.25 = more than 1800 hate<br />
<br />
WA5<br />
OSoW mainhand:  350 x 3.75 + 1.5 x 700 = 2362 hate<br />
OSoW offhand:   700 x 3 +  350 x 1.875 = 2756.25 hate<br />

With weapon affinity 5 the BoC by itself almost produces as much proc aggro as the OSoW mainhand and BoC offhand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having used both anger2 and this scim simultaneously once upon a time ... i found anger2 to be more reliable aggro than the debuff ... which leads me to place the value somewhere close to 350.  I could be wrong though /shrug.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
As I said, I was using PoP as an example because weapons really start to scale up at that point.  High end to me is Tacvi, MPG trials, RSS and beyond.  There will be pick-up Time raids soon, trust me on that.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know what rune 3 is.  Rogues have been eyeing Allin's Mace a lot lately.<br />
<br />
Crystal Dagger and Allin's Mace is a good combo to use till Anguish.  The best part is, they drop in the same event!   :D <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Whoever war who ditches a sews for a bow is either a)selfish. b) from a guild who is stuck in EP forever since guild never seems to make it to time.<br />
<br />
That's what happens when you do RZ twice for flags, and never look back, unless nothing else is up (which is rare when only 3 guilds are in the Elemental Planes.)  Things were a bit different then while they were re-tuning the encounters while you were doing them.  =P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
According to what your logic, one would assume that BF is alot better <br />
aggro than FB in the mainhand. If you insist that's true, i guess, you are right, i wont argue with you lol.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you mean Fleshbiter, in which case there isn't much of a comparison.  Procwise, the BF generates more hate, but you're comparing 16/19 to 34/30 with a solid aggro proc.  Innate proc, aug proc, and DPS are all contributing factors.  FB will blow BF away (I've seen an FB with A3 beat an unauged DBoTW time and time again with one of our MTs).  If you truly want to compare, compare your Champion's Sword of Eternal Power (dual yak augs), to a DBoW(no aug).  The DBoW will win. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Emilia, that's pretty much the experience I've seen as well.  It takes a bit for the SEWS to warm up, but once you've got it, you've got it.  Most settled in on the BoW for raids, and XPing after they'd seen how it worked, or read up on it here once the information had been posted and debated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for mace and chos:<br />
Damage difference:5<br />
delay:20<br />
Proc hate difference per minute: 540 (450*2-180*2)<br />
<br />
BF and FB:<br />
damage differnce: 9 (delay adjusted... )<br />
delay 20<br />
Proc hate differnece per minute: 1200 (700*3-450*2)<br />
<br />
If 5 damage difference is not enough to cover the proc hate diff of 540 per minute (according to you), A 9 damage difference of FB certainly would not be able to cover the 1200 proc hate difference per minute compared to BF<br />
<br />
Also, comparing DBoTW with epic 1.5 is not fair. not only is epic's ratio inferior, the proc of DBoTW is essentially a double proc (hate + stun) with an adjusted mod. Without the proc mod, they could have similar hate generation, i cannot tell. However when you compare a  DB with epic 1.5, you are doing something similar to compare BoC with BF; what is the point really? It simply doesn't apply to the topic we are talking about, which is the hate generation of that 18/20 runic mace.<br />

Only when the proc rate dies down a bit will the superior ratio even begin to make up for some of the lost proc aggro.  Mainhanded my money is on the CHoS for pure aggro.  There's just too much disparity otherwise.<br />
<br />
Secondly ... 34/30 more than trumps 16/19 for a 1 hander on the dps scale ... and these 2 don't even begin to compare to the 13/20 vs 18/20 ratio.  It is also rumored that FB's proc is not your average run of the mill stun ... ie there is something more there we arent seeing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about you ... but i consider the epic's dmg/delay to be considerably better than DB's for a mainhanded weapon.  The raw ratios are similar, but the faster mainhander will get that dmg bonus much much more.  Epic 1.5's dps aggro is probably higher ... but the real gem on DBoTWL is the 1k+ aggro proc which has a bloodfrenzyish mod.</div></div><hr />

That 18/20 hammer is basically the new and improved Cudgel of Wrecking, which is hardly an aggro weapon. I can really see monks, beasts and rangers going nuts over this. It's a huge boon to them. Less so for rogues and warriors.<br />
<br />
I'm quoting myself here.  This is something the classes I mentioned would mainhand.  Rogues can't.  Warriors who would mainhand this, are probably upgrading from a Split Blade of Destruction.  I realize that bards can also use this.  I just don't know enough about the class to determine what they value, and what they don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's generally agreed that this mace could be offhanded well enough.  However, on it's own, it's simply not an aggro weapon per se.  You're going to take an aggro generation reduction.  What the purpose of the thread has been (correct me if I'm wrong) is whether it'd be worthwhile to do this, or not.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm an aggro whore.  I want that mob glued to me till I'm dead, or it is.  I spend more mana with my cleric on nuking then I do healing, which suits me just fine.  If I don't feel like boxing, I'll grab a DPS class.  I play my rogue the exact opposite.  I don't want aggro, I simply want to kill the mob as quickly as I can.  No matter what I'm playing, I'm looking at effeciency.<br />
<br />
Others don't see it that way because they don't play the same way.  That's fine too.</div></div><hr />

What you say is correct until the maximum aggro of the group is less than the aggro output of the warrior. Then you are actually losing efficiency because you are essentially &quot;wasting&quot; hate that could be used as DPS.<br />
<br />
There's a good chance that with the people you group with you can never have enough hate, but for some people there is. I personally always group with the same people so I know exactly how much I need to hold aggro. Anything more than that is wasted for me when I could be helping out with dps.</div></div><hr />

You don't really know how this works.I have noticed that weapons with damage less than delay do not seem to produce a lot of aggro.Where weapons with damage much greater than delay seem to produce more aggro.Yep, this is only &quot;seems&quot;.We don't know how the numbers are really used and must make educated guesses based upon experience and whatever player testing has been done.For me with my BOW/a3 I have noticed that ifirs don't seem to be a problem at all regardless of the fact it's our rogues using them,however,stick another dps class like a ranger in there with a little better ratio from higher GOD content and aggro gets noticably harder.The BOW works great for me with POP stuff and below.Our BOW warriors aggro just as strongly as our bf/eb weap guys do on raids.Friends usuing higher end GOD ratios are something else though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
All this evidence is saying is that aggro levels of a certain calibur are holding aggro against of weapons of a similar calibur, but are not holding aggro well against weapons which are much much better. Try switching to CHoS/Bloodsworn and tank against elemental/time rogues/rangers and see if you hold aggro fine. If not, is it still GoD ratios that make the difference? Or could it be the disparity between the tank aggro weapons and the dps weapons that is making the difference?<br />
<br />
Would you not say the following paragraph makes perfect sense? <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't really know how this works.I have noticed that weapons with ratios similar to my weapons do not seem to produce a lot of aggro.Where weapons with ratios much better than my weapons seem to produce more aggro.Yep, this is only &quot;seems&quot;.We don't know how the numbers are really used and must make educated guesses based upon experience and whatever player testing has been done.For me with my CHoS/Bloodsworn I have noticed that Acid Pocked Blades don't seem to be a problem at all regardless of the fact it's our rogues using them,however,stick another dps class like a ranger in there with a little better ratio from higher PoP content and aggro gets noticably harder.The CHoS/Bloodsworn works great for me with LDoN stuff and below.Our Friends usuing higher end PoP ratios are something else though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isn't the conclusion of this paragraph the same as yours except shifted down a level or 2?<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I don't think it has anything to do with some magic number of damage being greater than delay, I think it is simply where the aggro weapons can't keep up with the DPS weapons. For you, it may be GoD level weapons, for others it may be much much lower than that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has to relative differances of aggro generation between differantly geared warrior's vs differantly geared dps of course i agree.I don't agree that the 18/20 offhand is as good aggro as a CHOS offhand though both can do the job.I'll bet that any dps weapon with a ratio equal to or much lower than delay will suck in the mainhand without a proc for aggro.It will also suck for aggro in the offhand.Adding a proc won't make it better than adding a proc to an existing good aggro weapon with a proc.There were a couple weapons similiar to 18/20 runic  that sucked for aggro in EP's.Does  the lowered proc rate in the offhand tip the scales to dps? Probably, but not that much.Some higher ratio'd weapons have pretty good aggro on their own.Even when the dps are using similiar stuff.Of course a proc is necessary and I don't see myself dropping my BOW for anything but a DBOTW or FB yet.I'm sure some other god weapons could compare well though.Is it all relative...yeah.Does it scale evenly?..I don't know and neither do you.I do know that 18/20 runic is crap aggro relatively for a warrior  in EP content.Of course, if folks can use a shield and hold aggro they can probably use a dps weapon too.</div></div><hr />

I think there is a thread out there telling you (base damage + DB+1)/delay is an ok approximation for determining hate... so the damage of a weapon has a linear relation with hate generation given that the delay of different weapons are adjust.<br />
<br />
Shredder, have you use a chos yourself? Crudgel of wrecking could be bad aggro in the highend, but in the lower end, it could be a viable weapon. Long long ago when i was still in BoT mainhanding GBoS augmented, some time level monk kept stealing aggro with the ethereal destroyer... ED is a really bad &quot;aggro&quot; weapon in the highend, but when you compared that with some low end &quot;aggro weapon&quot; like GBoS (which is better than CHoS...), the aggro generation is pretty comparable if not better.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that critical procs generate no extra aggro right?  And that the ED has a -15% proc rate mod?  There's more to this story, like AA or the monk having a yak aug in the ED.<br />

Fynepisa, I agree with you.  My group is heavily DPS stacked of the caster variety.  Chanter + pet, necro, and wizard, mage.  It's worked well for us.</div></div><hr />

It was also way before even ldon. So there was no yeksha aug, no wa 5.</div></div><hr />

I've seen people main hand weapons similiar to this.Dps classes and warriors.Knights I know that play around with aggro with me used them as well and compared them to dps 2 handers and other weapons.Knights bagged em cause the aggro sucked btw.It's far less aggro than a good dps 2 hander from similiar content,or,a CHOS in the mainhand.In the offhand it will still be less aggro than something like a CHOS imo.<br />

I see all sorts of threads with partial tests that can be applied out of context.Just becuae someone has done a test telling me that a yak proc is better aggro than an a3 aug or eb on a raid mob doesn't mean I take it for proof.I've seen similiar weapons in use a lot and their aggro was relatively the suck.Still it will probably work fine with an aug in the offhand.My sa tanked fine with a3 auged dps 1handers all through EP's until he got a SEWS.Warriors with dual EB and BF's and caster dps didn't prevent him from doing his job.The question is if you are comparing absolute performance.If you are then the CHOS is better aggro.I would never have a problem with a warrior choosing the 18/20 over the CHOS offhand for a lot of other reasons...though I probably wouldn't have.<br />

Btw.A 14/18 ratio with a frostbringer style proc sounds good to me hehe. :)</div></div><hr />
