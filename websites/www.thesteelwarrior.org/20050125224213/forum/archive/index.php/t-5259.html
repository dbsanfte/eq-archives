I know I need a new face item. Any suggestions on what to get and also any other upgrade suggestions will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get your hp aa. Don't bother with cs/ca until you get nd3 + ae taunt.  And even then, pe is going to help you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's what I would do...<br />
<br />
 ND3 - AE Taunt - CA 1- CS 1 - PE - CA3 -  Planar Durability - CS3- LR5- ID5 then from there you can make your own decisions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Your hp will go up quite a bit, which is probably why its relatively low considering your gear level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry I didn't give any gear suggestions =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mask of the Sky<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: FACE  <br />
AC: 12<br />
HP: +90  SV FIRE: +7  SV DISEASE: +7  SV COLD: +7  <br />
SV MAGIC: +7  SV POISON: +7<br />
WT:  4.5    Size: TINY<br />

 Its not too shabby and should be pretty easy to get with your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you have alot of VT gear, what lvl range are you looking for? what are you currently raiding, if anythign at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fruzuk</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I am on FV. I have been there since it went live and Fruzuk is my 4th reroll.  The thing about FV is there is only one character per account there and only a few items are no drop.<br />
<br />
So when you reroll you just pass all your gear and plat to your next character. Whcih leads to one character with a lot of good gear and plat. You dont have any twinks who suck up your in game resources leading to a well equiped main character.<br />
<br />
I am not presently guilded. I am going to apply to a top raiding guild once I meet all requiments as far as AAs .<br />
<br />
Are there any LDoN gear that would be good upgrades ? Or would AAs be better than gear upgrades at this point? I am going to work on the required AAs to apply to a top raid guild on FV. They are AE Taunt, ND3, CA3, CS3 .</div></div><hr />
