<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For fun I finally trained ingenuity kind of on impulse, did two levels the other day. Then put on some proccing weapons and expected to see the proc go up.<br />
<br />
Nothing. Nada...What am I missing here? I thought ingenuity is supposed to increase your proc by 100% by the third level.<br />
<br />
But in two days I havent had a single proc over the usual amount for that weapon.<br />
<br />
Did I misunderstand how this aa works, or is it broken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the aa gives your procs a chance to crit for 2x the normal dmg it would have done, but the chance of it going off at lvl1-2 totally sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ingenuity just allows for crit procs, max ingenuity will double the da,age of the proc when it crits only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The proc has to be an instant proc with a direct damage component and it can not leave any kind of effect on the mob (such as a debuff or a dot).  I kind of think that that you might not have the right kind of proc for it to work is all since you have not seen it go off one time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm I tried wraths edge ,  red epic, and gaudralek all with no luck. What a suck aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The chance for a crit proc is very small, especially in the first 2 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was told it only applies to DD effects ... and not any DD + any effect type procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It works on stuff that's DD + effect as long as the effect has an duration of instant.<br />
<br />
For example you can critical static blow, 125 DD + stun 3/65.<br />
<br />
Anything that leaves an icon on a mob can't be critted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Using the droga weapons, 280 dex (at my cap w/o AA), and a dd aug in each weapon with ingenuity and wa1 I used to see a noticable amount of crits.  Of course, some will depend on how long your mobs live too, if your nukers kill fast, you won't get as many swings.  I think my debuffers usually do cripple, tash, mala...which the latter two should help, as you can't crit on a resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can tell you from experience red epic doesn't crit &gt;&lt;  Really pissed me off when I found out....oh well, not that I use it now anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did a small test of this once, and as far as i recall, at level 3 ingenuity, a DD proc crits about 4% of the time.<br />
<br />
So if you have an average proc that for instance procs about 5%, the chance of seeing a critical proc is around 1 in 500. Thus not something that has a real impact on dps  :) <br />
<br />
The good thing though is that primary and secondary is totally independant on eachother in this matter, thus ingenuity is far better for dual wielding with fast weapons, than with a slow 2 hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It really seems like combat fury and fury of the ages increases the proc crit rate.  Can anyone verify?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Use the Great Blade of Storms, I know for a fact that this weapon will crit proc.  I had it proc with Ing 1 and Ing 3, (went from one to three).<br />
<br />
Fried</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It really seems like combat fury and fury of the ages increases the proc crit rate. Can anyone verify? <br />
<br />
It doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Epics won't crit for whatever reason, maybe due to the anger effect? Droga combo crits fine, as does my WCS. Only have Ingenuity 1 and it goes off often enough for me to notice. I should probably get level 3 just to finish it off though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Epics won't crit for whatever reason, maybe due to the anger effect? <br />
Rage of Vallon leaves an icon on the mob, this is the reason why it doesn't crit. I don't understand why after all these years this hasn’t been changed. The old Rage of Vallon was a debuff, hence the icon.<br />
<br />
It's funny, these post seems to crop up a lot. Like Phantron said, it's all about the icon on the mob. You can crit blast with any DD proc as long as it does not leave an icon on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Don't bother getting Ingenuity unless you're getting all 3 levels of it.  The first 2 levels of it suck so badly that you probably won't notice any crit procs at all.  The last level still sucks but seems to raise the crit chance from nearly zero to around 4% or so.</div></div><hr />
