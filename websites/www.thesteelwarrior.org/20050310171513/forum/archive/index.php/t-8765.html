<br />
I am seeking several players to interview for an article.  The parameters I have are:<br />
<br />
You consider yourself a casual player<br />
You have a character at level 40 which isn't terribly twinked<br />
You are currently playing and enjoying the mid-level game<br />
<br />
I'll be taking or asking for screenshots that show your armor, and of your character in combat, ask about your armor and weapon choices, if you do tradeskills, roleplay, etc.  I'll be comparing characters of the same class and level (and from different servers - or I'd have just found them off my own).<br />
<br />
Now... I'm not here to debate what &quot;constitutes&quot; a casual player, but for the purpose of this particular article, am seeking players fitting the above profile.  ;)  (can you tell I've been through this on several other message boards already?)<br />
<br />
If you are interested, please email me at sylvene@stratics.com.  (I am a member of Stratics staff, but this is for a print publicaction, not for Stratics) I appreciate your time.</div></div><hr />
