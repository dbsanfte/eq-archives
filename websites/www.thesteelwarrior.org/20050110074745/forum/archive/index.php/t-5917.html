We are mostly LDoN equipped so this loot is actually pretty nice for us. I was wondering if someone has the locations of the different named and their difficulties so we can gear up a bit here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you head east from zi at the first intersection and make a slight left up the hill, the name lizard is a walker mob, spawns at the top of the hill.  You already know the spawn point of the named pooka.  There's a name undead all the way north at that dead end.  I've never done the left portion of the zone since there's no real need to stray too far from the eastern / northeastern area if you want to finish this trial in a timely fashion.</div></div><hr />

The above image is a shamelessly stolen link from the cleric boards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chavoor the Trickster - Always pops in that first southern culvert to the east.<br />
<br />
Ikaav Firecaller(gater) - Seems to have two static spawnpoints.  Either in the far north east room(labeled &quot;Camps&quot;) or from the first split go left, left, then on the right side of the room with the north, west, and south(where you are coming from) exits.<br />
<br />
Ukun Bloodbeast - I've seen this mob to the west of the western spawnpoint of the Ikaav, or in the first room on the middle(north) path.<br />
<br />
Umbiki(rampages) - Spawns in several places through the zone including close to Chavoor, in the east/west path connecting the middle and right paths, many spots in the loop on the west side.<br />
<br />
misguided bel? Creque(sp?) - Supposedly a named this mob only pops in the middle northern room labeled &quot;Crypt&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyv Hunter - I believe this one tends to spawn on the western path, but not sure.<br />
<br />

<br />
are these nameds available in xp mode instance too? or have to do the whole flagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any instance of vxed will have these named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nowadays, the named are not present when you first zone in.  At the 20 minute mark, all of the named will spawn (all that you happen to get in that instance, that is).  At 21 minutes, if there are no named on track, then you can quit the expedition and start over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you can just kill PHs and spawn them. Respawn is quick and the Name:PH ratio isn't bad at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never saw the killing of PH's result in a named spawn before the 20 minute mark, but maybe I just haven't done it enough.  It seemed to me that there were no PH's at all until the 20 minute mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if you can't spawn any named before the 20 minute mark, the respawn is faster than 20 min so you might as well kill the PHs and get a shot at the named faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The named don't come out of placeholders initially.  They spawn themselves at the 20 minute mark, all at once.  At 19:59, presto, you find out how many named you get for that instance, whether you've killed anything or not.</div></div><hr />
