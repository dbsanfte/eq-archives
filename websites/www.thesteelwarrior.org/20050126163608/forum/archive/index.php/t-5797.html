<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, my magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=942461) is on the left, or there to click on it.<br />
<br />
As you can see, i have bought a club of the mad researcher from EF.  I was planning on augmenting it with Anger 3, then a 2 damage aug from Tak'ish, although not that i am 4 or 5 adverntures away from the A3 augment, i am scared i might be trying to turn a DPS item into an aggro item, any suggestions on if i should put the proc on the club or wait for something else?  The other item for aggro that i have is red epic, sadly enough =/. I got this account from a guildy who quit, so i did not bring him up(notice the aa's and earring augs).<br />
<br />
I find myself using 2hs epic for aggro atm, i have a greatstaff of thunder i am not too enthralled with aggro wise.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 cleric main that i can use to get items with, along with a 65 mage i can box with these 2 chars too.  I also am in an ele plane flagged guild, and eventually might have chances at better weapons(recently had a chance at a valorous quarterstaff from AD, but forgot that can't click orb after AD is engaged.  Thankfully though, since i forgot ethereal procs have -hate to them i remember hearing about when PoP first went live)<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Before you get your panties in a bunch, my first main was a lvl 55 Warrior, and went to cleric because, well, i don't know really, but i am now back to the dark side :p</div></div><hr />
