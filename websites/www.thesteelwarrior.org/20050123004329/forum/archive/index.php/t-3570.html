<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kytor</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long time lurker, first time poster.... :)  Well after looking through a bunch of Magelo's I have some ideas but would like to get the opinions of the gang here.  I recently started playing my warrior again and have done some upgrading so mostly looking at weapon upgrades (I am saving for the CHoS atm), but any comments are welcome on any other slot.  <br />
<br />
Money isn't to much of an issue.  Although I can't afford anything in the 70k+ region just yet.  <br />
<br />
I also am wondering how my AC and HP compare to the level I am, I think it is ok, but not really sure.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time,<br />
<br />
Kytor<br />
55 Warrior of Bristlebane<br />

***Edit***  I forgot to input my raw AC ATK values so will have to do that when I get home later today:(   Unbuffed I am floating around 1050 AC and around 1050 ATK  ***Edit***</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
Mosquito Leg Earring to replace the Vah Shir earring.<br />
<br />
Only things I could think off offhand that really should be done =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kytor</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Azer,  I appreciate the help.  I have been toying with the thought of heading into Kael for some exping so will try to get the gaunts from there, maybe even trying to get into a ToV raid.  I had my earring spot mismarked, but still thinking of changing it to the mosquito leg or getting a bloodmetal earring.<br />
<br />
Got another question though.  Which would be a better weapon to replace the spiked velium mallet?  Wind-Worn handblade or the copper hammer of striking?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
<br />
Kytor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CHoS.  Might want to think of upgrading your haste item.  Check around the Magelos to get ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soulscream belt would be a good haste item to look for.  Drops in Veksar so you may be able to farm it.<br />
<br />
Then replace your gauntlets.  Skyshrine MQ is your best option, otherwise either Indicolate from Hate are very nice (5 stamina, 50hps) or Champions quested in thurgadin.<br />
<br />
Should also get something with hps in your neck slot.  Clattering bone necklace has already been suggested, mithril spiked collar or Brellium plate are also nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kytor</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info gang.  Updated magelo with the rough estimates for weapon, defensive, offensive skills and the clattering bone necklace as well as the CHoS.  Will be upgrading haste soon as well as hitting either HoT/Kael for guants.<br />
<br />
It's nice to be able to come here and get some solid advice.<br />
