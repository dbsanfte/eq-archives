<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im curious if this weapon is worth adding to my arsenal? Like the ToD and GSoT are almost &quot;required&quot; weapons of the normal warrior. What is an ok price to pay for one? Whats the high/low they sell for? Are there any other weapons that do area effect procs? I thought I read in another post that this weapon no longer drops, is this true? All opinions are welcome. Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would wait a little bit longer if your looking to purchase one. Seems everyone is still on the Berserker kick, and as it is Berserker useable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you dont have rampage disc it is prtty much useless, it just wont proc enough to really make a difference even if you have 6+ mobs in the camp at once in say an easy LDoN adventure.  I think the main use I had for mine was when we were AoEing the ssra mine for emp bane metals.  Even then it was mostly a toy and I didnt do any serious damage (I dont have rampge btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moozilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">get rampage, get 500 mob pull, group them up by running in circles, hit furious, hit rampage, pray you proc'd enough to win, as you're so lagged from the proc messages you aren't going to get away...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qaladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It no longer drops which means the price will only go up over time.  Buy one now if you want it is my suggestion. Keep in mind that its mostly a toy though.<br />
<br />
They sell for largish sums and will only get worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">500 mob pull LOL.  What zone has 500 mobs?  Genearally 50 to 100 mobs is about as many as you need to make it work good, depending on mob hit points.</div></div><hr />

Even though I haven't gotten rampage yet, it's still nice to kite around some Hill Giants in Rathe Mtns. and whip this out.<br />
<br />
246 pts each is considerable damage to those guys so it's still somewhat viable.<br />
<br />
Plus, for those raids where I'm not tanking, and basically dealing with multiples (for some ungodly reason), then it's still a lil kicker I like to play with.<br />
<br />
But aye, still a situational item at best until ya get rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its such a fun item though, also if you're in time and on phase 5 its fun too.  Those are about its only uses though.</div></div><hr />

Oh man!  I am going to see how many guildie wars have this and see what kind of dmg it will do now!  Thanks Pumilio!<br />
<br />
If nothing else our cleric team can use the rez practice :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I finally found a good place for it a while back. I needed some gnome meat for illusion potions for corner tanking, so went to Dulak with the war shammy combo and had fun. <br />
<br />
   Run all around that fort area in there pulling every mob you can and then try to one round 40 plus of them. Even when ya dont get enough procs to kill them all I could just finish them off with normal Melee.<br />
<br />
  But the Earthshaker sells for ungodly amounts of plat now, although there are probably a few sitting on mules from back in the days they were a common drop that didnt seem to have a good use.</div></div><hr />
