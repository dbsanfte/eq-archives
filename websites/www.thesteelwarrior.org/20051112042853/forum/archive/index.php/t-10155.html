<br />
But theres a few questions I have (couldn't find it anywhere)<br />
<br />
1) Whats does each point of stamina equal to health at 60 - and is there a cap on stamina?<br />
<br />
2) How does defense work (not AC, the + to defense skill stuff) and does this have diminishing effects or a cap?  (What I'm trying to ask is how good is this stuff, is it worth sacrificing stamina/AC for it and going all out defense gear or is it not that great..?<br />
<br />
3) How does enchanting work?  I can see that you can add certain enchantments to items but do all items have an enchantment slot?  Also it says that some items already have enchantments and you can apply a new enchancement by overwriting the old one.  How can you tell if an item already has an enhancement and what it is?<br />
<br />
Sorry if the answers to these questions are blatantly obvious, but not being able to play the game yet I can't tell :( Just trying to prep myself on gear choices before I can play...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) No clue<br />
2) There's a formula on your character's AC number.<br />
3) You can have 1 type of enchantment on an item, and you can always tell by the listing on the item if it's enchanted or not. Enchanters (dur) can enchant your items, leatherworkers can reinforced your armor with armor kits, and blacksmiths can attach chains to weapons to prevent disarmament plus attach spikes to shields, which causes damage every time you......block maybe? Not 100% on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-01-2005, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 stamina is always 10 HP for anyone at any level I think, which is why you see some random posts like 'this rogue has more HP than my warrior nerf them' since anyone who piles up enough sta gear can have a ton of HP (of course a War gets more HP per level for being a War, but the advantage isn't that big).  I have not heard of a cap that exists but I'd think it'd be very easy to verify if it did.<br />
<br />
Defense is supposed to affect how often you get missed.  It appears to have very insignificant effect since stuff 20 levels lower than you still don't have problem hitting you.  Some claim higher defense leads to higher parry/dodge and lessens chance of getting hit by a critical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok .. this thread is leading me to wondering about questions of balance.  If Defense, AC, lead's to the same avoidance/mitigation for every class .... and since all classes get the same HP per Stamina .. then just why are we playing warrior's?  I mean we have NOTICIBLY less DPS that other classes, and we can't heal ourselves or other's while tanking as paladin's can ....  <br />
<br />
I am only at lvl 25 right now, so this might not apply to me as of yet, but I can't help but wondering about the advantage of a warrior over other classes, especially, from what I am reading, when all of the raid content start's being SERIUSLY explored ... and especially in a group situation.<br />
<br />
I think, given the above, these are valid concern's.  If I'm missing something please tell me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of folks are concerned about how bad WoW warriors &quot;suck&quot;  Go over to the blizz forums if you want to see a true whine and cheese fest.  While we could stand to get some love from Blizz, it aint nearly as bad as folks make it out to be.  Perhaps the class is a tad more challenging than some folks would like, but I'm pretty happy coming from EQ.<br />
<br />
for +defense items, I think it only adds to your dodges.  If you go up against a warrior in PvP then you do NOT want to dodge alot.  You'll get eaten up by overpower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok firstly let me just say I am not actually playing the game atm due to it not being released in Europe yet, am in the final beta which opens up (hopefully) in next few days....  been following threads on messageboards (particularly here).<br />
<br />
But theres a few questions I have (couldn't find it anywhere)<br />
<br />
1) Whats does each point of stamina equal to health at 60 - and is there a cap on stamina?<br />
<br />
Each point of stamina from worn items is worth 10hp. Each point of stamina from your base stats is worth a lot less, but the exact formula is not obvious.<br />
<br />
2) How does defense work (not AC, the + to defense skill stuff) and does this have diminishing effects or a cap?  (What I'm trying to ask is how good is this stuff, is it worth sacrificing stamina/AC for it and going all out defense gear or is it not that great..?<br />
<br />
Each point of defense adds 0.04 to dodge, block and parry and decreases the chance for a mob/player to crit you by an unknown amount, which is presumed to be the same as the normal level difference. ( I.e. a level 20 mob will crit you as if you are level 20 yourself if you are level 19 with +5 to defense ). What that is worth in terms of STA/AF is a personal decision, much the same as deciding if 12STA is better than 1% dodge. <br />
<br />
3) How does enchanting work?  I can see that you can add certain enchantments to items but do all items have an enchantment slot?  Also it says that some items already have enchantments and you can apply a new enchancement by overwriting the old one.  How can you tell if an item already has an enhancement and what it is?<br />
<br />
Enchanters use components created by destroying green (good) quality items to add enchantment effects to items. All items can be enchanted, however most items only have one enhancement slot, so enchanting an item will mean that you can't use other enhancement items, such as armor kits or shield spikes, on it.  The enchantments are fixed by the type of item, so for example enchanters will get a spell that enchants a bracer by +5 stamina.  The better enchantments require items that are difficult to get, usually only obtained by destroying blue (rare) or purple (epic) quality items. Enchanters can enchant soulbound items through a special trade interface.<br />
<br />
Enchantments on items will show up under the item description as a line of green text and if you attempt to enchant an item that already has an enchant, it will popup a dialog box asking the enchanter if they wish to replace the existing enchantment with their new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defense is believed to affect damage from all special melee attacks that obviously ignore level restrictions.  I saw an example of mob using MS in a FoH thread that'd hit a tank with 8K ac for 2700 and a cloth user for 2700, but only 2K on a tank with a ton of +defense gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can attest to special melee moves not playing by the same rules as normal melee hits.  Just go attack a mob that is 6+ levels to you and hit it with HS, Slam, Cleave, etc., and watch how hard you hit it compared to the craptacular damage you do with normal melee swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sorta balances out at the end game:<br />
<br />
1) Warriors have defensive stance which give us 10% mitigation and more aggro in that stance.  With sword/board you will be the end game tank for many instances.  A paladin can sorta do the same job, but its a bit harder for them to hold aggro and they do jack for dps.  AC soft-caps at a pretty low lvl, so that 10% is huge for us warriors.  Paladins don't have that.<br />
<br />
2) Warriors CAN be dps monsters if speced that way, somewhat closer to rogue dps.  We can switch between defensive and offensive very easily.  <br />
<br />
3) We hold aggro like kings, with so many different shouts and abilities.  You can hold aggro with a shield (gonna have to 50+) and shields provide 1/4-1/3 of our total ac later on.  (some shields have 2-3k ac).  You can block with the shield, thus mitigating a portion of that damage away.  We have abilities that let us block 80% of the time 2 attacks every 6 secs.  That coupled with revenge that lets us stun the mob 40% of the time makes for good damage mitigation<br />
<br />
4) Our area effects (yeah we get those) allow us to hold aggro pretty successfully with mages area effect nuking.  Instances are 5-6 mobs at a time!<br />
<br />
5) Non plate classes will die in very short time if they are beat on for any extended amount of time.  Paladin aggro is ok, but its not aggro lock like in EQ.  That and they can't really heal and tank at the same time.  30% reduction in aggro from heals.<br />
<br />
Theres a bunch of different reasons why warriors are good.  The problem is that for the alliance side, warriors only really overcome paladins in the lvl 50-60 range.  1-40, the paladin is god and can do 99% of everything warriors can do better.  Later on for some reason, they wimper out. <br />
<br />
So ask yourself this, are you going to be playing in the lvl 1-40 range?  Roll a paladin.<br />
<br />
If you are going for high end, 60 instance raids all the time, go with a warr.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Er no. Demoralise, piercing howl and thunderclap combined do not even come close to holding aggro on a mage who is AE nuking. This is really obvious when you are pushing your limits instance wise and a mage can't kill AE mobs in two nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) from the limited looking I have done: the base 20 stm and every point of stm gotten from leveling up are worth 0 hit points. Your race's stm above 20 at level 1 get your 10 HP/stm--just like every point of stm from items.<br />
<br />
2) AC seems to have a very steep slope. At 44th while DWing I have 3100ish AC and 43% mitigation. Tossing on my shield, I have a 4600 AC and either 49% of 50% mitigation rate. Particularly once we are into plate, I think the incremental value of AC is very small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason why AC is on a diminishing return is because going from 50% to 51% mitigation is worth twice as much effective HPs as going from 0% to 1% mitigation.  It's probably not an issue as long as you're below 50% (everyone who can't wear plate) but once you get over 50% additional mitigation really starts to have a lot more value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) from the limited looking I have done: the base 20 stm and every point of stm gotten from leveling up are worth 0 hit points.

<br />
<br />
Actually that's not quite right.  From dev comments in beta we know that hps are calculated as:<br />
<br />
hps from stamina + hps from a table lookup based on class/level + a base<br />
<br />
From calculating in beta:<br />
(sta-race/class base sta) * 10 <br />
+ table lookup<br />
+ min (sta, 20)<br />
<br />
So when you level and gain 20 hps and 2 sta your table lookup value did not change and you did gain 20hps from the 2 sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's like, you gain a level and it'll say:<br />
<br />
You gained 15 HPs<br />
You gained 2 sta<br />
<br />
So people say how can I get 2 sta (20 HPs) but only gain 15HPs?  Obviously sta doesn't work!  The Blizzard response would imply you really gained 15 HP + 2X10 = 35 HPs.  I'll see if I can verify this next time i level, should be pretty triival to check really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a post a while back (but after release) about the sta you get from leveling giving you very little, if any, hps.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that my hit points gained each level goes up while i still get only 1 or 2 sta points.</div></div><hr />
