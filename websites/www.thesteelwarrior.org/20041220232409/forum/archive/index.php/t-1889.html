<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">notice that mobs seem to be jumping a lot? My guild was to late to do AoW or a lot of other things so we killed off a couple BoT towers and the mobs we consistently taking large jumps every 2-3 secs in combat.<br />
<br />
We weren't sure if it was weapon procs or spells (no one was using anything different than usual) but something appeared to be over-tuned and I was curious if others saw this and had figured out what.<br />
<br />
By trial and error we eliminated most of our weapon procs (such as force strike off the Great Blade of the Storms... and we outright forbid knockback weapons in BoT: imagine a knockback on Aucliffe Chaoswind...), mage pet push, and wizzard draughts which were the most common guesses. <br />
<br />
Anyone else encounter this and figure out the cause?</div></div><hr />

I would look to point fingers at any new raiders you had, or baring that, some vetern who was having and offday and maybe not as awake as he should have been.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed it too.. My GSoT proc was pushing mobs considerably more than usual.  2 procs in a row would move the mob oor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menia</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We noticed that, too. Was especially painful to get a Jord Skygge pushed over yourself, and it faced the raid...<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure, some Casters don't pay attention to the Knockback component of their spells, but it wasn't that bad until then...</div></div><hr />

That spell has done that since they added new effects, its only visual if you have player emotes animations turned on in options.<br />
And it doesnt actually cause movement, again its only visual.<br />
<br />
But I did notice last night in ChardokB (only place I hunted last night after patch) that my Bone-Bladed Battlehammer was causing mobs to literally jump up off the ground and land a few inches further back.  The Pali in my group was stunning but was not causing the effect that my weapon was causing.  Didn't cause any problems except mobs would &quot;jump back&quot; on a proc and sometimes landed up on the wall.  Didn't think anything of it till I read this post.   I didn't fight with a mage last night, but if its just &quot;proc&quot;ing weapons then their pets should cause the same &quot;jump back&quot; problem instead of the old &quot;slight push back&quot; that I used to get.<br />

I was chalking it up to the Force Strike proc off GBoS. It was *very* annoying on the skygge...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Werekin</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, I was in Veksar, yelled at my group about someone using a knockback effect/spell, the only one who changed anything was the pally turned off some proc, I assume a buff proc? but after that the mob moved much less, prior we were chasing him around the room.  My GSoT didnt seem to move anything I held solo though.</div></div><hr />
