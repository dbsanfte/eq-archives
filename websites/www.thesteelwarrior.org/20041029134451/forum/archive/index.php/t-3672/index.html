<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Knord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild had it's first shot at AoW last night.  It was late, our regular raid had been called before statue spawned, so we only had 30 people for the attempt.  All was going smoothly, I was first tank in the rotation.  We got him to about 60% before defensive wore off on me and the first tank switch.  That was when things fell apart...the 4th and 5th tanks in the rotation died somehow before the second tank was able to get aggro, and then he and the 3rd tank died soon after that, why I don't know.  Think he was at around 50% when we finally wiped.<br />
<br />
On thinking about the encounter, I have a few questions.   First, does AE Taunt work on AoW?  At one point I lost aggro due to some overzealous nuking, and when one regular taunt didn't work, I hit AE taunt, and he still didn't turn.  Don't think it was low health aggro, cause I don't remember seeing someone die after he didn't turn back, and he did turn back after another normal taunt.   Another thing, if you set up a hotkey that will announce that defensive is gonna drop in a certain time, can you use another ability like taunt in the /pause period?  For example, say the hotkey is /disc defensive  /pause 1785  /rsay Defensive down in 15 seconds, next tank get ready  , can you use other hotkeys like kick or taunt in the /pause 1785 time period?<br />
<br />
<br />
With more ppl, we can own this I think, I just want to be more prepared next time.  I want him dead. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mahulk Keras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't need AE taunt to switch tank on AoW. Agro on AoW is all about range. Your 4th and 5th tanks most likely were closer to AoW (or WAY ahead in damage/agro) so they got eat before 2nd tank. Make sure everyone knows AoW range agro and you will have less trouble to get control on the fight.<br />
<br />
AE Taunt worked when unshrinked and levitated couple months ago. They might have change it tho and I think it depends on the race of the warrior.<br />
<br />
Don't use /pause of you will not be able to kick/slam/taunt/disarm and all during the pause (not that it matters much for AoW). Simply use /disc to see timer. At level 60+ timer for defensive reuse starts around 10min 30sec, so at 8mins you can call disc down in 30sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AE taunt used to work on AoW only with levitate on at one point due to the model size.  Currently however even larger PoP mobs also respond to taunt normally so I think it should work on AoW as well unless the fix was PoP only.<br />
<br />
The /pause command prevents other commands from going through for the duration so a lot of casters dont use it. I manually check my disci timer and hit hotkeys.<br />
<br />
With your hps and level and a smooth CH chain, it's probably best for you to tank till death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well back when I was doing AoW we always tried to 1 tank him. That sometimes didn't work but usually 1 tank would make it to about 20 life on AoW at least before going splat then next tank just get in corner, be sure the heals are flowing and hit ae taunt. So if you are trying a tank switch I would say don't do that, let the first one tank till they croak. Just keep the spam heals flowing when defensive drops. Also, if you need to switch tanks using a nimble tank during the switch used to help us out.<br />
<br />
Your melee should be using MAX melee range to if you guys are new to this encounter. When and if you loose ago the rest of the raid needs to back off a second to let you get it back. AE taunt I have read doesn't work on AoW due to his size and Z axis but it worked for me everytime without fail. Sounds like you just got unlucky on that part.<br />
<br />
You cannot have a long pause in your defensive  key and be able to use other abilities during that time, the pause locks other hotkeys out so I wouldn't use it. Get you a timer for your UI and just give everyone a heads up defensive drops soon is what I used to do.<br />
<br />
Pull him to the corner and stick his butt in there. Use aa pets to push him in fast. Spam heals &gt; all and others watch their agro = Win. He is a straight forward fight, just high attack and melee but its certainly not something you can't overcome. Good luck to you, he will definately help your tanks out with a good agro weapon that can be passed down to newer tanks as you upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bumamgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, single tank is the way to go on AoW these days.  From your magelo, it looks like you should break 8k raid buffed.<br />
<br />
We've been single tank killing AoW since back in the day when I was around 7500 raid buffed.<br />
<br />
Just set up a solid 3 second CH rotation (can be done with as few as 5 CH'ers [Clerics/Druids] assuming decent mana regen)<br />
<br />
Have them run at 3 seconds the whole fight, from start to finish.  Get gnome illusion, corner him, kill him.<br />
<br />
30 people is more than enough to lay him out.<br />
<br />
If you want to &quot;practice&quot; the encounter without blowing it, do the Idol unslowed.  The Idol doesn't despawn, so you can try on him over and over, and the AoW fight is essentially the same as the Idol is when unslowed.  Idol has less HP, but his DPS unslowed is very similar to AoW.<br />
<br />
Have your highest HP/defensive AA warrior tank him (CA3/LR5 are gods against AoW)<br />
<br />
If your MA goes down, have everyone except the SA turn off attack and back away.  Let the SA build solid agro, then have him call in the troops.</div></div><hr />

7500HP on a 3 sec rotation?  That will get you dead fast, I should think.  Hell we still do him and we use a 2 second rotation with 6-7 clerics and I buff over 9k.  Occasionally people will see me go beserk, even with this setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I think that 2 second rotation, with one tank (no switches unless the MT dies) is the way to go on AoW for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">3 seconds will not keep you alive after defensive with 7500 hps, that much I can promise you.  You might live for a while, but eventually a spike will end you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's simple insanity.<br />
<br />
When we did him the other day, we used 4 clerics + 1 druid at 3 seconds, I buff to 9053hp, flawless victory.<br />
<br />
Seriously, 3 seconds is plenty, and unless your clerics have ass for mana regen (and I can't imagine they do, if you buff to 9k then your guild should have decent gear overall) using more than 5 people in the CH rotation is a waste.<br />
<br />
I mean, what the hell, if they show up, throw em in there, but don't delay the raid or anything :)<br />
<br />
We've done AoW 10 times over the last few months, and we've ALWAYS used a 3 second rotation.  First kill was July 11th, and I'm certain I hadn't yet hit the 8k HP mark.<br />
<br />
We've done him with everywhere from 25 - 35 people, and with as few as 4 CH'ers.  Yes, it was hairy when we only had 4 CH'ers, but with enchies chain runing and a necro to pump, it was still a success.<br />
<br />
Anyway, do it however you feel safe doing it, but I'm just telling you what is possible.<br />
<br />
Side note: I do have max defensive AA (CS3/ID5, CA3/LR5) but I haven't always.  In fact, during our first AoW fight, I believe I only had CA2....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well 3 sec chain can work its just much riskier.<br />
<br />
AoW quads for 1140 and flurries so he can perform 6 attacks per round for 6840 max damage in a round.  Toss in a kick of bash for another few hundred ponts and that is easily over 7K hps per round.  When you do a 2 second line AoW gets only 1 attack per Complete Heal on the tank.  If you do a 3 second line about every other heal the AoW gets two attacks on the MT between CHs.  All it takes is two back to back bad rounds for the MT to die in a 3 second line once defensive wears off.  When the max for two rounds is 14K+ from the AoW you can see how its easy to get hurt real bad real fast between CHs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bumamgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Forgot to mention that we also keep Divine Intervention up on the MA, and many of our clerics have the Unfailing Divinity line of AA.<br />
<br />
That ace-in-the-hole has saved my ass a few times when AoW would get one of those lucky streaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">id personally opt for the 2 second chain that you know wont mess up rather than just slowing it down a second and hoping DI fires, an unlucky flurry and DI failing would have good chance of whiping the raid when just tightening chain to 2 seconds would seem to be safe way. especially if you have chealers not doing anything</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup DI is the win, but only time I see it go off on AoW is if I attack through enrage accidentally.  On our server you take a lot of flak if you blow the AoW spawn...  better safe than sorry I suppose.  My guild is actually somewhat cleric heavy, so we have plenty to go around..gives them something to do.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm betting that AE tuant will definately work on AoW now.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that AE tuant was still the way you describe it above (no Z coordinate check) when I was in the Hole the other day.  We were climbing a tower, basically spiralling up it on the stairs.  No rooms all the way up, so no mobs through the walls around us at all.<br />
<br />
Whiile fighting one mob, another mob wanderer came up the steps from behind us and started on the cleric.  Then another wanderer came down the steps from above us and started on the enchanter.  All 3 mobs in camp are unmezzable (at least by a level 54 enchanter).<br />
<br />
So I'm thinking, &quot;there's no mobs through the walls, and AE tuant doesn't do a Z check&quot;.   Thought it would be safe to use AE tuant and end the cleric and enchanters suffering at the same time, since we'd probably lose one of them had I tried conventional tuant on one mob at a time.  Well, it aggroed the room full of mobs at the bottom of the tower that we had IVU'd through earlier (a good 3-4 flights of stairs down), and a room full of mobs that was way above us that we hadn't gotten to yet.  I died horribly fast as I evaced the rest to safety with my wizzie.<br />
<br />
Definatly does a Z coordinate check now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bumamgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">3 Sec when defensive is up maybe?We run 3 seconds end-to-end.  We could slow to 4 seconds when defensive, but have found that adjusting CH timing mid-fight is a risky proposition.<br />
<br />
As for blowing the AoW spawn, we've blown it once, and that was our first ever AoW attempt.  Once we learned the fight, we've never blown the spawn again.<br />
<br />
Our guild is pretty small in comparison to others.  In fact, back when AoW was a regular target, we only had ~35 members.  We've always had to make do with 3 - 4 clerics + druids.  When that's all you have, a 2 second rotation simply isn't possible.  3 seconds is certainly doable, and we have 10 succesful AoW fights to prove it.<br />
<br />
Key is to keep DI up, have enchanters chain rune the MA, and invest in defensive AA (which all MA's should do as a matter of course anyway)<br />
<br />
Now that I break 9k raid buffed, we've considered dropping to 4 seconds, but figured there was no reason to mess with a sure fire strat.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it! :)</div></div><hr />

With DI and chain Rune, theres no doubt that your could probably do 4 seconds.  Rune and DI are not necessary, and with a 2 sec rotation you wont need either of them.  (Just watch for enrage)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Talun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Been Tanking AoW since i was 6800 HP raid buffed with 7 clerics and a 2 sec rotation they even kept me alive after def was done almost everytime.with the addition of the massive druid heals have the druids do a back up rotation of faster heals and you wont have any trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>chidder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">our first aow kills our tank had bit over 8k 8200 and we were able to keep him up with 7 or so  clerics for atleast a while after disc fell. now with LR should be even easier. did it with 9200 and 5 clerics (raid of 28 total bout 5 boxed) kept me up with 1 use of loh in that time. but back to the tank rotation. Every tank thats not next in rotation should turn attack off and back up once mt goes down. except for second mt that is.<br />
<br />
note to krowbar. Have you had Aoe tuant work on Fenin. or pheonix type mobs in fire  they always seem to egnore it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raiddinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As others have said, just use one tank.<br />
<br />
Get at least 5 or 6 cleric/druid in the CH chain and have everyone else keep throwin little heals or bedlams or what have you on the MT since nobody else will be taking damage (assuming that they are at the proper melee range and he is being corner tanked appropriately).<br />
<br />
His DB is huge, Tank it with /disk evasive.<br />
<br />
You could try out that spell clerics get from LDON thats a little mini defensive until like 1600 dmg taken.<br />
<br />
From everything I have seen he has SKELETON aggro, get the MT as close to his thing as you can and he will stay on the MT no matter what unless he starts summoning people which means overnuking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mightyberge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">with todays levels and AA if you can break 7500 raid buffed you can single tank AOW.  as for argo control, i would just annouce and make a hotkey to do light/medium nuking till 50%. and also  tell melee to be at max melee at all times except the SA and TA<br />
basically, you need to be closest, then the SA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I thought we were all in agreement here that /disc evasive was a really bad idea on AOW...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Using evasive on AoW would likely reduce total damage taken, but defensive is likely a safer use because it reduces maximum damage taken, which is the real killer on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">dont need to change tank when defensive is down really...<br />
some corners in the arena are fvcked up tho and the tall races even double skrunk cant corner AoW, so either have your dwarves/gnomes/asslings tank him or make your tall tanks gnomes ( i dont recommend being a gnome for too long tho :) )<br />
Corner him, have melee's at max melee range and it should go smoothly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You sure its a strict 3 second chain?<br />
<br />
I tend to find most 3 second chains end up 2.5 really quick with 5 people.  Heck of a lot easier to just reclick the CH as it pops then to try and time a half second delay.<br />
<br />
5 * 2.5 = 12.5. <br />
CH 10 + Spell Gem Reset2.5 =12.5<br />
<br />
Anyway, DI compared to adding a 6th Healer and tightening chain to 2 (really 2.1).  is neglicble vs aow.<br />
<br />
BTW: with a druid as one of the 5.  and on 3 seconds, your increasing the odds of a spike landing as druids lower heal lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you wouldn't mind sharing any idea the hitpoints on AoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">We do AoW with 3-4 clerics.  Our first try we had less than 30 people.  Our prime tank is close to 9kHP, 1700AC and has full defensive AAs.  CH Rot was 3 seconds with a couple spam healers.  Prime tank never dropped below 60% in defensive.  On the pull we had 2 adds being off tanked.  Finished him off with only 1 or 2 deaths during the fight.  With a fully AAd tank, he's really not that hard.<br />
<br />
If you plan on doing tank switches, a few things to keep in mind that will help.  First, when tank switch is called, melees should stop attacking except the next tank in line.  Second, Clerics and Spam healers immediately switch to the next tank in line and start healing.  If other melees get aggro, let them die.  Third, make sure your tanks are saving Furious for the switch.  It gives the Clerics a few seconds leeway on the Rot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">furious sucks!!! never use furious on a tank switch, especially if its a flurry mob because gues what.....flurry and rampage go through furious, however a mob cant flurry on you if youre in fortitude. example, last carprin run on vindor's pull when i engaged i hit furious, he landed a flurry with a lifetap in it and i got one rounded while furious was still running</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lemme further clarify that cause the ramp comment can be interpretted two ways.  What I meant was:<br />
<br />
I've never had a fire proc go through from say Druav or Reparm or have a Rampage message go off while tanking Sol Ro while in Furious.  Once it ends though, well that's another story.  =)<br />
<br />
Actual rampage damage will hit through Furious though.</div></div><hr />

I've only done AoW once, 26 folks 3sec rotation (stonewall) and 2sec (non-sw), with one tank the entire fight.  My necro would manadump the clerics as needed.  We finished the fight and 2 of our clerics basically went OOM after their very last cast, so 2 rounds of 'spam' heals were required at that point.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the regen on AoW is fairly decent, so our numbers are higher than those that have better gear/more toons.  I was under the impression he was 1 million hitpoints.  It is very easy to miss dmg from logs due to range, but the AoW fight, mostly everyone was semi-close to him in one of the deadends, so I doubt I missed too many nukes.  I would've missed dots, but we only had one necro (dunno who else was dotting).</div></div><hr />
