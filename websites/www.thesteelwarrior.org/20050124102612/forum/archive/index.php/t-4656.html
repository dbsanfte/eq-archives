I am currently using this in my offhand with a BoC+Anger3 in my main hand. Would it be worth putting an Anger3 on it, or should I wait and try to get a better sword somewhere?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are having problems holding agro and there are no upgrades in your near future, then go for it.<br />
<br />
If you have pretty good agro or there is a possibility of getting a better weapon in the near future, don't waste the points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it's pretty random(literally) on wether or not I would get another weapon soon or not.<br />
<br />
The way my guild works is if we have the peopel online to kill something we will kill it. If we don't, then I will lead a pickup raid and we will kill it anyway.<br />
<br />
Currently, our biggest guild target is The Great Pumpkin of Kael Drakkel. However, I expect my pickup raids to be moving into Vex Thal and upper end of Tier 3 stuff. I'm not sure if there's any weapons that would be an upgrade worth looting pre-elemental. I would LOVE a Bloodfrenzy, but I dunno if I could justify looting one over a guildmate...and it's a slim chance that I would win the roll on a random for it on one of my pickups.<br />
<br />
Are there any hidden weapons out there that I'm not aware of maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bloodfrenzy is the best warrior weapon you can get before you can kill RZ in Tactics. That's pretty solid justification to me unless you plan to get one of those within the next month or so.</div></div><hr />

Right now I have an augged BoC, unaugged hategiver and augged BBB, and I rarely use anything but my anger 3 augged BBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a pretty decent weapon to augment.  My guild has tried cursed maybe 3 times in all and it hasn't dropped a bf but we have no problems at all holding aggro with augmented swords.  In fact a BoC with anger 3 is pretty much warrior snap aggro.</div></div><hr />
