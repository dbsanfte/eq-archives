<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cemberfrost</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I have a 46 Warrior on the Luclin server, and I just recently found your website.<br />
<br />
I have done very little questing, and am looking to start, but I am having trouble navigating your boards.  I realize the The Keep is regarding quest info., but is there anywhere that has walkthroughs for some of them.  Reading some of the posts on the boards, the Coldain Ring Quest looks interesting, but there are only posts on the last 3 quests, not the first 5.  I know Allakhazam has quest information, but unless you pay the fees, it's not really class specific.<br />
<br />
I don't suppose anyone could point me to an area that would give me walkthroughs on Warrior quests from beginning to end?<br />
<br />
Other than that, great site, even though the mathematical philosophy of taunting and damage mitigation REALLY hurts my head...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alla's has some good info on all the 10 ring quests, starting with Garadain's Blanket (#1) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=934) .  Links to all the other ring quests are contained there.  Also, this (http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/garadainsrings.html)  site has some good info on the first 8 ring quests.  Hope this helps you a bit as far as the ring quest goes.  As far as other quests to consider, look at the Keep area, and see what quests people are asking about.  Usually, these are the ones that are most worth doing.  Also, look at different gear suggestions that are made in the Bunker section of the forum.  Many of those gear items are quested.  I used to keep that section open in one window, with all's open in another, looking up different pieces of gear.<br />
<br />
the mathematical philosophy of taunting and damage mitigation REALLY hurts my head... <br />
<br />
Do not get to worried about the hardcore, indepth aspect of those things.  The basic concepts of only taunting when you loose agro(when skill is maxed anyway), and that more mitigation is good will take you a long way in game.<br />
<br />
BTW, nice to see some one else from Luclin on the boards here, and as we are on same server(and I love meeting new people), feel free to shoot me a tell ingame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqin</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a search on ally's for Warrior 40 to 50 lev and unfortunately there isn't much in the way of quests that are highly desirable.  <br />
<br />
- As you raid planes collect War epic drops.  <br />
- Perhaps begin Coldain ring quests.<br />
- Rallic Pack ?<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several quests for War's mid-50s and up that are worthy: Draconic Pauldrons, Bracer of Benevolence, Iron Cog Earring, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may want to assist a druid and or cleric friend with their 40's quests such as the prayer shaw mobs, then you can hit them up later when you need help in WW ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cemberfrost</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all for the advice!<br />
<br />
I am helping my friends with their shawl quests, hehe. 52 Cleric and 48 Druid.  And no worries about them helping me out when I need it.<br />
<br />
Thank you Redhenna, I will definitely shoot you a tell in game, as I know zero other warriors in Luclin, and am the only active warrior in my guild.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the links to doable quests.<br />
