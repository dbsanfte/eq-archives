Look at the parse I posted on page one to see if the list was accurate...obsidian scim (+25% to proc rate, according to the table) had about 2.5ppm, while anger had about 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a GSo4W and it procs very often compaired with other 2 handers i have used, also i to wonder if the weapons base proc rate effects the augments(nots saying its = to the orignal, im wondering if there is a bonus to it. such as a 2pp min rate gives no bonus, at 1 pp min rate gives a 25 bonus to the base line of the augment to make up for the slow procs, and a high PPM rate may slightly lower the proc rate... just some idea's here about augments having a independant proc rate+ a bonus)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a given proc aug will average out to the same number of procs per min whether put on a cleric hammer with innate proc of 10+ times per minute, or on a standard 2 ppm weapon. So, a 150dd aug'ed GSot4W will get the same number of 150dd procs as if you put the aug in any other weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, it is called random number generator.  EQ's RNG is designed to defeat our brains.  It is designed to make us trigger the pattern matching part and make false conclusions.<br />
<br />
Go to eqtraders, it is weekly that someone will post &quot;OMG THEY NERFED THE DROP RATE ON &lt;insert item&gt;!!!!!!!&quot;  But you will then find 10 to 20 people saying, no, I got a stack yesterday.  Just because you THINK ES procs more, doesn't mean it is so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What it could be I guess is that the because Eartshaker is so slow it's more prone to streakiness (is that a word?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other problem is preception. When you're using Earthshaker, the ONLY reason is for the procs. You're waiting on every swing, hoping for a proc. With your gem axe, you aren't. You just look up and notice it's proced a few times in your chat window. Without a parse decrediting the assumption, I'll go with the extensively parsed common assumption.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it just me or does anyone else think its possible the aug proc rate could be a function of the weapon proc rate.<br />
<br />
Obsidian Shatter procs (surrounded by flickering flames): 1280<br />
Proc damage: 38,400<br />
Proc DPS: 1.233<br />
Procs per minute: 2.467<br />
<br />
Anger 3 Procs (contorts with rage): 942<br />
Procs per minute: 1.815<br />
<br />
Ifir................... 1285, 1.976 / min<br />
Ifir augment ...... 1167, 1.78 / min<br />
GRMK................ 660, 1.01 / min<br />
GRMK augment.... 608, 0.93 / min<br />
<br />
At the very least the aug proc rate is not the standard 2PPM as some think.  Notice the GRMK has less then 1PPM on its aug, which corresponds with the barely more then 1PPM on the weapon.<br />
<br />
But at the same time we have clerics saying thier time hammer when aug'd does not proc nearly as much.<br />
<br />
Possibly...<br />
<br />
where:<br />
WPR = Weapon Proc Rate (Assuming 305 dex) in PPM<br />
APR = Aug Proc Rate (Assuming 305 dex) in PPM<br />
<br />
APR = ( WPR *0.9 &gt; 2.5 ) : APR = 2 + (WPR * 0.1) ? WPR * 0.9<br />
<br />
I doubt its right, but it took me 2 minutes to put it together.<br />
<br />
My point is, I think that APR is a function of WPR up to a certain # of PPM, then it either becomes a static 2 PPM or 2PPM + some small % of the WPR.<br />
<br />
(gonna use VB/BASIC code for ease of understanding)<br />
SIMPLIFIED VERSION:<br />
<br />
IF ( WPR * 0.9 &gt; 2.5 ) THENAPR = 2PPM OR APR = 2PPM + some small % of the WPR ELSEAPR = WPR * 0.9END IF<br />
<br />
Now lets see if you guys can parse something to prove me wrong  :cool:   <br />
<br />
Either way its another possibility that needs to be ruled out.<br />
<br />
EDIT: What we really need is 2 good cleric time hammer parses, one with an aug, 1 w/out. The longer the better, and both must have same Dex for valid results (aka 305dex).<br />
<br />
I think its possible the clerics may be mistaken and its an avenue we need to address before making hypothesis on possibly invalid information.....sort of like what I might have just done &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grud</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tamener, the GRMK has a standard proc rate. The reason it and its aug is at ~1 ppm is because it is in the off hand, which is expected. The fact that the proc rates for aug and weapon are not related (other than the fact that the weapon proc can &quot;block&quot; an aug proc) is evident from the info you quoted above on the OSoW, where the scim procs at ~2.5ppm and the aug procs at ~2ppm. Please look up in the thread at Ciae's post where it is confirmed that with an aug'ed cleric hammer, the aug still procs at the standard rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did overlook the innate proc blocking the aug'd proc. However I'm not ready to assume that augs proc at a base rate. <br />
<br />
I did not miss the statement about the aug on the cleric hammer, if you read my post I ask for a LOG PARSE showing conclusive data.  For a long time people didn't know how this game works, and a lot of great folks here at TSW have used log parses and mathematics to discover how those things work.  I see no point in &quot;taking someone's word for it&quot;, when a parsed log file would be solid evidense.<br />
<br />
So please, if you want to tell me I am wrong prove it.  I want you to! Its something else we can rule out.  Its a step in the right direction. Just saying &quot;it seems to be normal&quot; just isn't good enough.<br />
<br />
I have been looking at raw data for augs for possible proc rates on them, but its sort of hard for me to get a log file of an aug'd cleric hammer...since i am not a cleric, nor am I time flagged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure the aug proc rates have been hashed out .. it may be a beggar to find with a simple search tho.<br />
<br />
Failing that, one of the cheap augs on a Fine Steel Somesuch should be good enough for a parse log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grud</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clerics have parsed this info. You can search EQClerics for the info, they are capable of doing their own parses you know, but they aren't going to get posted on a warrior board. But the even simpler method:<br />
  http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=42197<br />
  Look for the procratemod field. Augs have a proc rate field just like weapons. Satisfied?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tamen said what i was getting at, augs may have their own proc rate, or their own proc rate that is modifired by a script that checks the original state of the weapon</div></div><hr />
