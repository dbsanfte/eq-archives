<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VERMEIL</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking for some input on what type of armor you shoot for.  Currently, at level 54, I'm using an MS build, and as a result, shoot for only  &quot;Armor of the Bear&quot; which has +sta &amp; +str to it.  This keeps my stamina fairly high, along with a respectable strenght score for DPS.  <br />
<br />
However, as I get closer to level 60 I plan on re-specing to a protection build.  If you were in a protection build, would you just go for the plate that had high pluses to stamina, or look for some that has + to defense?<br />
<br />
As always, any input would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I tried to focus on Blue quality items with higher stamina and some Agi with the highest AC. If I go back to protection spec  then of the Bear would be better since Str adds to your Blocked dmg as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

If the combination of the two is better than my current gear I'll put in for it. I totaly disregard most other stats except the odd effect -- most of which are on Trinkets anyway.<br />
<br />
Check out http://relicguild.org/calc.cgi. It has a calculator that gives a basic equivalency between stamina and armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strength and Agility i am not sure about their relative value. The effect of Agility is not very visible and Quantifyable. For now, i choose to rely on strength because i do know what that does. <br />
<br />
Intelligence and Spirit i give absolutely no value at all.<br />
<br />
Taking a look at the warrior set items total bonusses represents pretty well the relative values i give to the stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Value Sta Above all.  As far as STR and AGl, I put high value on each.   Most Valor pieces have STA, STR, AGL in bigger quantities with the emphasis on STA the most...some have spirit.  So, I use this as a guide, maily because of heard alot of warriors say one they get their valor pieces, things get alot better.<br />
<br />
Right now, sta is 230-ish, str is 160-ish, and Agl is 120-ish for me.  I am trying to balance AGL and str a little better to better match the ratio given by a Valor set.<br />
<br />
Some thing's I've noticed since I threw AGL intot he mix is that my crit rate has raised considerably, while my average damage per swing has remained relatively the same(despite losing 30 Strength in leau of +AGL Items).  I also seem to Dodge more.  It feel's like my proc rate has lowered a little since i lost the strength.  Take that last part for what it's worth as I have no number's to confirm that ... it's just the sense that I've gotten the past couple weeks as my thrash blade son't seem to kick in as often when I'm 1hs, nor does my linken sword proc as often as it did when using it or Dual weilding.<br />
<br />
So .. perhaps's STR = Procrate as well as teh other things that have been Identified with it?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I tend to think STA, STR, and AGL are all needed in order to acheive the best results.</div></div><hr />

I tank a lot, so it works for me.  I have almost a full set of Valor, but to tank I wear Warmaster's Leggings and Ornate Adam Breast plate.  Also Handrafted Mastersmith's girdle from UBRS is much better than the Valor belt.  When I'm doing dps/soloing/farming I switch to my Valor BP and legs, bit better str/agi for dps etc.  Also, go STA enchants and AC/reinforce on everything you can.  Sta I think 9 bracer, 7 boots, 7 shield, 100 hps on chest, 70AC on cloak, 40 AC on hands and legs.  (I think that's it)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I usually go for AC and Stamina first and foremost, with +Defense being a close second.<br />
<br />
I have a rough guideline I follow, which works for me (it IS based on some math).  Keep in mind this is based on MY stats, so your guidelines will be slightly different:<br />
<br />
1 Stamina = 25 AC<br />
1 Stamina = 2.3 Defense<br />
1 Defense = 11 AC<br />
<br />
I usually just go with the piece that gives me the the highest &quot;survivability&quot;.   I do a bit of pseudo-mathicating when strength and agility are in the mix as well, but those are something I just play with, I don't have a set guideline.<br />
<br />
Edit (more stuff):<br />
<br />
Agility DOES play a small role in survivability.  Strength affects blocking, but I never really calculate that.  However, both of these stats will affect your threat to some degree, because more DPS = more threat.<br />
<br />
Based on some research from a bit ago, strength will almost always give you a better DPS increase per point on normal attacks.  This doesn't take into account talents that work off of crits, skills that make a great usage of crits (MS for example), and what have you though.  Just something to think about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, spirit use to determine proc rate, but they took that out. Proc rate will no longer be effected by any stat. Strength adds a small bit of block, (pathetically small, and no amount of strength can be considered &quot;protective&quot;). The 100 str buff from crusader proc will raise your block by a whopping 5. Nothing to write home about. Strength is for attack power.<br />
<br />
Now i'll disagree with most posters because I min-max defensively. <br />
<br />
Stamina is nearly useless in non raid situations. Even going for non stamina gear I can get to near 7k full buffs and with an imp pet. The top heal doesn't come close to that unless it's a critical heal. The only time stamina is better than Armor, Defense or agility is if you're fighting straight casters.<br />
<br />
Out of Stamina, Defense, Armor, Agility, and +Dodge/Parry Percentages, stamina is the only one that doesn't increase the value of a heal.<br />
<br />
Since mitigation via armor scales, armor gets less and less useful the more you have. So as you go along just check for what offers the best combination of mitigation/avoidance. <br />
<br />
Things to go by:<br />
<br />
10 Defense = 0.8% Avoidance + Variable (the variable is the 0.4% block it adds, which of course mitigates a varying percentage of the incoming damage)<br />
10 Agility = 0.5% Dodge<br />
Armor scales (always check to see how much an armor gain will effect your mitigation by mousing over)<br />
1% Dodge is always better than 1% Parry (you can not parry a creature behind you)<br />
1% Parry is always better than 1% Block</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree.  That logic ignores non-perfect situations, and they are frequent.  Stamina provides a VERY useful buffer in groups or raids.  Sometimes, that heal is going to be late.  Sometimes, you take a lot more damage than normal.  Sometimes, the shit hits the fan.  Having that extra 1khp could be the difference between the heal landing a few seconds later, and you eating dirt.<br />
<br />
Stamina provides effective survivability no matter how you cut it, just like the other &quot;Defensive&quot; traits.<br />
<br />
Not to say that Defense, Agility, and the rest should be ignored solely for Stamina, but saying that Stamina is &quot;nearly useless&quot; is drastically overstating your point.<br />
<br />
Also, with those hitpoints, I would assume that a fair bit of your gear has stamina.<br />
<br />
Would you give up 25 Stamina for 1% Dodge?  If Stamina is useless, that's a decent trade, yeah?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apologies, the first sentence and second sentence are linked:<br />
<br />
&quot;Stamina is nearly useless in non raid situations. Even going for non stamina gear I can get to near 7k full buffs and with an imp pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason I don't go for stamina gear over other things is stamina is so abundant on most of our gear.  If you have a stamina deficiency then yes, stamina would be useful, but with hp so easily attainable I don't see that being a problem. &quot;Nearly useless&quot; may be intended as a gross overstatement but its to shed light on the fact that going for big numbers isn't going to make you a better tank, perhap worse, in fact. <br />
<br />
Buffer may be nice, and I never turn down extra hp, as a matter of fact with the crappy numbers on the agi and armor librams I still believe the hp libram is the best defensively.  Hp buffer is mainly useful against casters, where forms of mitigation like reistance aren't practical to use as your normal gear.<br />
<br />
In non-perfect situations the other things will help you out as much as hit points will, so I really don't see the point in that. I have 31% avoidance, 15% block and 58% mitigation. If another warrior has 600 more hp than me, or even 1k more hp than me but 20% avoidance (10% dodge/parry each) 10% block and 55% mitigation, odds are i'm going tou outlast them anyway.<br />
<br />
I've done all of the major instances with just a paly as a healer (in 5 man groups), except upper BRS. Not having a true healer and making every one of those paladin heals count for more means something. I've really noticed a difference since I crunched the numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough.  I can't argue that most of our gear is stamina heavy anyway, so I understand what you mean about not being &quot;Stamina focused&quot;.<br />
<br />
Regardless of how you feel about hitpoints, disregarding Agility, Defense, and + to Parry and Dodge is asking for trouble (from a defensive perspective) no matter how you cut it.  For that matter, giving up a large rating in any of those for a small rating in another is probably just going to hurt you.<br />
<br />
Do you have any parses Granite, or did you arrive at those conclusions through straight number crunching?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only have a few items I'm after left to get, once I get those maybe i'll put together a set of valor, get my hands on a parser and compare the valor to my self-constructed set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Stamina is nearly useless in non raid situations.&quot; <br />
<br />
Quoted for truth.  You need enough hp for most PvE situations to where your healer dosen't have to panic.  For PvP, you need as much as you can get without crippling your damage or crit rate.<br />
<br />
Really, there are about 4 different types of &quot;regular&quot; plate late game.<br />
<br />
Heavy armor + defense<br />
Stat plate<br />
All around + crit<br />
All around + defense<br />
<br />
The all around + defense stuff (Golem skull helm, stonegrip gauntlets for instance) is probably the overall best stuff to go for.  You don't get too much of an overall damage reduction from the heavy armor plate, but you do lose out badly on stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tinuvas</div><div class="date">03-16-2005, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just going by mouse-overs, though i'd love to use a good parser to test some stuff out. Avoidance % being dodge+parry.<br />
<br />
Another question: How do you usually rate agility vs. stamina?  Or do you pretty much make a straight comparison?<br />
<br />
To give an idea of what I use now:<br />
<br />
1 Stamina = 2.3 Defense (.18% avoidance +variable(block))<br />
1 Agi = 0.05% Avoidance<br />
<br />
So for me, I would usually say 1 Stamina is roughly equal to 3-4 Agility.<br />
<br />
Now that I write it down, it looks a little off.</div></div><hr />
