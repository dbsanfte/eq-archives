Let me just say...this thing is the greatest.  Just for a little test run I jumped into to PoJ and kicked a few rats around.  The thing proc'd in the first 10-20 secs on all the mobs I pounded on.  I was able to kill 3 rats before I needed to stop to regen LOL.</div></div><hr />

I have it stored in my Fabled Evil-Eye bag...Nice and soft and cushy...no breakage LOL.  I actually noticed about a tic per kill on the rats regular xp...heading back with my fellow cleric for some duo action :).  I pulled out my Fabled Executioner Axe after its slowed though so even less chance of breakage hehe.</div></div><hr />

Mob there only get partial slows anyways. other than a few fights where they resisted till very end it worked out fairly well with the cleric healing.  Not the best setup but it does do the job.  We only had to break for med breaks like every 20 to 30 mobs, and cleric was brand new EP flagged, that night in fact.</div></div><hr />

That rocks!  I hoped for some good mileage out of this weapon, I'd stick an anger aug in it and tank with it if the DPS was a bit better :).  PoE mobs are very magic resistant and the proc has a +25 on it as well.  If you could make it work there for slows, that's nice.</div></div><hr />

With a fungi(or that kickass regen BP from Riwwi) you are your own group...can kick some major ass in places like Droga, all by your lonesome.</div></div><hr />
