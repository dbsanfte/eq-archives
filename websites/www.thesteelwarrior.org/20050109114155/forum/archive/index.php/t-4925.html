<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im fucking sick of all the effort i put in to upgrades in my gear just because i am agnostic, back when i started 4 years ago the general thinking was go agnostic to be open to more quests.<br />
<br />
then they 180 on that line of thinking and fuck all the agnostics because they dont follow a god that gets killed every 18 hours across the servers, really how fucking powerful can their gear be from normal if they are dead half the time?<br />
<br />
case and point, heraldic. <br />
<br />
zek armor has better stats and a lower trival number than fine heraldic.<br />
<br />
now i can understand the stats being lower... if the gods where as powerful as they are made out to be, how can the god be lending power to hundreds of suits of armor if they are pulling their ass back on after a guild just beat the shit out of them.. at that point i think their armor should revert to fine heraldic untill the god comes back.<br />
<br />
what i dont understand if the higher fail rate of fine heraldic over other types, one would think that it would be harder to channle devine will into a suit of armor.<br />
<br />
more over, if that warrior over there, you know, the steriotype fat ass that follows zek, goes out and kills his own god, shouldnt that armor fall off of him or some shit? he is no worse than I, at least i didnt go up and give my god the fucking middle finger<br />
<br />
more so why are vah shir said to be agnostic? if you read the books in PoK, do the quest around the citys (shar vahl, kejek, kerran) they do beleave in a spirit realm with multipule gods, why is there only 1 polytheistic religion in EQ?<br />
<br />
anyhow i guess the point of my rant is so that they devs know that i am flipping them off simply because i have no decent armor progression, its coldain, skyshrine, ornate for us godless people, no middle ground between skyshrine and ornate, while the ass scratching ogre who takes part in a zek stomping party once a week gets a nice progression thanks to heraldic.<br />
<br />
now i know there is fine heraldic i can get, but smiths never make the damn stuff because of the higher fail rate... so basically you cant get it on Emar that much<br />
<br />
excuse my pissy mood on this but it makes me angry on how bad it sucks to get armor if you arnt the steriotype warrior</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;what i dont understand if the higher fail rate of fine heraldic over other types, &quot;<br />
<br />
I have no clue why this is. Then again, it could be worse. You could be an iksar and stuck wearing chain mail. Or you could be a troll smith, with nothing but weapons to make.<br />
<br />
&quot;goes out and kills his own god, shouldnt that armor fall off of him or some shit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Some RP type is probably going to come on and say well that's what Rallos would have wanted ... someone to face him in battle ... but you've got a point, there should be some sort of penalty somewhere for killing the representation of your GOD on the material plane. Nothing too harsh. It's just, if there's going to be a REWARD for worshipping a specific god (CT snare neck, Quellious PAC neck, Tribunal plate mail, etc.), there should be a similar penalty for doing something AGAINST that god.<br />
<br />
&quot;more so why are vah shir said to be agnostic?&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess the best explanation I can offer on this question, and it's a very valid question, is this:<br />
<br />
The Vah Shir worship the spirit realm ... sort of a far more primitive religion that puts its faith in the powers of a more amorphous spirit realm of animal totems and their power.<br />
<br />
This is, sadly, not very well thought out. And of course, oversimplifies primitive religions.<br />
<br />
My best advice for your armor woes would be to look towards Ornate. It's far too expensive to purchase, imo, but camping it would be a nice option.</div></div><hr />

edit, well i chose a vah shir because its alot like me heh, the whole attuide &quot;high and mighty&quot; you might say ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barja Bardagi</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My human SK helped discover a lot of the Heralid armor pieces.  Heck, my partner and I are responsible for all but 1 piece of the Fetid.   The Triv and success rates between Fine Heraldic and the Imbued Heraldic series have always been the same... Ever since the May 8th patch they were introduced.  So that part of what you stated is incorrect.<br />
<br />
As for not smithing the Fine, I know I don't cause no one ever buys it... I take rare orders for it from folks, but on the whole, I don't smith it unless someone asks specifically for it.  It's not worth the cost compared to the stats, IMHO.<br />
<br />
As for your complaints on how powerful the gods can be if they keep getting killed by guilds - Quit confusing game mechanics with game mythology.  It doesn't work.<br />
<br />
And yes, I'm a stereotypical fatass ogre who follows Rallos and wears Fierce.  Guess what?  I was a 250 smith making the armor and my guild needed a new MT.  Bite me.</div></div><hr />

You are going to get most RZ worshippers telling you they are hardcore rpers, crafted all their own FH armor, and if you do not like it to stfu and reroll (irony in light of the recent mellee hanges). Not to mention their sob stories about Butcherblock back in the day.<br />
<br />
Just the way people act when they get an advantage in this game. No its not only secluded to knights :). And seeing as 90% of the warriors in Everquest are now hard core RPers that chose Rallos Zek, well you are going to get very little support from anywhere. Just deal I guess...</div></div><hr />

Of course, if you really wanted to bitch about something involving armor, back in those days when the FIRST cultural came out, try finding a Shaman who actually BOUGHT Imbue:Jade.<br />
<br />
 And of course, the new Ykesha I'd like to own....guess how many Troll GM Smiths there are on my server. TWO, one of whom is on hiatus. Whereas any monkey can slap together Fine Heraldric. Don't start on Fierce because I own exactly ONE piece - a bracer.<br />

 Hate cookie-cutter bullshit Warriors. /grumble</div></div><hr />

Get a good guild, put in some work, and it'll pay off.<br />
<br />
As for killing your own god or what not, heck... if I remember right (been awhile) when ya kill Mith Marr his projection in your mind smiles at you and says you have a spot reserved in the Halls of Honor for your victory over him.  It's part of the story (though a crap ass story, but a story none the less).<br />
<br />
Personally... I'd just love to see GM's come back out again like they did before Kunark's release as some of the main characters of EQ and actually tell a story of what's going on instead of some gay voice inside your head telling me to go to my hometown.  Alas, Brad and friends are gone...<br />
<br />
I ramble.... none the same, it ain't as bad as you set it out to be.  Ya either buck up and move ahead or you can stand where you are and let yourself get knocked down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was all nice and stuffs generally, since I got less hassle from most good aligned races. Then, after some hiatus and playing other characters, came Fierce Heraldic and I was screwed in armor progression ... wtf ?<br />
<br />
Seriously, how many hunts in Velius now ?<br />
Not to mention Plane of Hate for planar armor ?<br />
Oooo .. or how about Cobalt armor ?<br />
<br />
Thank god for LDoN and Miragul armor, that's about the only way to go for agnostics now, which is pretty sad. Heck, agnostic is a &quot;religious&quot; direction too, why not have cultural armor for only agnostics ?</div></div><hr />

You can go and get your points in EF like I did, or go to HoT and get some armor there. My gear is a mix between Miragul and Myrmidon and some pieces, no Ornate (never won a freaking roll thanks to casters rolling on my molds when I never rolled on a rune).<br />
You may even go to Nro and get the armor there (thats what Im planning for some of my SS pieces to replace with).<br />
I really wouldnt care less about RZ and anyone that worships him and their armor.</div></div><hr />

We warriors with lame cultural armor (Brell) came up short versus all the HUGE HP cultural, but we 're ok now.</div></div><hr />

I have written often on Everlore board about being a RZ worshipping Ogre to power game. Been shot down everytime because OBVIOUSLY every warrior has PoT gear already, yeah righhhhhttt!<br />
My guild couldn't kill Vindy, n/m anything big. I play a few hours a week max, and I could get in big guilds and get all the armor rotting. I would start so many points down on the DRP system I would get jack. Plus I would never be able to play enough due to RL issues. Most warriors are in your boat, look at some of the magelos posted here. I easily broke 4k hps at level 52.....<br />
Keep the lie going though and tell everyone how you can raid 6 times a week, 12 hours a day, in that big guild just dying to add its 19 warrior (DC on Tunare has or had 18 Warriors) to get that gear!<br />
It is easier to start over than get the gear! Or buy molds, prepare to farm plat a whole lot, cause on my server its camped 24/7 by the ones with no life but EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So true, I am in the exact same boat as you (rolled all my life in velks, OS, BOT for items I could use but never rolled on a spec or rune). And if you read the caster boards before the changes came live they were giddy about being able to roll against mellee for tomes. Fucking greedy sons of bitches.</div></div><hr />

 That's funny cuz when *I* started 4 years ago I was told picking a diety would make a meaningful difference and allow me to do stuff an agnostic couldn't. Then they did a 180 on THAT line of thinking and made Agnostic the unquestioned best choice=P<br />

 I never liked the fact that RZ armor was *that* much better than the pussy polesmoking god armor, though it should be a touch better. I just hate when people argue that there was never meant to be any advantage to having a God and not being a pussy faction whore. There *WAS* supposed to be an advantage to picking certain Gods. And of every possible class/Diety combo none fits better than a RZ warrior, except maybe a Bristlebane rogue.<br />
<br />
 When I made Grimmlokk I read the diety descriptions, my only info on them at the time. It said, and I quote directly from the game, &quot;Rallos Zek is the god of war, if you are a warrior and don't chug cock you pick him because every other God will make you a flower-picking nancy-boy who is fruity and also not straight and manly like a beef jerky carving of Clint Eastwood.

Unquestionable? As a Dark elf warrior I have yet to find a significant difference in faction anywhere in the old world between agnostic and rallos zek. In fact<br />
I believe RZ has better faction in velious. My RZ test warrior can still go to the exact same places my agnostic can.    <br />

You probably haven’t tried to do any quests then, worshiping Rallos Zek gives you hard cap on some factions that no matter how hard you try and change it you will never get any higher than indifferent.</div></div><hr />

A warrior raising any faction back in the day for quests was pretty much beating your head against a wall.

what about the races that are forced augnostic, or if the ones where picking a god means everyone on norrath gang bangs you at a low level?<br />

Of course they can't worship RZ. But it's dumb they can't worship some of the shitty Gods like Xegony or Erollisi or Rishard Simmons. Even if you could worship them you'd still bitch about the armor though.<br />
<br />
 Really no reason every warrior shouldn't be allowed to worship RZ if fucking wood elves can.<br />
<br />
or if the ones where picking a god means everyone on norrath gang bangs you at a low level?<br />
<br />
 If you're not willing to face somje opposition to worship Rallos the great and powerful you aren't wanted within his ranks, Suzie. You should welcome confrontation.<br />
<br />
 If you're talking about other Gods, no one cares. They're all pole smokers. CT and Inny are just pansy versions of RZ. God of Fear? Hate? WTF kinda sissy shit is that to worship? May as well worship the God of Hangnails or Skinned Knees.<br />
<br />
 My pragmatic side says you should have had the choice to worship RZ. My literal side knows even if you could have you wouldn't have chosen to, so this whole thread is stupid. People who only choose RZ for the armor, or who cry their heads off now because they didn't choose him before, are shitboxes. Rallos doesn't want you bandwagon riding fucks. He knows you don't thirst for blood and the survival of the fittest! You just want to wear something fancy and fit in, Rallos in fact hates you and your whole family. He told me you should all re-start as bards who worship Harvey Firestien. Yeah that's right Rallos talks to me. He says you should wear tighter panties(Fine Heraldic Thong anyone?) to keep all that loose sand in your collective vaginas(vaginii?).<br />

not entirely true, they lost connection with the old spirits, and had to learn to retune themselves to the spirits of the moon<br />
<br />
i would worship RZ because i kill everything that doesnt kiss my ass, a freeport guard said &quot;you want some of this&quot; and he smacked his blade on his shield. i said &quot;insolent paladin dildo, fear me!&quot; and then i smacked the crap out of him, and used his helm to cook his liver for my dinner HAH!

I was born four and a half years ago, as a Wood Elf warrior worshiping Karana. No heraldic armor for me, no sir. Thunderous you say? Human and Half Elf aye, but not for me, no. Non deity heraldic? Sorry but there was better. And in truth, I was wearing mostly warlords by then.<br />
<br />
Then the bonds that sheltered Jaggedpine from the rest of Norrath were broken. Oh wow Karana follower quests. By the time I had the faction to do any of them, PoP released and I was working for better.</div></div><hr />
