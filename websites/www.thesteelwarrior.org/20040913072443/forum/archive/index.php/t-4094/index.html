<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you check EQAtlas.com, on the east freeport map, you'll see the building marked 17. Hallard's Resales with Merchants selling Various Weapons<br />
<br />
The Warrior Epic quest guys are in that section of town. Stay up on the ledge, don't go &quot;down&quot; into it. You'll see them near a tent on the ledge, upper part, of the area.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">every now and than too Wenden and Co. are at the zoneline between EFP and WFP.<br />
<br />
usually it's an errant training from someone KOS who aggro's a guard and ends up attacking Wenden ( /whistles innocently )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like to call that part of freeport the slums. Although really, freeport is like one big ghetto. You should be able to sneak in through the underground. I did this before i had an invis item and only had to deal with one unlucky guard &gt;:) Id probably be tolerated (agnostic DE) but knocking slate around was too tempting ;)</div></div><hr />
