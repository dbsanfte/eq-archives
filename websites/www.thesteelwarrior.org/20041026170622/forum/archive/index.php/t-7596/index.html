<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are new armor sets coming to ldon which will be elemental-calibre. The price cap at 1452 will be raised, to what I don't know.<br />
Raaj, TSW<br />

<br />
They will also be adding some elemental/time quality gear to the ldon vendors allowing anyone casual players who do ldons to have access to some of the same level equipment as raiding players.<br />
Gemdiver, Gaffe's<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not honestly sure which dev stated that we will be adding Elemental level armor to the adventure merchants, but for right now this is a rumor and not a fact. There are no plans to add any elemental armor at this time. This doesn't mean we won't add some in the future, but it hasn't been discussed yet, as far as I know.<br />

So which is it? Are you going to require everyone to farm the elemental named to get gear in the near future? Or you going to let the casuals into GoD?</div></div><hr />

*shrug* Raiders will have two routes available to them to arrive at the same goal, either they raid or they LDoN, or maybe even a combo of both.  LDoNers won't raid though, because that's one of the things that distinguishs them from raiders (at least not more than an occassional raid).<br />
<br />
Seriously though, if SoE has any sense at all, and I'm not always sure they do, the raiders will still be getting significantly better gear in GoD and OoW than what could be acquired in LDoN.  And the number of missions required to buy the armor in LDoN will still be prohibitively time consuming and the vast majority of people just won't do it.  Whether or not SoE realizes it, they are bringing progress for a pretty significant chunk of their player base to a slow grinding halt.  Most people don't have the 1400 point armor and many don't see any hope of ever getting it.  So why do they think people will be working on getting armor that, while better, is even more time consuming to acquire?  Sorry, but SoE needs to catch the clue train before it's too late.  Seriously.</div></div><hr />

It'll be 16 months of grinding (ish) in LDoN for the complete outfit anyway I expect, assuming that the grindee finds efficient groups and plays 4 - 6 hours a night - and truly could use the upgrade.  That'd be for the pieces and the augments to bring it up to near EP quality.<br />
<br />
I would have liked to see a progression in LDoN that not only included different MOB variants and loot tables, but different maps and even mission times.  Easy, low level missions on small maps in short times for low points at 20, up to large and complex maps with longer mission times and more points at 65.  Factor in a level + points total to *progress* through the various LDoN stages mebbe.  It would have been enough to help give the feeling that one was progressing through something - not just a nightly trawling for a Tak group to work up to Royal armour for ... eh ... some reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree there should be a progression.  That's how the game has always worked.  You gear up to where you can handle the next bigger encounter you couldn't handle in your previous gear.<br />
<br />
I also think that there should be multiple forms of progression.  LDoN is another form of progression.  I feel that there should be bigger armors in LDoN, but to balance it with the rest of the content in the game I don't feel that points you can earn levels 20-65 should be the very same type of points that you can put towards elemental quality armors.  Level recommendations on the armors and the small amount of points awarded kinda enforce this already if you start LDoN at an early level.  Later though, when everyone's level 65 (and soon level 70), there's really no more progression through level limits on the items.  There should be.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to have a new tier to LDoN.  Level 70 adventures, with a level 70 high risk counterpart.  The level 70 adventures would follow the same design as the previous level tiers, in that a regular 70 adventure would be the same as a 65 high risk in difficulty, with a 70 high risk above that.  Preferabley bringing in a new sixth theme as well for a little more variety.  New elemental sized armor, purchasable by points gained from level 70 adventures only (regular and high risk).  Double the point cost over the current high LDoN armor.  Also, make it so that you can't start, or join in on, any level 70 adventures (regular and high risk) until you've maxed your adventurer's stone from the previous LDoN adventure themes.  Have a quest NPC that requires your &quot;maxed&quot; stone, giving you a flag for the level 70 adventures.  The NPC also returns you a similar adventure stone (same stats as the maxed one you gave the NPC obviously) that has the ability to grow a little bigger through your number of wins in the new sixth theme.<br />
<br />
No bazaar equiped group can just &quot;blow&quot; through level 65 high risk adventures like they can normals.  Even full LDoN/ornate equiped can't just &quot;blow&quot; through them.  And it will be super tedious and a huge time sink for them to do level 70 normals till they get elemental quality armor.  It would be better off for them to upgrade to the current high end LDoN armors or the slightly smaller ornate to help secure consistant success in level 70 normals.  And yes, someone not very geared could be led through these adventures by much higher equiped people and have a more easy road if they know the right people.  But that's no different than how a lot of people opperate in guilds as well.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember the time frame someone calculated a while back as to how long it will take someone to get a full set of fully auged LDoN armor?  Wasn't it something like 2 adventures a day for 2 years or something outrageous like that?  It was on this board before the move from EZboard.<br />
<br />
Elemental quality armors are gonna cost more for sure.  Even without my idea above, it's definatly gonna take longer than 8 months of farming to get fulls sets of the stuff.  Full sets of stuff that won't be the top end armor of the game.  Full sets of armor that will be comparable to the best armor from 4 expansions ago once OoW is released (PoP, LDoN, GoD, OoW).  Time offers uprades, GoD armor is bigger, OoW armor will be bigger.  It's gonna take people a long time to get full sets of elemental quality LDoN armor even without the timesink I suggested above.  And people are worried this is gonna step on the e-penis they created in 8-months 4 expansions ago once OoW is here?  Come on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know for a fact it will, because the very idea of suggesting that LDoN progression should be faster has lots of raiders up in arms already.  I know this from an ongoing thread over on MB.  People who have put in their time to get to the top and jumped through the hoops required of them are almost invariably against the concept of anyone having it even the slightest bit easier, even if their rewards aren't going to be as good.  Just seems to be human nature, don't ask me why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I doubt the point of this thread was originally about whether or not elemental LDoN gear is or is not a good idea.<br />
<br />
The point is that Sony STILL is not communicating, either with its playerbase or internally.  People at the summit, who btw seemed to leave very cheery and optomistic, were told certain things.  Those things are now &quot;rumors&quot;.  WHAT do you mean rumors?  You fuggin' told players about it at the summit.  If you want to later pass the shit off as a rumor, then don't make claims at your little happy-huggy pow-wow. <br />
<br />
It's simply not okay to justify the bad content by claiming it was a communication problem, make promises to the players at the summit, and renege on those promises in the cheapest way possible - claiming its all a &quot;rumor&quot; while neglecting to mention that Sony started it. <br />
<br />
But, hey, that was just my take.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">they haven't reneged on any proimises yet.  Expecting something from brenlo at a summit just a few weeks ago to have filtered through all the devs or even CS reps is absurd.  in 2-4 months we'll know if they have reneged on it all.<br />
<br />
as for skipping shit, meh my guild didn't tuch luclin straight from velious/kunark to pop/ep</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">they haven't reneged on any proimises yet.

<br />
<br />
It doesn't take 2-4 months to meet and discuss the comments made by Sony employees at the summit and then, if one is really ambitious, prepare and circulate a memorandum detailing those statements.  <br />
<br />
The players are all on the same page and we come from different classes, servers, and backgrounds.  Why can't the loony toons over there in Sony headquarters get their ducks in a row?  <br />
<br />
I don't doubt that in 3 months or a year or however long you wanna give these guys your life, they'll figure something out.  My point was simply this:  They promised communication  and one of their first public acts on a board identified that promise as fictional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Or heck, point your emplyees at the EQLive site and from there the links it has to the various reports.
