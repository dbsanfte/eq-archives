<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>grobsmashprexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From what I have read that most other classes have problems with the fact that warriors can not take agro right off the bat.  I think something that could be a fix for this and not upset the balance of the game to much would be to give warriors a new ability that procs 500 hate.  Make it a effect that can not be dispelled and last a hour that way it can only be used once per fight.  Have a short refresh timer on it so that it can be used on every mob or every couple mobs in a fight.  So basicly it would be a epic proc to start the fight with I do not think that would be to over powering and if it is they can lower it some.  They could make it a class ability warriors get at level 40 and scale the amount of hate it causes up from there.</div></div><hr />

That is by design :) it's the whole purpose of aggro control.<br />
<br />
there are 2 camps those that want increased aggro (the lazy people whi don't want to have ot use skill (( I know big stereotype there sorry))<br />
<br />
and those that want knight aggro brought down a bit. (those who like the challenge and still believe in aggro control by the group and not the MT)<br />
<br />
<br />
I am of the second camp and I am a knight I belive my aggro spells should be toned down on the amount of aggro they use and the mana cost for them raised a bit, to bring us into balance with warriors. I prefer skill as opposed to just hitting auto attack making a macro to stun mobs and going afk to watch soaps :p<br />
<br />
Either way SoE needs to do something. What they do is anyone’s guess only they know what they are planning or talking about.<br />
<br />
I just hope they make some changes soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not really a fair comparison, im sure a 52 warrior with a BoC/SoD combo would pull agro from a 57 knight. Ofcourse if somebody is twinked (better equipped than their peers) they're going to draw agro, but a twinked 52 monk wouldn't out agro a twinked 57 warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>judorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I once had a magicain. He once had mod rods. Basically 2-3 mag's could supply endless mana to a raid force. I was needed I was desired. Then they changed mod rods...<br />
<br />
I now have a warrior. Who doesn't have problems getting/holding aggro IF everyone plays a certain style. But it is not none stop chain pulling slow/nuke all you want group. Because I can not generate endless aggro.<br />
<br />
SK's are fine. Palidens on the other hand can generate endless agro. I have tested this many times. No matter what i do I can not take aggro for more than a seconded or two. A lvl 65 wizard can maintian a DPS upwards of 160's if not higher just because of a palidens ability to generate aggro through spells and resisted ones help with this.<br />
<br />
You can bet having a class that trivalizes 99.9 percent of the encounters for everday EQ(grinding) will be nerfed. They can not allow one class to be able to have this on spells that were never intended to work this way.<br />
<br />
I just hope there are some palidens left when they do, because guess what it will make the game less fun for them and all the others used to playing that style.<br />
<br />
I know it did on my retired magicain</div></div><hr />
