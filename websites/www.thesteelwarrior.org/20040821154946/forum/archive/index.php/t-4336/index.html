I had a chance  to verify  the  difference in aggro abilities between Pally's and Warriors last night.<br />
<br />
The scenario is the same for  both runs in ldon TAK  dungeon.<br />
first misson kill 60<br />
Group: 56 Ranger, 57 Cleric, 56 Chanter, 57 Wizard, 56 Necro, and a 57 Pally.<br />
Mission 1<br />
mission completed in 46 mins. Proceed after  completeion to wipe every living thing  in dungeon<br />
during this mission problems  with  aggro were  almost none existant. The  Pally  held aggro with out special consideratons. I was able to  cast ensnare the  moment the pulled  was  called. Only 3 times  in the course  of this adv.  did I wind up with aggro and that was my fault due to an ill timed nuke, and was easily remedied by casting cinder aggro went  straight  back  to  Pally.  Only once did  the Wizard get aggro from an ill timed  nuke(nuking while the  mobs is being  pulled) needless  to say a great  run.<br />
<br />
Mission 2 Tak dungeon kill 59<br />
Group is the same players with one change  we had a 57 Warrior instead of the  Pally<br />
Mission completed in 78 mins. group wants to take a break after win<br />
Aggro was an absolute nightmare on this one I couldn't cast ensnare untill mob was below 50% health even then I had a high  chance of  pulling aggro. In the situations when I got aggro casting  cinder jolt had missed results  aggro lost  mob goes  after  wizzy or cleric. there was no way in this fight that I could even think of  using any nukes. The Wizzy couldn't nuke untill mob was below 40% health due to aggro problems. the cleric  pulled aggro several times with  CH which was not a problem with the Pally Tanking.  All in all during this dungeon every member of the group got aggro more than once. The very dynamics of  play changed considerably.  Do Warriors have a Class Balance  problem? Based on this I have  to  say  yes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is where most knights come in and say, &quot;no! it's balanced, because Warriros get to tank high end bosses!&quot;<br />
<br />
This problem has been more then obvious for years,<br />
yet still so many either refuse to see it, or don't see it for odd reasons...</div></div><hr />
