<br />
Velium Gemmed Longsword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26880) x 2<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Velium Gemmed Great Sword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26894)<br />
<br />
I guess my real question here is if there is a formula to figure out theoretical dps on two 1-handers and a formula on a 2-hander?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on your AA's.  Should we assume you have all of them?  Even Sinister Strikes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine that since they scale in a linear fashion you could just use the base stats for a base comparision.<br />
<br />
primary(DMG+DB)/DLY + .5(secondary DMG/DLY) for the dual wield setup.<br />
<br />
(16+13)/20 + .5(16/20) = 2.25<br />
<br />
The .5 accounts for a 50% dual wield &quot;fire rate&quot;. I'm unsure if this is correct or not. This also doesnt account for double attack on either hand. However, if I understand the way the formula would scale, it should still be fairly linear. Then again, I could be smoking crack, since I never was too good at math.<br />
<br />
For the 2Her, it should go something like this. Using the formula for primary damage.<br />
<br />
(34+35)/28 = 2.46<br />
<br />
This assumes a damage formula that is the same for 1H weapons and 2H weapons, which may not be this case. I they are since 2H has a larger DMG and DB than 1H.<br />
<br />
Considering the fact that the weapons are all made to the same scale (approximate damage) and that 2H seems to be the defacto DPS setup, you can see that the item designer accounted for this and made the 2H come out ahead on pure damage compared to the 1H.<br />
<br />
IMO, go with the greatsword it you are choosing on pure DPS.</div></div><hr />

Nope, I'm just now finishing up my durability AA's, so nope.  ;/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the difference in dps between those 2 options are negligible for a warrior doing dps duty on a raid. For me, I'd keep the 2hander for dps. That would leave you 2 weaps to sell instead of just 1 .. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greatstaff of the Four Winds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed, Greatstaff will own both alternatives mentioned.<br />
<br />
If you have absolutely no offensive AA's, I am guessing that the 2 handed velium sword would come out on top of the dual wield setup.  Dual wield needs a lot of AA's to produce good damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at lvl 65 with the 1Her available to us we get better DPS with 2H than DW<br />
and we can make some group order of DPS (with a coarse internal group order) :<br />
<br />
1. top DPS<br />
Great Maul of the Mighty<br />
Staff of Shattered Dreams<br />
Halberd of Endless Pain<br />
Lodestar<br />
<br />
2. exelent DPS<br />
Cranial Bludgeoner<br />
Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair<br />
Stone Etched War Sword<br />
Blade of War<br />
<br />
3. decent DPS<br />
Demerix the Painsipper + Jagged Onyx Staff Wailing Coral Staff<br />
Ornate Greatblade<br />
Greatstaff of the Four Winds<br />
Bloodied Berserker's Blade<br />
Fabled Razing Sword of Skarlon<br />
Velium Gemmed Great Sword<br />
The Sword of Ssraeshza<br />
Anathema<br />
...<br />
<br />
4. sub part DPS (but still good for PoP beginner)<br />
Plankton Laced Greatsword<br />
War Marshall's Bladed Staff<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder<br />
Windblade<br />
Obsidian Greatblade<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
Note : this list is not complete but it helps to evaluate the eproximative DPS value of 2Her. I have put what we can expect of top DPS from a DW user but didn't ever try to scale down other DW combo within theese groups. And don't forget that Haste, AA, position, lvl of mob, ... affect greatly DPS output thus it's hard to give a true DPS score to wepons or combos.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you guys rate the Fabled Executioners Axe?  Just curious cuz I have one and I use it over my WMBS any time I have haste that will not be overwritten by the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like much speaking about DPS to score a weapon because it is hightly dependent on your stat, the mob, and your position. moreover I never consider procs in dps estimation because their aren't reliable on exp group (short fight) nor on heavy resists mob. but for this time I will try to give you an answer.<br />
<br />
Well, you don't have WA1and you have 36% worn haste, this give you at best a global haste of 66% (ie you proc uniformly on long fight with no overlaping procs. this give 36s of 86%  haste and 24s of 36% haste  at best, that is averaged to 66%).<br />
this result must becompared to other weapons wielded with only 36%  haste and no domaging proc (to ease the rcomparaison). doing so I get that you should approximatly output the same dps with your fabled exe axe than with a SEWS or a BoW.<br />
but remember it's an approximation made on your stat with best luck. and don't forget that this don't give you the same aggro than the weapons I sited above!<br />
<br />
Yoda.<br />
<br />
EDIT : I did see you were only lvl 63, that should change a bit the result but that that much (DB at lvl 63 is still colse to the one at lvl 65).<br />
<br />
EDIT : EDIT: yes the result is still reliable.</div></div><hr />

thanks for your thougths<br />
You rate the velium gemmed as decent<br />
and the WMBS as sub par<br />
I have the  WMBS and was thinking of buying the <br />
velium gemmed great sword/or Hammer(the one that has the same stats)<br />
depending on looks  do you have any stats on what the increase in DPS is?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somewhat redundantly, since others have answered the same way, I'd be slightly inclined to go with the 2h option. Also, if I had a decent 2h dps weapon already, then before I spent fantastic amounts of plat on upgrading it to a slightly higher dps weapon, I'd take a long hard look at whether or not I could use that plat to improve my armor. This is especially true if the whole reason I'm looking at dps is that I'm not one of the top five tanks on the raid. Better dps is not going to get you into the top five tanks in your guild. Better armor and aggro weapons will do much more in that direction, so I'd really put more resources into that.<br />
<br />
Of course it's a very good idea to have a legitimate non-aggro dps set up. Bad things can happen if you have an aggro set up for dps and assume that because the MT has a &quot;better&quot; aggro set up you're okay: the rng will give you some &quot;lucky&quot; procs at some point and you'll gank the MT's aggro at the wrong time.<br />
<br />
EQ is 5ish years old and there are lots of servers and people raiding 24/7. So somewhere, at some point, it's possible that the dps output of the 7th tank on a raid saved the raid. It's also possible that you will be stung by a bee while you are playing EQ, and have a fatal allergic reaction but that before the bee venom can kill you, lightening will strike you dead.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when you are not the main tank you have to get in front of the mob anyway. If you are using DW, and the mob ripostes, then at that point you are higher maintence than if you are using a 2-hander. If you already own three weapons (a dps DW combo and a dps 2Hander) then as frostpaw pointed out, you can sell the two DW weapons.</div></div><hr />

I will give a bit on the dps if the hps are resists are good.   On many raids most of the healers are so focused on the MT and mt rot that I will not get healed in time, so what keeps me alive are resists and hps. with the 2 1handers you have a total of 60 resist to fire, cold and magic plus 160 hps campared to  42 resist and 100 hps.   Just something to keep in mind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuzzee</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also have a Fabled exe axe... and when I'm not tanking, that's the only thing I use.   Amazing DPS and I don't even have any offensive AA's.  Never parsed it, but you can ask the people in the arena in the bazaar how effective it is. =).  Almost everyone I've fought in the arena always asks for the axe and even some EP+ people were impressed with it.  So I'd say Fabled exe axe &gt; WMBS definitely.  As long as you don't try to tank with it (which i also do sometimes if we don't have rogues/BL's in group.)</div></div><hr />
