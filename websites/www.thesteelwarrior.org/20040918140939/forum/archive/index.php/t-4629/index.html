Wild Pitches<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
By Jayson Stark<br />
ESPN.com<br />
<br />
  <br />
Revenge of the week<br />
When some guys hit two home runs in a game, they say it was because they kept their front shoulder tucked, they just happened to get good wood on the ball or, if they really get creative, it was &quot;just one of those nights.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Suffice it to say you'll never see a quote like that in Week in Review.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because there are men like Phillies center fielder Doug Glanville.<br />
<br />
Last Friday, he hit two home runs against his former teammate, Curt Schilling, in Schilling's first start against the Phillies since they traded him last July.<br />
<br />
  <br />
Doug Glanville and Travis Lee will remain happy teammates as long as they stay away from the video games. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now the previous four men to hit two homers in a game off Schilling were Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Mike Piazza and Barry Bonds. So it's not as if just anybody can step up there and do it.<br />
<br />
And how did Doug Glanville explain this performance? This is what he told the Philadelphia Inquirer's Bob Brookover minutes after he and the Phillies had dealt Schilling his first loss of the year:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Curt's a friend of mine,&quot; Glanville said. &quot;We used to play video games together. He killed one of my characters one time. I never forgot that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This, folks, is why Doug Glanville is one of our favorite Americans.<br />
<br />
<br />
But it seemed to us that there clearly was more to this saga -- something deep and painful, something tragic and powerful. We went digging for the full story.<br />
<br />
<br />
As Glanville remembers this poignant tale, he and Schilling were playing a computer game called &quot;EverQuest&quot; -- an online version of Dungeons and Dragons.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;One day,&quot; Glanville told Week in Review, &quot;Schill was playing his character, Cylc&quot; -- whom Glanville described as &quot;a dwarven Cleric,&quot; whatever that is -- &quot;and he asked me to team up with him in Faydwer, in the zone of the Butcherblock Mountains, to kill Aviaks, which are basically walking birds.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hang with us here, friends. There will be a baseball point coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;My good-natured character, Bingbong,&quot; -- whom Glanville described as &quot;a dwarven Paladin,&quot; whatever that is -- &quot;was at a little lower level (in status) than his,&quot; Glanville said. &quot;So Cylc was better able to withstand the return attacks. Nevertheless, we attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
So there they were, battling away against those dastardly Aviaks. Suddenly, Glanville began to hear the sound of bones breaking. He quickly deduced those bones belonged to his beloved Bingbong. He looked around for Schilling's guy, Cylc, for assistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oops. No Cylc anywhere in the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somewhere in there,&quot; Glanville recalled, &quot;he had sent a message to me, saying, 'RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.' But he typed this as he was already a mile away from danger and standing next to the guards that protect him. Needless to say, my lifeless character was now chicken feed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Little did Schilling know this would some day lead to him giving up two home runs to Glanville in a giant airplane hanger in Arizona. But it's true.<br />
<br />
&quot;I vowed revenge on the soul of Bingbong,&quot; Glanville said, &quot;for the negligent actions of Cylc.&quot;<br />
<br />
And boy, did Schilling ever pay for Cylc's crimes.<br />
<br />
<br />
But how do we know this was just an isolated occurrence? Suppose many a big game on the diamond can be explained by isolated acts of violence on a computer screen? This is stuff you never hear about from Miller and Morgan. But it happens, Glanville said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not enough attention is paid to the off-the-field motivators that create nasty on-field grudges,&quot; Glanville revealed. &quot;I believe video atrocities top the list. Curt Schilling assassinated my lovable Dwarf Paladin in EverQuest, happily smiling as his character stood in the safety of the town guards. That can create serious internal friction.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe we need to analyze some of the video atrocities committed on PlayStation2 or Dreamcasts, or even the Commodore 64, if we need to go back that far. Teammates play each other all the time on these platforms in baseball simulations, football and other head-to-head games. This creates all kinds of bad blood when the winner is not as gracious as he could be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Until now, those games may have seemed like just innocent diversions. Now, however, we know different.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm of the theory,&quot; Glanville said, &quot;that this could be a key explanation as to why some players have tremendous success against certain other players. Like Todd Helton against Bobby Jones (10-for-16, 3 HR). Or Mike Redmond against Tom Glavine (16-for-25).<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Glavine beat Redmond in Madden Football, 73-0, and poured Gatorade over himself after the victory. Maybe when Bobby Jones was losing to Helton in NBA Live, he 'accidentally' knocked the cord out of the wall, claiming it was a 'power-surge problem.' We don't know these things, do we?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, we have no idea, because until now, we've foolishly confined our baseball analysis to things that happened only in real life. Now we understand that on those computer and video screens, there exists a world within a world. And we'd better investigate that world, too, if we want to continue providing incisive baseball commentary.<br />
<br />
And we know this because of one baseball game in Arizona last weekend and one honest, incisive ballplayer named Doug Glanville.<br />
<br />
We've been unable to get a comment from Schilling on these events. But at this point, Glanville says, that doesn't matter, anyway. All that matters is the on-field ramifications.<br />
<br />
&quot;Schill has to live with what he has done,&quot; Glanville said. &quot;He can tell whatever story he wants, but the facts are the facts. Bingbong was set up, led to an untimely death in the prime of his life for no other reason than pure malice. Things like that do not go unavenged. Sometimes it spills out onto the field of play.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And if it ever does again, you know you can count on Week in Review to be right on the scene -- to thoroughly confuse you more than we already have</div></div><hr />

Probably all the stress from broken warriors on EQ has aged him like 140 years in the past year.  <br />
<br />
According to Gamespy, Gary Gygax helped create the Dungeons and Dragons video game.  Very impressive!  If he is in fact Furor, then that makes Furor's review of WoW even more credible.  That would mean it was written by an actual expert who makes video games and not just a guy that plays video games and happens to be very good at it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess I'm dating myself, but Gary Gygax was the pen &amp; paper God of Dungeon's &amp; Dragons - the original. He also had influence in many other pen &amp; paper games.<br />
<br />
I played the original pen &amp; paper D&amp;D the day it came out and for years after.<br />
<br />
Whether Furor is Gary Gygax - I don't know.<br />
<br />
But, as for Gary Gygax - He's an Icon in the gaming industry for RPG as J.R.R. Tolkien was for fantasy in literature.<br />
<br />
Please don't underestimate Gary Gygax. I guess one would have to be atleast 30+ to know the evolution of all this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my former guild.<br />
<br />
I helped him camp his pipes.<br />
<br />
He got me killed a few times. Heh.<br />
<br />
We explored Veksar together when it opened.<br />
<br />
Ah, good times. Good times indeed.<br />
<br />
He also does reviews for one of the magazines. And ends up seeing a lot of the other content in the game that way. So he's on some other servers too. Like I know he played on Stormhammer for awhile, reviewing Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
Nice guy. But your typical monk, with all the ticks, and quirks.<br />
<br />
Thus, my kind of peoples.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">According to Gamespy, Gary Gygax helped create the Dungeons and Dragons video game <br />
<br />
As pointed above he actually wrote the first D&amp;D books (pen &amp; pencil) back in the late 70s (players manual, monster manual).  <br />
<br />
Gary Gygax<br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. <br />
<br />
Ernest Gary Gygax (born 1938) is perhaps best known for co-writing, with Dave Arneson, and co-publishing, with Don Kaye, one of the most well-known role playing games: Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D). He is also the author of the Gord the Rogue series. <br />
<br />
Gygax and Jeff Perren wrote Chainmail, the game from which D&amp;D was developed, in the late 1960s. Gygax and Kaye founded publishing company Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) and published the first version of D&amp;D in 1974. Gygax wrote a new version of D&amp;D, Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which was published in 1977-9. As of 2003, Gygax continues to take an active role in D&amp;D, and writes a section in Dragon Magazine. <br />
<br />
Another of his creations was DragonChess, a three-dimensional fantasy chess variant, published in Dragon Magazine #100 (August 1985). It is played on three 8x12 boards stacked on top of each other - the top board represents the sky, the middle is the ground, and the bottom is the underworld. The pieces are characters and monsters inspired by the Dungeons and Dragons setting: King, Mage, Paladin, Cleric, Dragon, Griffin, Oliphant, Hero, Thief, Elemental, Basilisk, Unicorn, Dwarf, Sylph and Warrior. <br />
<br />
After leaving TSR Gygax created Dangerous Journeys, an advanced RPG spanning multiple genres. He began work in 1995 on a major new RPG, originally intended for a computer game, but in 1999 released as Lejendary Adventure which some consider to be his best work to date. A key part of its design was to keep the gaming rules as simple as possible, as Gygax felt that RPGs were becoming too complex and discouraged new users. <br />

I'm 50, I know Gary from his early days in Internation Federation of WarGamers (long gone). I played on his SandTable in his basement the Chainmail game, and I used to have a rule book for it heh.<br />
<br />
I sold Hot Dogs at the very first Gencon, I used to own a copy of Stratagy and Tactics #1. I still have a copy of the very first wargame Tactics II the 1958 version with the round HQ units, Avalon Hill's first wargame, yurs for a mere $20,000. <br />
<br />
Gary used to sell insurance and then made shoes while his TSR was just getting off the ground.<br />
