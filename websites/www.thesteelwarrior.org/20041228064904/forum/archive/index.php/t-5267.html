<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only difference between any weapon in the game, is 1/3rd of the damage which comes from your base offense skill, and your damage bonus. <br />
<br />
So to rank any weapon in the game, all you need is the formula<br />
<br />
Weapon Damage * 2 + Damage Bonus / Delay<br />
<br />
+<br />
<br />
A damage modifier to predict the DPS of the weapon against any mob in the game. <br />
<br />
This damage modifier has some factors in it.  How much haste do you have, what level is the mob you are fighting in relation to you(base defense), about how much AC does the mob have(we can use an average per level of the mob), how often does your offhand weapon swing in relation to the mainhand, how often do you double or triple attack, what damage table is your class on, what is your offensive skill, what is your attacking skill, and any other modifiers such as Accuracy. <br />
<br />
Since everyone seems to be parsing the same level 61 mob, and the attack/haste is relatively similar for everyone, the damage modifier would be relatively similar for everyone.  <br />
<br />
At 41% haste, against a level 61 mob, with around 1550 attack, the modifier is about 25 dps per 1 value of the weapon. <br />
<br />
For the offhand weapon, due to a lower number of hits, 1 dps is subtracted for every .5 value of the weapon. <br />
<br />
So, let's get started. <br />
<br />
Warrior Parses<br />
<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord mainhand<br />
38*2+13/35 = 2.543 (63.6 DPS)<br />
Edge of Eternity offhand<br />
20*2+0/20 = 2 ( 50 - 4 = 46 DPS)<br />
<br />
Darkblade + Edge = 109.6 DPS<br />
Furor Parse = 110.76 DPS<br />
<br />
Vanazir<br />
60*2+40/38 = 4.21 (105.25 DPS)<br />
<br />
Vanazir = 105.25 DPS<br />
Behemoth Parse = 105.64 DPS<br />
<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord mainhand<br />
38*2+13/35 = 2.543 (63.6 DPS)<br />
Hammer of the Timeweaver offhand<br />
26*2+0/24 = 2.167 (54.175 - 4 = 50.175 DPS)<br />
<br />
Darkblade + Hammer = 113.775 DPS <br />
Pawz Parse = 64 + 50 = 114 DPS <br />
<br />
Rogue parses<br />
<br />
Jagged Timeforged Blade mainhand<br />
20*2+13/19 = 2.789 (69.725 DPS)<br />
Dagger of Distraction offhand<br />
(18*2)+3/20 = 1.95 (44.75 DPS) <br />
<br />
*Assuming elemental damage gets resisted about half the time*<br />
<br />
<br />
Jagged + DoD = 114.475 DPS<br />
Slansin Parse = 107.49 with 30 Accuracy<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless rogues lose melee attacks when they backstab this parse seems off.  I would check the effective delay on the melee for this parse.  Even if the elemental damage of the weapon is completely removed from the formula, this combination should come in at 110.725 DPS, still 3 DPS more then what is reported. <br />
<br />
Jagged Timeforged Blade mainhand<br />
20*2+13/19 = 2.789 (69.725 DPS)<br />
Ifir offhand<br />
18*2+0/19 = 1.89 (43.25 DPS)<br />
<br />
Jagged + Ifir = 112.975 DPS<br />
(No parse listed)<br />
<br />
Ranger Parses<br />
<br />
Timespinner mainhand<br />
23*2+13/22 = 2.682 (67.05 DPS)<br />
Edge of Eternity offhand<br />
20*2+0/20 = 2 (46 DPS)<br />
<br />
Timespinner + Edge = 113.05 DPS (With around 1550 attack)<br />
Parse not listed. <br />
<br />
Edge of Eternity mainhand<br />
20*2+13/20 = 2.65 (66.25 DPS)<br />
Timespinner offhand<br />
23*2+0/22 = 2.09 (48.25 DPS) <br />
<br />
Edge + Timespinner = 114.5 DPS (With around 1550 attack) <br />
Dunadein Parse = 110.34 DPS with 1620 attack and 30 accuracy<br />
<br />
I think this parse is slightly off as well. <br />
<br />
Timespinner mainhand<br />
23*2+13/22 = 2.682 (67.05 DPS)<br />
Hammer of the Timeweaver offhand<br />
26*2+0/24 = 2.167 (50.175 DPS)<br />
<br />
Timespinner + Hammer = 117.225 DPS ( With around 1550 attack)<br />
Parse not listed. <br />
<br />
The other parses would require different modifiers, I'll do it later. <br />
<br />
If I did some math wrong, feel free to point it out and I will change it. <br />
<br />
Basically, the simplified explanation of how attack works is this. <br />
<br />
The first checks made, are the riposte, parry etc which determine whether you can even attempt the hit or not. <br />
<br />
Secondly, is a skill check based on your skill in offense which goes against your opponents skill in defense.  This determines if you will land a hit or not, and accounts for 1/3rd of the damage + the Damage Bonus portion of the hit.  Classes with lower base offense, would have a lower hit percentage because of this, regardless of their attack.   Your hit percentage would decrease against higher level mobs with a higher defensive skill, and increase against lower level mobs with a lower defensive skill.  At Damage * 2 + Damage bonus, you will get a huge amount of hits, because this is when the skill check portion of your attack is landing for max damage.  Since the values seem to overlap, you have a higher percentage of hits at the maximum and minimum values.  <br />
<br />
Thirdly is a skill check based on your attacking skill.  For instance if you are using a 1h Slashing Weapon, this check would be based on your skill in 1h Slash.  This is also where I believe the Time mod Accuracy works so you would not see an increase in your hit percentage from Accuracy, but rather you would notice a slight increase to your DPS with it.   After it is established that your hit will land, Accuracy along with your weapon skill would help to boost the chance that you will do additional damage that hit.  After that check is passed, your Attack comes into play and goes against your opponents AC.  Basically, on quite a few swings, your attack never even comes into play.  If you were to fight a really high AC mob, you would tend to hit for the Damage bonus and up to 1/3rd damage from the skill check portion of the attack.  <br />
<br />
Your max hit is likely tied directly to your base offense as well. At lower levels, you wouldn't have high enough offense to hit for the max possible.<br />
<br />
I'll make up some numbers as an example. Let's say the skill check portion of an attack works by rolling your offense skill against your opponents defense skill. <br />
<br />
We can use a scale, say 1-1100 for my example. <br />
<br />
1-200 would be a miss, from 900-1100 your skill check portion of the attack would hit for the maximum value it can. <br />
<br />
When you first start off at level 1, you might be around 350 just the same as your similarly leveled opponents. Each time your offense skill goes up, you would gain 3 points on this scale. <br />
<br />
You would take your 350, against your opponents 350, and let's say you both roll a dice and the difference would be the value used to determine whether you miss or hit and if you hit, how much you hit for. <br />
<br />
Since you start at 350, and your opponent has 350, and the difference has to be 201 in order to hit, the odds are against you landing a hit so when you first start out, you would barely be able to land a hit. <br />
<br />
As you continue to play the game, your offense increases and in my example, it would increase at the rate of 3 per 1 point of offense. If you gain 5 offense per level, you gain 15 points over your opponent, so the odds continue to increase that you will hit your opponent. Let's say around level 20 you would have around 100 skill in offense. That would increase your total by 300. <br />
<br />
You are rolling out of a possible 650 now, and your opponent, say he is a blue con mob 5 levels below, is rolling out of a possible 575. The difference needs to be over 201 in order to land your hit, but as you can see the odds you will hit are gradually improving. <br />
<br />
If you were to fight an opponent 20 levels above you, say with a defense of 200 he would be rolling out of a possible 350+200*3=950<br />
<br />
So the odds of you hitting an opponent 20 levels above you, are pretty slim. You would have to roll out of your possible 650 against his possible 950 and beat him by 201 in order to land a hit. It's not likely. <br />
<br />
The reason your damage would be lower, is because it's impossible for you to hit for max damage with your offensive skill. If you are rolling out of a possible 650, and the maximum hit requires a value of over 900, it's impossible for you to hit it.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, this has gotten longer then I intended. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those parses assume max offensive AA,Some include effects such as Combat effect while others do not and others without having maximum Atk.Furthermore if anything changed offensive wise in the next expansion the results would be even further skewed.<br />
<br />
I suppose it works fine for now,but it doesn't really offer anyhting that wasn't already known that I can see outside of your theory that Accuracy effects weapon skill over actualy To Hit %<br />
<br />
A decent way to test that theory would be to aquire a warrior with a peircing weapon and then a slashing weapon with the same damage delay.Parse the war with the slasher with no Acc mods then parse with the piercer with the accuracy mods and look at the Average hit/DPS and see.If it does in fact do what you suggest it should bring a 240 skill in line with a 250 one.What would be intersting to see is if this works on 250 skills at all being the cap is 2 poitns away or if the mod is basically wasted ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there is a huge time difference.  Using a formula to calculate DPS in 15 seconds, as opposed to 15 hour parses... and the formula is likely more accurate then the parsing. <br />
<br />
Those 2 parses that I think are off,  I wouldn't be surprised if some attacks are missing based on the delay of the weapons.  Likely all that happened is that their computer lagged causing them to miss some attacks.  Maybe they were doing things in the background, who knows.  Without a formula though, no one would ever know that the parses are off.  One of the main reasons I think they are off is because they underperformed as opposed to overperformed.  The damage modifier is calculated around 1550 attack with no accuracy, so the fact a ranger parse with 1620 attack and 30 accuracy underperformed is a pretty good indication that some attacks were missed, likely due to lag. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the only thing that would change is the damage modifier.  You can still use the formula to accurately rank weapon combinations, the damage modifier is only used to predict the DPS of the weapon. <br />
<br />
The damage modifier can be adjusted, just like new offensive AA's can be introduced. <br />
<br />
I am currently working with some friends to get a program out there that would calculate a weapon's DPS with some information entered. <br />
<br />
Offense Skill<br />
Mob Level<br />
Haste<br />
Attack<br />
Weapon Value<br />
<br />
All of that other information would likely get programmed in, the damage ratio, hit percentages etc. <br />
<br />
If we can do it, I think it would be pretty cool to basically be able to spend 5 seconds entering information, and be able to fairly accurately predict how much DPS a weapon should do against a mob. <br />

Imagine applying the Mippo Theory to real world statistical calculations. It's all very ingratiating for him, I'm sure, as it helps reaffirm what he wants to believe.<br />

Soon we'll have the Vanazir pumping out triple the DPS of the best possible DW combo. Keep workin' at it bud! You're almost there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There used to be a paladin in my guild that swore by these numbers.  Unfortunately when I parsed them, they are always wrong.  In my experience they are fairly useful for comparing 2-handers to each other, or 1 1-hander vs. another, but I haven't had good luck with them trying to compare 2-handers to dual wield combo.  I actually used to pull out a WMBS when I wanted DPS because the equations said it was better than my dual wield combo.  When I parsed it though, I found out I had actually been lowering my dps by pulling out the 2-hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Explain to me then how my formula is so accurate with both 1hers, 2hers and the offhand? <br />
<br />
For example, <br />
<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord mainhand<br />
38*2+13/35 = 2.543 (63.6 DPS)<br />
Edge of Eternity offhand<br />
20*2+0/20 = 2 ( 50 - 4 = 46 DPS)<br />
<br />
Darkblade + Edge = 109.6 DPS<br />
Furor Parse = 110.76 DPS<br />
<br />
It's within 1 DPS of Furor's parse, it also accurately breaks down how much damage Furor did in his mainhand, and offhand.  Information Furor did not list with his parse. <br />
<br />
The EXACT same formula, which you say is inaccurate for 2hers, <br />
<br />
Vanazir<br />
60*2+40/38 = 4.21 (105.25 DPS)<br />
<br />
Vanazir = 105.25 DPS<br />
Behemoth Parse = 105.64 DPS<br />
<br />
Yet again, within 1 DPS of the parse.  <br />
<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord mainhand<br />
38*2+13/35 = 2.543 (63.6 DPS)<br />
Hammer of the Timeweaver offhand<br />
26*2+0/24 = 2.167 (54.175 - 4 = 50.175 DPS)<br />
<br />
Darkblade + Hammer = 113.775 DPS <br />
Pawz Parse = 64 + 50 = 114 DPS <br />
<br />
Not only is this parse within 1 DPS, but both the DPS from the mainhand, and offhand listed by Pawz with his parse are within 1 DPS of my totals using the exact same formula. <br />
<br />
Weird coincedence I guess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, these three guys are applying for a job.  The interviewer calls them into his office one at a time...<br />
<br />
The interview says to the first man, &quot;It says on your resume that you're a mathematician.  So, tell me, what is 10/3?&quot;<br />
<br />
The mathematician considers for a moment and says, &quot;Exactly three and a third.&quot;<br />
<br />
The interviewer calls for the second man to enter, and reviews the resume before him. &quot;It says here that you are a computer scientist.  So, tell me, what is 10/3?&quot;<br />
<br />
The computer scientist considers for a moment, and says, &quot;Computers are notorious for rounding numbers badly, especially irrational ones.  So the answer would be about 3.33.&quot;<br />
<br />
The interviewer scans the next man's resume, and calls for him. &quot;I see you're a statistician.  So,  tell me, what is 10/3?&quot;<br />
<br />
The statistician ponders for a moment, takes off his glasses, and looks the interviewer straight in the eye.  &quot;What do you want it to be?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How can that equation be possibly right when you get a weapon's damage rating based on damage/delay/damage bonus and then multiply it by some factor to account for the 'real world' damage?  The damage done from damage bonus is always constant regardless of how uber (or not) you may be (ignoring accuracy mods).  Any weapon with a base of delay of 38 will always do the same damage from damage bonus whether it's a 0/38 or a 60/38.  <br />
<br />
I suppose if you actually parse out the damage attributed to damage bonus (just take number of hits you land on per second and multiply it by DB) and then divide it by (DB/delay) you'll have the right number to multiply to compensate for the damage from the DB part.  However, this number can't possibly have anything to do with the weapon's damage rating or your attack levels, since that number has to be fixed regardles of what attack or what damage the weapon has.<br />
<br />
The fact that those numbers match with the parse is purely coincidental.  If you want to establish a weapon's damage rating you have to ignore the damage bonus part at least because you can't just multiply damage bonus by some factor that's related to attack/damage when damage bonus has absolutely nothing to do with either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weapon Damage * 2 + Damage Bonus / Delay will give you a value.  <br />
<br />
That value, will accurately rank any weapon in the game.  I didn't make the formula up, you can find it if you look at your hits.  When you use the formula for offhand, just remember not to use the damage bonus, since an offhand weapon does not have one. <br />
<br />
Hammer of the Timeweaver<br />
26 Damage * 2 + 13 Damage Bonus / 24 Delay = 2.708<br />
Edge of Eternity<br />
20 Damage * 2 + 0 Damage Bonus / 20 Delay = 2<br />
<br />
2.708 + 2 = 4.708 is the value for this dual wield combination<br />
<br />
Flip the weapons,<br />
 <br />
Edge of Eternity<br />
20 Damage * 2 + 13 Damage Bonus / 20 delay = 2.65<br />
Hammer of the Timeweaver<br />
26 Damage * 2 + 0 Damage Bonus / 24 Delay = 2.167<br />
<br />
2.65+2.167 = 4.817 is the value for this dual wield combination<br />
<br />
EOE + Hammer = 4.817<br />
Hammer + EOE = 4.708<br />
<br />
So, someone would do more melee damage by EOE+Hammer as opposed to Hammer+EOE.  Which isn't entirely obvious just by looking at the weapons.  Obviously, other things need to be taken into effect such as proc damage.  If proc damage is relatively equal, you would do more damage with the EOE in the mainhand, as opposed to the Quarm hammer. <br />
<br />
When comparing the values to 2hers, the only difference is the offhand damage is very slightly off.  Almost unnoticable unless you want to figure out the DPS of weapon.  What I have found to work when figuring out the DPS, is simply to subtract about 1 DPS per .5 value of the weapon.  So if the offhand weapon had a value of 2, once you figure out the DPS, you would subtract about 4 DPS from that figure.  This is only if you want to get the DPS though.  Just to rank the items, the values given above are fine. <br />
<br />
Weapon Damage * 2 + Damage Bonus gives a number.  Graph your hits with any weapon, and you will notice a huge excess of hits at this value.  That is because it's the maximum value your skill check allows.  Basically all damage done by this formula, has absolutely nothing to do with your attack, it's solely based on your base skill in offense.  Whether you hit a mob or not, has nothing to do with your attack.<br />
<br />
All additional damage done after this formula, will be the same for everyone with the same skill in offense, and similar attack. <br />
<br />
The only factor in determing the DPS of a weapon, is how much of a modifier to use.  I used 25 above, and 25 only works on the above formulas with an equal skill check, and relatively equal attack.  For example, Monks would need a higher damage modifier, Shadowknights and Paladins would require a lower damage modifier in order for their dps numbers to be accurate. <br />
<br />
The simple way to find out what the modifier is, is to just use an existing parse of a similar weapon, and divide the DPS of that weapon, into the value of the weapon.  Then use that modifier on any similar weapons. <br />
<br />
For example. <br />
<br />
Coral Hilted Spike Driver, is 13/19 with a 13 damage modifier. <br />
<br />
13 Damage * 2 + 13 Damage Bonus / 19 Delay = 2.053<br />
<br />
Let's say you know that you can do 35 DPS with a Coral Hilted Spike Driver, with your haste, and your attack.  Not that it does, im making the number up for an example. <br />
<br />
You would take the 35 DPS / 2.053 value of the weapon and your modifier would be 17.05 <br />
<br />
Let's say you weren't sure, and wanted to get a Bone Spiked Crusher from Grummus.  It's 12/18. <br />
<br />
12 Damage * 2 + 13 damage Bonus / 18 = 2.0556<br />
<br />
Due to the higher value, the Bone Spiked Crusher, would very slightly edge out the Coral Hilted Spike Driver.  You are curious how much of an upgrade it is...<br />
<br />
You take the value, 2.0556 and multiply it by your modifier 17.05<br />
<br />
Your new DPS would be 35.048, since you were already doing 35 DPS with your current weapon, it wouldn't be worth it to get it since its only a .048 DPS upgrade. <br />
<br />
The only thing you need to know when finding out the modifier for a Dual Wield combination is that the offhand weapon is slightly overreported, so when figuring out weapon DPS, subtract 1 DPS for every .5 value of the weapon. <br />
<br />
Pretty much by knowing the value of one weapon and its DPS, you can find out what your DPS would be with any similar weapon quite accurately. That's extremely useful if you ask me. <br />
<br />
To be able to calculate the formula, you would need to assign a value to everything involved.  Add it up, then it would produce a number and that would be the modifier. <br />
<br />
If you simply wanted to use this formula as a tool, it's still extremely accurate in ranking weapons, and telling you the weapon DPS if you use the correct modifier.  Just simply take the modifier from some existing data that you know, and relate it to any similar weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really know why Dunadein's parse is off, he probably just lagged or something who knows. <br />
<br />
But your Rogue parse has backstabs included.  Since I don't really think a Rogue is going to sit there and backstab for 10 hours, I think it is safe to assume that the parse is using a macro. <br />
<br />
Really, is it that far fetched to think that running a macro on a parse, caused your parses to miss some attacks?!? <br />
<br />
Did you also not already have to redo a parse because of a problem with a macro?!? So why is that you think only the one parse is wrong?  It was just a lot easier to spot. <br />
<br />
I would also assume that your Monks used Macros, and their melee damage is slightly under as well.  <br />
<br />
I would say there is a pretty good chance all of the parses you have listed done by Rogues and Monks using Macros, is slightly underperforming on the melee aspect of the parse.   Basically, the parses you have listed are wrong which kind of sucks, because people are using them to compare the classes DPS, and your information is inaccurate.  <br />

I don't really know why Dunadein's parse is off, he probably just lagged or something who knows. <br />
<br />
But your Rogue parse has backstabs included.  Since I don't really think a Rogue is going to sit there and backstab for 10 hours, I think it is safe to assume that the parse is using a macro. <br />
<br />
Really, is it that far fetched to think that running a macro on a parse, caused your parses to miss some attacks?!? <br />
<br />
Did you also not already have to redo a parse because of a problem with a macro?!? So why is that you think only the one parse is wrong?  It was just a lot easier to spot. <br />
<br />
I would also assume that your Monks used Macros, and their melee damage is slightly under as well.  <br />
<br />
I would say there is a pretty good chance all of the parses you have listed done by Rogues and Monks using Macros, is slightly underperforming on the melee aspect of the parse.   Basically, the parses you have listed are wrong which kind of sucks, because people are using them to compare the classes DPS, and your information is inaccurate.  <br />
<br />
Moral: Don't use Macros to parse.  <br />
<br />
I have a question.<br />
<br />
What exactly are you trying to prove? More speficially, WHAT IS YOUR POINT? <br />
<br />
EDIT: My apologies to Mippo, aside from his passive aggressive jab at our data being faulty he did nothing wrong to provoke a flame from me - I've gone ahead and deleted my previous insults. <br />

The Arena should never become a flame ridden/infested posting forum, no matter who posts, not Furor Planedefiler and not xxxLvl54Warrior - keep it clean.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't say since I haven't done any research like this whether or not he's full of shit. <br />
<br />
But I don't think it's really called for to insult him for trying to come up with theory to rate weapons. <br />
<br />
Personally I'd be a lot more convinced if you posted some logs showing us the &quot;formula&quot; in action. If you think the parses of the rogue or monk were off due to lag or macros or whatever, maybe you should run some of your own, just on pure melee dps, and see if your results conform to the formule you're suggesting. Just saying, &quot;hmmm that's off, must have been because you were backstabbing&quot; isn't as convincing as showing parses to back it up. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I can't claim to know what you're talking about when you refer to his claims about VDD outdamaging DW combos. Probably a previous thread, maybe on some other board I don't frequent. I dunno. <br />
<br />
But using his own formulae, for an EoE and Timeweaver hammer, let's see that's like <br />
<br />
[(20 x 2) + 13] / 20= 2.65 <br />
<br />
[(26 x 2) + 0] / 24= 2.17 <br />
<br />
so that's like 4.82 ? <br />
<br />
And a VDD would be [(60 x 2) + 40] / 38 = 4.21 <br />
<br />
So by his own formula, the DW combo is better. Also, just for kicks, I did the math on the GoC and it ended up having 4.33 value, which would mean that in just pure melee DPS it outdamages a VDD. This is something that I know you were out to prove with the parses originally Furor. Or at least something that you backed up when people claimed that VDD would outdamage GoC in pure melee dps.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, it seems decent for comparing weapons to me, at least if all you're concerned about is pure melee damage. <br />
<br />
But if you really want to convince people, you'd do some parses and prove that whatever weapon has the highest &quot;value&quot; is going to pump out more dps, given otherwise identical conditions. Trying to actually use this theory to &quot;predict&quot; your approx or god forbid exact DPS I think is kind of retarded. But maybe it's good for just comparing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He said that the formula told him to use a WMBS but when parsed the DW combo was better. <br />
<br />
Actually, I did the formula using those two weapons, I'm not sure if that's what you were wielding when you did the parses. But a weapon like GBoS, or a SoD is going to be at least comprable to either of your current weapons when you count in proc damage.(And I could tell you that without a formula)<br />
<br />
And according to that theory, BF + BoC is 3.75 and WMBS is 3.46, meaning it would tell you that DWing is better. I dunno exactly how much DPS that's supposedly going to equate to, but at least for comparing the two setups, it seems to be okay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What he's doing is trying to quantify weapon damage by just delay, damage, and damage bonus alone.  This obviously make sense in theory since fundamentally those 3 things are the only thing that varies for DPS if you're at the high end (same haste, same AA, same attack, etc).  <br />
<br />
But by finding your weapon damage rating as a function of delay, damage, and damage bonus and then multiplying it by a factor (since obviously weapons don't do 2.5 DPS or whatever your damage rating is) scales the damage bonus factor as well.  This unfairly gives 2H weapons more damage than they really do because their damage bonus/delay ratio is always higher than 1H (easily verified).  Yet, this scaling factor that is supposed to account for attack, buffs, AA, etc, have nothing to do with the damage bonus of a weapon.  <br />
<br />
To see how this calculation doesn't make sense, let's say my attack is so high I always hit for max.  Let's just call this 300 DPS because I'm too lazy to figure out what that actually is.  So by the logic above the number to multiply the 4.21 rating on VDD is about 75 for my super uber character.  This also implies that since VDD's damage bonus of (40/38) accounts for roughly 25% of the weapon's damage rating (4.21), 25% of the damage I done with VDD comes from the damage bonus.  But this obviously can't be the case.  I'm hitting for 395 every hit and with VDD's DB at 40, that's barely 10% of my damage that is coming from damage bonus.<br />
<br />
The formula suggested unfairly gives damage bonus twice the weight.  First time into the weapon rating (which is right, damage bonus obviously increases DPS) and then again by scaling it with attack/AA/buffs/etc even though damage bonus does not scale with these factors.  Given damage bonus is better in 2H weapons by their nature, this inflates the damage 2H weapons actually do.  The formula assumes the % of damage done by damage bonus is constant, but it is wrong.  The % of damage done by damage bonus naturally decreases as your attack goes up.  <br />
<br />
Of course, I don't really think about such things when I choose my weapons... I just look at what people parse.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I was curious. I have a BoC and GBoS. according to the &quot;formula&quot; that combo, with the GBoS mainhand would be like 3.78. <br />
<br />
I also have a GSot4W that I use almost exclusively, because it really seemed to be a lot better dps. Never parsed it, never felt a need too. <br />
<br />
Comes out to be like 3.81 or something, and that sounds really fishy. If you count in the fact that GBoS has a 180dd proc, it seems like that DW combo should outdamage a 41/31 2hander. I doubt it, but I'll par...<br />
<br />
Okay never mind I won't parse it, because I just realized that that formula is in fact shit for any DW combo, but just adding the two values together makes no sense. Forgive my previous comments. It kinda calls into question the whole theory. So what, you add them together....because your offhand weapon, in addition to having no damage bonus, swings 100% as much as your main weapon? And...you can double attack with your offhand? triple attack with it? Does your offhand weapon double attack with the exact same frequency as your primary hand? Also, isn't flurry supposed to be more helpful with DW than 2handers because you swing more often, as a general rule? Is punishing blade exactly as good as Ambidexterity and will increase your dps by a fixed percent with any weapon? Way too much shit unaccounted for.<br />
<br />
Feel like an idiot for not reasoning that out a little better now, but uhhh yeah. Pay me no mind. <br />
<br />
Still does seem okay for just comparing one weapon to another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It scales it evenly for both combinations.  A higher damage bonus doesn't necessarily mean the 2her would outperform.  In fact, Vanazir, with a damage bonus of 40, is significantly below the other Time dual wield values and you would confirm this with parsing.  The parsing has already been done, and my formula's match up evenly with both 2hers, and dual wield combinations as I have already shown. <br />

<br />
The first portion of an attack is based on your offensive skill.  Even if you had 1 million attack, you still wouldn't even come close to hitting for a weapon's max hit everytime.  The ratio of hits between the Damage Bonus and Weapon Damage * 2 is a constant.  That ratio is directly proportional to the values in the 2nd portion of the equation.  So if you were hitting for max possible every hit, it would be directly proportional to the ratio of hits, based on your offensive skill.  <br />
<br />
To put it into numbers. <br />
<br />
Vanazir's offensive skill counts for Weapon Damage * 2 + Damage Bonus. <br />
<br />
60*2+40 = 160<br />
<br />
If you have Vanazir, and you were to look at your hits, you would see an excess of hits at 160 damage.  This is because the values overlap and it is the maximum possible hit allowed based on the offense skill check. <br />
<br />
At max offense, you likely won't get very many hits between the damage bonus, and around 70, maybe 2 hits out of 1000 in that area. <br />
<br />
From about 70 damage, to 160 would be a ratio of hits.  That ratio is a constant. <br />
<br />
Let's say out of 100 swings, we have 40 misses, and the 60 hits as follows: <br />
<br />
40 Damage - 0<br />
41 Damage - 0<br />
...<br />
51 Damage - 0<br />
....<br />
70 Damage - 2<br />
71 Damage - 7<br />
72 Damage - 1<br />
73 Damage - 1<br />
...<br />
89 Damage - 9<br />
...<br />
156 Damage - 13<br />
157 Damage - 4<br />
...<br />
160 Damge - 25<br />
<br />
<br />
395 max hit - 160 damage from offense skill = 235<br />
<br />
Only 235 damage comes from your attack and the first part of the equation is a constant.  So you have hit diminishing returns on attack, when the ratio of hits on the 2nd part of the equation, is directly proportional to the ratio of hits in the first part.  The ratio of misses on the 2nd part of the equation is based on your skill check in that particular weapon, so that is a constant as well which means with 1 million attack you would still have some hits between DB and DB + Weapon Damage * 2, in this case 160. <br />
<br />
All of that is a constant though, and is disregarded you can't change your skill check.  What you can do however, is look for all of the damage that is effected by attack.  That ratio above, if all of your hits are landing for max, would basically be those numbers, +235. <br />
<br />
So if you had 13% land at 156, you would have those same 13% land at 156+235, 391. If 25% of your hits landed at 160, then you should have 25% of your hits land at 395.  That's when attack has reached diminishing returns.  Based on past parses, this happens around 2150 attack.  My personal theory, is that 1hers reach diminishing returns before 2hers, based on a smaller damage pool but that is just personal theory. <br />
<br />
The formula suggested unfairly gives damage bonus twice the weight. First time into the weapon rating (which is right, damage bonus obviously increases DPS) and then again by scaling it with attack/AA/buffs/etc even though damage bonus does not scale with these factors. Given damage bonus is better in 2H weapons by their nature, this inflates the damage 2H weapons actually do. The formula assumes the % of damage done by damage bonus is constant, but it is wrong. The % of damage done by damage bonus naturally decreases as your attack goes up.<br />
<br />
In my initial post, I used the exact same modifier for both 1hers, and 2hers, and both values were accurate.  If it did in fact inflate the damage done by 2hers, then why was the DPS given by my formula on Vanazir, within .5 DPS of the 10 hour parse listed without and also, using the exact same modifier, within .5 DPS of the 1her parses listed?  If what you claim were true, that would not be possible.  <br />
<br />
Comes out to be like 3.81 or something, and that sounds really fishy. If you count in the fact that GBoS has a 180dd proc, it seems like that DW combo should outdamage a 41/31 2hander. I doubt it, but I'll par...<br />
<br />
The formula only takes into account melee damage.  Whichever number is higher, will outperform in melee.  So if you were to parse it, the 3.81 would do more melee damage then the 3.78<br />
If the 3.78 has a proc, it would likely push the weapon ahead of the 3.81 when the proc damage is factored in.  Simply based on melee damage alone, the 3.81 will outdamage the 3.78 though. <br />
<br />
A simple comparison between 3.81 and 3.78, the 3.81 would do more damage.  Now, the question becomes, would a 3.81 outdamage a 3.78 with a 180 DD proc.  The answer is, how much damage does the proc do?  Since the values are so similar, it likely does. <br />
<br />
Okay never mind I won't parse it, because I just realized that that formula is in fact shit for any DW combo, but just adding the two values together makes no sense. Forgive my previous comments. It kinda calls into question the whole theory. So what, you add them together....because your offhand weapon, in addition to having no damage bonus, swings 100% as much as your main weapon? And...you can double attack with your offhand? triple attack with it? Does your offhand weapon double attack with the exact same frequency as your primary hand? Also, isn't flurry supposed to be more helpful with DW than 2handers because you swing more often, as a general rule? Is punishing blade exactly as good as Ambidexterity and will increase your dps by a fixed percent with any weapon? Way too much shit unaccounted for.<br />
<br />
Does your offhand weapon do as much damage as your mainhand weapon? Obviously not, but look at the values of a weapon in the offhand as compared to that same weapon in the mainhand.  It loses a huge portion of its value and yes, that loss of value does compensate for your above questions.  <br />
<br />
Ambidexterity and Punishing Blade are actually almost identical gains. <br />
<br />
Adding the 2 values together, does accurately judge the value of the dual wield combination.  The margin of error, the answer to all of your above questions, is about 1 DPS per .5 value of the weapon.  So if you were to calculate the DPS of the offhand weapon, it would be 1-4 DPS over what it actually is, you can manually adjust this though so it isn't a problem.  Sony tried to balance 2hers and 1hers, and frankly im really surprised, it is almost identical. <br />
<br />
The modifier is very simple. <br />
<br />
Calculate the value of either your 2her, or your mainhand weapon then find out the DPS you currently do with that weapon. <br />
Divide that DPS, by that value, and you have the modifier that fits your AA, your gear, your attack, your skill mods, your haste, etc<br />
<br />
Now, take that modifier, and you can now apply it to any weapon in the game, and with your current gear, and using the same haste the modifier came from, that is the DPS you would do.  The only exception would be if you calculated the modifier by using a 2her with the relevant 2her AA's, and tried to use it on a dual wield combination without the relevant Dual Wield AA's, your dps from the formula would be overreported. <br />
<br />
The only thing not accounted for, is procs.  Since the modifier would come from your own gear, your own statistics, all of your relevant information that makes up your DPS, would be accounted for.  The values are all accurate so the DPS reported would be accurate, within 1 DPS.  Why did I use 25, because that is the modifier based on max offensive AA's, and that haste/attack value.  Since all of those parses were done with similarly equipped players and haste, the same modifier gives out accurate DPS information on all similar parses.  Obviously monks with a higher damage table, and Knights with a lower offensive skill would be exceptions, they would require different modifiers. <br />
<br />
If you are bored, just try it out.  You have nothing to lose~<br />
Calculate your dps with your weapon, find out your modifier, and use the values of the weapons to calculate how much damage you would be doing with any weapon in the game.  Basically, a Kunark geared ranger could see how much DPS he would do with Time weapons etc.  Just remember when calculating the offhand DPS, to subtract 1 DPS for every .5 value of the offhand weapon.  That's the margin of error.  <br />
<br />
Just have fun with it~ More or less the formulas are simply a tool to calculate melee damage of the various weapons, and to predict DPS of them.</div></div><hr />

That might be forgivable if these values were a constant across classes, however they are not.<br />
<br />
This means that your formula is worthless for comparing damage between classes, as you found yourself, but dismissed as the parses being invalid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason why they match is just a coincidence.  The two weapons you parse are very close in ratio and actual DPS so slightly inflating the 2H damage by multiplying the DB bonus does not skew it.  Obviously a weapon's damage has to be f(damage, delay) + g(damage bonus) where f and g are linear functions and I'd guess in this case your f and g values just happen to be very close so you end up with numbers that look right.  However, if in next expansion everyone can have 100000 attack then obviously you'd have to modify your multiplier to a larger number and then it will be obvious that you're overcounting the effect of damage bonus.  If that modifer was say, 50, that means suddenly damage bonus damage doubled using the same weapon even though you're not hitting any more often or hitting the mob any faster.<br />
<br />
According to your formula, the DB portion of a VDD will do roughly 25% of all damage done by VDD whether your attack is 0 or 100000 attack.  After all higher attack (or lower) just changes the number you multiply your weapon rating by.  That can't possibly be right.  We know if your attack is 0 almost all your damage will be from DB and if your attack is somehow 100000 then barely 10% of your damage will come from DB.  Yet your formula will predict 25% in both cases.</div></div><hr />

Monks get a higher dual wield cap than warriors. This means the ratio of 1h/2h weapon damage is different than it will be for warriors.<br />
<br />
Monks do not get the flurry AA, a monk will always perform less attacks than a warrior wielding the same weapon.<br />
<br />
Rogues do not get the flurry AA, they also do not get the triple attack ability, they will perform less attacks than both a warrior and a monk with the same weapons. <br />

That Mippo's formula is designed to predict weapon dps using the current state of EQ ?<br />
While i do find the 25DPS per weapon point solution really weird.<br />

<br />
His reasoning is based on 1 hypothesis : 1550ATK <br />
(Full AA &amp; Warrior of course).<br />
That is the ATK rating on his formula is ment to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Parsing a VDD with 1200atk  1500atk 1800atk 2000atk will give different &quot;Magic Numbers&quot;.<br />
Thats the most common hit value.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of threads on the PoN (pally board) that have parsed and <br />
compared the magic number for paladins based on ATK &amp; Weapon DMG+Bonus.<br />
<br />
It could be possible that Mippo has found a way to transform<br />
the 1550atk magic number (and other values) into DPS.<br />
<br />
Parsing a wide variety of weapons (Dual Fine Steel / Weighted Axe / Reaper) etc etc<br />
<br />
Will tell us if the formula works for today's warriors (fullAA 1550atk 41%).<br />
If it does, it means the formula is correct into predicting weapon<br />
DPS under specific conditions.<br />
<br />
I dont think its ment to be a general formula for potential DPS evaluation.<br />
But more of a 1 case scenario formula.</div></div><hr />

25 = 10 * 2.5<br />
<br />
Weapon delays have units of .1 seconds.  The &quot;10&quot; is what you use to convert delay into seconds:<br />
<br />
damx2/del for 13 20 is 26/20 = 13/10 = 1.3 damage per 1/10 second.  Multiply by 10 to converr the units to seconds.<br />

2.5 is just as inexplicable however.</div></div><hr />

I think you misunderstood what you read of 'magic numbers'. The magic number is the same regardless of attack - (2 * damage + dam bonus), the only thing which changes with attack is the average damage, due to the shift in distribution of hits between the minimum, the MN and the maximum.</div></div><hr />

Almost everyone doing this parses has max offensive AA's, attacking the same mob, and almost identical attack.  The 25 modifier accounts for that specific set of AA's and gear.  The only reason it can be used on most of the parses, is because of all the parses I compared, they all have identical attack, identical AA's, identical haste etc so it remains accurate. <br />

Anyone who does a parse with that exact set of equipment, max offensive AA's, 41% haste, level 61 mob, and similar attack, it would remain accurate. <br />

You pointed out Monks are on a higher damage table, but if you had read my post, I did not compare Monks.  I found the DPS of the Rogue to be off, and am assuming the Monk dps is off as well due to using the same macro that caused the Rogue DPS to be off. <br />

EmiliaEQ has it right.  That value is isolated to that specific case. <br />
The thing is, it's very easy to get that value for other sets of gear/AA etc. <br />
<br />
All you have to do is find the value of your weapon, and know the DPS *you* do with it accurately.  Then divide your own personal DPS by the value of the weapon.  Since the DPS is coming from you, and takes all of those things into account, your atk, your AA's or lack thereof, the modifier given to you would be accurate for any weapon in the game.  <br />
<br />
If a monk got his modifier, it would take into account his added damage table.  If someone missing AA's got it, it would take that into account.  <br />
<br />
What I did, was I found my own modifier, based on my current gear, and I can use that to accurately relate to anyone with similar gear.  Max offensive AA's, that attack range, and same haste. <br />
<br />
So yes, the modifier is specific to you, but it can accurately predict how much dps YOU would do with those weapons.  For the purposes of end game parsings, use an end game modifier, and you get end game dps~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The magic number is the same regardless of attack - (2 * damage + dam bonus)<br />
<br />
Well for me the magic number was the number that most often came up.<br />
Coming out often, meant that there was something special/magical about it.<br />
<br />
Not the average hit (which is not the number that comes up<br />
the most often unless you have 100.000.000 ATK)<br />
<br />
With 2100+ atk (bst+shaman+bard) when i can grab them during some raids<br />
My most common hit with the BoW is not 2x48+37=133.<br />
I almost never see 133 hits. Its more of 200+ maybe 230ish.<br />
<br />
 I do have a small question/Idea<br />
Could we not split weapon DPS into 2 categories : Fixed &amp; Random <br />
<br />
The Fixed DPS part will always remain the same. <br />
Thus it is easy to eliminate.<br />
<br />
DBoW = 38+13 / 35<br />
DBoW max hit = 225 ? <br />
DBoW min hit = 13<br />
<br />
DBoW fixed DPS w/o skills = 13/3.5 = 3.71<br />
DBoW Max variable DPS w/o skills = (225-13)/3.5 = 60.57<br />
<br />
Assuming Skill check(80% single attack, 10 % dual attack, 10 % triple attack)<br />
Assuming Skill check coefficient = 1.3<br />
<br />
DBoW fixed DPS with skills = 13/3.5 x1.3= 4.83<br />
DBoW Max variable DPS with skills = (225-13)/3.5 x1.3= 78.74<br />
<br />
Add 41% haste<br />
<br />
DBoW fixed DPS with skills = 13/3.5 x1.3 x1.41= 6.81<br />
DBoW Max variable DPS with skills = (225-13)/3.5 x1.3 x1.41 = 111.03<br />
<br />
DBoW Max possible DPS = 6.81+111.03 =  117.84<br />
(thats if u max hit every time, and do 1.3 swings per average on each round with a 41% haste)<br />
<br />
Paw's parsed DBoW at 63.91 DPS.<br />
<br />
Out of these 63.91 DPS we know that 6.81 came from the fixed DPS part that<br />
are not affected by Player ATK vs Mob AC.<br />
<br />
So 63.91-6.81 = 57.1 dps came from the Variable DPS part.<br />
Thats a 57.1/111.03 or 51.43% Efficiency DPS conversion.<br />
<br />
So Weapon DPS could be divided into :<br />
<br />
0.5143x(Maxhit - Bonus)x1.3x1.41 /DLY + (Bonus)x1.3x1.41 /DLY <br />
<br />
That would put :<br />
DBoW at 63.90DPS (no precision loss compared to Paw's parse rounding values)<br />
VDD at 97.44DPS (105.64 Parses by Behemoth, 8 DPS gap is huge, but VDD has Punishing Blade)<br />
<br />
There is only 1 variable in the entire theory (the Skill check coefficient).<br />
And i have no parse around to determine what it is.<br />
<br />
Since the 51.43% is a direct product of the Skill Check factor its easy to fix it.<br />
<br />
That coefficient will not be the same for 1H and 2H (because of punishing blade).<br />
It should be higher for 1h, which means that 1H weapons are better used under low mitigatin/high ATK scenarios.<br />
(we remember everyone using 2H in luclin not a surprise there).<br />
<br />
Once the &quot;Skill Check Coefficient&quot; is determined. (Got no parses around)<br />
<br />
It would be nice to make a few small parses with different ATK values.<br />
<br />
And to see it is possible to use this to determine mainhand weapons DPS.<br />
(Mob lvl &amp; Mitigation &amp; Player ATK are to remain the same of course)<br />
<br />
And also to see what % of the Variable Damage do we get based on those ATK values.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really doesn't matter if you use 2*damage or 25*damage.  If I say my magic formula is 25*damage/delay then the number I multiply after would be just a 2.  You get the same result.  As long as we believe a 60/30 is supposed to do twice the damage as a 30/30 (ignoring damage bonus) then obviously DPS is a linear function of damage and delay.<br />
<br />
The stuff like different skills/AAs/etc are small enough that you do not differ significantly when you lump everyone's offensive skills into one multiplier.  It is also the reason why although weapon damage is incorrectly scaled, the number 25 actually just happens to put the weapon's damage bonus to reasonable (but not exactly correct) amounts.  If the number was anything that differs signifcantly from 25 then you'd either overpresent or underrepesent damage bonus in DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just remember when calculating the offhand DPS, to subtract 1 DPS for every .5 value of the offhand weapon. That's the margin of error. <br />
<br />
Why do you call this margin of error? Without it this &quot;margin of error&quot; you would have to assume the offhand hits as much as the mainhand, just without the damage bonus. We know this is not the case. Would it be more appropriate to say that with max offensive AA on DW combo, using your attack values, the offhand gets 92% of hits as the mainhand? I say 92% because, using 25 as the multiplier, 1 dps from every .5 value equals 92% of the original calculation(alteast from your examples).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone who does a parse with that exact set of equipment, max offensive AA's, 41% haste, level 61 mob, and similar attack, it would remain accurate. <br />
<br />
You pointed out Monks are on a higher damage table, but if you had read my post, I did not compare Monks. I found the DPS of the Rogue to be off, and am assuming the Monk dps is off as well due to using the same macro that caused the Rogue DPS to be off. <br />
<br />
Let me repeat this. Max offensive AA's are different between classes. You cannot compare classes directly with all the skills I mentioned abstracted into one constant because the skills have different values for different classes.<br />
<br />
The rogue damage parse has absolutely nothing to do with a macro or otherwise, rogues do not get triple attack or flurry.<br />
<br />
This is the same reason that you can't predict bard damage with a multiplier you calculated from warriors - they have a FAR lower double attack skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
On an entirely different note :<br />
<br />
With 2100+ atk (bst+shaman+bard) when i can grab them during some raids  My most common hit with the BoW is not 2x48+37=133.  I almost never see 133 hits. Its more of 200+ maybe 230ish <br />
<br />
You are wrong. Run your own log files through a parser and have a look for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I developed a similar but more complex system to this recently using a spreadsheet. I accounted for each offensive AA, chance to dual wield, chance to triple attack etc etc etc. <br />
<br />
Like Mippo I realised you can use a scaling value for each setup to transform from damage/db/delay to dps, but unlike him mine was ((k.2.damage)+bonus)/delay.<br />
<br />
Anyway having drawn up the tables and made them accurate for myself I can now plug in any weapons and accurately predict my dps for any setup. However to be able to do it for every class and player I would require THOUSANDS of parses from people of different class and with different AA's in order to determine what effects each has on the dps. <br />
<br />
In the end I binned it as not worth the effort. I am happy that I can work out what weapons work for me.<br />
<br />
And anyway I just got my BoW. No more weapon changes for me now anyway! lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, question! Is the listed weapon delay in 1/10ths of a second? I thought the listed delay was the % of 1 tick (6 seconds). So 20 delay as I saw it was 1.2 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made some mistakes.  I don't mind making mistakes, the key is learning from them and not making them in the future.  To be honest, I did not know about Flurry.  It explains 1), why there was a margin of error in the offhand weapons, and 2) why I thought the rogue/ranger parses were under.  I fixed it now, and I also now know exactly how much DPS Flurry adds.  Now that I know this, I think it's complete and utter bullshit Monks are getting it when I look at the current ranger GoD AA's.  Hopefully one or the other changes. <br />
<br />
What I am currently in the process of doing, is exactly what many of you are describing.  <br />
<br />
I am finding the specific value for every skill, AA, or value that effects DPS in any way, shape, or form. <br />
<br />
So the final formula would be, <br />
<br />
Weapon Damage * 2 + Damage Bonus / delay<br />
<br />
Then I would list everything that has a value, and you can add all of the things that you have up, and multiply that modifier by the value of your weapon(s).  It will be able to accurately predict the DPS of any weapon in the game, with any combination of gear/AA/class when I am finished. <br />
<br />
For example, <br />
<br />
1 Offense = X<br />
1 Accuracy = Y<br />
1 Weapon Skill = Z<br />
Flurry AA = A<br />
Ambidexterity/Punishing Blade = B <br />
1% haste = C<br />
<br />
etc<br />
<br />
And you would add up everything you have to get your modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we do appreciate the work ya put into it.  What you are trying to do is even harder than what I attempted.<br />
<br />
I tried a similiar thing breaking out the AA skills under the post &quot;Impact in DPS of Critival hits AA maxed?&quot; In that post I broke out normal melee damage, critical hits, etc and came out to one main conclusion about AA skills.<br />
<br />
With the below AA skills maxed you come up with an additional 14% more total damage no matter if you do 10000000 damage or 100 damage.<br />
<br />
In that post I also break out (after corrections from my fellow warriors) percentages from procs, various AA skills and its still not exact except for the 14% from the following AA skills:<br />
<br />
9 AA ferocity maxed (double attack)<br />
12 AA combat fury maxed (critical hits)<br />
18 AA flurry maxed (flurries)<br />
9 AA fury of the ages maxed (critical hits)<br />
18 AA raging flurry x 2 trainings (flurries)<br />
6 AA Ingenuity maxed (critical spell procs)<br />
<br />
However it will take you *****72 AA points***** to generate this additional 14% total damage.<br />
<br />
Its a lot harder to break out the individual AA out but I did make a good stab at it.  Its still not perfect but is getting there.<br />
<br />
I wonder how your formula would work against my results in post.  I might try fitting it in.  Have to recuperate from my latest set of figures LOL.<br />
<br />
I went ahead and also broke out the direct normal melee damage for each weapon.  Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's actually not that hard to do, once you have some of the values in place.  I've just been really busy lately with a couple of Beta's I'm in so I put this little project on hold.  I know the value of haste, so I can accurately compare parses with different haste values by making the DPS adjustment from the haste myself.  I know the value of Accuracy etc, so if one post is done with 10 Accuracy, and another with 30, I can make the adjustment to get everything even.  Then change one specific thing that I want to check, and the DPS difference, is brought back to a value, which becomes the modifier for that skill.  Run it through 3-4 10+ hour parses to ensure the accuracy of the value, then use it to find other values.  The more values you have, the easier they are to find as you can make the adjustments manually.  The last values would be base skills, like 1 point of Offense, and 1 point of 1h slash etc.<br />
<br />
Some more parse data from the Rangers of EQhunter, if you want it. <br />
