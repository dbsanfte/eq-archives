I'm currently doing the Draconic Pauldrons quest (have the heads), yet I still need the necessary CoV faction to do the turn-ins. My question is: what is the best spot for killing/tagging to raise CoV faction other than the arena / plate house? I have a regular group with a 55 Ranger and 55 Shaman, and was hoping to find a place where the three of us could do this in a night or two. Oh, and my current CoV standing is &quot;Amiable&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

EDIT: And as far as I know only &quot;warmly&quot; is required for the turn in.</div></div><hr />

(Provided you do the 2nd subquest in Skyshrine)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks. Have a rough idea on how many helms it would take to go amiable to warmly? I'd like to price this out first, if it's to high I'll wait until the guild goes farming junk again. Money, as always, is tight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it was that many, under 100 for sure, probably about 20 I think.  I did amiable to ally that way just buy out the bazaar before you go to sleep and buy them out again when you wake up :)  I kept like an extra 40 on a mule if i need to do it again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Definently i went from medium amiable to high warmly in 10 helms. It is great although i got all helms for free because we were killing arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yisue</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">who the helms to turn in pls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhagulim</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone give a more detailed walkthrough on this?  I desperately need ally faction with CoV; I went on a small raid with my guild last night and wasn't told I needed CoV faction.  I offered to leave, was told not to, and ended up getting myself killed twice and nearly ruining the turn in for our guild leader :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">U turn the helms in to Lieutenant Milven. He is by the WL zone in Skyshrine. Zone in come through the gate and take a right then up the stairs. He will be in front of you.  We use him mostly for the very bad faction with a little help from a druid. <br />
<br />
If you are at warmly I would say kill in the arena for a few hours. It doesn't take long in the arena to go from Indiff to Ally. A good days fighting and you'll have faction, exp, and maybe a few new pieces of gear. Oh, and it's always good to get a hit in on Vindi, Statue, AOW  if someone is fighting them nearby. I usually launch a few arrows and then watch and hope they don't wipe out...lol<br />

Turning that stuff in is virtually useless for anything but +Yelinak faction now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if I was you, I would hang around in kael and try to tag along on any Vindi/Statue/AoW kills; faction hits from that are huuuuge.  Otherwise, just try and kill stuff in arena and get as deep as you can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cozlo</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just after the Skyshrine revamp ... I turned in at least two bags of helms and a bag of toes and was Indiff from start to finish.  I know I had already had some work done on Indiff too.  Friends of mine and others in my guild had experienced the same thing.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps it was remedied in one of the recent patches.</div></div><hr />

Two hours of killing in the arena to wait on peeps to arrive for Vindi and the Statue and guess what. Was ally before we even got to them. <br />
Hunting Arena mobs will get you to ally faster than collecting helms and a whole lot cheaper. The change over for the faction rate seems to be once u enter the see invis area. ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some faction levels are bigger than others.  You spend an abnormal amount of time at Glower, indiff, and amiable to CoV, and spend very little time at all in apprehensive, kindly, and warmly.<br />
<br />
It's not a linear spread.</div></div><hr />
