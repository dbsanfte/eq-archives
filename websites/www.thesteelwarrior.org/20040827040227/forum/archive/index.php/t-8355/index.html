<br />
Based on this thread and the one on TSW and talking to people in-game, the following &quot;list&quot; is the primary concerns/suggestions of the casual warrior (note:  I'm trying to retain a warrior-centric list, since this isn't a &quot;casual&quot; thing, but a warrior thing)<br />
 <br />
1. LDoN armors:  While augmentable, Royal Attendant gear is not geared toward warriors, but a generic cookie cutter &quot;best plate&quot; armor available.   Would like to see more class-oriented class-specific gear available through less raid intensive means.<br />
 <br />
2. Mid end raid content and availability:   Weapons like Bloodfrenzy, Hategiver, and Blade of Carnage are wonderful additions, but are rather limited in availability due to the &quot;public&quot; nature of the mobs who drop them.    While content like Time isn't &quot;contested&quot;, and the availability of Rallos Zek isnt' a factor in attaining a Darkblade, simply being able to beat him and getting the item on the spawn table is, the casual players don't have that luxury.   All of the spawns capable to be defeated by more casual guilds ARE contested, and are only available to a single raid force per spawn cycle.   With an ever increasing pool of people capable of defeating these encounters, the likelihood of finding it up and available is less and less.  It was bad for instance in Luclin when 3-4 guilds were fighting over Cursed, nowdays 20+ guilds are able to kill him per server.    The potential solutions are as follows:<br />
 <br />
A. Instanced &quot;Raid Content&quot; which ensures that the defeat of encounters is the roadblock and not the availability of contested spawns.<br />
 <br />
B. &quot;Raid Content&quot; which matches the difficulty and the Rewards of Velious/Luclin era content, but removes the availability factor.<br />
 <br />
C. Sticking with the plan to itemize tiers 1-3 in Planes of Power, to review and add items, and increase the value of items found there.  (Of particular interest is the potential itemization of Saryrn's Tower and all of the Plane of Torment, a ghost town currently)<br />
 <br />
D. Reintroduction of Fabled mobs to the game.   They breathed new life into many old zones, life that has been deflated again.<br />
 <br />
E. EXPANSION of Fabled type mobs.   Those were great ideas, and &quot;Fabled&quot; Kunark and Velious type mobs would also be a good idea.<br />
 <br />
F. Mid level gear in new content shouldn't be lesser than middle upper level gear from previous content (i.e. Bertoxxolouss shoudln't have lesser quality gear than Vyzh Drah the Cursed or Exiled).   <br />
 <br />
3. There's a massive weapons shortage in Gates of Discord prior to Uqua+ content.<br />
 <br />
4. Place Zoneouts in ALL zones.  If there's a &quot;safe spot&quot; there should also be a zone out.    Warriors shouldn't have to be at risk by being trapped into zones like Sol Ro Tower.   While gate potions and necks are convenient, they shouldn't be necessary during the normal course of play.   <br />
 <br />
5. Alternate Key Quest into Sol Ro Tower.   <br />
 <br />
6. Alternate Key Quest into Elementals.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Frodlin, are you intending that there might be discussion of this list and/or any further suggestions by either casual players and/or non-casual players?<br />
<br />
Could you clarify?<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm going to be forwarding this list to the community team.   While spirited debate and all is good, it's not my business to be filtering through stuff, it's their list, and their concerns.   If you want to agree or disagree, feel free, but the list won't necessarily be altered by concerns from yourself or myself or anyone who's not a casual warrior.   This is their list.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if there's rough agreement by casual warriors (as a community) on something you've come up with that doesnt' show up, then I could implement it, but things arent' going to change on the list without general agreement by casual types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The casual community might concider wether or not some revamping of LDoN would be helpful. Suggestions I've seen include:<br />
<br />
a. Make the current Difficult level Medium with the same AP reward as currently in place for a Difficult. Add a new Difficult level with 150 AP's for successful completion intended to take into account increased player power with OoW and level 70, make LDoN less of a timesink, and to allow for some higher quality mob loot drops.<br />
<br />
b. In concert with &quot;a.&quot; above, look at either guaranteeing or having a high percentage chance for one loot dropping boss mob spawning in each new Difficult adventure with a moderately extensive loot table to insure groups always have a boss mob available that drops a variety of loot.<br />
<br />
c. To insure content is always available for small guilds add 18 person medium difficulty raids.<br />
<br />
SoE might add improved tradeskill items that use components that don't drop in locked content.<br />
<br />
Concider making Ornate molds and patterns No Drop by making the mobs drop Baroque molds and patterns henceforth (turned in for the same armor) to discourage farming by those not needing the armor and keeping it available for those that do.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If LDoN scales as it has in the past, then the level 65 &quot;hard&quot; will be the level 70 &quot;normal&quot;. <br />
<br />
Remains to be seen whether they will put in a &quot;hard&quot; for level 70, but it would have to be added and tuned and who knows if they will go back and add another level.  After all they didn't go back and add a level 65 dungeon to Luclin, but then LDoN is kind of a special case.<br />
<br />
My bet would be that Oow will have it's own instanced exp dungeons, with new loot, although I wouldn't try to guess whether you will earn adventure points in them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">frod, your list is almost PERFECT in mho, good work.<br />
<br />
Could you add making the currect LDoN normal the new &quot;easy&quot; level tone down hard a little and make that &quot;medium&quot; and then make a &quot;hard&quot; level?<br />
<br />
or just use battleblades idea, and I agree 100% in making PoP armor no drop with their molds/patterns but if the dev's do that they need to give a weeks warning or something to those that buy/sell to make money.<br />
<br />
In game message board to post raids on perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just to clarify, I was suggesting making the mobs drop Baroque molds and Patterns and leaving the Ornate Molds and Patterns to disappear as the supply run out. Either way, /shrug.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigdung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Those are some good ideas. I have to admit my biggest pet peeve is that there are not enough Warrior specific gear. Maybe at the very high end of the game there is but I'm not there so I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How is ldon plate armor not geared toward warriors? It has AC, stamina, and raw hp. What more do you need that you can't fix with augs/non-visible slots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, he was referring to &quot;Baroque Molds&quot; in essence, replacing ornate molds, but creating the same armor.<br />
<br />
Usually what I've seen is that people fall into the &quot;Droppable vs. No Drop&quot; debate based on whether they have the armor or not.   If they dont' have it, they tend to prefer it be no drop to prevent greedy casters and other vile beasts from rolling for them for cash.   Once they have it on the other hand, it tends to become a viable source of income, and really only fair that it be droppable.<br />
<br />
That's the crux of the matter.   <br />
<br />
Then you have people like me, who say &quot;Hey, if it's no drop, there's a much greater likelihood that those who equip the gear, killed the mob that DROPS the gear, thus preserving some level of progression&quot;.    This is why I like the Vxed/Tipt itemization plan, because you're not going to see people who've never Seen Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru wearing his bracer.<br />
<br />
On the other hand.... 2 words sort of obfucscate that postion:   Goranga Club<br />
<br />
In other words, the best of all worlds would be to make drops occur in areas that aren't easy to get to and require a little effort, perhaps with even some see SoS mobs in the way to prevent corpse dragging/rez twink homostromy.<br />
<br />
At that point, it would be far more justifiable to put nicer gear in those areas.   <br />
<br />
When PoP was about 2 weeks old, I posted something about that monstrosity called the Windblade.    That thing should've NEVER been in Halls of Honor, it should've been in the factory in PoInnovation, and it NEVER should've been droppable.    People should've gone in to hunt for it and acquire it.   People feel better about themselves when they do something for themselves, this is no less true in EQ.  People feel better about themselves in EQ when they loot their items off a fresh kill, and begin using them right away.   Saving up scraps of platinum and becoming an accountant isn't what made EQ special, killing powerful monsters and wearing their treasures did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It is a tricky subject.<br />
<br />
The main problem(for those that are &quot;up and coming&quot;) is people doing it almost purely for profit, perhaps we could make the molds no drop but decrease the spawn rate to 3 hours instead of 6 since buying them is no longer an option and since there will be alot more crowding of camps by people who need the item but can no longer buy them, increasing the spawn rate also means players that can only play 4 hours at a time are not shit out of luck also.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with people looting rots, at least they are a high enough level to enter the zone, if memory serves me right ornate can be used by people who are not even high enough to get the level auto flag for BoT.<br />
<br />
Also letting them get their loot and move on means less crowding in the long run, and less crowding is always good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How is ldon plate armor not geared toward warriors? It has AC, stamina, and raw hp. What more do you need that you can't fix with augs/non-visible slots?<br />
<br />
The problem IMO is that it is generic, in other words, the same for Pallies/Clerics/Bards/Shadowknights/Warriors.  But then you see ornate pieces that have a little more AC/HP for a warrior than other classes, but it is missing the casting stat and mana, it would be cool to see the same thing for LDoN armors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye, lets turn all that shitty caster junk into something useful!<br />
<br />
No need for elemental level armor if they just revamped the LDoN merchants to have class armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Frod on the point about wanting to loot it myself. I have maybe 2 peices of armour that I have purchesed in the bazaar and really hate trying to save cash. Infact I dont save cash its why I usually have less then 10k in the bank acount. Making some good stuff drop off earlier PoP mobs but making it no drop and maybe level restricted would ensure that it doesnt get farmed by the same farm groups that just sit and sell it for so much in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good list. BB's LDoN/Ornate suggestions are good too, IMO. No-drop ornate molds would be good, it's 100% true that questing or killing for your gear is far more rewarding than buying it. <br />
<br />
I STILL think we need something &gt; ornate (preferably thats not from LDoN), and I really like frodlin's idea of hard to get to, good, no drop loot. We need more tipt bracers. Guaranteed drops from hard ldon assasinate bosses and something to encourage rescues seems like a worthwhile tune to LDoN, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;People feel better about themselves in EQ when they loot their items off a fresh kill, and begin using them right away.

<br />
Frod, I realize that you are trying to make a warrior-specific list here, but in whatever venue is appropriate, do try to impress upon SOE that a lot of casual suggestions in one way or another center on this concern. Even if SOE tossed every specific casual-warrior suggestion you've got listed, but somehow dealt with this concern and matched it to warrior gear, SOE would have more happy campers, I would think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I totally agree with Brabble on this. Think back to your very, very first kill in Everquest. I still remember the first thing I killed was a skeleton with a shield, and man that felt really great. Raider or not, the joy of discovering that a mob dropped an item you can use is beyond description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh, I also love killing things that gave upgrades for the character doing the killing, veksar's soulscream belt and kylong items are great examples</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">People feel better about themselves in EQ when they loot their items off a fresh kill, and begin using them right away. Saving up scraps of platinum and becoming an accountant isn't what made EQ special, killing powerful monsters and wearing their treasures did. <br />
<br />
I'm a good old fashioned roleplayer.  Among my quirks, Daggorr has a Code of honor that centers on this very Idea.  If I don't Loot it, I don't want it.  I take great pride in knowing that every item I wear was hard won.<br />
<br />
The only exception make is for bazaar items.  Even then, I try to only buy items that I cannot camp myself if possible. As my coins are hard fought for and the bazaar gives everyone equal opportunity to gear up I don't really see a problem with it.  <br />
<br />
No Drop Items are great in the respect that they are far less contested and I have a good shot at getting them.  The only problem is there is no return on them when I upgrade.  No resale, not even tribute, just a sense of waste.  Droppable Items are good for both a quick upgrade and for a badly needed plat infusion to get an upgrade but can be harder to get.<br />
<br />
In its simplest concept, I think that Placing No drop Gear in &quot;easier&quot; areas and Droppable gear in the &quot;harder&quot; areas would be a good solution.  Fight harder for the better reward.  No need to camp for weeks for an item that will someday simply be destroyed and you can still buy/sell the harder to get gear if your willing to put in the cash/time.<br />
<br />
Droppable and No-Drop loot each have their place, they just need to be balanced  carefully to keep the frustration levels down.</div></div><hr />

 A Fucking Men. Someone sticky that quote to the Dev's foreheads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Makeing loot no drop would increase the cost of sellable items and make them more rare.<br />
<br />
I think it is fair to say that most casual players bought 30-40% of the items they are wearing or more, if you had to get every item that you needed many of those slots would be empty. No drop means more farming for what you want and more of the unwanted items that drop rotting.<br />
<br />
As well with no drop items there is no more vested interst to go back to a camp after you have what it drop so it will be harder to get people back there after they get get there item or 2 from there.<br />
<br />
I would guess half or more of the ornate that drops drops in the Tower of Sol Ro and is later sold keeping the price of BoT drops down and makeing it buyable to a larger number of people.<br />
<br />
Make it harder for the uber raiders to get his alt twink in to loot something and he will get 3-4 of his equaly uber friends together march in and wipe out every mob in the way and keep them dead so his alt can walk in easily.<br />
<br />
You want many more static loot mobs than are in recent zones with dropable loot that is geared towards the people that should be camped there not a place like Tactics with 2 static named pops in one camp more like seb with around 8-12 camps each haveing there own named and another few exp only camps that could result in random trash mob items is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The no drop solution to ornate is a decent idea. Another possibility is to increase the drop rate. Both of these solutions have plusses and minusses. <br />
<br />
The idea for a meduim LDoN setting I love as well as the 18 man raid idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kalos Nathsar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, first off... currently I wouldn't even call myself a casual player ( maybe 2 nights a week for exp, other times just to log and chat), but a couple months ago I was a nightly regular. <br />
<br />
Also, I haven't read through the previous &quot;suggestion&quot; post completely, so I apologize if a thought of mine has been already discussed.<br />
<br />
These are my thoughts from what I would enjoy...<br />
<br />
1. Fables, if reimplemented, should not be permanant. Admittedly, the fables were awesome, and well worth the insane camp in most places, but obtaining an item like the FFBSS which is so &quot;rare&quot; and unique adds to the joy of looting it. You know that only a certain number of them ever dropped, and it is somewhat like a status symbol. It was an event, and it gave out event-type loot (rare and awesome), and should be kept that way. It makes owning a fabled piece of armour much more gratifying. If you want to bring new life back to a zone completely, revamp it. I wouldn't consider a group of 60's mowing their way through lguk to be &quot;breathing life back into the zone&quot; imho.<br />
<br />
An event with expansion of the Fables into Velious and Kunark would be interesting though... as long as it stayed as an event.<br />
<br />
2. I was a big bazaar rat (not the annoying type, but rather the &quot;always searching for deals&quot; type) when I did play, and most of my equipment was bought from the bazaar. But I 100% agree that I had much more pride about any item I looted myself from a mob I helped kill. The Soulscream Belt and Kylong Darkmail are great examples of that. I'm intrigued by Daggorr's idea of no-drop armour in lower lev areas... it promotes advancement through grouping and targeting specific mobs rather than farming common mobs.<br />
<br />
3. Despite the fact I use them, I hate the cookie cutter look of the SotBS and CHoS (I think this was covered in the suggestion post). Provide us warriors with some alternative 55+ level weaps or quests. I think this is what you mean by your #3 point, but I'm not very experienced with GoD zones/mobs, and wouldn't be sure if I would be able to obtain alternatives there anyways at my level.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry if I've repeated anything.. these were just my thoughts and opinions when I read Frodlin's post. Otherwise, I agree with your suggestions completely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing I would add is some additional mitigation/avoidance.  Currently warriors are just to close to pal/sk especially since their class changes wishlist include mitigation/avoidance.  We should have more mitigation/avoidance or they will be better than warriors.<br />
<br />
Not really sure what difference it makes tho, I haven't played EQ in 3 weeks.  I am waiting for what OOW does to the problem.  I just don't see a need to play a class (warrior) that apprears to be dumped in favor of paladins when OOW is released.  Not to mention the class definition lists if they get done the way they appear they will be, warriors are so screwed it isn't even funny.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this 100% and I have probably gotten more out of the bazaar than anyone in the history of EQ.  Getting big enough to do LDoN hards and earn my own gear *that was better than anything in the bazaar* was hands down the best time I've ever had in EQ since my pre-level-10 newbie days.<br />

It is a great list, even if not very *warrior focussed*.  At the same time, I that the warrior, as a class, is fairly well off (there may yet be itemization issues, I wouldn't know) and that the most significant issues to warriors are more to the general game.  In other words, aggro and survivability look well taken care of to me, and the remaining issues concern what game mechanics there are for a player to improve their character - warrior or other - to play *more better EQ*.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Gotta say I like the list. There is a rediculous derth of weapons for the non-raiding warrior after the droga pair. And the amount I am looking to spend means that I have to get into some cash camps and then get lucky with drops. <br />
<br />
I guess I have looted 80% of my gear--the cultrual and the weapons being the current exception. I certaintly remember doing the crafted quests, looting my Indilocite BP, and killing in the arena for my Champions Legs (at 59th while in Crafted Legs) far more clearly than I do buying the gear I have bought. <br />
<br />
There needs to be a medium LDoN setting (along with BB's high setting). Hard just seems to require a level trust that any pick up group I am in (assumining we even have the right classes). At this point I can do an LDoN with almost any group of classes. Now groups I tank for, assuming some sort of CC (BSTs if nothing else), can get by with shaman MH. But still Hard groups are few and far between--at least on Povar.</div></div><hr />

If I was a casual warrior, I would be more interested in whether a new tier of LDON becomes available at level 68-70, with correspondingly better loot and point rewards for those who dare to try it.</div></div><hr />

Also have to say I am so not XPing in LDoN to grind to 70.</div></div><hr />

I think it would be pretty lame of SOE not to continue the ldon progression as it has been, with group average level over 68 getting what we get now as a &quot;hard&quot; ldon as a norma, and a new level of hard. Otherwise level 70's will just stomp through the old hard's, effectively making them as lame as normals are now at level 65.<br />
<br />
It would be really cool of them to come up with new items for the new level 70 hard ldons too, but thats probably too much to ask. It would give them space to fix a lot of peoples complaints though.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but there's something to be said about being able to pull 4,5,8 mobs into camp and everyone still manages to live.  Boring it definitely isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">It has been said many times, tanks are dependent on their gear.  Maybe we are too dependent.  We are all burning through hours doing one thing or another to get an upgrade of some kind.  We are the only class that gets interviewed on a regular basis during group invites, &quot;What's your Hp and AC?&quot;  I know casters work very hard getting gear, especially flowing thought items, but I have never seen one rejected from a group becasue they ony have FT1.  The question is never even asked.  If a hard LDoN group needs an enchanter, they take any 65 chanter, and do not quiz them.   The group leaders have to interview warriors because a poorly equiped warrior willl be ripped apart doing hard zones and cause the group to wipe,  but a  poorly equiped caster, usually just slows it down with some med breaks.<br />
<br />
As has been pointed out before, a warrior needs to be further along in the game in regards to equipment than other classes to be included in a group.  This is too true. <br />
<br />
Dispite this, I must admit, I am generally happy playing a warrior and the role they have in the game.  I just feel we have to work a little bit harder than other classes to get to the same level of play.<br />

I don't see people stomping through 65 hard LDoNs at level 70, the way many 65s stomp through 65 normal LDoNs. The mobs will still be hitting for 990. Sure, there are new buffs, but the Virtue upgrade is only an additional 450 hit points. I doubt you'll see people with more then a 1000 hit points over what they have now (gear being equal, of course). That's not enough of an increase to make up for the fact that mobs are hitting 3x harder.<br />
<br />
Pulling a room of 990 hitters will shred level 68 or 70 casters and clerics pretty much just as fast as they do now. A 5K cleric (pretty easily achieved, even pre-EP) can last for a while against a couple 330 hitters in a 65 normal. That same cleric can only last 3 or 4 seconds against an unslowed 990 hitter, unless they've bought all their avoidance AAs. A lot of clerics haven't. A shaman or mage pet can tank a 65 normal mob for a pretty long period of time, they can't against a 65 hard mob.<br />
<br />
The new pacify spells don't have a - resist adjustment right now. IMO, the second biggest difference in a 65 hard LDoN is the huge lull resistance the mobs have (first being mobs hit 3x harder). Without a FD puller or a FM bard, at some point you are going to get a pull of 3 or 4+ mobs. In a normal LDoN, a cleric, enchanter, bard, or a monk can pacify a mob or two to break the room up. Don't have one of those four classes? A pet caster can off tank a mob. Or you can root them for a good long time. In a 65 hard, pretty much all you can do is mez with that many mobs. Hope you have an enchanter in your group.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the lull resistance removed in 65 hard LDoNs. It's so far out of line compared to elemental planes and GoD. Pacification works 90+% of the time in Kod'Taz, but only 20% of the time in hard LDoNs? Why?</div></div><hr />
