<br />
Wraths Edge 13/20 +3 Fire +3 Shissar Bane drops off the High priest. I was curious if this is an effective weapon against the Emp, and how often it drops off of HP.<br />
<br />
Part of this is actually needing a better understanding of how Bane weapons work in terms of does the Bane damage make this a 19/20 weapon against non-fire immune snakes and does it act the same on the Emp? Or is it a 3/20 weapon against the Emp?<br />
<br />
I have also seen some comments about not worrying about Bane weaps and using EB procs, etc to MT even though a tank won't do melee damage. Does the &quot;potential&quot; damage a tank does generate equivlent aggro then or are the tanks solely relying on the +700 hate procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">19/20 on snakes max, realistically 17/20 vs emp. Never seen one on our hp kills, tho they're pretty few (think 6 total).<br />
<br />
We tank emp w/o banes, using b.frenzy &amp; boc warriors. The potential damage output seems to sustain aggro just like normal, just you aren't really doing any save your dmg shield.<br />
<br />
If you're going to be emp MT and really want a bane, make a 2h. If you have no hope of MT unless all the other wars die, still make a 2h.</div></div><hr />

I was using wrath's edge on emp.  I was not tanking, so this is from behind.  My offhand was blackout... which did zero damage (and the blackout proc did not do damage either).<br />
<br />
My 1HS damge was 51,826.<br />
The duration was 18 minutes, 19 seconds.<br />
1HS DPS was 47.16.<br />
<br />
The proc added an additional 2,852 damage (not included in DPS figure).<br />
<br />
Not sure what you would consider &quot;effective&quot; but 47 dps against emp seemed pretty good to me, for a one handed warrior :)  Pair it with a taunt weapon and I'm sure it would be just fine.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Adding additional info below for those that are in to this kind of thing...<br />
<br />
Max hit was 169<br />
Min hit was 15<br />
Avg hit was 54<br />
<br />
Max crit was 276</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you get Wraths Edge 13/20 +3 Fire +3 Shissar Bane to become a 17/20 on emp?<br />
I thought emperor was immune to pure melee damage, so only the fire and shissar bane would hit, which would make it a 6/20 weapon on par with other shissar bane weps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Relying on elemental damage for a real world parse hitting max every time is foolish, in reality it's more like a 17 / 20 then a 19 /20 at max.<br />
<br />
And sorry but banes hit for listed + bane damage, least mine always has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look at my min, mean, and max hits from a parse of using this weapon against emp, you'll see that it certainly isn't acting like a 6/20 weapon :)<br />
<br />
My results certainly seem in line with a weapon having a damage rating somewhere between 16-19 damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, Wrath's edge is 16/19 minimum vs. Emp, with a DD proc.  Nice weapon and you don't have to farm that stupid green metal :).  47 dps vs the emperor is very respectable for a melee.<br />
<br />
I like mine.</div></div><hr />
