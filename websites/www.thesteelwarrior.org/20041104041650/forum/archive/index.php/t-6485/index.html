<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i wasnt  sure in which area i should put this, so ill try it here <br />
<br />
actually i have the 3 year version of the staff (Tormax i think)<br />
2 days ago i have my 4´th bithday in eq.<br />
my question is can i have both or must i destroy the older one to get my 4 year staff<br />
<br />
Item is lore so i think i have to destroy one, but they have different effects on it ? Magelo list it as items with different Items-Id´s.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EgatBearskinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The staff you get is based off of your character's creation date, not the &quot;age&quot; your character is.  You can redo the quest all you want and it is always going to be the same result, you can't change the date you were born on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That is true but my cousin did his staff which should have been Trakanon's Tail since the char was created in 2000 and it ended up being Mirigals rocket which is the newest one.<br />
<br />
When he did /played it said his born date was 2014 which of course is wrong but we have no idea why or how.<br />
<br />
Checked his system time thinking maybe it was pulling from that but the system time was correct on his PC.</div></div><hr />

Here's how to determine what sparklie you will get: <br />
<br />
Hit /played and look at your character's birthdate. Now check where it falls... <br />
<br />
1999 - Nagafen's Fire <br />
2000 - Trakanon's Tail <br />
2001- Tormax Candle <br />
2002 - Solusek Sparkler <br />
2003 - Miragul Rocket <br />
<br />
Also note that the years apparently go from March to March of the next year, not Jan - December. For example, a character born January of 2000 would get Nagafen's Fire, and not Trakanon's Tail. Hope that makes sense!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mine should have also  been Trakanon's Tail, but was Miragul's rocket due to my creation date showing to be the year 2020.<br />
<br />
I have petitioned, spoken with GM's, and /bug trying to correct this problem. I haven't gotten anywhere yet, but I have been petitioning every 3 days for a status update. I know the GM very well now.</div></div><hr />
