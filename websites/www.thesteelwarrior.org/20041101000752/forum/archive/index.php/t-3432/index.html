<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not concerned about which weapon generates more agro.<br />
<br />
I want to hear from people who own ( or owned ) a Sceptre of Destruction or BOC, or have owned both at some point.<br />
<br />
Which procs more an SOD or a BOC?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SoD for sure.  Used both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dual weild sod and I proc a ton<br />
<br />
I also weild boc and sod. SoD still procs a ton. However its like 3 SoD procs = 1 BoC proc in terms of hate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno about that, seems to me like SoD proc is better for hate than BoC.  But that's just in approx 2 years of usage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's funny, I have a Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled and the stun proc on it seems to be about 3/4 the hate of an EB proc in my estimation. I'd guarantee that a SoD proc would do even better.<br />
<br />
There's a reason why I offhand my BoC in favor of my Exiled sword - Blade of Carnage does not proc nearly enough to be satisfactory for me. The Exiled blade procs like there's no tomorrow and does more DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I also weild boc and sod. SoD still procs a ton. However its like 3 SoD procs = 1 BoC proc in terms of hate <br />
<br />
What a joke.  I sold my fuckin BoC because it wasn't even worth keeping around compared to SoD/Copper Hammer.  I had the so called &quot;best tradable aggro weapon&quot; bagged for 3 weeks, there is no way that the SoD is 1/3 the hate of a BoC.  It's more like equal, with a fuckload more DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks guys, I picked up an SOD and was considering imbuing it, then questioned should I have held out cash wise for a BOC.<br />
<br />
With the responses I have heard here it makes me feel i made the right decision.  Id rather have good agro with consistant procs then exellent agro once in a while, as my groups gets killed waiting for my BOC to proc, I have been there done that...<br />
<br />
BOC will stay in my main setup untill I get something better which will be a while im sure.  <br />
<br />
ATM I am considering imbuing copper hammer or RED epic blade,<br />
mixed results in diff zones, its a toss up which generates more agro in my offhand, some zones like LDON MMC (bb) my epic is almost never resisted.  IN Everfrost epic is resisted a ton.<br />
<br />
<br />
So heh, any suggestions what to imbue? CHOST, sword of the bloodsworn, or red blade for my offhand?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep. I've considered trading my BoC back in to my guild (I use SoD/GBoS almost everywhere for aggro). Really, the only use it has over those two is against mobs with insane MR (ie Emperor Ssra and Seru).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have to disagree here I have used 2x SoD, BoC and SoD, BoC and GBoS and by far the best agro combo I have found is BoC in mainhand and GBoS in offhand.  In my guild this is the prefered setup (BoC main, GBoS offhand) for all the warriors except those that got lucky with bloodfrenzy drops.  Sleeper is still asleep on Rallos Zek so SoD are quite common in my guild and really none of the warriors use them except for the new recruits that haven't gotten EB yet.<br />
<br />
For all of you people claiming SoD procs 3x as much as BoC I call BS.  Do some parsing to back that up.  Tons of parsing has already been done on BoC and it procs at the same rate as every other weapon that doesn't have an innate proc modifier like bloodfrenzy or the cleric hammers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would like to see some parsing to back what you said up Sulvar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have both , and i agree that SoD seem to proc more than BoC. Tho i think Eb is more aggro than sod, it seems that the sod procc is faster aggro, when eb procs it feels it takes a sec b4 mob turns with sod its insta turning. That said when i need max aggro i use dual eb, because to me its the best aggro. The dps you would get from SoD isnt very viable for me atleast as its partly resisted alot in higher pop. Eb is the win when it comes to aggro, tho BoC and SoD are Great weapons for aggro, both best you can buy imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deadsexy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SoD by far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Last night I was having a heck of a time keeping/getting agro off a Ranger in my group. Business as usual right?<br />
The group was 65 war, 65 wizzy, 63 cleric, 62 bard, 63 ranger.<br />
I should mention that I outlevel the ranger, and i have about 50 more AA's. She was using some axe founbd in Mistmoor LDoN adventures ( very common axe ).<br />
Unable to keep agro off this ranger i decided to fix the scenario:<br />
I lent my Blade of Carnage to the Ranger. She kept saying &quot;but you are already having a hard time maintaining agro&quot; to which i replied &quot;just trust me&quot;.<br />
Eventually she agreed to try it and took the commonly found axe out of main hand and equipped the BoC.<br />
With the Ranger using Blade of carnage in main hand i had very little trouble getting and maintaining agro using my great staff of 4 winds.<br />
The BoC would proc and the mob would snap to the ranger for a brief second, but i would get it right back.<br />
It is a sad state in this game when a weapon that is designed to aid me in getting agro REDUCES agro.<br />
The same ranger I am talking about above used to comment on my agro holding ability using the BOC Before PoP expansion came out. She had to try pretty hard to get agro off me in those days when i was a simple level 60 warrior and she a 58 ranger with neither of us having any AA otherthan run3. <br />
Now she has to jolt 4 times to get the mob off her while i use every taunt trick in the book. :PP<br />
It is my opinion that sony nerfed the BoC when PoP expansion came out, to make us warriors buy the expansion so we could go out and get better weapons.<br />
I also note that in todays game comparable weapons to the BoC are a dime a dozen. Heck i have had 5 copper hammers of striking and have seen the King that drops it spawn 7 times in a 5 hour session.<br />
Hello Sony: Can we warriors get some gear balance? Enough with the plate all stuff, enough with the weapons that are war, rng, pal, sk, brd.!!!<br />
More war only kick ass stuff to make warriors a needed commodity again.<br />
I have had my BoC bagged for weeks. I also am gonna sell it.<br />

<br />
I have had a Blade of Carnage for 2 years. It USED to be like this.<br />
It used to snap agro on proc all the time. But that was when Shadows of Luclin was a brand new expansion.<br />
These days comparable weapons are far to easily attained.<br />

This thread proves that proc rates are independent of delay and that the 10 or so diff weapons that this shaman / ranger combo parsed all proc at the same rate (procs / minute)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, if you haven't parsed it then you don't know which procs more.  My guess would be that they are the same, but I haven't parsed it either.<br />
<br />
In my experience, BoC is far better than an SoD (and yes I have both) for aggro, but YMMV.  If you think EB reduces aggro you really need your medication adjusted.</div></div><hr />

I could hold agro much easier when the Ranger had the blade of carnage equipped. We did this test for only a few mobs but it was VERY noticeable. She didnt have to cast 4 jolts, she in fact didnt have to cast ANY jolts with the BoC equipped.<br />
I am not saying EB is an agro reducer: my point is the BoC is not what it used to be compared to today's weapons.<br />
-It NEVER used to be so streaky in procs<br />
-it used to be reliable for agro<br />
<br />
I am not the only warrior who has it bagged.<br />
ex: Haas<br />
If you are happy with a BoC great for you. I am not about to talk to you about getting medication because we disagree and posted my experience last night more for amusement than ridicule.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">At least post the weapon the ranger was using then.  I don't care if you don't like the BoC, but you are posting an anecdote about an experience group and drawing a pretty outrageous conclusion from it.  <br />
<br />
You are making assertions about thinks like &quot;streakyness&quot; with regard to the BoC with no evidence other than what it &quot;seems like&quot; to you.<br />
<br />
That kind of thing doesn't fly on this board.  EQ is full of superstitions about proc rates and aggro and the speed of jboots after a patch.  If you're going to make assertions like this, with nothing but an anecdote that leaves out countless variables to back it up, then expect to get called on it.  What we are looking for is real data.  Not anecdotes about ranger axes and BoC's making your aggro worse.<br />
<br />
GSot4W is a great aggro weapon btw, and I can't stand monks with them that don't manage their aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LMAO I think you have just found the solution to all warrior agro problems.  We just need to get all rogues / rangers / sks and pallies to start using Enraging Blow weapons to reduce their agro so we can taunt off them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Indeed.<br />
Thanks for understanding my comment on what a Joke things have become.<br />
As to the axe the BoC replaced it was called Stained axe of the scions. Here is a link to it:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23208<br />
Certainly not &quot;Uber&quot; agro.<br />
You are correct, i have no data other than what I witnessed in gameplay.<br />
Using the stained axe i didnt get agro until she jolted several times, using the blade of carnage she didnt have to use jolt and i got agro on my first taunt key press each time.<br />
After we all laughed at how &quot;useless&quot; the BoC is she returned it to me and i bagged it yet again and we returned to her having agro for 50% of the fight.<br />
Maybe i have the only broken BoC in the game. <br />

If you are claiming that axe is better aggro than a BoC then you are claiming that EB is an aggro reducer.  That axe is slower, has a worse ratio, and has no proc.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The answer is that anything can happen for 4 fights.  If you and her are both paying attention, you should be able to keep aggro off of her using your GSot4W even if she is using a BoC.  There is a lot more to aggro than what proc you are using.  That doesn't mean that the BoC has been nerfed.  There is nothing objective to indicate that it has.  I had a BoC before PoP, and I use one now.  If anything I find it much easier to hold aggro now, since taunt was improved significantly at the start of PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I am not going to waste my time in parses when I KNOW what i saw happen. I KNOW that my j-boots are slower.<br />
<br />
That statement in only slightly less assinine than comparing a Stained Axe of the Scions to a BoC for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Unless you're using a bloodfrenzy your eb rate from main hand will be less then spectacular, that said BoC isn't that bad as some are trying to point it out to be. Compared to a sod? I found myself with more short term agro problems when I bagged my sod, take it for what you will. Neither tho are the savior of warrior agro, not even close.</div></div><hr />

This is not to say that you dont have such information, however, if you want others to post factual information, it would probably help more to post facts, and make this a 'factual' discussion, instead of just demeaning someone else for not posting facts.</div></div><hr />

Havent any of you done silly things to amuse yourselves in this game?<br />
Like the time I decided to tank in POV without my normal BP on because when I looted my corpse the banded tunic I was carrying went into my chest slot and my healer noticed no difference in the amount of time required between his Cheals.

The BoC has been around for 2 years, and has generally been considered a major upgrade from the SoD.  Thousands of people have upgraded their SoDs for BoCs since the Enraging Blow proc was added to it in early Luclin.  I'm not the one showing up here saying that &quot;it sucks&quot; or it was &quot;nerfed&quot; with nothing to back it up, so I don't think the burden of proof lies with me here.  That said, when I get a chance, I will get my SoD off of my SK twink and run a parse on SoD vs BoC proc rate just to put a stop to the rampant speculation that is going on with regard to these two weapons lately.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to prove anything, I just want to see some data to back up what you're saying if you're going to give people advice that differs greatly from the common wisdom of the warrior community.</div></div><hr />

a serious question!<br />

A. The BoC has about half the proc rate of the avg?. (i.e. 1 per minute rather than 2 per minute)<br />
<br />
B. The Augment you put on an item is directly linked to the weapon's proc rate? E.G. on BoC ykesha 510 pt aug goes off once per minute; on CHoS it goes off twice per minute?<br />

Man, it sure fuckin feels like it sometimes because I've seen that SoD rip off 4 or 5 procs in a 10 second period, and I rarely go a minute or more without one, but I know the research that has been done, and i'm not about to make that claim without the shit to back it up.  Maybe i'll go to Kael tonite and fuck up the Recruiter for awhile.<br />
<br />
My personal experience however says that the SoD is better for aggro.  I'm playing favorites, I like my SoD, and I dumped the BoC because I had it bagged for like 3 weeks.  SoD/Copper Hammer adds like 10-15 DPS for me from procs alone, that's a huge deal for me since I do XP camps for the most part and very little raiding.  I'll be honest and say that I always thought Enraging blow was the highlight of the warrior class as well, but after the novelty wore off, the BoC really didn't impress me at all.  1 EB proc will lock aggro...that's a given.  But the flipside is that 1 Anarchy or 1 force shock will do the same, with a DD attached.  Why the fuck bother with Enraging Blow?  I'm not seeing a reason, other than having a 100hp weapon, which I don't need as badly as 300kpp.</div></div><hr />

It is a sad state in this game when a weapon that is designed to aid me in getting agro REDUCES agro.<br />
<br />
It is my opinion that sony nerfed the BoC when PoP expansion came out, to make us warriors buy the expansion so we could go out and get better weapons. I don't see how you can take offense when you post something like this and people call you out. No where in your post did you allude to it being a joke or just for your amusement. Posting stuff like this without some sort of parsing to back up some pretty strong statements is going to get a lot of response, that should be pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
Normally, Haass and I have a difference of opinions because of our different play styles, however his explanation for why he chose to sell his BoC in favor of an SoD is the most logical reason I have seen anyone post as to why you shouldn't use a BoC. Maybe it's not for everyone depending on their play style, but even Haass would agree that it is one of the best agro weapons for someone who s concerned with locking down agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Here ya go, fresh off the recruiter, ~30 minute parses.  I don't have my BoC anymore unfortunately, but you get the SoD and Copper Hammer results.<br />
<br />
Pertinent information -- <br />
<br />
--228 Dex.  I could have capped it at 280, but I was AFK and i don't care enough to cast avatar on myself 6 times just to prove people wrong.<br />
<br />
-- I have ambidex, and Flurry 2.<br />
<br />
-- 36% haste, again, too lazy to add any buffs other than Focus.<br />
<br />
On to the info, first run, just under 33 minutes, SoD Mainhand, Copper Hammer offhand.  <br />
<br />
52 Anarchy, 1.57 per minute<br />
35 Force Shock 1.06 per minute.<br />
<br />
Second run Copper Hammer Main, SoD offhand, 31:40 for time.<br />
<br />
58 Force Shock, 1.83 per min.<br />
27 Anarchy, 0.85 per min.<br />
<br />
Small sample size, so slightly larger margin of error, but I think you get the idea.  (For the numbskulls, no you can not assume that the Hammer procs more than the SoD, it's streaky and half an hour isn't enough to outweigh it).  The SoD procs just as much as any other weapon, no more, no less.  If it was coded to have a higher proc rate, it would have been clearly visible, ala cleric hammer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Haass, what do you mean by &quot;recruiter&quot;.  I'd love to do some parsing also.. Hate to go to Katta.. ugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">At the entrance to Kael from Eastern wastes is a Kromriff Recruiter.  He's Perma Rooted, green to pretty much everyone, and he regens faster than I can melee him down...even with 100% haste.  With Replenishment and my Fungi Tunic, it took him about half an hour to knock my HP down to berserk, so yes, he does fight back, but it's nothing that insurmountable if you've got a healing class sitting near ya.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Anyone know of or ever parsed the proc rate of Epic Red blade?  What about the proc rate on the CHSD that drops off of the POI Dragon?<br />
<br />
Would LUV to see the proc rates of these weapons and how they stack up agains the weapons mentioned above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">There is a CHSD parse on this board a few topics down.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>TheGiantOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I duel wield 2 sod's and love the action.  30 + procs against one mob.  Considering 288 on 7/8 of them and 576 on other 1/8 (with 3 trainings in ingenuity 3 - crit blasts) these weapons rock.<br />
<br />
I plan to add another 150 + weapon proc type 4 aug onto these two to increase the aggro even more so I can have the following as a possibility:<br />
<br />
SoD 1 = 438 + 438 additional crit blasts = 876 possible dam/procs<br />
SoD 2 = 438 + 438 additional crit blasts = 876 possible dam/procs<br />
<br />
Not bad anywhere from 13000 - 26280 additional damage against a single non uber mob in a single fight.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the aggro from every time they proc the interrupt 0 sec stun kicks in (whether or not mob is immune or not to that portion) will increase your aggro a lot.<br />
<br />
Did a test using the sod's came up 83.04 dps.<br />
<br />
So my choice would be sod's hands down.</div></div><hr />
