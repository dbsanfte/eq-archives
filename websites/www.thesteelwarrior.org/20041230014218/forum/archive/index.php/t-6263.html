<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tunk</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious how many AAs other warriors have gotten before they opted to finish off their marshall title. I'm currently at 120 AAs and still a veteran. With GoD AAs I could easily spend 180+ on things better than those required for my marshall title, but vanity has finally caught up with me and I've deceided to do ambi + double riposite to get that stupid title. I can't think of any other class that would have 100+ AAs without their class title.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If i hadn't gotten the earthshaker I would probably not of gotten Marshall until well into my 200's.<br />

With Gates you can easily argue that there are another 90 AA that you need before you need the vanity title, so I'd expect your average &quot;working tank&quot; to have well over 200 AA before getting Marshall these days.</div></div><hr />

Once I got the title, then I got the important AA's</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looted mine from Master Yael two years ago. :)<br />
<br />
I held off on getting Marshall for a while, but decided ambidexterity was useful, and since I already had rampage, it was pretty easy. <br />
<br />
This was very early in PoP though. With GoD it might actually be a little different, since WA and Sturdiness are so useful. Still, &quot;Veteran&quot; is stupid, and I'm happy to be a Marshall. Ultimately it's a game, and min-maxing very tiny advantages in getting things you'll get eventually anyway is pretty pointless. If you want to be a Marshall, go ahead and get ambi and rampage or whatever. It's not like those are totally useless, even if not quite as powerful as something else. It doesn't really matter in the long run.</div></div><hr />

I was going to break down and buy ambidex to get it (already got PE, Ramp, AET)  but since I looted a BoW this weekend I'm gonna have to wait for Flurry to be a marshall heh.  Probably be around 200 AAs before I'm a marshall now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was a long way in for me, pre-GoD. I have all the defensives, hp and things like punishing blade, ferocity, stalwart endurance, and hastened instigation before I went back for the Flurry AAs to add to AET, PE and Ambidex.<br />
<br />
I always liked &quot;Veteran&quot; better: it didn't seem as pretentious :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Marshall pretty much means old school now :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I'll probably be between 180-200 before I'm a Marshal, depending on whether I get a weapon/aug worthy of maxing out WA before I get around to Flurry.</div></div><hr />

50k for an Earthshaker??<br />

Paid 500pp for mine and that was even after the post here aout clearing fire mobs with it.</div></div><hr />

I can't think of any other class that would have 100+ AAs without their class title.You'd be surprised. My wizard didn't get his class title until 220 AA.</div></div><hr />

I went the CF3/Flurry route, but I 2h usually.<br />
<br />
You put in a lot of effort to get where you are in the short time you have had on Stromm.  The cosmetics of the title is a deserved reward.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help you tank better, of course, but you are ahead of the curve.</div></div><hr />

Right about the time pop came out i was marshall.  Wouldn't change my title for anything :) With GoD aa's n such i can see alot of newer players getting well over 200 aa still veteran title</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayida</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's kind of odd actually, even on FV server, I'm seeing significant negative reactions to warriors who get their Marshall title before the infinite stream of defensive AAs.<br />
<br />
I'm progessing along on my defensive AA quite nicely, having recently completed the CA/ND/CS3 and PE routine, and starting on IR5/ID5, but even so I'm finding folks regularly who do &quot;what defensive AA do you have?&quot; and &quot;well you're not *wasting* any points anywhere else are you?&quot; and so forth.  I don't see folks running around badgering other classes about what AA they have, not to this extent at least. <br />
<br />
Perhaps it's be that we're not considered *effective* until we have those, and those warriors without defensive AA get the looks of horror reserved for 60+ clerics who don't have complete heal or virtue.<br />
<br />
At any rate, Veteran these days seems to be a bit of an honor title more than Marshall, unless you're old enough to have had Marshall before PoP or everyone knows you have 200+ AA.  It means that you're &quot;not frivolous&quot;, if you're a Veteran. <br />

<br />
Fuck em.  I got Marshall at 42aa, and I don't regret it in the slightest.  The game should be fun.  To me, Marshall is fun.  Grinding out 200 defensive AA's isn't.</div></div><hr />

If you're not, there's going to be another warrior who is, and he'll be a better resource for that guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could easily hit 200 useful AA before I get Elder title for my beastlord, but I'm vain and nobody really cares what AAs I have other than MGB, pet hold, and paragon so I'm getting elder in 2 more AA.</div></div><hr />

I did it the flurry route after all my defensive AAs and ferocity/PB. I turned on titles again for some reason, and I saw I was a marshall. Completely shocked me, it hadn't even occured to me that I should be one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only benefit I'd think the title might have for pickup groups is at least you know the person got 42 AA or more and in most cases they got a lot more.  If they're a veteran, they might only have 18 AA.</div></div><hr />

I think Clerics generally also wait a long time to get their class title.  To get Exarch, I think most get Innate IVU, a pretty useless AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">around 92 aa for me.  Did PE, AETaunt, Rampage, Dbl Riposte 2.  Dont regret it one bit.  Only folks who look down on me for getting it before i finished ID5 are jackasses who forgot that some folks definition of fun differs from their own.  To each his own I suppose.</div></div><hr />

It funny because one of my RL friends is an SK and got the horse and solo'ing AA's first.
