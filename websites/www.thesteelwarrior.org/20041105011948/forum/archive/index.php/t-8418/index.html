<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no idea what the raid situation is like on PvP servers much less how well they progress.. so I couldn't tell ya about getting Time gear.  However, it's my opinion that Warriors totally suck at PvP, for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>meatshieldd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's my opinion that Warriors totally suck at PvP, for the most part.<br />

<br />
good then its not just me<br />
<br />
<br />
could you share with me what its like on your server in regards to raids??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the best war useable drop for PvP is in time : Shuriken of Eternity<br />
<br />
BTW : the only other item that a war need is punice stone (200 is barely enougth), and lots of potions (DoT to get ride of mez, DS, Heal, Gate, Shadow step, cure, sow, spirit of cheeta,  ...)<br />
<br />
so to survive in PvP server you need to be permanently /ananimous, shrinked, sowed and invisible. as soon as there is mezer in the zone, dot yourself. when you start a fight : pumice all what you can (pumicing a charm pet is the wothest thing because when you will dispell the charm ...), then get into melee (if your opponent is meleing hard put DS) start with ToD (slow) if it's resisted then journeyman stick (tash). use a snare whip to prevent runners (for kitters : shadowstep then melee with Snare whip till success). DH is shit dps even with crit so don't use it out of furious. (I don't remember if fear spell works in pvp, if yes there is an 2H axe than proc fear...). the best PvP dps weapon are the swarming pet for melee, and the shuriken of eternity for range (both EP+). otherwise standard strong dps. augment your weapons with stuns, even if they are 0s you can get lucky and interupt a caster.<br />
if you get snared, dot, debuff ... then pumice yourself (or cure yourself). if you can't stand the fight click shadowstep and then either try to get back into melee or click gate.<br />
if the non charmed pet is too hard, then Gold Plated Koshigatana proc Dismiss Summoned.<br />
<br />
NOT : but yes war sucks at PvP, even with all the clickies you can use, you will allways find some classes that you can't face, like an SK that use HT very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">one funny trick too is to get an earthshaker, click spirit of cheeta, run around the whole zone, head back to the group of players that has angaged you, as soon as in meleee, drop all your haste, wait that the train arrive then click fortitude, then rampage then gate. the train will help you to caste multiple time the earthshaker, and even if you didn't killed them, the train will finish them off (but this last part is agaisnt the eula isn't it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The GM's on PvP servers have for the most part let PvP become a free for all, very few rules exist.  I hear from some friends and family of mine who still play on them that they are cracking down a bit recently because of the extremes people are going to in order to &quot;cock block&quot; content.  I spent four years on a PvP server and moved off about a year ago and haven't really looked back.  The PvP servers used to be enjoyable because the player community as well as the GM's used to enforce some basic rules, such as loot and scoot, no bind rushing, no training, etc.  Now it's pretty much a free for all, do what you want, be as lame as you want.<br />
<br />
Having said that, a family member of mine, a 65 warrior with elemental and time gear, kicks ass in PvP.  Warriors can crit and crip for insane damage with high damage 2H weapons, and can take out casters very quickly.  Also, they have the HP's to take a lot of damage and still survive.  In order for a warrior to be good in PvP they need excellent gear and they need resists in the 200+ range unbuffed for all resists, the warrior I'm speaking of is closer to the 300+ range unbuffed in all resists.<br />
<br />
Warriors with sub-par resists and sub-par gear suck in PvP and will get owned.  Warriors with great gear will kick ass in PvP.  That can be said for pretty much any class in PvP nowadays, skill is only a small part of the equation.  If you don't have a lot of playtime to get into the top guilds and get the best gear, then expect to get your ass handed to you repeatedly by people with better gear than you.  If you really want to stay on a PvP server then suck it up and get used to it, and learn to log when you're being cc'd.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, and yes you need potions.  SoW potions are a must.  Cure disease and poision.  Pumice.  Gate potions.  Also, buff order is important as is leaving a top slot open for nasty dots so that you can dispell them.  That is where the strategy comes in.  Basically plan on spending twice as long to level and get aa's or so due to PvP issues, and just get used to it.  If you don't like it, change servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You don't need Time for good resists either. Elemental is where you start getting Raex, etc. Vex Thal also has some good gear for resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Out of curiousity, which PVP server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jarrae Halliwax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Warriors and PvP...  Warriors soloing players is pretty similar to warriors soloing mobs.  It works some of the time, but not often.  If you are in a group and engage in a PvP battle a warrior is pretty handy to have in a group.  I tend to start the fight by standing back and pumicing.  Once I get sick of that I jump into the fight with a big 2 hander (don't forget your /disc either.)  No you won't beat the Time equiped player, but if you might be able to drive one or two of them out of the zone.</div></div><hr />
