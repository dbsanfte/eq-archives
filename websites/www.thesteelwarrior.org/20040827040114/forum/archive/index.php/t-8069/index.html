<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My bot machine is a Dell P4 1.8 Ghz, 256 mb of ram, and a GForce MXsomething card, not real sure on the card.  But it runs EQ fine... takes forever and a day to zone into Natimbi sometimes but other then that it runs EQ fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Marrgill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sheesh, your laptop is better than the desktop I normally play EQ on. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sis chipsets are generally not very good, and have many issues with EQ especially after the directx9 engine was put in.  Mostly because of the way SiS chipsets handle transparencies and zbuffering. For everyone out there avoid SiS video chipsets at all costs.</div></div><hr />
