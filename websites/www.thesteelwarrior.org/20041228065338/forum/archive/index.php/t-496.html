This is sort of a poll, but I am hoping to hear your interesting anecdotes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimo_Sabbi</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally like the RZ script, not many people do though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
caveat: Rallos Zek might be the most &quot;satisfying&quot; since we worked so hard for weeks for that eventual victory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rallos Zek once you get him down to farming status.  After hundreds of hours of blood, sweat and muthaf-ing beers to be able to zone in and kill him in 70 minutes makes it all worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

Did it every night for a week and got it on the 5th try.  Although that might change when rallos dies, that freakin event has been kicking the crap out of us and many dances of joy will be done when the bugger falls im sure hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not the hardest, or the one with the most loot.<br />
<br />
But YOU KNOW he's the keeper to candyland. YOU WANT to kill him.<br />
But something always goes bad and you fail over &amp; over.<br />
<br />
Killed Fenin/Xenogy/Coirnav  GitalakaRAPER in EarthB.<br />
(And every mob in PoP so far)<br />
<br />
And none made me as happy as RZTW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Xanamech Nirthafen (Sp?) in PoI lol oh well toughest mob i have fought and he looks so funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no such thing as a gimp reply :)<br />
<br />
If you found the fight hard. The risks immense.<br />
The challenge there. Then its a good fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn i still have cold sweat when i hear &quot;Flurry Drake&quot;<br />
<br />
And they would barely dent me now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL thanks Emilia.<br />
<br />
Most people are like oh my toughest kill was Ubermob_110 flagged for days got lots of blood/weps/keys and then we pwned him makes me feel a little weak hehe but those guys play alot and are in top guilds of their servers. <br />
<br />
But, Yeah Xanamech gave me a big rush we started wiping at 2% but lasted and got some cool loot.<br />
<br />
Thanks emilia that made me feel better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL anyone who is worried about their lack of uberness listen up..<br />
<br />
So far the coolest thing in PoP was when I failed the PoN hedge quest for the flag to CoD or whatever you get from that. I won a Twisted Longbow !yahoo!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be Fighting the Rathe &amp; racing for 1st in PoTime if my RL hadnt interfeered.<br />
That put aside, i dont think people have to be ashamed of their lvl.<br />
Or their guilds, or what they kill, or their gear.<br />
<br />
I remember FEARING Emperor Crush<br />
I remember PRAYING Dvinn wouldnt pop<br />
I remember OMFG when i first saw Vox<br />
I remember MAMA HELP when i saw Vindicator<br />
And the list goes on and on and on for ever.<br />
<br />
Agreed, been there done that. But as a person that was in your<br />
shoes a long time ago, i think its disrespectfull to frown upon &quot;lowbies&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fenin Ro eats Vindicators for lunch. BUT<br />
FR will be the same challenge for 50 lvl65 as Vindic for 50 lvl50.<br />
<br />
Be proud of what you do. And dont be impressed by us &quot;ubers&quot;.<br />
We were in your shoes, pissing in our pants some time ago too.<br />
<br />
Ask any old school tank what remains his worse nightmare.<br />
He'll say green flurry drake. If he doesnt he's probably lying :)<br />
Flurry drakes were absolutely monstrous (green ones slowed you)<br />
<br />
5k hp at max.  Quad700 + Flurry every single round. Absolute fear factor.<br />
<br />
Today Fenin doesnt scare me as much as the flurry did back then.<br />
<br />
<br />
 The challenge is not killing Mob01. <br />
Its killing Mob01 that will kick your ass bigtime on the smallest mistake. <br />
The fact it may be FR , Vindicator , Vox  doesnt really matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me this is a no brainer. I love the Xegony encounter and the Coirnav fight is a ton of fun too. However, my favorite single PoP fight to day has got to be against Warlord Prolaz. Why Prolaz?? In a freak occurence with all of the planets aligned, I was able to tank Prolaz for 4 full rounds of melee once. For a wizard that is pretty amazing, the chances of all of the heals landing in time is astronomical. Made for a lot of laughs when the rampage tank died and I didn't. Here is my favorite screen shot of the event - over 17k damage in about 10 seconds:<br />

Green Flurry is the stuff of nightmares.<br />
<br />
gawdz I hate that slow.</div></div><hr />

Not my best moment but it sure was funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and he tanked it from about 80% down.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The RZ script has to be the most satisfying so far in PoP.  It was so satisfying for me because after the long hours and many deaths of learning the script, once hes dead and you got the script down, there isn't a much better feeling.  Fennin Ro comes in at a close second just becasue his script is pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah RZ script was the best imo. <br />
<br />
It ranks up there along with the first Sontalak and first Avatar of War kill for me. <br />
<br />
The common theme here is when something is hard and takes alot of practice to get right, then it is so much more rewarding when it finally dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild is focusing on entry to Vex Thal to gear up before tackling pop, so we've done about every mob in Velious and Luclin, save Seru, and have only done AD, Grummus, Behemoth, TT, etc, in PoP.<br />
<br />
I have to say that of all the mobs I've fought so far, none was quite as much fun as the Avatar of War. He's just exciting to MT.<br />
<br />
Cursed is annoying, Emp is even more annoying, but AoW was just pure &quot;My GOD this guy's big, and my GOD he hurts!!!&quot; fun. Quite a rush to MT him your first few times.<br />
<br />
Nothing quite compares to it. Cursed AE 2k? 4k? dot, I can't remember which, is annoying, the emp's AE's are also annoying, and I hear it just gets worse in PoP. <br />
<br />
I know the title is, what's the most fun fight in PoP, but, I guess my point is, fights in PoP I've seen thus far are more annoying than fun. The older fights tho, those were still fun.<br />
<br />
Ahhhh well, the time of the fun fights are going, I guess =)</div></div><hr />

We have gotten to the point where psuedo Rallos goes away and we all succor/TL/Gate outta there... now it's just a question of getting the real bad ass to take a dirt nap and open the elemental loot pinata! :D<br />
<br />
We try again tonight.... wish me luck!<br />

Simply because when you see what your up against, everyone is thinking to themselves,  'No way in hell this is gonna work'.  Their is also something about taking more than 2 and a half million damage durring a battle that is kinda funky.<br />

Hands down the most intense feeling in all my EQ history. I was litterally cringing in my chair screaming obscenities at my computer monitor when we were at the final stages. Upon winning I jumped out of my chair in happiness and the oncoming /gu spam was insane!!<br />

Props to ANYONE who beats this. Its a monumental achievement!</div></div><hr />

Although my favorite was always Blue, esp when short of stunners/manadrainers. :-)<br />
<br />
Yeah, never be embarassed about where you are. If you think Xena is tough, well, hell, even the uberest guilds couldn't kill Trakanon for the longest time.<br />
<br />
Back on topic...<br />
<br />
Wanna see how sick and twisted I am? Trails. :-) Execution might be my least favorite, as IMO the rest of em require a bit more thought. But Trails were my most (and, of course, LEAST) favorite.</div></div><hr />

I had 7k hps then and I still hated them.  But the most satisfying has got to be beating the rathe council.

<br />
Good :Luck to anyone and grats to all who have overcome this challenge.<br />

Sad thing is knowing one of these Avatar's is gonna get owned by like 10 people sooon lol it always happens</div></div><hr />

And I got the bow off him and didn't feel guilty cuz we've gotten 3 TZ bows and 2 Seru bows in the past 2 weeks! Grats me!</div></div><hr />

And no the design of this encounter means it will never be do-able by 10 people. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-Kai-</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are working on RZTW encounter now and so far it seems boring...knowing that you can go right back and do it over and over makes it less exciting.  AoW was still the most satisfying...for a warrior, that has to be tops...especially if he is slashing :D and knowing if you lose...you just lost a BoC .  Emp was satisfying...knowing door to VT was finally open.  MM fight was also pretty awesome...with the adds and all, seemed much tougher than bertox and was final flag for Solro.  Oooo...and green flurry drakes....that is just wrong...slowing you with no cure..thats just evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Click</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say TT was my most satisfying fight in PoP. Being one of the if not the first tank to test her out in EQ, and working hard at her over the next month or two of PoP made killing her so much more rewarding.</div></div><hr />

We killed him last night &amp; all I could think of while they were doing loot was get me the hell outta here now.<br />

The only good thing about that graveyard is its awesome incentive to not die.</div></div><hr />

And I even Had the Pleasure of Tanking a few of them, so the Ranger could do more DMG with his Bow Crits, was a Rush, fighting a mob that could hit me for 800 and I have 2300 HP.</div></div><hr />
