<br />
this true?<br />
<br />
if it is its about danged time they squished that bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it's good news except that cornering is impossible now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Debbin</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no shit cornering cant be done.  this was the second time we wiped on LMM due to the fucking stupidty of SoE.  We had him down to 10% when he warped to his spawn point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">him poping back to spawn is something else tho right? never attacked that mob personally.<br />
<br />
he is on a chain or gates?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;him poping back to spawn is something else tho right?&quot;<br />
<br />
No. It's directly related.<br />
<br />
Z-axis, and zone geometry is all messed up right now.<br />
<br />
Exhibit 1: Arrows not disappearing. That screenshot that's made the rounds was hilarious. That's been fixed.<br />
<br />
Exhibit 2: /rewind ... that it even exists shows they knew geometry was getting borked.<br />
<br />
Exhibit 3: Getting stuck in walls. People just get stuck in walls now. Walls they have no business getting stuck in.<br />
<br />
Exhibit 4: No more cornering. Mobs all over Norrath and Luclin are WARPING if you push them in a wall. Fighting Vex Thal nameds like this tonight ... NOT FUN.<br />
<br />
Exhibit 5: Riding around on a horse. My head gets detatched from body and starts having seizures on the screen. I can't target a damn thing and I can barely see through bits and pieces of my head. What the hell? This is completely related to z-axis tampering as I only have this problem when MOVING on a horse. Gong over terrain starts the wobbling, which brings on the discorporeal siezure look. Standing still, I'm fine.<br />
<br />
Exhibit 6: I can't go over a rock or a stone on horseback. That's just sad.<br />
<br />
Exhibit 7: Steps. My halfling can't walk or JUMP up the steps at Bandit 1 camp in PALUDAL FREAKIN CAVERNS. This isn't some bullshit, haha look at the funny shorty try to jump up the steps in Kael type of prank. This is some buggy ass, z-axis tampered with CODING that makes those tent steps completely insurmountable for vertically challenged races. Oh, to be a freakin' Ogre Warrior instead!<br />
<br />
Exibit 8: MAPS. The maps fade out when you elevate in a zone. You need to be on an even keel or right on top of something for it to be visible on your map. That makes the thing completely useless in some really tight spots where it used to come in handy.<br />
<br />
Exibit 8A: I can't use my map underwater. At all. <br />
<br />
Exhibit 9: The ghosting effect. Mobs get pushed around more now due to this collision crap. And it has something to do with z-axis as well. I see mobs ghost in the middle of a fight. AWAY from me.<br />
<br />
Exhibit 10: I was walking through Mistmoore Castle (the old school zone itself, not the LDoN ... I was working on the fireworkds quest today, which is how I had occasion to use my horse a lot AND go swimming while using a map ... but I digress, BACK to Mistmoore) ... I was walking through Mistmoore and my view had a line that cut through the middle of my screen. The top half started to slide a bit. Then it'd jump back into place really quickly. This happened when I would run up this one staircase, while approaching this hallway where I was camping Gargoyles. It happened everytime. Going UP steps. Z-axis graphics nonsense yet again.<br />
<br />
No ... this is not a coincidence. This is directly related to the stuff they are tinkering with in game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizef</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My barbarian shaman shrunk can not get out of water.<br />
<br />
Was stunk in the water pool in Sol B. I had to run a wizzie in to evac him out.<br />
<br />
<br />
In time Phase 3 I had try 4 or 5 times to get out of the lava. I kept poping back down to the bottom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Line of sight issues are drastically improved but mobs are more difficult to corner pin, usually resulting in the person being sent to the zone safe spot and the mob warping back to spawn.  The drawbacks &gt; benefits at this point until they can fix the few bugs that remain.<br />
<br />
On a different note, arrows and shurikens are still getting stuck on terrain and walls; not sure if this is intended or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had my zerkers axe get stuck in a wall last night... wtf? LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in PoAir the other day and a bunch of mobs were totally invisible to me except for their targeting ring.  I think thier images might have been displaced above or below me so that they were on the other side of the floor or ceiling.  They still hit me and I was able to hit them but it kind of sucked tanking them.<br />
<br />
Also--I have noticed that my arrows are not running into the ground as much now.  A few weeks ago, when I would use my bow, I would see a lot of my arrows drop into the ground but now they go parallel to the ground for a longer distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been dropped through the walls in SRT and Agnarr's Tower.  I've had AoW climbing walls so that I could not hit him but everyone else could...maybe he climbed all the arrows in the wall.<br />
<br />
It is inexcusable that SOE knew about these issues and released this anyway.... and I want to thank SOE for that.  Every day SOE further justifies my decision to quit EQ the moment WoW comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The arrow trick is hilarious when you want to do it. Nothing like 50 arrows flying into an orc pawn at 10 different angles ^_^</div></div><hr />
