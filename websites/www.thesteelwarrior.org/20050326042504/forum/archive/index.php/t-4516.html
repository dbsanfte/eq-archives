A first few snakes are pretty easy I wouldnt recomend trying with less then 4 groups to have any chance to win the cycle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We usually do him with about 30.  We do it as a ranged fight to stay away from his AE Charm.  MT, RT, and a Bard stand under him and fight.  Our tanks get to 400ish Magic Resist with GoD and Bard song and don't have any trouble with charm.<br />
<br />
Healers/Debuffers stay as far back as possible.  Then break out the Bows and the Nukes.  And NO pets allowed.<br />
<br />
Not sure of the exact range on his Charm.  My monk gets too close using his 100 range Shurikens but the other monks are fine if they are using Shissar Fangs with 170 range.<br />
<br />
Have the tanks lock him down and then burn him down.  Takes 15-20 minutes depending on raid size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We fight him. In melee range.<br />
<br />
We just time the firing of his AEs. It's actually a simple fight once you get his AE down pat.<br />
<br />
Position him right, and then do what I like to call the &quot;cursed dance&quot; or the &quot;snake waltz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Take him out easy.<br />
<br />
But to the original poster, I'd do what the person above suggested ... look for XTC and go from there. The Sraa bosses really are sort of a progression of tactics. Knowing how to beat XTC, and beating him with ease, will invariably help refine you for High Priest and Cursed, who will get you ready for Emperor.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Sraa raids can be a blast sometimes.<br />
<br />
Other times, eh, it's just snake, snake, snake, snake GOOSE<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">his melee is rather weak, keeping the MT up will be easy. i know of 1 guild that only had 1 cleric and a few of druids do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cursed has 2 aes doesnt he ? 1 is ae charm &amp; other is some dd I thought ?<br />
<br />
I dunt remember been forever since I fought him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes 2 AE's, the disease based charm which is easy to resist and then the AE 500 dot which is poison based and hard to resist, I forget the resist check.  It's pretty trivial though if you just fight him all ranged and keep him slowed the whole time, provided you also have good positioning(what walls to use and such).  Clerics with decent mana regen buffs/ft should be able to gain mana over the course of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slagfest</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try the Rhag/Arch Lich cycle or XtC and see how that goes. Cursed is a bit tricky if that's gonna be your 1st Ssra mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah, I don't really reccomend starting with cursed. XTC/AL will be quite a bit easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
Superchum's strat is the on my guild uses... as long as you have a good counter, and people that arn't retarded his dot aoe shouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
SSRA has some great loot, but it gets annoying/boring after the 900th snake. Oh, and start camping emp keys now... that way people get a feeling for the zone and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tdog</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you so much for the information.<br />
<br />
I am going to be setting up a raid this friday to clear the first floor hopfully. This should get us some practice for higher bosses. <br />
<br />
The plan is to farm emp Keys as we have been working on VT keys too. <br />
<br />
Again thanks for the information</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hes fully slowable and buffing DR and bard is a win, the only thing youll need a guide for is beating the EP / Time guild OTMing for their alts =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just get 50-70 people for the encounter and lag him out like my guild does!<br />
<br />
Rarely does he do the AE charm, (ie: I see less than 10 people charmed throughout the fight).<br />
<br />
He AE's his DoT like once every 45 seconds.</div></div><hr />
