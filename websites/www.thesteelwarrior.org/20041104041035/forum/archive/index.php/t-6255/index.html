<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fllint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious if anyone has done any tests to see if Gather shadows from Incarnadine BP actually does stay on more consistantly than the Invis from Cobalt Greaves.  <br />
<br />
I have both of them right now (bought the cobalt greaves recently just so i can invis the clerics etc. in the group) and wondering if it would be worth it at all to keep the BP b/c its invis doesnt drop as often.  I have heard a few people say that it does last longer normally, but have never seen any proof of it... any imput would be appreciated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always had the feeling that the Gather Shadows was more secure then the invis... I cannot prove it though. I have invis from a cloudy mask, to invis others with, and I norlmally invis myself with the BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">both spells last up to 20 minutes,  i have only the BP but i get everything from &lt;1 tick invis up to 20 minutes when the invis symbol begins to fade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is random, and both can drop immediately.  However, it is commonly believed that Gather Shadows lasts longer on average.  I cannot provide you with proof though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A while back on the wizzy boards someone did some extensive testing. While the duration is supposed to be random, the length of time it lasts appears to have a pattern. From the testing done, invis had several different duration. Your best bet is to invis up, then wait 20-30 seconds (the first duration, I forget exact number). Once you last beyond that, you are good for a few minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have cobo greaves, I wouldn't trade them for anything. Targetable invis &gt; self only invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fllint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah i would never consider selling the cobalt greaves just for the fact i can invis others... but was just curious if it would be worth keeping the incarnadine bp because it has a more reliable lasting invis instead of just selling it.  I'm not really hurting for pp or anything, but if the difference in the invis between the 2 is negligible i might as well just sell the incarnidine bp.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the info Wandor... I have noticed that same kind of thing..  invis seems to either drop after the first couple of seconds or it lasts for a good portion of the 20 mins.  Dont suppose you have a link to those tests?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've always wondered... when a caster casts his own Invis spell on themselves, they have fixed duration, but when they cast it on others, the duration is random.<br />
But why do invis pots have a random duration? or why when I Invis myself by an Invis spell casted by myself, it has a random duration? :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, I never found any tangible difference between Invis, Improved Invis, Gather Shadows or whatever invis spell, I always thought that the only difference was the effect on the caster, which was longer and fixed, but not on me, it would always fade randomly and in the worst places :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have had a lot better luck with the BP then the greaves. The option to /target invis is nice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>grumush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">*in regards to 2 posts above.<br />
Hi I have a 65wiz alt that I play in addition to grum.  Just as an FYI the only fixed inv spells are (for wizzies and echanters) greater invisability wich lasts 10 mins, no more, no less.  BUT it is self only (dru's and others get a version of this as well).  The targetable inv (regular plain old inv) is always random, when they cast it on themselves OR others.</div></div><hr />

I've always wondered... when a caster casts his own Invis spell on themselves, they have fixed duration, but when they cast it on others, the duration is random.<br />
But why do invis pots have a random duration? or why when I Invis myself by an Invis spell casted by myself, it has a random duration? :p It doesn't matter who the caster casts on, the spell still has a random duration. as grumush said, there are a few spells (called &quot;Improved Invis [to Undead or to Animal]&quot;) that have a fixed duration, but they are self-only.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have the BP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are different because they are different spells.<br />
<br />
If a caster uses the same spell to invis himself that he uses to invis you, then the duration on him will also be random.  But casters also get a line of self only invis, which has a fixed duration.<br />
<br />
As an example... my mage learned the spell invisibility at level 8.  And the duration on that spell is random (max of 20 minutes) no matter if I cast it on myself or on someone else.  but at level 54 I got the spell &quot;veil of elements&quot; which is a self-only invisibility.  And it has a guaranteed duration of 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As for the incarnadine BP vs cobalt greaves... like others have said.. I would take the greaves because yuo can invis others with them.<br />
<br />
And with either item... I would keep a couple potions handy in case invis starts to drop at a bad time.  Insta cast... so if your icon starts blinking while running thru the baddies, just click the potion in inventory and keep movin'.<br />
<br />
I used to have an incarnadine BP and and kept a couple potions on me for &quot;just in case.&quot;  Eventually wound up selling the BP to get enough cash for my AoN and haven't regretted it.  I carried potions anyway... now I just have to stop by and restock more often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah, you can do it MUCH easier than that.  Use a goblin gazugi(sp?) ring, instant clicky invis versus animals.  I used mine to kill mages that relied too much on their pets in duels.<br />
<br />
And on topic, I'd say it's kinda dumb to keep both invis items.  If I were in your situation I'd keep the greaves and sell the breastplate.  Like others have said, you can just keep a couple cloudy potions in your bag in case the duration goes spaz on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Breastplate and greaves have the same cast time, I keep Cobalt Greaves around due to the fact they are targetable and the breastplate is not.</div></div><hr />

You must have one of the smart groups.  Most of the retards I see in EQ wouldn't notice they were invisible if you told them they were.</div></div><hr />
