The guild I belong to has been spending some time in Ssra learning the named mobs. We have taken out Arch Lich with around 35 people and XTC with the same amount. Last night we killed XTC and were going to go do High Priest but it was getting late and we lost a few people putting us around 27 for HP.  What I am wondering is how the ranking of difficulty of these bosses goes.<br />
<br />
Someone told me it was: AL &gt; XTC but where does HP fit in this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HP is kind of a big step up from the previous mobs, but only because it turns from a single fight into an &quot;encounter&quot;.    The mob himself is not real tough, but you need Crowd Control, positioning, and so on.   It's kind of like this:<br />
<br />
XTC is the beginning encounter, and is slightly like HP, who is a mini version of Emp.   Those 3 encounters have one mob + adds that need to be dealt with.<br />
<br />
AL is more like the cursed cycle in that it's really a single mob.<br />
<br />
Ssra order of difficulty in my experience is like this:<br />
<br />
Rhag 1<br />
Rhag 2<br />
XTC<br />
Cursed Cycle<br />
AL<br />
HP<br />
Emp<br />
<br />
Some would put the cursed cycle a little tougher than AL, but once you have it down, cursed is pretty easy.</div></div><hr />

I'd still put it as:<br />
<br />
Rhag 1<br />
Rhag 2<br />
XTC<br />
AL<br />
HP<br />
Blood<br />
Cursed<br />
Emperor<br />
<br />
But another year of mudflation may have changed that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would put blood in front of HP, less adds, lower HP and no stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd put it at<br />
<br />
Rhag 1<br />
Rhag 2<br />
Blood<br />
XTC<br />
AL<br />
HP<br />
Cursed<br />
Emp<br />
<br />
<br />
Blood is pure puss<br />
Cursed is pretty easy if you got positioning and strat down, near-impossible if not.<br />
XTC just takes a while to kill due to the atk debuff<br />
AL isn't all that difficult as long as you control rampage <br />
HP is all about CC<br />
Emp is just a pain in the ass to tank, and by far the toughest one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanked Rhag1, Rhag2, Blood and partly Emp last night. Rhag1, 2, AL, HP last week.<br />
<br />
I hadn't done Rhags in a while and was surprised at how easy they were now. I didn't bother with a disc at all. Rhag1 lasted about 20 seconds, Rhag2 nearly a whole minute - with 30ish in raid.<br />
<br />
It was my first time tanking Blood and again I was surprised. Didn't need a disc. Tanked him solo for several minutes while CC settled in on the other 8 mobs, and only needed a couple of heals. He went down in under 2 minutes once we fully engaged.<br />
<br />
And again my first time at tanking Emperor (as one of 4 tanks we used). To be honest he was a LOT easier than I was expecting. Even when my disc was down he was not outputting that much damage, thanks the Gods for LR5! If the raid had followed my suggestion and timed his 4k proc I think I could have tanked him from start to finish. As it was he killed me once when I was down to 2k hps and he procced. Got ressed back in and found myself tanking again. Lasted the full 5 minutes it took us to finish him off without a problem.<br />
<br />
Arch Lich is easy to tank if you call your curse and have a GRC caster standing by to remove it. <br />
<br />
HP is easy to tank too, the encounter is about CC not tanking. Evasive owns HP.<br />
<br />
Glyphed cycle is the hard one. Must have a bard singing you Disease resists or you're gonna get charmed. His damage is not trivial but not ridiculous. Had no real problem tanking him and our two best rogues (both charmed) for a while, but then we wiped cuz my bard went down.<br />
<br />
Haven't been in on an XTC kill so can't comment on him.<br />
<br />
So to order them in encounter difficulty:<br />
<br />
Rhag1<br />
Rhag2<br />
AL<br />
Cursed (its not hard when your resists are high enough)<br />
HP<br />
Blood/Emperor<br />
<br />
In order of tanking difficult:<br />
<br />
Rhag1<br />
Rhag2<br />
Blood<br />
AL<br />
HP<br />
Cursed<br />
Emperor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the list above, slot XTC in between Rhag 2 and Blood for tanking difficulty.<br />
<br />
XTC is trivial to tank, he hits like a gimp when slowed and crippled, his AE does no damage and he barely rampages.<br />
<br />
I'm by no means uber but I tanked him with no problems last night for the whole fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HP is no harder than xtc or al himself, just got to keep healers out of range of his stun ae. he has a rampage like XTC, not as bad as AL. there are however 12 mobs to cc, 4 offtanked, 4 mezzed, and 4 need banished or charmed. most ppl CC them in the jail.<br />
<br />
cursed cycle is too gimped to say anything about other than make sure you got high DR for cursed(200+ on MT and hide healers), fight is all about positioning and pathing sucks in the basement. emp fight is like hp, bunch of mobs to cc. emp has 4k dd proc, need someone to grc MT and a rampage tank too. emp spawn is blown for 4 hours if you lose, maybe you could pull off a cr if someone got him to a side room, we never have though.<br />
<br />
nothing worse than going in a fight blind just to learn what a mob does, maybe save ya one wipe at least.</div></div><hr />

You can easily get all the adds taken care of and delt with *THEN* move in position everyone and engage HP.  With blood you get all the adds and blood at the same time and there's more room to go wrong.  As far as less adds with blood, there's the same number of adds that need constant attention, the only thing you lack is the ones that get killed on pop :)</div></div><hr />

Actually fights where you go in blind can be dam fun, problem is in today's game if you go in with this attitude you usually get steamrolled by guild_01 waiting in the wings for you to wipe so they can clean up their farm mob. Grats 3-6 day wait for attempt #2.</div></div><hr />

Only reason i have XtC harder than AL is the adds that need taken care of.<br />
Never had respawns on AL and our last AL was tanked by a paladin.<br />
As far as mob difficulty<br />

Emperor (takes a while, our MA was in his second defensive when we killed him last time, but only had 1 wiz and she was mostly spellshielding with a total of 46)<br />

Seen emperor killed by an elemental guild with 32 or so and xtc around 18 or 20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this, Blood is easier to tank than HP but the encounter (named + adds) is definately harder, allthough not too hard, certainly not with PoP lvls and AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well XTC is a joke we have done him bored at 6am with 2 groups, HP is a good emp prep fight ( sort of =D ) AL is good for teachnig rampage and Cursed is the man. <br />
<br />
my order is<br />
Rhag1<br />
Rhag2<br />
Xtc<br />
AL<br />
HP <br />
Blood<br />
Cursed<br />
Emp<br />
<br />
All of them will be a joke when you get em down, Cursed and Emp basically the 2 non rooted snakes in the house can be backpedaled into corners. Cursed is very doable with 25ish if u have a bard. Ssra is good training grounds, you get nice weaps, good FT, you learn ALOT about CC and rampage and healing. Emperor is awesome fight which no matter how much you prepare or what strats you read is always a surprise and fun . Stay in Ssra and farm keys and ores, break the monotony with patch days where all get loot and the result is a hardcore guild who works good together, and gets some nice loot to boot. Im very glad i pushed my guild to do Ssra / VT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fatz</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had an enchanter tank XTC once :D Was even funnier than the time we had a druid tank vindi :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rhags 1-2 groups<br />
AL/HP/XTC/Cursed 4 groups<br />
Emp/Blood - 40 ppl (our server dont kill blood without emp)<br />
<br />
so there you go as for tanking any of them  at level 65 with decent aas... Its boring non chalenging and does not requier disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's quite misleading, Casai. What you didn't mention is those are the numbers you need if you're in a powerful guild. Regular guilds will walk in and get slaughtered with those numbers.<br />
<br />
Rhag1/Rhag2 2-4 groups<br />
AL/XTC 4-6 groups<br />
HP/Cursed 6-8 Groups<br />
Emp/Blood 8-10 groups<br />
<br />
If you're the average guild taking them on for the first few times, those are about the numbers you'll need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah my numbers are optimal numbers havent seen them done with less</div></div><hr />
