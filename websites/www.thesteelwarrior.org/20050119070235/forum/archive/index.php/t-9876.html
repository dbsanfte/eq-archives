My experience soloing my Vah Shir Warrior to 41. (created before the tutorial and left at level 9 for a long while).  He was created to do the Warrior part of the Sonic Wolfbane quest for my shaman main but I'm having more fun with him than my main right now.<br />
<br />
1-3 in the pit in Shar Vahl<br />
4-7 in Shadeweaver's Thicket<br />
7-24 Various sections of Paludal Caverns (Just say no to bandit camps though)7-12 SWT side bugs<br />
12-16 HM side bugs<br />
17-24 HM side Shrooms and Shik Nars<br />
24-32 Marus Seru (easy singles and don't hit hard, decent money from the LQ hides too)<br />
32-41 Dawnshroud Peaks (again easy singles and don't hit hard, Loot blows)<br />
<br />
As a Vah Shir I cannot use any of the cultural armors so I really start with a handicap.  Some Bazaar bargain hunting really helped recently though.<br />
<br />
I found the best twink item I had was the Ceremonial Iksar Chestpiece (can't use a fungi as Vah Shir).  Up to 41 the regen easily surpasses the higher AC of anything else you can get at that level.  Also have a Grimiling Contraption, a Darkwater Pearl Ring and a Brazen Earring of Health(seems a rare item).  My Bind Wounds skill sucks since I rarely get damaged to less than 70% by any dark blue MoB and regen brings it much of it back before I can get the next kill back to my pull spot.  Filled in with a lot of Deep Cavern stuff my main made for the Dex boosts (always thinking of skill-up rates).<br />
<br />
The regen is running out now though but I think it will last me until the Archtect's Bejewelled Chestplate is worth the 4kpp they are going for on my server.<br />
<br />
As for weapons I really struggled early on with some nodrops from the Hollowshade Moor War and Grimling Forest.  The Greatsword of Grimling Slaying is pretty decent up to the 20s but the 46 delay starts to make it hard to keep the skill up after that.  Used a Skull Shaped Sacrificial Hammer and a Runed Mace of the Moor for Blunt skill ups.  Once the Hammer started to proc at 25 it noticibly upped my life expectancy (a 50 point damage absorption proc came in real handy at 25).<br />
<br />
Otherwise I went with fast weapons early on to get skills up - A Lamentation, Shissar Warsword, Obsidian Shard, Shaded Dagger and Blood Point were good until the mid 30s when thing started to look up. <br />
 <br />
Probably better stuff out there but this is what got me through the low end nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice guide, but I have found that some of the areas you have mentioned, powerleveled or not, are slower than other areas, not to mention that city of mist hits very hard compaired to other places you can go, heh. This is how I usually do it, goes much faster, and is very easy:<br />
<br />
1-4 Everfrost peaks (lots of mobs, and they usually swarm you, making for fast killing)<br />
<br />
4-8 Crushbone. (low hps, familiar area)<br />
<br />
8-18 Paludal Caverns. (no runners, great xp bonus)<br />
<br />
18-23 Solusek's Eye. (xp bonus, somewhat tough)<br />
<br />
23-34 Dawnshroud peaks (Mushroom fort respawns fast enough for you to constantly kill, and they die fast, and hit weakly)<br />
<br />
34-40 Gulf of Gunthak (low hps, good xp bonus, low attack, plenty of mobs to kill, no roamers on the beast, no casters, and two easy nameds)<br />
<br />
41-50 Dulak's Harbor (low atk, plenty of cash, mostly static spawns, and easy to dodge wanderers, fairly low exp, plenty of names and camping areas)<br />
<br />
Passed that, I usually just mess around, and go wherever, so it is a little tough for me to say what is best, so I will just take your word on the other places, heh. I will usually try to slam out some adventure points, or farm plat from DB mobs at those levels.</div></div><hr />

I'm missing OoW gear since I quit shortly after ding 66. Only no drop gear is from first stages of GoD easy to get and The Loyalist Shield (Super easy if you get the ashes) It cost an insane amount of platinum to purchase most of this gear...at the time it was 2 mil. or more (Half funded by me the other half my brother)</div></div><hr />

Skip all the bullshit.  Collect DF belts prior to making the char.  Enough DF belt turn-ins will take you all the way to lvl 10 easily.<br />
<br />
Go to PC from 10-17/18<br />
Unrest  from  18-35 (you'll get max exp from every mob you kill into high 20s)<br />
CoM for 35-44<br />
