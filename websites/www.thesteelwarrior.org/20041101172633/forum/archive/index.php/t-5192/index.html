<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is scheduled(yes yes I know but legends is reservations)and I have my own ideas what I should target some dkp towards. Upon saying that I would appreciate any input from others from looking at my setup what I aim for http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=726398<br />
thank you in advance.<br />
Oh one other thing to note we are also backflagging in preperation for killing RZ amd entering EPs so want to save some dkp for possible BoW and Rarex...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">VT specializes in nice utility slot items. rings, earings, necks, shoulders. Thinks that will help in progresson w/o taking up a potential Raex slot. You will want to bank DKP for plate armor when you get into elementals. Especially nice and with longetvity are AHR gloves, mask and BP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stay non-visible slots whenever possible cept bp / legs as they're rare upgrades even when in EP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Invest in an alternate form of entertainment to carry you through the hell that is VT clearing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They're not that bad, you can get them down to 3.5 hrs for a clear incl aten blobs with some mages. Still hard pressed to beat 25~ish loots for 3hr investment elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Magnar Midgeteater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">NO better way to gear an pre-elemental guild or one that has not been in the elementals for very long.  The loot goes very cheap and is great upgrades.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VT rules.  The first few time it is really exciting IMO.  I mean what is there not to love about killing a boss mob every 30-45 mins and destroying trains of 5-10 mobs at a time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Crimson Runed Mask, Earring of Eradication, Great Shadow Platemail, Talisman of Vah`Kerrath, Gloves of the Crimson Sigil, Leggings of Fiery Might, Ring of Resistance, Bracelet of the Shadow Hive. <br />
<br />
I'd throw in Umbral Vambraces and Belt of Mastery too....Crimson Bull ring aswell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah belt, forgot about it. Arms are a toss up, depends how long before you hit ele's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea I don't like Leggings of Fiery Might, 35 ac is pretty weak for the leg slot.  Aten Mask and BP are outstanding, belt of mastery is hard to replace before time, and those crimson bull rings are great as well.  Look around and see how many 20+ ac rings you can find.  It's a short list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ring of the Crimson Bull<br />
Belt of Mastery<br />
Umbracite plate Leggings (Plate legs are by no means easy to come by in the Elementals)<br />
Earring of Eradication<br />
Crimson Runed Mask<br />
Talsiman of Vah Kerath<br />
Great Shadow Platemail<br />
Shroud of Vigor<br />
Gloves of the Crimson Sigil<br />
<br />
*optional, good AC haste items*<br />
Gorget of Superiority<br />
Cord of Midnight<br />
<br />
*edit* BTW, I'd suggest NOT getting any range item in VT. Elemental bows are easy to farm for yourself, and Charm of Defense is also easy to farm in a single group (= no DKP spent)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Guess I should have checked your Magelo before posting :P<br />
<br />
Specific gear suggestions for you, I'd say save for Aten loots. If you can pick up one Aten loot a month, it's way better DKP spent than getting a few nickel and dime upgrades here and there.<br />
<br />
I's say for you:<br />
Earring of Eradication<br />
Great Shadow Platemail<br />
Gloves of the Crimson Sigil<br />
Crimson Runed Mask<br />
Belt of Mastery<br />
Umbracite Plate Leggings<br />
<br />
*if they go cheap, maybe pick up a Ring of the Crimson Bull, but by no means spend much on one, it's not much better than what you have now<br />
<br />
Emphasis on saving for Aten loots, they can and will last you well into Time. Leave the visible armor alone other than BP or legs, it's simply not worth it, Raex blows it away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for replies, I was thinking basically same way, we also are hitting Lord Seru next week(crosses fingers for BP or arm drop), VT in 3 weeks from today and prob RZ attempt right around VT time. soo my dkp are going to be hard pressed depending on generosity of mobs and how badly others want it lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't take Seru arms! Only good dropis BBB and BP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aimras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if ya really need new arms out of vt, maybe buy the 50ac/100hp arms? i forgot their name, steelsleaves sumthing, but i dunno how rare /high dkp they would go in EPs as raex /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ok, I cannot get it to show with the itemview show code.. Anyone know how to do it right like on this thread?. (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5002&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=2) <br />
<br />
Ok, my suggestion is the gloves.... you already have pretty nice gloves, but the click buff proc is priceless. When other items will last till, then that buff proc will last through Potime and probably through GoD as well.<br />
<br />
The cast time is so fast you can cast it while tanking and keep it up permanently. To add in the end, yes, the 0.0 stun and 65dd is noticeable agro and certainly increase your chance of an early proc.<br />
<br />
Gloves of the Crimson Sigil<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP <br />

AC: 35<br />

In the end it's all about preference.. the AHR neck definetly is sweet looking too :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Question:<br />
<br />
Does Soul Essence of Aten Ha Ra drop every time ? This answer will help me in how many points I choose to bid.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Yes, 100% drop rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aye, Soul Essense is 100% droprate.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure she actually has three different loot tables and pulls one piece from each every time you kill her.  It's the priest, caster, then melee loot tables + Soul Essense for a total of four really fawking awesome loots.  :D<br />
<br />
Can't beat that.</div></div><hr />

nah...loots to time taken to kill ratio sure VT/AHR is up there but i reckon Plane of Fire on full pop or Phase 1-3 in Time in much better....this is all IMHO</div></div><hr />
