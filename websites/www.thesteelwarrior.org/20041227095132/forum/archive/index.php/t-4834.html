<br />
I used them both about 5 times last night in Time and it seemed to be quite a lot less DPS gain than before, and I don't just mean because they are 1/3 as long as they used to be.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see some parses of how much these actually are effecting our offensive output.  It seems very miniscule atm.  Doing Aggressive I got 1-2 'max aggressive' hits per disc... most of the hits were around my minimum...<br />
<br />
Maybe their effectiveness was also reduced because of the removal of the negative effects?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parsed some in Takish Normal LDoN today.<br />
<br />
Average DPS: 121<br />
<br />
Doing aggressive on one mob raised my average hit from 118, to 141 damage.  Minimum hit remained 10. It looks to have added around 8-10 DPS over 1 minute.  (This may be skewed some as we got trained and I switched targets a couple times.  Will parse more.)<br />
<br />
DPS: 129<br />
<br />
Doing Mightystrike on one mob raised my average hit from 118, to 216.  Minimum hit remained 10.  It looks to have added ~60 DPS over 30 seconds, or 30 DPS over 1 minute.<br />
<br />
DPS: 185<br />
<br />
Doing Mightystrike on one mob raised my average hit from 94, to 184. Minimum hit remained 10.  It looks to have added ~80 DPS over 30 seconds, or 40 DPS over 1 minute.<br />
<br />
DPS: 200<br />
<br />
Just some data points, I'll post more as I can get them.  Though it is looking like Mightystrike might be the the 'new' best offensive disc that warriors get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weird thing to me is you only average 121dps with your weapons on a Tak normal adventure? My parses show me right around there with *way* worse weapons. And friend with BoW being in the 155-175dps range. 121 just seems pretty low for your set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was with shaman haste and no atk buffs or bard song.  Also I was the puller and forgot to remove the fights less than 20 seconds, which I did for the PoE parse.<br />
<br />
It is also with damage shields and bash removed from the DPS (which is about 20 less DPS).<br />
<br />
And you might note that I'm missing a few offensive AAs :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about charge but Fellstrike is definitely more DPS than Aggressive in it's current form.  Unfortunately Fellstrike in it's current form is STILL less DPS than Aggressive used to be.<br />
<br />
There were 2 situations where I used to use offensive disciplines.  One was fighting a boss mob where I knew I wouldn't be the tank.  The other was fighting XP mobs where I didn't need defensive.  Aggressive was available for use every 23 minutes in both of those situations.<br />
<br />
I still use offensive disciplines in the same 2 situations now but now my offensive disciplines are less effective than before.  The one benefit that this change gives us is that now we can use an offensive discipline even if we might need a defensive discipline soon.  Even in that situation we likely would not have enough endurance to pull that off unless we started the fight at 100%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems like maybe 2 minutes on Precision/Aggressive would be a decent tradeoff?  I understand they don't want Warriors to get too much DPS since that'd step on monk territory which is probably why they took out the penalty on Aggressive but axed the duration.  Anyone know what monks do with their discs?  Don't they get to do 2 offensive discs instead of just one though?</div></div><hr />

So?  That thread was started after mine and does not contain any parses or detailed info other than discussion.<br />
<br />
Plus I've also posted in that thread! hehe</div></div><hr />

I shoulda quoted Phantron for clarity's sake - I tend to avoid quotes if I'm immediately after the post I am responding to, they're bulky and add  a modicum of effort.<br />

I linked to that specific post, as it's the best one I've seen yet that explains what Phantron was asking about.  I wasn't thinking about or responding to your parses at the time.  Speaking of which, I've been following them each update, and thanks for the effort -  /salute.</div></div><hr />

I think I might try Charge for a bit to see how it works out. I tryed Fellstrike, but with 12/18 weapons it wasn't very spectacular. Maybe I should swap in a 2 hander next time.</div></div><hr />

It brought my average up to around 80dps overall. Since it is such an endurance drain, and only usable every so often, it works out as a nice dps boost especially on adventures.<br />
<br />
Now to get some endurance regen heh.<br />
<br />
edit: These numbers were from enchanter haste and Bard over-haste. My normal numbers are closer to 60dps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have started to look at charge for offensive disc use not for the DPS increase, because over 25 min, i dont know that any of them are going to make a big difference.  The thing about charge is, if you get a healer that you want down now, and is being stubborn, you are connecting with every hit.  Every time I have hit charge, I have yet to see a mob complete a spell.  Probably not a vailid use for 2 handed users, but still. IMO charge being used to drop a stubborn mob fast is the main consideration I am using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like Mightystrike, haven't tried Charge since the patch.  Aggressive never did impress me, so as others wax poetically about it, I can only wonder.  On the other hand, before the patch I only used the offensive discs about once a month, so perhaps I just forgot.<br />
<br />
Try Mightystrike while your berserk.  Lays down the smackles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you didn't notice, my last post was a MS while beserk.  375 DPS.<br />
<br />
This can be compared to a rogue's DPS on his best disc comming in at around 415-445 DPS.<br />
<br />
So for comparison:<br />
Normal Rogue 415<br />
Beserk/soon to be dead Warrior 375<br />
Normal Warrior 280<br />
<br />
Monk? Not sure.</div></div><hr />
