We did the rotation of clearing both rooms 8 times and no name popped. I had read that they spawn roughly every 2 or 3 times you kill PH. I am sure we were in the right place according to the map in the library and from the loc I got from Allakazams site. If anyone knows what the spawn rates are on these 2 mobs I would appreciate the info.</div></div><hr />

I remember camping Ghoulbane with my bro years ago for 24+hours straight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to do that camp, sometimes we'd get 2-3 of each named and sometimes we'd get none. /cheer RNG</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys. I think we will try it again tonight. We are  a small guild and this seems to be one of the better places to try for ornate drops when BoT is real crowded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want ornate do <br />
Glykus and Overseer whey repop every 12 hours and not that hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually see the Armorer a lot more than the Supplier, but the past several times we have killed him, he hasn't dropped a thing.  He used to have a drop darn near every time we killed him.  The Supplier has been much more elusive to us.  In a 3-4 hour camp, we have been feeling fortuante to see 1-2 spawns combined on these two total.  RNG has not been nice to us it seems.  When we do get spawns, it is just an empty Armorer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that was the first thing in EQ I ever helped camp for my friend. i think we hit 20 hours and we were going captain insano. there wer elike 10 of us there and my GL at the time was the highest level at level 31.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah I think Casai was uber lvl 35 or 40 at the time :) and pally was like 30 and Sonix who I bound right in the room was 24 or something when we started :) I dunno how many times that poor assling got killed and stuck in bind/loop or how many times I've trained half of live side to lguk zone, but we got Ghoulbane with just 2 of us. It was freaking hard to hold that camp then. That was before Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we pulled an all nighter at this camp. Approx 20 rounds in each room. I Armorer pop no loot and never saw Supplier. We actually set camp in the Supplier room. Perhaps us being in the room messes up the spawns I know that used to be a theory in LGuK in the old days. Perhaps you guys can tell me where you set up at ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">where you are in the room has nothing to do with spawns....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's an eq myth ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is also a spot in the kitchen area at the bottom of the stairs where either the Supplier or armorer can both spawn from the same PH. We have done that camp many nights but the nameds seem to be real rare. Heck with a good DPS group one night we were set up in the kitchen and also pulling the other Supplier spawn down the hall for a few rounds one or 2 nights.<br />
<br />
And as for rare mob camps, years ago one weekend we decided to camp the Ancient Cyclops and get some guildies sow boots. A couple of us started early on a saturday morning and guild took turns holding that camp most of the weekend, 40 plus hours of killing the PH's and not a single Ancient spawned.</div></div><hr />
