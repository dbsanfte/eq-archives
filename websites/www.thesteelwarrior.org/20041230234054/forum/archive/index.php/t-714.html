<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jecht</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got some time to waste so here is probably one of a few things that has been on my mind.  One thing that annoys me is the lack of personalization.  Sure they have added more faces, hairstyles, ect..but that isn't really what I mean.  Although I wish I had more control over this area.  Like body fat, nekked clothing.  The thing that I would really like to be able to see is personalized weaponry and/or skills.<br />
<br />
Personalized Weaponry: This would be tradeskill related.  These items are NOT something that will drop from a High Level Mob.  Some items needed may drop from mobs, but the weapon itself will be constructed in full.  Once you have the required items you cannot fail the combine unless your skill is below GrandMaster.  Also the stats on the weapon created are not random.  They are very specificly selected by the creator.  Not on a slide scale or anything, it's item related.  Say for instance you want to make a sword that has 10 dex and 10 str.<br />
<br />
These items are not thought out.  Names not final:<br />
<br />
Essence of Dexterity Lvl 1 = 1 dex<br />
Essence of Dexterity Lvl 2 = 2 dex (combine 2 level one essence)<br />
Essence of Dexterity Lvl 3 = 3 dex (combine 2 level two essence)<br />
...ect..ect..<br />
Essence of Dexterity Lvl 10 = 10 dex (combine 2 level nine essence)<br />
<br />
Essence of Dex Lvl 10 + Essence of Strength Lvl 10 + Smithy Hammer + Flask of Water + Sword =  &lt;sword name&gt;<br />
<br />
Here is the personalization part.  First, you get to name the sword.  Obviously you cannot name it just anything, there will be filters and checks to make sure the name isn't taken.<br />
<br />
Second, you receive a special container from the combine that creates a special item.  Only you can create this item and it is required to make your sword with the stats you have selected.  No other weapon can be created to have the exact same stats as yours.  What happens if you quit EQ?  Your weapon dies with you and becomes a rare item on the server.  Someday, someone may find your dusty journal and the secrets to your smithing..who knows....<br />
<br />
I would have your BlackSmithing skill at this point drop from 250 to 100 or 150 with a little message:<br />
&quot;You have poured all of your lifeforce and knowledge into creating this weapon.&quot;<br />
<br />
What do the items for this drop from?  I'm not sure, but they would be buy/sellable.  Not No Drop.  <br />
<br />
Also.  I would make No Drop smithed armor that obviously only you can wear, but that would be extremely nice.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts on that, now something just as interesting to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Personalized Skill:  <br />
<br />
Minimum Level: 60<br />
Minimum AA points: 1<br />
<br />
This skill's strength is determined by what level you are when you create it, and how many AA points you spend creating it.  I would cap the number of AA's but they could go up quite substantially.  Like 75 AA cap or something.<br />
<br />
So the most awesome skill would mean you would hafta be lvl 65 and it would cost 75 AA points.  Not sure if creating the skill would drop you to lvl 60 or not.  But this might be an option.<br />
<br />
Here is an example of a few skills you could potentially create:<br />
<br />
&lt;your name(optional)&gt; 's &lt;skill&gt;<br />
so the title = Grendal's Death Strike<br />
or               =  Death Strike<br />
<br />
<br />
Lvl 60 + 10AA = Bob's Blade Spin: Damage all surrounding opponents (5%).<br />
<br />
Lvl 63 + 40AA = Blade Slash: Basically cuts off one of your opponents limbs.  If an arm it slows it by 50%.  If a leg it snares it.  ect.<br />
<br />
lvl 65 + 75 AA = Death Strike: Damage opponent for 70% of opponents Hit Points.  Your level drops to lvl 60.  Skill requires lvl of 65 to use or lvl 65 to maximize Death Strike (20% lvl 60 up to 70% lvl 65).  If mob level is &gt; 65 then damage percent is capped at 40% and will not stack with another Death Strike.<br />
<br />
Once you get your skill you get a new hotkey: Train<br />
If anyone wants to use your skill you have to train them in how to do it.  They still need to meet the requirements.  They can achieve the same skill without you, however the penalty/cost for them will be greater.  I know, sucks for them but you did get there first.  If you train someone in it then it will be easier for them to learn that it was for you to do it (since they have someone teaching them and you didn't).<br />
<br />
Okay.  These are just a few thoughts.  Kinda just wasting time and venting some of my ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm you have lots of ideas. Some good some bad. I think the weapon idea is cool but you have left out a few factors. ATK /Del stats would be vital in this process. What about procs on the weapons or level limits to use the weapons. I think saying that a weapon with the same stats being unavailable would be a tough one too. All in all I think being able to create weapons that are personalized would be awesome but prolly needs to be a bit more flexible. I mean could you imagine all the griping when the stat combos are all filled up and EQ2 or WOW comes out and the creators of the weapons leave EQ. <br />
<br />
Those are just a few of my thoughts on your topic. Very interesting though keep the ideas coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should take the ideas from other MMORPG's.  To personalize and/or customize a character they should put in a skill cap of some sort.<br />
<br />
Instead of letting everyone max their skills in everything, have some sort of cap that will allow max skills of only a few main skills.  What I mean is that instead of maxing 1hs, 1hb, 1hp, 2hs, 2hb, 2hp allow maxing only one of them.  Say that you could only pick 10-15 AA skills you could put points into.  Or that you can only pick 10-15 AA skills outta the whole list.  That would customize different people to do different things.<br />
<br />
You would see people who use only 2hs weapons.  You would see people with only duel weild.  Some druids would be healers, some nukers.  Some mages will use only air pets, some fire.  That would allow customization to a new lvl, because people cant be great at everything.  So then they choose one main skill to focus on and that would be their characteristics.<br />
<br />
It'll never happen though :D</div></div><hr />
