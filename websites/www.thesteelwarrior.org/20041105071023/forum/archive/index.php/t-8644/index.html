<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, did they ever invent the way to get augments off your current stuff?<br />
<br />
I remember I was saving for Anger III on a SEWS from my guild when I looted one (not sure that will ever happen now LOL) but if I could just peel Anger III off my Scepter of Destruction, then I would spend that money on some armor upgrades or a 40 hp aug....<br />
<br />
Anyone got the skinny on augment removal?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a gnome in Butcherblock that sells a augment removal potion.  You have to look at your augment to see what type of distiller you need and buy the appropriate one.  I believe the Anger 3 type 7 augment costs either 750 or 1k pp.  Then you can sell back that augment to any Adventure merchant for 70% of the value you paid for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you inpect your augments from inventory it will say what type distiller you need to remove them without destroying the augment. The gnome near the birdbath (Mimzit Furnov) in the BB LDoN camp sells the distillers. Then you use the birdbath just like with normal augs.<br />
<br />
Also, you can now sell back LDon merchant bought augs and equip if you have some things you'd like points back for. The return is like 70% of the original purchase price</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info you two :)<br />
<br />
Great news :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can you turn in Augs that were gotten from boxes and mobs btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, only augs that can be bought with points can be sold for points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Augs and items bought during the patches, that weren't suppose to be there, can't be sold back also.</div></div><hr />
