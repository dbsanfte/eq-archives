<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just curious.  On my server, there is only one guild in time (well, they have a large app guild as well).  While they are the only guild in time, they continue to do the Rathe encounter on a regular basis.  A couple of the other guilds on the server claim the main point of this is to block access to time.  The guild in question admits that they would rather have certain guilds in time over others, but say that is not the primary reason.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that the Rathe encounter is a major pain in the rear, and most consider it not worthwhile.  Is there some compelling loot that might draw a guild with a monopoly on TIme to the Rathe?  Nothing that drops from the Avatar of Earth seems obviously desireable compared to time loot.<br />
<br />
For info purposes, I'm in a smaller guild that's just starting Vex Thall, that will be refocussing on planar progression in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depending on how many guilds are in the EP's,with tim only taking at most 2 days to clear for msot guilds it leaves you with 3 or 4 days of nothing to do.<br />
<br />
You can do LDoN raids but a lot of guilds won't so you farm EP's.If there is quite a few guilds in the FP's you don't often have a choice in what you can farm.That usually leaves Xegony and The Rathe up as they are not &quot;Farm&quot; type encounters due the the length of setup clearing and the actual encounter.<br />
<br />
If I had to choose between doing The Rathe Or X I would do the rathe,Simply because I kind of enjoy the encounter,That being said X loot is a little bit better than Rathe loot in my opinion especially for a guild in time.Once you get it down it doesn't take a very long time to do anyways,especially if you have a coth bot up and such...<br />
<br />
<br />
They are also probably cock blocking other guilds to=P but with the 3 day spawn time that isn't a very productive practice either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds odd. I dont see any good reasons for doing Rathe once in PoTime, and trying to block a 3 day spawn seem an excersise in futility. But I guess its always fun to speculate:<br />
<br />
A) Blocking<br />
B) Maybe their GM really really want the essence from there :p<br />
C) Maybe they are just not too bright :D<br />
D) Maybe they are really really really bored<br />
E) Maybe they hate their enchanters<br />
F) Maybe they found some nice way of gimping the encounter<br />
<br />
Who knows(or cares) :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What surlok said. You can do time in like 5 hours, that leaves a huge amount of time to do whatever else you want. Some guilds have an absolute fear or hatred of Ldon raids, so they stay in the elementals. Others just do Ldon and leave the elemental stuff alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rathe drops aren't that bad.  And it's good practice for the guild as a whole in working together.  Its better than doing nothing for 4+ days of the week.  Specailly when FR is farmed instantly upon spawning, Coirnav is either blow or killed very quickly, and even Xegony is farmed on every respawn.  That leaves only 1 god that isn't constantly killed, and even now, we've got to schedule time to kill Rathe because he's becomming contested.<br />
<br />
If you've got it down, you can do Rathe in under 3 hours.  If you don't, then yes, it sucks and can take like 5-7 hours.<br />
<br />
LDoN is not an option, it simply sucks and no one on our whole server raids LDoN.  What a joke expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they are the only giuld in Time, there it makes perfect sense to permakill the Rathe. Once you have Time in farm status, there is plenty of time to waste doing other stuff. The biggest benefit is that they won't have to share Time with anyone until they want to. The longer they can control entry in to Time, the further ahead they will be for the next expansion. Sucks, but it's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rathe BP's are a decent option for clerics, especially since most 2-box can't/won't ever see a bp mold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BP's and Legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Legs? Lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm sure he means Plate legs?  We even give those to apps now tho...<br />
<br />
Leather and Silk legs rot now, even twinks/alts all have them.<br />
<br />
Chain also goto apps...<br />
<br />
But the BPs are certainly nice since you don't get too many Time BPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even plate legs are to common &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think my guild has the worst luck for plate drops to be honest. We starting radding in time on 7/1 and as of today we still have 5 or so people who need plate legs. <br />
<br />
We have had 4 total time plate legs drop. With GoD about to be out in 3 weeks we will be wrapping up time raids pretty soon so there is no holding out for time legs now. BP's... Do I even have to talk about the shit number of drops vs the number of plate class's? <br />
<br />
Anyway,<br />
<br />
There are two reasons to do the rathe. The 29/30 sword is a nice rogue/RNG weapon. The rings have real nice AC for tank types. The Essence quests of course are decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grongl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rathe is super easy once you have the fight down, and the drops are great.  And like the folks above mentioned, when you're not in Time, there's not a lot else to do, especially if your guild isn't big on LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I guess its different from guild to guild. <br />
<br />
Leather/Chain legs have been rotting for a long time now. Plate legs go to people(typically clerics) in deep negative DKP(aka not very contested), only thing we really miss is maybe 1-2 silk legs, but those are bound to come from Phase 3 sooner or later anyway.<br />
<br />
As for BPs we have gotten 18 PoTime BPs so far(we seem to average 1 pr week), so I sincerely doubt any plate user in my guild would spend DKP on the inferior one from RC, unless we made it ridicously cheap.<br />
<br />
Sword/Ring is also surpassed by PoTime gear(Timespinners rotting as well, and most rangers seem to hold out for a timeweaver to go with it). Darkblades+EoE = nice for warriors, so I dont see anyone really wanting the RC sword.<br />
<br />
So all in all RC would be wasting our time to raid there just for temporary upgrades.<br />
<br />
As for the new expansion and wrapping up time raids, I doubt we will do that anytime soon. Phase5 loot is still selling well, and the ratio of loot pr hour is still extremely good in PoTime. Spending 5-6 hours in PoTime once a week even with a new expansion out seem well worth it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We're basically in the same place as Timmok's guild. I think we need 1 more pair of silk legs before they go to rot and plate legs are going to the deep negas or apps. Chain and leather have been rotting for ages, twinks are all decked now. With the way Time is instanced, it is going to be a long time before there are enough guilds in Time before it screws with our farm schedule so it's not worth it for us to kill the Rathe. For a guild who hasn't gotten to Quarm yet, it makes sense keep other guilds out so they can stay in Time without interuption. It's going to take future guilds longer and longer to get to Quarm because they will not have the luxury of getting to practice the Zeks day after day without having the pressure of finishing before their turn in the rot is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't see why any guild would want to do the Rathe just to keep a guild out. If they wanted to do that, Coirnav is a much better target. Unless the other guild has the majority flagged for Coirnav, if that is the case the &quot;cockblocking&quot; guild dropped the ball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Peorth12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm currently in a guild in that exact situation.  There are 3 main reasons why we do the Rathe.<br />
<br />
1) Nothing else is up.  Time is cleared in 1 day, 2 at most.  With FRo, Cornaiv, and Xegony pharmed/blown, that only leaves the Rathe.<br />
<br />
2) Rathe only takes about 2 hours from CoHing in, to TLing out after kill.  Thats really not so bad if considering none of the loot rots yet.<br />
<br />
3) Cockblocking.  Imma go so far and say this is the main reason.   <br />
<br />
And that is why we do the Rathe twice a week :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Mostly BP.  Viable alternative to Time BP for a few classes if your guild is unlucky regarding Timeless molds.  Time has better drops for every slot that you can get from the Rathe, but sometimes peeps will crack from trying to hold out on a bad streak.<br />
<br />
We still have things which haven't dropped for us yet, at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My old guild on Terris did their second Rathe kill in 75 minutes (first pull at camp to Avatar kill).<br />
If you have a mage in place for CoH you might be hard pressed to find a faster kill in elementals with similar quality loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">were gonna do him cause there is nothing else up !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;My old guild on Terris did their second Rathe kill in 75 minutes (first pull at camp to Avatar kill).<br />

<br />
Corinav's a 15-minute encounter if you have a mage in place.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You are right, but i know a lot of people who would willingly go back to raiding VT or Ssra before raiding Water ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">We clear Time in 1 day (Sunday)<br />
The EP are perma cleared (2 guilds there almost time capable)<br />
<br />
I wont bother doing Coirnav for the loot (its more cockblock)<br />
TRC well i have that looong boring event that 1 LD can mean disaster.<br />
<br />
So we up doing EP/Xegony/VT  ....  Everyone hates LDoN<br />
<br />
<br />
But trust me a Time guild is BORED during 5 or 6 days of the week.<br />
And TRC/FR/Coirnav/Xego are all they have left if they hate LDoN.</div></div><hr />
