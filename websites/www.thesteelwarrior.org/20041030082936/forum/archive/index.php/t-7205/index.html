<br />
I recently got a BoW.  I'm curious on 2 points.<br />
<br />
1) What is best to aug it with?  My thoughts are either Anger3, or the high end Ykesha aug from lguk ldon.<br />
<br />
2) What is the order of the most usefull AA to get to maximize the BoW's usefullness?  I don't have a ton of aa, I have most of my defensive done, and I'm working on Punishing Blow 3.  I do not have ferocity yet.<br />
<br />
So, do I finish up Punishing Blow 3, or switch to something like Weapon Affiinity?<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks-<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats on your BoW :)<br />
<br />
1) i highly suggest Anger3. Noticable more aggro, and not a big loss in dps (2-3 dps from ykesha, when BoW gives 100+).<br />
<br />
2) Punishing Blade, Ferocity and Weapon Affinity, i would say finish PB3 as you already started it, then ferocity as it dont cost a lot. once these 3 are done, Flurry/Ragging flurry, but those are quite expensive (require combat fury3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">anger 3 for sure; than go with the aa's mentioned above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For aggro wa-5 &amp; Anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have 125pt ykesha on my BoW; with wa5, all offensive aa's except double riposte, AHR gloves and Incite I have zero problems holding agro (guild MA).   Using 2.5 procs per minutes (and not counting the 250 pt critcal blasts i get often) that works out to over 5dps.  But in truth I often proc 2-3 times with ykesha in the first 10 seconds of a fight.<br />
<br />
If you're insecure about agro go with Anger 3, but I'm very happy with my Yak aug and the extra dps does add up in xp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Finish your defensive AA's first !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kavariel Baenre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had ykesha on my BoW and loved it. I never had problems with agro. The stun was enough agro to hold through tashes/slows and had snap agro when it procced and you didn't have the mob facing you. <br />
<br />
I recently got a darkblade and went the opposite route and put anger 3 on it since anger is basically a ykesha on steroids and its disgusting for agro. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, in my opinion, is that both anger or ykesha will work. Ykesha's extra DPS is small and anger costs more. WA5 will having you proc so much that any extra agro that anger 3 has over ykesha 125dd will be overkill. Having been a huge fan of my bbote it was an easy choice when I faced it and never regret it. Buy what suits you.<br />
<br />
and yes finish your defensive aa's first no matter how hard it is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">no way to prove it, but i think WA5 is the most important AA after you get your tanking aas done.<br />
<br />
anger3 is by far the better aug, im just a sucker for dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WA5 is a godsend and the absolute best AA for aggro. i had some AAs saved up for sturdiness 4 when i got my BoW and spent them all on PB and it seems worthwhile so far. i had come from using a yak augged bloodfrenzy and i wanted to keep most of that aggro so i went with anger 3 but yak on the BoW would be enough in most situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree: get weapon affinity before you start worrying about your DPS. <br />
<br />
It's better when the mob sticks to you and the group can do DPS unharmed than when you have to run around and chase mobs and lose valueable seconds of being connected to mob (missing out additional damage and more important: chances to proc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taggen_of_Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anger 3 = 600 hate<br />
<br />
Yak125 = 400 hate + measly few dps<br />
<br />
IMO its not about feeling secure, its about doing the best you possibly can in your area of expertise...warrior = tank go for Anger3, finish your defensive aa, get WA5 then finish PB3 Fero3 CF3 Flurry6</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Speaking as someone with a Vana and 125 yak aug, don't spend the extra points on the anger aug.  Get your defensive  aas done and get WA 5, that should always be more than enough aggro with incite/bellow.  Besides I love to see crit blasts for 250!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Unless your wizards and necros are already going OOM, &quot;more than enough aggro&quot; is nonsense.  Everyone could have nuked/dotted harder and killed the mob sooner if you'd gotten anger3 instead of yak125.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From what I can tell from his original post he dosn't MT for raids and he dosn't have his defensive AAs done.  Yak125 + WA + incite should be more than enough aggro + a nice little bit of extra dps for his exp groups.  Besides if you're not MTing 100% of the time the EB/anger combo has a pretty good chance of pulling aggro off the MT where as the yak aug might have less of a chance.  On a lot of fights in time I find myself going back to my emp2hs/100yak to avoid pulling aggro for the first half of a fight and we usually one tank everything.  But then again thats just my personal experience and opinion.</div></div><hr />

I recently got a BoW.  I'm curious on 2 points.<br />
<br />
1) What is best to aug it with?  My thoughts are either Anger3, or the high end Ykesha aug from lguk ldon.<br />
<br />
 No question imo the &quot;best&quot; aug is anger 3.The Yak aug is probably close and others would help as well.<br />
<br />
2) What is the order of the most usefull AA to get to maximize the BoW's usefullness?  I don't have a ton of aa, I have most of my defensive done, and I'm working on Punishing Blow 3.  I do not have ferocity yet.<br />
 <br />
If by &quot;usefullness&quot; you mean  for tanking I'd go WA before any other offensive aa.It's by far the strongest aa for helping you hold aggro after ae taunt.The auged BOW would hold you over easily  till you finish your defensive aa tho.I would finish defensive aa first.<br />
<br />
So, do I finish up Punishing Blow 3, or switch to something like Weapon Affiinity?<br />
<br />
Imho WA is far better for aggro than PB3 .I'd switch.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
If this is going to be your primary tanking weapon for a long time I wouldnt hedge with aggro.The raid won't stand or fall because you swap in a dps weapon for dps work.The new aggro boosts are gold I'd make the most of them.We tried Fennin Ro for the first time recently and had a flawless kill.Not even the puller died<br />
and my disc went down at like 40 pct. :) <br />
