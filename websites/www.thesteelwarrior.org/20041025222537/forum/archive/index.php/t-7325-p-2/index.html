<br />
your comparing ranged agro, /shield ability, and a hp improving AA to an ability that gives what...2% dps to the classes who can now use it?<br />
<br />
<br />
are you shitting me?<br />
<br />
<br />
i don't have berserk....<br />
<br />
i can crit vs undead for 5 minutes every 72 minutes...<br />
<br />
i'll glady trade you back, you can have crits, crips, fuck you can even have slay undead, if i can have my PE back, my /shield ability, and my lock on ranged agro.<br />
<br />
sound like a fair trade?<br />
<br />
and BB, noone really buys the class descriptions, until i am the undisputed master of undead DPS, like my class description implies, than all the class descriptions are crap.<br />
<br />
you, i, and everyone else knows what a tank is, your little game of word play is pathetic..we must really have you on the ropes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh yes, I know well what a tank is. It's word for word the Warrior Class Description.Warriors take &quot;the point in battles&quot;.<br />
<br />
I also know what &quot;primarily melee&quot; means and what is meant when Verant/SoE states:<br />
Players who like to engage in melee fights  but want the options spells provide will find paladins a great class to play.<br />
<br />
Now, you might not like the official class descriptions, The Official Player's Guide, or Brenlo's statements, (or Absor's before Brenlo), but I'm puzzled, what information from SoE did you rely on that indicated to you that Knights should tank like Warriors and have a powerful spellbook?<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And if SK's got a 100% res and Paladins got Virtue, a 99% SL, etc. Clerics would still be the preferred healers.<br />
<br />
That argument is unworthy of you.<br />
<br />
I never said that it was a good idea, I simply said that it wouldn't threaten the raid boss MT position. It shouldn't be done because there is a tradeoff for a spellbook. You and I both agree on that, we just disagree on the size of that tradeoff. Given a full defensive, even if it didn't threaten the warriors raid MT role (which I don't think it would), the tradeoff is would not be big enough to justify the spellbook.<br />
<br />
No Warrior will play a game where Knights can tank 95% as good as Warriors and have a powerful spellbook. Given a choice between a marginally better tanking #3, 4, 5, ... Warrior and a Paladin with all their raid utility a guild would be crazy to admit Warriors<br />
And of course, I have never suggested a gap that small, so your point is nothing more than your usual histrioncs. Given a half defensive, particularly one that carried a hefty casting penalty, any guild would have to be stupid to use a knight for boss tanking as anything other than a last resort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well Gimmel,<br />
You hit the issue right between the eyes although you were aiming for the back of the head.<br />
particularly one that carried a hefty casting penalty<br />
<br />
The &quot;hefty casting penalty&quot; for full Defensive is having no spellbook. To be converted into a Warrior. It's exactly the choice Warirors made.<br />
<br />
The &quot;hefty penalty&quot; for half Defensive ought to be one-half of the spells Knights have without it. Even losing the ability to cast spells when not under Defensive is not enough. It makes Knights much closer to Warriors at need and powerful Tank/casters when that need doesn't exist. Waaaay too much versatility.<br />
<br />
Besides, I originally thought much as you that there should be a &quot;hefty penalty&quot; and then I realized how wrong headed it is. Knights should not get a Warrior specialization class defining ability at all. Their solution should be spell-based. They lose some tanking and DPS capability as a cost of having a spellbook and spells should restore as much as SoE allows that lost ability.<br />
<br />
Give Paladins BoV and SK's a simular buff fueled by their opponent's vitality. Make sure both classes can effectively contribute to healing themselves, because if they can't they aren't getting full value for their spellbook. Restore some Paladin stun capability and give SK's a short duration spell that drains the heck out of their opponent's attack for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Only when their base level tanking ability + spells after proper adjustment do not let them perform a tanking role in raids, then SoE should look at a short term auto parry or reposte ability.<br />
<br />
The value Knights bring into raids will never be based on their ability to be a substitute Warrior, Cleric, or Necromancer. All three classes are going to be and should be superior at being what they are.<br />
<br />
The value they bring ought to be because despite not Tanking as good as a Warrior or casting as good as their caster parents, they can do both and have little casting niches of their own.<br />
<br />
Inhibit Knight casting while they tank adds for example, and you've totally negated their purpose in the raid game.<br />
<br />
Their purpose is not to be mini-Warriors. 100% Warrors have got being a Wariror covered 100%. They could however be superlative add tanks using spells and skills Warriors do not posess. They could spot heal, CC, etc. Or debilitate a mob will a unique buff.<br />
<br />
To suggest that as a hybrid tank they must MT hard hitting red mobs is to demonstate a lack of understanding of the game (I'm not stating you have expressed such a view.) Surely Rangers prove that having a taunt button does not mean a class should MT the same mobs Warriors MT.<br />

<br />
I'm simply making a point. We get OUT abilities whored our, we'r not going to have sympathy for the &quot;poor knights&quot; who get their abilities whored out, because guess what, we did too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">.......................................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How could ranged aggro be &quot;whored out&quot; when it comes from using spells inherited from the parent class? The only reason knights were able to get ranged aggro is because necro and cleric spell lines were &quot;whored out&quot; to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gimmel,<br />
<br />
I'm not certain why you didn't reply to my post - agreement or disagreement.<br />
<br />
I think it's obvious that Knights need a couple of unique spells and that weaker duplication of parent abilites do not serve them well.<br />
<br />
The best SK mob debilitating spell is none too powerful. Yet this ability is highlighted in their class description. A short duration instant attack debuff could provide them with a kind of &quot;stun mitigation&quot; ability that Paladins have had for some time.<br />
<br />
If Paladins are to have a Combat Medic raid sub-role, then Flash Heals that heal for more than a hit or two are a necessity. When add tanking, such an ability becomes an asset.<br />
<br />
If tanking is the sum total of what Knights bring to a raid, then a guild would be far better off recruiting Warriors.<br />
<br />
The right path I believe is for Knights to have sufficient base level tanking to beat a blue mobs in a group, powerful enough spells  to allow them to comfortably bring that up to the level of handling a yellow mob, and a mitigation ability sufficient for them to &quot;tank like a Wariror&quot; for 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
These things could give them areas where they excell. Rather than measuring their sustained healing compared to a Cleric, make Paladins the masters of the Flash Heal. A big, uninterruptable high mana cost emergency heal. Rather than compare their ability to mitigate damage from a high DI mob with a Warrior, make SK's capable of substantially draining a mobs attack and obtaining it for themselves. Now they takes less damage, do more damage, and potentially their group and the raid benefits from their ability.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dracuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This whole discussion makes me sick. Take what the game gives you and STFU. Paladins are complaining and they will get fixed. You guys continue to push paladins being nerfed to oblivion and they will do just what I have done, roll a warrior. Now instead of competing with paladins and shadowknights for grps and such you will be competing with thousands of new warriors. Enjoy the competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ariakkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">so casters specifically used thier spells for ranged agro during a fight? to purposely tank them?<br />
<br />
you guys argue semantics so much you lose sight of a bigger picture...every goddamn ability in the game at some point or another has been whored out to another class.<br />
<br />
until warriors got incite, knights were the only tank class that had ranged agro capabilities...period.<br />
<br />
and who gives a shit about rangers, they are not &quot;the forgotten tank&quot;, they are a DPS class just like rogues, the fact they have had taunt since the game came out means about as much as the fact rogues were the worst class in the game when it came out. i also remember back then that warriors and knights were perfectly equal, maybe we should all go back to that time, instead of whenever it suits your arguments.<br />
<br />
class descriptions are, and always have been crap...just because yours happens to have one sentence that you like to repeat over and over doesn't change that. my original class description said i could sell LoH for fun and profit...wheres my fun and profit for LoHing someone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ariakkas,<br />
Early in the game Rangers were often prefered tanks. There is not a single word I have every seen in ANY Verant/SoE literature that says any class is a tank - EXCEPT the that the Warrior Class description word for word defines what players call a tank. Warrior=Tank. Tank=Warrior. Tank is largely player venacular (perhaps used by developers early on and passed down to players) used to denote a role. That role is obtaining and holding aggro and surviving. There are no official tanks.<br />
<br />
Rangers have ranged aggro btw.<br />
<br />
Actually the Class Descriptions, The Official Player's Guide, daily developer chats, and ocassional comments from Verant/SoE reps are the only information we have regarding design intent and reasons for subsequent change.<br />
<br />
You don't like ANY of these sources because they suggest Warriors should be the best tank in the game.<br />
<br />
You ignore published literature, long in-game tradition, and common sense. Pretty silly to suggest Warriors argue semantics.<br />
<br />
btw, despite quite a collection of class descriptions and early statements I was unable to find that &quot;fun and profit&quot; remark. Could you tell me which document or if it was just hyperbole that fine too.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ariakkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">it was in the original classic EQ book that came with the original EQ box. before kunark was out. i'll try to see if i still have it to get a direct quote, might be some interesting warrior descriptions in there as well.<br />
<br />
Rangers have ranged aggro btw.<br />
<br />
as i said before, you and i both know rangers are not tanks, we don't balance rangers as tanks because they tanked 5 years ago, just like we don't balance rogues vs 5 years ago because they were absolutly useless then.<br />
<br />
Actually the Class Descriptions, The Official Player's Guide, daily developer chats, and ocassional comments from Verant/SoE reps are the only information we have regarding design intent and reasons for subsequent change.<br />
<br />
i've already comented on how i feel about class descriptions, i don't use the paladin class description to balance me against, so i don't feel im being hippocritcal in saying that i feel all class descriptions are crap. you cannot fully encapsulate each class in a paragraph, and expect it to fully explain every role and class function.<br />
<br />
You don't like ANY of these sources because they suggest Warriors should be the best tank in the game.<br />
<br />
you only bring them up because you feel it does support your arguement. i don't care if your the best tank in the game, don't group me with people like aborsch who want tanking dominance, cause i don't. i dont even care if i get a defensive disc or not, i don't care if it's a spell, a disc, or if i have to stand on one leg doing the funky chicken to make the ability work, as long as i can have fun when i log in to play. i don't even care if i ACTUALLY get fixed or not, i would be happy with an ability that meakes me believe im fixed....i would be happy with increaseing my dps 100 fold and tanking away all my tank ability...i picked a paladin 5 years ago, and now im stuck with it. i just want to be able to play at the level i have become accumstomed too, and have fun doing it, whatever that involves.<br />
<br />
You ignore published literature, long in-game tradition, and common sense. Pretty silly to suggest Warriors argue semantics.<br />
<br />
its been a 5 year in-game tradition for knights to be tanks, we were perfectly capable of filling a warrior role in classic EQ, why did that &quot;tradition&quot; not continue?<br />
<br />
i've been pigeon holed into this role, why can't i do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">But sir, you can tank right now for experiance. I know you can.<br />
<br />
You have about 2k HP's less than a top Paladin. You can't expect to tank like one vs. hard mobs.<br />
.....we were perfectly capable of filling a warrior role in classic EQ, why did that &quot;tradition&quot; not continue?<br />
Because a tank that could fill the Warrior role and cast spells completely negated any purpose for Warirors to exist. Fortunately, in the very first expansion this was fixed. As a focused Parent class Warriors were given Defensive. An absolutely perfect solution to a difficult problem. Warriors need to be the best tank, but that shouldn't prevent other tanks form getting normal experiance groups or having a raid role.<br />
<br />
In normal experiance groups where Defensive is very rarely used, you get groups. You have a different raid role than Warriors. It's been that way for 4 years.<br />
<br />
Your claimed inability to tank is related to where and what you want to tank given your equipment level. That's been a characteristic of EQ since it was released.<br />
<br />
Dracuul,<br />
Awesome that you rolled a Warrior. If you were on my server and level 53. I'd be more than pleased show you a Paladin runing absolute rings around you. With a little effort at the Ssra/Seru/VT level of the game, I'd show ya a Paladin that pretty much had your AC and HP's while having FT15, the important focus effects, a spellbook overbriming with powerful spells. I bring my Paladin to 65 and I might even solo a dragon for ya so you get a haste item better than my spell self haste buff. You are in for a terrible shock unless you are being power leveled and twinked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I replied to this before, I'm not sure if it was deleted by a mod (in the outhouse, that seems kinda odd...) or if it just disappeared or something, but I'm not typing everything out again, so I'll just pick up where I left off.<br />
<br />
until warriors got incite, knights were the only tank class that had ranged agro capabilities...period<br />
<br />
Erm...wrong.<br />
<br />
Warriors had snare glands.<br />
<br />
its been a 5 year in-game tradition for knights to be tanks, we were perfectly capable of filling a warrior role in classic EQ, why did that &quot;tradition&quot; not continue?<br />
<br />
It has continued.  You can tank in almost every situation.  Since you are only part warrior, you can only do PART of what warriors can do -- defensive.  This means that you have a rougher time against many mobs than a warrior does.  Guess what, though?  You always did.  Starting with Kunark, you were not on par with a warrior when it comes to tanking the big mobs.<br />
<br />
Now, SOE wants raid-targets to be killable by exp groups (a la ikkinz).  The reason for this is that Ikkinz is meant to be part of a Raid Progression.  The fact that people farm it for exp is their own prerogative, but Ikkinz was designed with raiding in mind -- that you should be of raid level to progress into Ikkinz4, and you should bring a finely tuned group.  It's MEANT to filter guilds out of Ikkinz4-7, NOT for you to play with your exp group in.</div></div><hr />
