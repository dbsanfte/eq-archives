<br />
No word on any changes in FB focus.  I still use my SC faithfully when the need presents itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If FB worked the way a lot of people WISHES it worked (mods to spell aggro and bash aggro according to lucy) then FB shields would be nice.  It seems, however, that all they add to is bash aggro wish is pretty much non-existant.<br />
<br />
The + to ac and less riposte (for those w/out the aa's) and the new aa line that lets you miss even more attacks with a shield makes it nice for tanking boss mobs after defensive falls.  Unless you have an ungodly weapon (like a DBoTWL) though it sucks for pretty much anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imagine an agro multiplier<br />
<br />
Then imagine a very small number, say .00000000000000000000000000000001<br />
<br />
Then multiple that number by 4<br />
<br />
There you have your explanation of FB4<br />
<br />
Totally craptacular</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">10-20-2004, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, supposedly its 40% more hate generated by the bash swing than if the shield had no FB focus on it.  Kinda talking about peanuts though.  Say for shits and giggles a bash hit that landed for 10 damage was 10 hate.  You'd get 14 hate instead.  Even if bash hits we're 100 hate, 140 aint that much more to be worth anything from a hate point of view.  Especially if thats all you use in the off hand.<br />
<br />
Over time, ghetto bashing with a FB focus sheild does generate more hate than just using kick or slam or a shield w/o FB focus.  Thats a lot of clicking for a relatively small return.  <br />
<br />
I've always liked ghetto bashing and do it often but after a while I cannot keep clicking cause my hands get tired (and I'm not a bard).  When the shit is hitting the fan, no way am I ghetto bashing.  But when I can afford to think about it and peform the action, I switch in a shield, bash, switch out to my off hand right after I landed a successful taunt to get me just a lil bit further ahead in the hate list.  <br />
<br />
Its nominal at best, but I'll take every bit I can get.</div></div><hr />
