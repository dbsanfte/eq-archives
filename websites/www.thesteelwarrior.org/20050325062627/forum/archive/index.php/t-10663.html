<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benjaminne</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple days ago, I created a new character.  (A human warrior on server Argent Dawn, name: Whinston)  My previous character is a level 32 Warlock.  I discovered that being a warrior is quite difficult.  Is it supposed to be this hard?  As a warlock, I was able to solo against enemies 2-3 levels higher than i was.  I have found that with my warrior I am unable to do this.<br />
<br />
My question is:  Am I doing something wrong?  Is there some sort of secret to playing successfully with a warrior character?  Or...are warriors just major gimps?  <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">most classes own warriors in solo scenarios. we're best in groups but as you level and get better gear and develop cooking and first aid you'll be able to solo pretty decently. I feel the most useful professions to a soloing warrior are herb/alch.<br />
<br />
lots of builds work for soloing. I'm a fan of an Arms/MS build with a few points in Fury for Cruelty and the rest in Prot for Imp Shield Block/Imp Revenge. others swear by a more Prot-heavy build - Imp Revenge plus Shield Bash and Conc Blow is a lot of stunning power.<br />
<br />
personally I love the class but realize we could use a few boosts.</div></div><hr />

We also have pretty poor ability to deal with adds in general.<br />
<br />
I will say, you're super dependant on gear, get the best armor/str/agi/sta equipment you can, and strive for blue+ quality weapons.  I would also recommend keeping up to date on your first aid.  It will make life immensely easier.  Even still,  I think we really lag behind everyone else until plate armor rolls around at 40.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Too much agression to play a caster/pet class I need to be right up on the mob hitting it.... that mentality doesn't work so well as a squishy class...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benjaminne</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played on my Warrior a little more last night.  <br />
<br />
What I discovered is that warriors really depend on their gear, more than any other class I've played.  (Armor, especially.)  Is this accurate?<br />
<br />
Also, assuming I plan to use this char as a tank in groups, would it be better to switch to a two-handed weapon, duel yield, or stick with 1h-shield 1h-weapon?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes warriors are extremely dependent on gear.<br />
<br />
as for weapon setup, it depends on who you ask and what your current situation is. if you have a really good two handed weapon but a crappy 1h + shield, you should probably use the two hander. in most cases I go 2h and switch to 1h + shield for bosses. I don't like dual wield because a) it's expensive and b) your accuracy drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fun can be a big factor in weapon choice.  I dual wield a lot - miss rate be damned -  when I'm grouping against soft stuff, and more rarely when I solo.  Then I can fling great gobbets of Rage around, it generates so quickly. And I just enjoy DW more.  (So there!)  In instances, it's 1H + Shield, or if I'm the extra tank it's a two hander for big slow hits.  And I try to keep all of my weapon skills, including unarmed, maxxed out - just in case that special widget drops.  We are dependent on gear, and that means I want to be skilled for whatever gear drops that I may be able to use.  Some folks also macro their specials to equip a hard hitter for instant specials, but I'm too indifferent to have set those up yet.<br />
<br />
When I hit 60, I'll surely narrow my grip down to one strong 2 hander, a shield, and two one-handers and mix and match to suit my mood, but right now I've got a full backpack of stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice to you is to not take the stereotypical attitude that a warrior's ability to tank, solo, or PvP depends on its talent build. (at least not until 40+)<br />
<br />
While Im still ignorant of how warriors work once you hit 60, in the process of leveling 1-38, Ive heard a lot of &quot;this is how to be a warrior&quot; and &quot;warriors cant do this&quot; rants and witnessed many of them being disproved. <br />
<br />
A good example of such is the general attitude towards warriors in PvP. The other day I grouped up with 3 mages to complete a non-ellite quest. These guys were built for dps and assumed that it was all that mattered in pvp. When we had all turned in the quest they asked if I wanted to duel assuming that any warrior, especially a warrior with almost all sta gear and a prot build, would be a pushover. It turned out that I was probably the hardest opponent that they could have chosen. They all tried to kite me and nuke me into the ground but their dps builds were so inefficient that when they hit low mana I still had a good 30% of my health left. With imp shield bash and concussion blow the duels were easily won at this point.<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
Im not trying to say that my build is good against dps mages. What Im trying to get across is that when people assume that there are only certain ways of being effective at a task they are usually wrong. Obviously warriors can be very speced out with our stances and talent trees and I think that blizzard intended to create more ways of being effective at tasks by giving us these specs instead of restricting certain specs to certain tasks.</div></div><hr />
