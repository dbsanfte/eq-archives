<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">do we gotta be there during the draft?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I may end up changing that, but not quite sure yet. You canalways go in and pre-rank your draft board, and the program will draft for you when your timer runs out, basically taking into account, who is the top player left vs your needs</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK i'm in and just kept my draft picks that way besides making Vick higher. who's ready to get owned by the halfling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's awful early for draft day... more than a month before opening day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">so, plenty of time to talk trash!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like Dobbo's thinking...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okies all, the field is set with 16 teams. <br />
<br />
Due to popular request, we are going with a autopick draft versus live, so I changed it. <br />
<br />
You may want to look at your personal prerankings, and make changes. Its pretty acurate using the preset rankings, but you may want to customize it. <br />
<br />
The draft order is set by the order you all signed up, and will roll First to last/last to first (example: the person drafting number one in round one doesn't pick again til last &lt;32&gt; in round two and the person drafting last in round one picks first in round 2) so as not to corrupt and give everyone a fair chance to get good players.<br />
<br />
After the draft is complete, the remaining unpicked players are immediately available as free agents, so get yourself ready to scan the pool once the draft is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The draft, however we went from a live to an autopick draft due to problems for peeps not being able to make the live draft. So the draft will take place at random sometime between now and August 2nd. Just keep checking your roster periodically, or your email you registered with, as I would think they would email when your team was drafted.<br />
<br />
So, I posted message Our football page, Tholuxe, Stromm, and Steel Warrior Boards a few days back. Everything else stays as original except for draft type. Just keep checking back, as I am sure their will me a mad dash for free agents once the draft is over.</div></div><hr />
