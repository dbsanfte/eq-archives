<br />
The most simple and obvious questions I'll ask first. Don't laugh, I know almost nothing about this expansion besides what I read in the patch message and some threads here.<br />
<br />
1. Are the missions the only new thing content wise in the expansion?<br />
2. Where do these missions take place? Old world zones?<br />
3. Are the missions mostly to kill Dragons?<br />
4. Are there new dragons? Any new models?<br />
5. Any raid stuff?<br />
6. Any chanellenging group content for those bored with MPG trials/RSS/ small raid mobs?<br />
7. New AA? Heard no.<br />
8. Overall opinion of the new features like the potion belt, weapon saves, guild hall and expansion overall?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, there are 8 new zones.<br />
<br />
2. Where do these missions take place? Old world zones?<br />
<br />
The take place in instanced versions of the DoN experience zones.<br />
<br />
3. Are the missions mostly to kill Dragons?<br />
<br />
I only did 2, but they have a format sort of like tasks.  First it will tell you to go to a certain area, then when you get there it will tell you to loot X number of items, then kill a named mob, etc.  Varies from mission to mission.<br />
<br />
4. Are there new dragons? Any new models?<br />
<br />
Yes and Yes<br />
<br />
5. Any raid stuff?<br />
<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
6. Any chanellenging group content for those bored with MPG trials/RSS/ small raid mobs?<br />
<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
7. New AA? Heard no.<br />
<br />
No<br />
<br />
8. Overall opinion of the new features like the <br />
<br />
potion belt -- Very nice for keeping an invis pot handy without taking up an inventory slot.   Could also put a gate potion in there but you would have to be careful with it :)<br />
<br />
weapon saves -- Great.  Makes swapping weapons effortless<br />
<br />
guild hall -- Cool zone.  Good place to hang out or go afk away from the noise of PoK, and if you are a soloer it's a good place to go AFK or log in to chat without losing your buffs.  The corpse summoners in the guild lobby will change the game<br />
<br />
expansion overall?  -- Looks pretty cool from what I've seen.  More content but not a lot of advancement, which really isn't necessary at this point since Tacvi and Anguish are far from being farmed out by pretty much anyone.  There are some raids that drop some very nice loot and (presumeably) will be a challenge to top-end guilds.</div></div><hr />

What is the difference between the 2 camps, 1 for evil races and 1 for good? or Its arbitrary as to which side you wish to support?<br />

The challening group content are just missions you get later on? Guessing raids come from the same place but different NPC?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, all of the content is accessable through Lavastorm. There are actually three camps I hear. 1 good, 1 evil, and a Wayfarers camp. It does not matter which camp you choose to go to but faction will be involved as to which one will give you more? (I may be wrong about this) missions.<br />
<br />
There is plenty of groupable stuff to go kill that is challenging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Not everything is accesilbe from Lavastorm. 2 New zones are..<br />
Broodlands, and Delve's Lair.<br />
<br />
All missions are accessible from lavastorm though, and the 2 camps are based on faction. As you do more missions for onefaction, you lose faction with the other.<br />
All of the task people are in the same area: raid, group, solo.. That was for easy access.<br />
<br />
<br />
All zones are accessible from Broodlands though, including every instance you will have to go to Broodlands to get to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's right.  It's like if you went on a mission to Sebilis, but it is your group's own personal version of sebilis, with no one else in it, and maybe some special mobs/drops.  The mob difficulty also scales with average group level like LDoN, so the zone may be harder or easier than the normal static zone depending on the level of players in your group.  I would love it if there were missions that went to instanced versions of old zones with the mobs scaled for level hehe.  Can you imagine going to a level 70 version of crushbone or Unrest?   I'm sure that would be extremely difficult to implement but it would be pretty cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Did they change this? When I was screwing around with it on beta it still took an inventory slot, but was technically clickable from a bag (not a main inventory slot). Is this what you meant or did they change it to basically allow for 4 more slots for potions only?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it still takes bag room, but you don't need a main inventory slot to keep it out in the open.   I didn't try putting food in it, but I doubt that would work hehe.</div></div><hr />

Or is it limited to 'potions only'?  Basically i want to know if i can fill my inventory with backpacks at this piont and never worry about saving a spot or 2 for the instaclicks again.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to the utility belt and bandolier.  The guild hall confuses me ... i don't know what it is or how it works ... i'll learn though i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guild hall is simple. Its an instanced zone that only your guild can get into. Buffs are saved there, and you can do tradeskills, port to certain areas, and aug items, etc while there.<br />
<br />
Guild lobby will let you do things like... Nothing but hang out and Summon corpses.<br />
<br />
Barter zone is awesome layout, though, i hate the fact they made Bazaar the same. Although Bazaar now has zone connections to Plane of Knowledge, Nexus, Barter, and Shadowhaven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it'd be that difficult to make instanced zones off the old zones.  I remember you can get an expedition to Plane of Hate B for one of the epics that's obviously instanced for your raid only and it looks the same as the global Plane of Hate B (at least I assume).  <br />
<br />
However seeing that people do demand better graphics, I think what will happen is that people will be complaining why is there a level 70 orc in Crushbone in the same old boring primitive graphics.  Now if you want a graphically up-to-date level 70 Crushbone, yeah that could be a lot of effort.</div></div><hr />

Seems like it would be nice to be selling and buying at the same time.  For instance: your trader can have all your crap in the window to sell, meanwhhile you've got buy orders out for spider silks and ukun quills (or whatever) so people can come up and sell em to you while you aren't there.  Maybe i just dont understand the functionality of the new system yet, and it will make sense once explained.</div></div><hr />

Yep that dragon is irritating... We took him out on Zeb last night and were really dissapointed that he flees at 75%.  We were hoping for some sort of story line advance.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't very hard though, I was tanking him and got mostly minimum or lowish hits... defensive not even needed.  Also the AE was easily resistable it seemed.<br />
<br />
I'm curious how you kill now, maybe you have to fight him near the lava pit or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did the same thing.  The new bazaar seems to be designed with maximum suckiness in mind.<br />
<br />
I went and camped a couple named in Broodlands.  With myself a 54 BL and a 65 druid things got hairy a couple of times.  Despite what the devs said this expansion really offers nothing for those below 55.<br />
<br />
At 54 my BL joined a group that gave a shot at a mission and if we would have completed it successfully he would have gotten 15 points.  So the points system does not seem quite as messed up as LDoN.  However the require/trivial levels on gear is poorly tuned.  Oh well the bandolier is a nice feature as is the guild hall.</div></div><hr />

I was told the extra slots would be useable later, loot or quest or something like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the 340 points stuff is required level 65+  The only nice thing that I saw that I could really use was the augs.  Basically everything else had required levels on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gonna touch on two issues =x<br />
..<br />
<br />
1.) While your complaining about being lost in the new bazaar. Open your map screen, if your not a complete and total dumbass, you won't get lost!<br />
<br />
2.) Missions are for anyone 55+. Varys Depending on how hard the task are. For instance, I did 2 last night worth 45 points, and during the task, we had to evac out twice because things got heavy. All of us were 70, in Time/Qvic/Txevu armor, with most of our spells.<br />
(First group was Warrior,Cleric,Shaman,Beast,Bard,Wiz)<br />
(Second Group was Warrior,Cleric,beast,bard,chanter,druid)<br />
<br />
If you want a challenge for your level, these things rock. They completely blow LDoN out of the water.<br />
<br />
BAndolier rocks, as does all the guild hall features. This expansion is pretty awesome if you don't complain about it for 10seconds, and stop to enjoy the stuff they added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mascher</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went in last night and all I found was what was apparently a mission to collect stuff and we weren't able to share the task.I assume i was at the wrong place for DON missions or do I have to do a Task to get faction first to get DON's.Anyone tell me what i need to to to get DON instanced pls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quests were not challenging for me, druid, cleric, enchanter, rogue and paladin. We neve once had a problem and only death all night was druid who attacked an indifferent named by accident. I didn't think they ere very challenging at all, and I as a warrior could solo pull a majority of the tasks. Druid would have been capable of healing me as well, and I can't imagine a knight having much trouble tanking except possibly on the named pre-slow, but even then I doubt it.<br />
<br />
The bandolier sucks as well. Like I said, it takes me like 1 second to switch to the weapon type I need, and the bandolier is a hinderance until it starts remembering where it took the item from rather then auto-inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and the bandolier is a hinderance until it starts remembering where it took the item from rather then auto-inventory.<br />
<br />
Ya, then SoE can spend about 4 months debugging it so that it doesnt cause you to lose items or some other whacky effect they didnt plan.<br />
<br />
Example.. swap weapons. Hand bag the weapons were in to your friend. Swap weapons back. Now where in the F do they go?<br />
<br />
I think keeping things simple is sometimes a really good idea. Challenging SoE's programmers to do something that can be actually quite difficult, to fix something, that quite honestly takes a person with OCD to even care about, is a bad plan.<br />
<br />
Would Bandolier be better that way? Sure.. about 2% better, and in return you get tons of potential bugs.<br />
<br />
I suppose you also want your bags to remember that they had items in those slots too so that when you loot something it wont occupy the slot, thus destroying the perfection that is your inventory?<br />

The only feature I do not like is the new bazaar.  There was no need for the new design but if they were going to do it they should at least make sure that the old map is deleted before putting in the new map.  I ended up with the maps overlaying each other.  So the map did not do me a bit of good.<br />
<br />
Other then that I liked the adventures.  The 10 level limit is so much nicer then LDoNs 7 levels.  One word of warning, the average level of the group must be above 55, and this is actually key because if your group average is sku'd by a 60+ person and a bunch of say 54s if the 60+ person LDs you have 2 minutes to bring your group average level back up or you get &quot;booted&quot; from the mission.</div></div><hr />

Maybe Diablo2 would be more suited for you =x.<br />
<br />
The bazaar is easy as hell to use, once you get it patched right.<br />
Sorry to sound like an ass, but if you can't use the new bazaar, Diablo2 is for you!</div></div><hr />

The devil is always in the details.  The underlined section should not be a requirement.  It should have patched right without having to delete the files and re-patch.  Since you can not determine that you are bugged in the zone until you log in people have the right to bitch about it.  Especially since there was nothing wrong with the bazaar in its previous form.  /hidealltraders resolved any graphics problem people might be having.<br />
<br />
In this case Detheb you are incorrect.  The rest of DoN rocks but the bazaar sucks.  Big time.</div></div><hr />

Sure there are bugs, big deal, get over it, they will be fixed.  It all comes with the MMORPG territory.  WRT to change, people should take the time to check things out a little more before bitching about it.  I saw this post on the SoE boards from a community representative which sheds some light on the reasoning for the new bazaar layout.  I think they did a great job myself.  Kudos to the designers.<br />
<br />
As stated previously in the thread, things like hidetrader was not a permanent fix for problems with lag and such in the bazaar, it was simply an interim &quot;bandaid&quot; to temporarily solve the problem.  The new bazaar will alleviate lag due to congestion.  No more need to look at the floor if you do not have hidetrader activated, no more movement lag and such.  It is understandable that change is hard to accept especially when you change something from the form it was in for several years.  Gve the new bazaar a chance.<br />

I used to spend quite a bit of time there (yes its a blue server) and I'm kinda pissed its gone. The new bazaar is a pain in the ass to navigate, they made it into a really shitty MPG spinoff. There was no need for that, the old bazaar was much better. Where the fuck is my arena though?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also. Whileas you do need to repatch, and you shouldn't have to, that doesn't stop the fact the new bazaar is great. The new zone is really great, and when you take base 1 off, even though as someone said, we shouldn't have to, the map is pretty clear. Do a &quot;find trader&quot;, figure out what section the person is in(Be it Blue Griffon, or Red Dragon). From there, the find will take you to a tunnle. It leads to a room, in which the trader will be in. Not alot of running around, just a little more complicated. <br />
<br />
Also, to Binbar.<br />
Yeah, I am an asshole, but, as I said. Only to people that can't figure out how to use a simple or system, or who just don't want to use the system and complain about not knowing how to do it.</div></div><hr />

My trader was stuck in the wall after the patch. so i deleted the bazaar files and re ran the patch (advanced, check all, full file scan) - found no new files! <br />
So i checked that luclin was ticked- no luclin box, and no DoN box. <br />
the login screen tells me i have 9 of 9 expansions, and station-account info lists them all.<br />
<br />
So does anyone have any advice for howe i can force the patcher to download those files. Id rater not buy the expansion again. <br />
One 'hint' perhaps, is that the logon screen refers to DoN as ERROR String not found (which is a pretty shit name for an expansion)</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you were at the task/mission camps.  They are on a typical good/evil faction depending on your deity.  You will be apprehensive to one, threatening to another unless your character is agnostic, in which case you're fine in both camps.</div></div><hr />

OK now for another  question. I figured this part out but do all the zones repop after the kill?We made it to the end of what was a 3 part task and bad pull wipe.It appeared the whole zone had repopped.Is there a way past this or is it always gonna be 150pp summon corpse and start over?Thanks Mascher</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my experience, some repop and some don't.  We have done a lavaspinners lair (collect 15 drake fangs) where nothing repopped for the 90 minutes we were in there.  The Thundercrest &quot;A Simple Task&quot; (flower collection), things do repop, but much slower than usual (30 minutes compared to 19.5).<br />
<br />
Those are the only 2 I've done, but it seems consistent at least per task.  I haven't seen any triggered repops except the task-related named.</div></div><hr />
