<br />
I'm a former warrior, current magician on Tholuxe Paells and have a question.  The level 61+ summoned weapons that mages create will proc for pets somewhere between 44-49.  These are 10/20 with +3 magic/fire/cold damage and 50hp.  The proc does 150, with the magic version adding in a stun effect.  From watching my pet, I've seen that the Blade of Walnan (magic) has a great deal more aggro than the Fist of Ixblat (fire) but I'm unsure how much.  Have any midlevel warriors tried using these?  When my warrior was in the low 50's, I would have been able to get similar weapons to at least temporarily replace my Frosty/ Jade Mace.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.<br />

I never noticed any difference between the agro of the blades vs the fists.  Magician elementals are fortunate enough to have identical skills in 1hb, martial, 1hs, and so on, so they don't suffer from a dps loss depending on what they're using like beastlord warders and shaman wolves do.<br />
<br />
So it can't be that.  Dunno...  :)<br />
<br />
Btw, never give warders the blades.  Their dps will drop from about 60-65dps to about 40-45dps.  Despite warders being straight up warriors, their skilltree is similiar to the beastlords themselves.  Always give them fists and never anything else.<br />
<br />
It's the same with shaman wolfies, but to a lesser extent.  Giving the wolves weapons does, in fact, allow them to dual wield (They innately double attack), but they will do more melee dps with the fists than they will the swords.<br />
<br />
This is probably stuff you already knew.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, to my warrior brothers, don't be suprised if the 61 air pet can tank better than you can, lol.</div></div><hr />
