<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oloth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Although I'm not a 5 year vet. of EQ and of the class warrior... I've often come to wonder why there is so little weapon diversity in EQ... Everything has seem to come down to Enraging Blow type effects. I have yet to see such a case warrior might base weapon selection vs. encounter...  In the same way that casters might for DD's or DoT's. I might consider that an excellent way to add a little spice to Pure melee, but then again the community might not want spice??? Would we prefer the works on everything consistancy or a greater weapon selection that might add few more factors to an encounter? <br />
<br />
Just a few ideas of my own...that might make it worth while to have a weapon bag....<br />
<br />
1. Increased Proc rates vs creature type ( undead proc weapons vs undead... disease based procs vs mobs weak against disease.. bane weapons...etc..)<br />
2. Worth while  bane or + dis/fir/col/mag like 5 on 1h 10 2h where the dps increase would be significant.<br />
3. More multi component procs ( like Anger (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3624&amp;source=Live)) With a variety of effects that would be benificial vs a type of encounter) These could range from mana sieve type to large spell runes...<br />
4. Weapon Foci... worn effects that increase the effectivness of either procs (in the increasing rate or effect) Casters get spell foci pure melee get weapon foci. (Btw it think it would be fair to exclude hybrids from best effects ( as I believe they should have been excluded from caster foci best effects since their are not specialized in either)) or hit rate (hit/miss ratio) or even discipline extention (defensive/aggressive) or further reduction in reuse by 20% etc...<br />
<br />
Add Augments to the mix and I'm sure there could be even more room for creativity... Now.... then again like I mentioned earlier maybe the community would not be in favor of this (after Seru/Emp type encounters). That was an encounter disign mistake and obvious timesink.. I would be always be in favor of non-specific weapons, but am suggesting an itemization that would make it worthwhile to attempt to attain specific weapon types.<br />
<br />
Now EQ is a bit of an old dog at this point and maybe it's too late to impliment something this dynamic in nature. Although it might be worthwhile to make more dry runs in future expansions with a full implimentation in EQ2 where there are no legacy issues.<br />
<br />
So am I in left field here? or Should things stay static (Stick with what works, don't rock the boat...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've already got a ten slot backpack full of weapons.  Willsapper, copper hammer of striking, twisted steel bastard sword, gaudralek sword of the sky, trudgeon of doom, silken whip of ensnaring, trident of the deep sea, great staff of thunder, and a couple more misc. weapons I rarely use except for looks.<br />
<br />
And I have nothing with EB on it.  I donno, I kind of feel like I'm already having to carry around a small armory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haha, Glatius I have the same thing, I've got a clicky heal BP, my Twisted Steel Bastard Sword, Greatstaff of the 4, Trident of the Deep, Truncheon of Doom, 2 blood points (fear), Great Blade of Storms, all 3 Epics, Wicked Shank and some weapons from LoY with broken plank graphics (because that's just sexy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For a very brief period, all I had in my bag was Go4W, GSoT, and Shovel of the Harvest (free food).  Ahhh, the glory days of the all 2hb armory.<br />
<br />
Now I have the above 3 weapons, Embalmers Skinning Knife, GBoS, HG (got it last night!!!) and that seems to be a pretty light load, comparitively.  I also have one of the Auliffe shields, just because.</div></div><hr />

You list two in your profile. Sup with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That would be my laziness to update my Magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah in my best times I carried around 15 weapons (pre EB ) with different procs for different mobs for aggro and utilities .....<br />
<br />
Like poison proc dot for aggro in CT ( works great ), red Epic for the mosquitos in CT ( resist poison dot but not fire procs ) and lots of other stuff ( TSBS / Gauldralek / Willsapper ...... ).<br />
<br />
Now its only these ( BoW / HG / BBotE / Primal 2h / Primal 1h / GSot4W / Possessed sacirfice Club ( 40 % haste 30 atk buff ) / Rotting fists / ToD / FB4 Shield / Willsapper )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ToD<br />
2 red epics<br />
1 blue epic<br />
2hs epic (I know, I know)<br />
GSoT<br />
copper hammer<br />
bloodsworn<br />
2 stun whips (in honor of Frodlin)<br />
snare whip<br />
earthshaker<br />
2 tash sticks<br />
<br />
Used to carry a chelaki tail, but banked it. Probably should bank all the epic stuff now, but that makes me sadface for some reason. Probably can ditch the stun whips now, though I keep meaning to test their proc rate against the droga weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Norfolk:Brell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally I think Enraging blow and Anger are weak effects. All they do is rack up hate, other than that, theyre pretty damn useless. I would rather have a DD effect with a slow, stun, or snare component than something like EB, which Aside from the aggression lockdown is otherwise useless.<br />
<br />
Right now all I have is a couple of poison DD's I bought from LDoN, and exp group or raid encounter I have precious little trouble holding aggro unless some trigger happy paladin wants to show how he can snatch aggro from me. Granted were not killing in time, nor do I think we ever will be, but I do just fine tanking in the Temple of Veeshan.</div></div><hr />
