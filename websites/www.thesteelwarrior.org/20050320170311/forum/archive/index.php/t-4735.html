Anyways I badly want to find out what is the name of the song that is in the background in some foreign language sung by a female voice. I think it might be german.<br />
<br />
If you know help me out with song name or name of singer/band or whatever info you can give.</div></div><hr />

I dunno the commercial you're talking about though, so that's a complete random guess.  (I also think the actual title of the song might be in german, but you should be able to find it with that np)</div></div><hr />

The band (or singer, I'm not sure which) was named Nena; they did an English version (99 Love Balloons) and a german version (99 Luftballoons).  I'm pretty sure the German version was a bigger hit in Canada when it came out (it's the one I heard all the time, I heard the English version like thrice), and it's the one used in the commercial.</div></div><hr />

Oh, yar.  I was doing sound-alikes in my head prolly.  And chatting with a few groups waiting for PoJ trials and so on hehe.  Was a pretty good 80's geek moment if I hadn't blown it tho.</div></div><hr />

Goldfinger will join Eve 6 and Dynamite Hack next week in Atlanta to kick off a joint month-long tour, and the Los Angeles ska punkers will be out touting their new single, a cover of the '80s bilingual classic &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot;.<br />
<br />
German New wave singer Nena scored an international hit with her original take on the track, titled &quot;99 Luftballoons,&quot; in 1984, and eventually re-recorded the song in English, a version which failed to chart as high as the Germanic one.<br />
<br />
Inspired by the 7 Seconds cover of the song from 1985, Goldfinger first recorded &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot; for inclusion on its 1997 EP, &quot;Darrin's Coconut Ass,&quot; but decided to save it for the band's just-released &quot;Stomping Ground&quot; LP.<br />
<br />
Singer John Feldman opted to incorporate elements and lyrics from both versions of &quot;99 Luftballoons&quot; into the Goldfinger cover -- with the help of a German vocal coach.</div></div><hr />
