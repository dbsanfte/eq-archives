<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello<br />
<br />
Well I came here looking for advice upgrading my weapons (SBoD/HoH) and most people said CHoS/SoBS (cheap and common agro wise) was way to go....<br />
I tried but I found offhand procs were not worth lower DPS... so I used CHoS/SBoD. Now at last I got a BoC, and I am using BoC/SBoD and thinking of some Anger upgrades....<br />
<br />
But now I feel pretty comfortable with my weapons and I am looking for some armor upgrades.<br />
<br />
I am not in a big guild, no raid, no ornate molds... just some cash, 50k is what I got after getting BoC, and I find that every dropable (bazaar gear) upgrade is close or over 100k. (Helmet of RZ, Warlord's Steel gauntlets, Ornate molds.... ) ill start earning plat again, but took several months to get the cash for my BoC so Im sick of it. <br />
<br />
LDONs are a good way to get armor, but forming a LDON group is not easy, and requires a time I dont have. I never know if Ill stay on 30 min o 3 hours...<br />

<br />
So looking at my magelo can you think of any upgrades? Mainly looking for Quest, or drops from mobs a full group hmm 60+ can handle.<br />
<br />
I think there is a nice back item of a Quest in Katta, but im short on ideas for upgrades... <br />
<br />
Thanks guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">looks like ornate or ldon for any real upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i hate to agree; but time ( spent, not the zone ) is your biggest enemy and LDoN gear will prob be the best 'bang-for-your-buck' in regards to upgrades and/or coin. gotta just play your cards right and try to arrange hunts with common people in your playtime and go from there. you might actually come across some quality hunting times with people in yor same predicament.<br />
<br />
sadly; any big upgrade item at your stage will require bucketloads of plat or bucketloads of time spent :(</div></div><hr />

This expansion was tailored for your type of player.  Use that to your advantage.  It will take you some time and effort, but, you'll end up with gear that's better than the ornate that's alreqdy out of your reach!  LDoN is THE saviour for the mid-tier, casual Warrior :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You've encountered the curse (or blessing) of the FH geared warrior.  Not much outside ornate or Tak LDoN armor will ever beat it if you aren't in a raiding guild.  <br />
<br />
Personally, if I were you I'd be kind of happy where I am at the stage of the game you are in.  I know we all are constantly searching for upgrades because it gives us a feeling of improvement and satisfaction, but honestly your gear is more than sufficient all the way to 65.  Stop worrying about upgrades, grind your way to 65 and you'll find your options will open up extraordinarily.  You will be able to hunt for your own ornate in BoT without having to spend time in the bazaar and groups in LDoN will be more likely to take you.  Besides, the points gained in LDoN for the time it takes and exp you get isn't worth it prior to lvl 65 IMO.</div></div><hr />
