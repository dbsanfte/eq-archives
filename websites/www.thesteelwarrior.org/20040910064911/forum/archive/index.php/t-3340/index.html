Actually, we've never had a class balance forum at a Fan Faire.  The reasons for that should be pretty obvious.  No matter how well balanced a game is, there's still room for improvement.  Someone is always going to have a beef.  A forum like that would just end up as a shouting match between players about how one class should be nerfed another should be boosted.<br />
<br />
There's no pretty way to host a forum like that.  Tom (the Fan Faire guy) wrote out a sample schedule that had that in it.  I immediately told him that there was not going to be any such thing.  Somehow that sample schedule was used, not the real one, on the folders that were handed out.<br />
<br />
No, a &quot;Class Balance&quot; forum at a Fan Faire would be like the proverbial long-tailed cat in the rocking chair factory.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">And I kinda agree with the reasoning behind that, actually.  There's enough shouting going on in the messageboards, I'd hate to see or even hear about a real life version.<br />
<br />
I just find it a little funny, myself, that the T-shirt was signed like that. :D  Not sure why, just funny to me.</div></div><hr />
