<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this came up a few months ago, but I thought it had been addressed. I could not corner mobs in VT last night -- and neither could a dwarf guildmate. A halfling warrior in our guild didn't have any problem. I know there had been a problem, but then ogres were given triple shrink -- and even triple shrunk I could not corner the mobs. <br />
<br />
Anyone else having any problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup.<br />

Wood elf illusion + shrink solves it.</div></div><hr />

Guildleader is a halfing warrior(insert halfing joke here), and has had to step in  recently when I could simply not get the mob cornered right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinaabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am Vah Shir, and I have the same problem. I can not corner mobs like Grieg and Statue/Idol. I have to carry DE/WE or gnome illusion pots with me always.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Err, well, I don't think it's really our job.  I think this is technically just exploiting zone geometry.  I mean seriously, you and the mob are technically sharing the same space, which is inside the corner itself, while you still being able to keep it facing you.<br />
<br />
It's certainly made some people's lives either, but I wouldn't call it an essential part of the class or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, in reality, I occupy space, so no, the mob and I are not sharing the same space. Seriously, why should the mob just be able to float through me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mobs have been doing that since day one, I don't think that's a valid reasoning for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not valid? It's okay that small race warriors can perform a vital raid function that a *triple-shrunk* large race warrior can't?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, I said it's not valid to use the excuse that mobs shouldn't be able to pass thru you.  In response to your new complaint, consider it a racial advantage.  You knew the penalties when you picked a fatty :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It looks like only the first shrink changes size now so triple shrinking doesnt make you any smaller. So thats what needs to be fixed to make corner tanking possible again. Was the dwarf able to corner tank with a single shrink? (They are a bit &quot;bigger&quot; than halflings.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No, I did not know 3 1/2 years ago that because I picked an ogre (because I thought they looked cool) that I *could not function as a raid tank* due to size. If I can't corner mobs, I don't get to tank. Period.<br />
<br />
That's wrong.<br />
<br />
I don't know if the dwarf was shrunk or not.<br />
<br />
Three shrinks used to not make a difference for ogres, but as of a few months ago, it does. I get noticeably smaller each time, but not at the 4th or subsequent shrinks. At 3 shrinks I'm slightly shorter than halflings, though evidently wider than I used to be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You knew the penalties when you picked a fatty<br />
<br />
Actually, that's not true.  Double shrunk large races COULD corner mobs for most of EQ's existance.  It is only recently (I forget exactly when, but in the past year for sure) that they made a change which resulted in Ogres, Barbs, and Vah Shir not being able to corner mobs unless illusioned (I dunno about trolls... as I don't know any troll warriors).<br />
<br />
I use an AoN for my insta clicky anyway, so I usually just skelly myself and then double shrink so I can corner... but it is a huge pita when illusion wears off or is dispelled when you're fighting...<br />
<br />
This was a negative change to gameplay when they made a graphics change (I think it was when they changed all the running animations, but I'm old and forgetful and might have that wrong).  There was a lot of discussion about it when it happened, but since there was a work-around by getting illusioned, it gradually died off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes, I used to be able to do this, and now I can't. <br />
<br />
And don't even get me started on how *charisma* is now the most important warrior stat. (Ogres, of course, start with a base cha of about 37.) So in today's raid environment, shrimpy pretty people are the ultimate tanks. wtf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow you guys should hear yourselves . . . .<br />
<br />
couple expansions back, it was the fatties that were the ultimate tank.  Just get some illusion pots and be done with it already, big whoop some little people are now getting to be top of the heap . . . . <br />
<br />
Cry me a river about charisma . . . . . sheesh<br />
<br />
i chose agnostic back before good racial armor . . . well guess i'm screwed huh . . . .<br />
<br />
Just do everyone a favor get the illusion potions, and just deal with it . . .until either it's announced as a bug or you need to be a fatty to push a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, I've been trying to make a sarcastic poke here, but apparantly it's going over some people's heads.<br />
<br />
You have enchanters on that raid?  GET A FUCKING ILLUSION.<br />
<br />
You know a shaman?  Get an illusion potion.  Get an Elf Crown.  Get an AoN.  Re Roll as a goddamned gnome, I don't care.  This is not that big of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's not a difficult concept. <br />
<br />
I don't want to change my race in order to serve as a raid tank. I dont' want to juggle groups to get a chanter into my group every time I have to tank a mob (assuming that's even an option). I don't want to spend 300 plat on a potion every time I have to tank a mob. I don't want to spend 100k+ on an AoN to tank a mob. I don't want to spend weeks farming greens for faction for some stupid quest to tank a mob. I already went out and got myself a cobalt bracer, and now that's not enough, even though for a long, long time it was?<br />
<br />
I am a warrior and I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TANK A FUCKING MOB.<br />
<br />
No clue why this is hard for people to get, but there you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You're oversimplifying your desires and exaggerating solutions. Shouldn't be a prob to keep a chanter in your group on raids, not at all.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/sarcasm on<br />
<br />
All I want to do is not get stuned from the front so i can do my flippin job . . <br />
<br />
All I want is to kill everyone for all the short jokes<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Ok . . . sorry I am trying to take you seriously, but I can;t.  I have to get illusions to climb up big stairs, I get stuned all the time (didn;t get SE aa yet), and I don;t want to hear your whining over having to spend money on illusion potions to corner a flippin mob.  See every race has a disadvantage as well as advantages . . . just because you have to buy a stinking potion to corner a mob should be no big deal.  After all you enjoyed the extra str, and sta for 50ish levels till race becomes a non issue.  Lets see; Do we need to go back to all the what is the best race for a warrior threads . . . notice how me and my smaller brethren are the butt of your jokes . . . . ok so who is laughing now.  It's an annoyance, just like stun is annoying to me . . . except you can buy some potions to equalize the problem and i need to spend 12aa's.  Now please get over yourself and we can continue to a meaningful discussion.  (btw you can still &quot;tank&quot; you just can;t corner a mob . . . . not all mobs require that strategy if you didn;t notice that)<br />
<br />
thankyou now move on, take a trip to the bazaar and get some illusion potions, return to buisness as normal . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I disagree. <br />
<br />
I actually think this is pretty similar to the basic warrior taunt question. It's a question of fundamental workability, where large race warriors are forced to accept an INCREASINGLY burdensome amount of work ONLY to tank a mob.<br />
<br />
I already paid my 10% experience penalty. I got my cobalt bracer. I've geared and AA'd myself. Now I have to spend thousands of plat to become a different race, or spent weeks killing greens for a stupid quest? Just to be able to even tank a mob?<br />
<br />
My guild is in VT. It takes between 7-8 hours for us to clear the 10-11 named that occupy it. We try to rotate tanks occasionally. We arrive at TVD. Raid leader says hey Tug, why don't you get this one? I say, I can't -- because the only project illusion chanter is AFK and I'm out of potions. I *can't* tank the damn mob. At least, not in any reasonable way, while the halfling just hops into the corner and gets the job done.<br />
<br />
And I'm being childish because I think that's wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This is retarded. <br />
<br />
NOT BEING ABLE TO TANK A MOB IS MORE THAN AN ANNOYANCE.<br />
<br />
Iskander, how would YOU feel if the ONLY way you could tank a mob was to have an enchanter in your group casting Illusion:Ogre on you, and that without that you *couldn't function*?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I would not give a shit. I'd probably crack fat jokes on myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I still disagree.  Your problem is that you are fighting mobs that need this tactic, you tank just fine normally.  The only time you suffer is when the mob needs to be cornered, it's buggy atm so the only work-around is for you to carry illusion potions.  <br />
<br />
Yes you need to jump through hoops that may seem a little unfare.  However it's not like nobody else has to.  Why don;t we make an &quot;I win&quot; button so everytime you have difficulty tanking you can press it and instantly become superman.   <br />
<br />
I don;t exactly think 1000 platinum is exactly going to break your bank is it?  At that level of play it shouldn;t.  If you have that big a problem maybe you're guild can help with the cost because it's needed to tank these certain mobs.  <br />
<br />
Yes you are being childish because there is an easy work-around till things get fixed (you did /bug this didn;t you).  Will it happen soon  . . . who knows, maybe they will figure corning a mob is an exploit and make it impossible for any tank to do it . . . I don;t know.  As someone from a small race who caught plenty of crap for the last 4 years I have been playing for being &quot;small&quot; I find it silly you are making such a big deal out of this.  Being an ogre does not make you unable to tank, it means that strategy won;t work for you, that is a BIG difference from not being able to tank.<br />
<br />
BTW the chanter i group with routinly illusions me, just to annoy me, I wouldn't care if I actually needed it in a situation or not.  Also as a smaller race I used have to get illusion or Grow when I MT's so people would spot me (at least in a guild I was in at that time) so no i wouldn't care if I needed illusion ogre to tank a mob in a special situation either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I can see it's not a big deal to you. After all, it doesn't affect you. YOU aren't the one who *can't tank* because of your race. But hey, I appreciate the warrior solidarity. Rock on brother!<br />
<br />
There was NEVER a situation in which small race warriors couldn't tank, but if I can't corner a mob, I am useless to the raid. Yes, I could drag the mob around the room with the melee spinning around trying to get at the back or whatever, but why do that when the halfling can just corner the damn mob? It's not remotely comparable.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as of this morning, a ten dose small race illusion potion costs 3k on my server. I have 2k in my bank account atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Get the guild to pay for it. Pay more attention to the Bazaar. Pharm some quick cash items. Or, as mentioned above, just speak with whoever makes groups for raids.<br />
<br />
Also, small warriors used to have a disadvantage aganst AoW and other large mobs because of a lower Z-Axis. They compensated (the game may have changed as well, but players stepped up in the meantime).<br />
<br />
Honestly you're looking for sympathy where there is none. Warrior solidarity is irrelevant. Use what options you have. SoE might even &quot;fix&quot; this if you /feedback it enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">There's a big fucking difference between not being able to tank and not being able to corner.  Have you tried just wall pinning it?  Center it?  You can tank just fine.<br />
<br />
As for charisma, cry me a fucking river.  Dwarves start with 45, omg omg omg wood elves are so much more uber.  Different races have different pluses and minuses.  Forget about your frontal stun immunity?  You're ability to cap sta so much sooner?  I agree that it should be fixed, but you're turning an ant hill into a mountain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The point is you are still a good tank, and yes in that situation it is inconvenient.  I find Grow is inconvientient and yet i had to have that on me several times when i would MT.  You're ability corner a mob and tanking are not the same thing so quit mix and matching terms.  It's a particular situation, just deal with it.  <br />
<br />
You're right I don;t have the issue, yay for me.  Want me to wire you 10k so you can buy some potions?  I have a real novel idea for you though.  Why don;t you mention this to your guild . . . maybe they can help you with the cost, cut you a deal on the potions, make sure they have chanters around so you can tank etc.  It's not like you are raiding vex with a pickup group, it's called teamwork . . .succesful guilds use it.<br />
<br />
I am sorry that you're race makes this such a problem for you . . . really . . . . but then again look at all us people who chose agnostic, or MM or some other diety instead of RZ so we could get killer armor.  It's annoying but get over it already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I know this came up a few months ago, but I thought it had been addressed.

Anyone else having any problems? <br />
<br />
This was my initial post. This is a perfectly reasonable, mild, and fair post. If it became a mountain later, it's because of whole series of increasingly irrelevant or stupid replies to it.<br />
<br />
It's a notion of basic fairness. I'm disappointed small race or non-raiding warriors aren't behind this, but I guess I'm not surprised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I'm an ogre and it doesn't bug me. Yeah I spent money on illusion potions until I got my VT illusion crown, for the rare occasion that I had to corner tank. However, if you're corner tanking every single mob and view it as an integral part of the game then maybe you should be reworking some of your guild's strats, because I can tell you right now that with the exception of very few mobs you don't really need to corner tank at all.  In the time that you take to raise some money for illusion potions the shorties are wasting time exping for stun resistance that you got for free, and they can never even be 100% resistant to it. I'd much rather have my stun resistance than a few plat for illusion potions, personally.<br />
<br />
Yeah I was kinda mad when they changed it so ogres couldn't corner tank, and it made for some interesting encounters when we were figuring it out, but live and learn and roll with the punches. It's not that bad and you can just let some other people tank if you're too damn lazy to work for some sort of illusion item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Why get the ogre to drag the mob around in an ugly mess in the middle of the room, or an awkward side pin, when the halfling can corner pin the mob perfectly, and no one has to move?<br />
<br />
I'm perfectly capable of doing these things. It's totally unfair that I have to.<br />
<br />
This is exactly analogous to the warrior taunt problem. It's a basic fairness issue. Really, you guys are sounding like knights. &quot;But you can adjust, but the raid can adapt, but there are hoops you can jump through, but you have other (unrelated or irrelevant) advantages, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll keep feedbacking it. Meanwhile, I guess I have the confirmation that I originally sought, that it is in fact a problem, and that large race warriors cannot do what small race warriors can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">It's a notion of basic fairness. I'm disappointed small race or non-raiding warriors aren't behind this, but I guess I'm not surprised. <br />
<br />
I'm disappointed that you aren't behind small races getting frontal stun immunity and getting quite a bit more stamina and agnostics and other other races getting similar cultural armor, but I guess I'm not suprised.<br />
<br />
I agree that it should be fixed <br />
<br />
Yep, I'm not behind you at all.  Seriously, calm your ass down with this martyrdom and screaming how unfair the world is.  You get some bonus, some penalties, same with all others.  Guess what, I carry grow clicks for certain mobs / places also.  It should be fixed, but that doesn't mean the world is against you and that you can't tank at all.  If your guild needs corners and can't wall pin / center, maybe your guild needs to learn some more skills instead of relying on corners all the time.<br />
<br />
Middle is an ugly mess and walls are awkward?  They really do need to work on it more then.  This isn't near the warrior problem.  We couldn't do near the job they could.  With this, you can do the exact same job, just have to be in a different position.  We didn't have the ability to do what they did.  You can.  It's not near what we had to do to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Apples and oranges, Tugurok.

<br />
And I guess along those same lines I should be /feedback because my racial armor stinks.  You can do you're job, but you don;t want to put out any extra effort to do so.  The developers need to get up and fix this asap because it's much more important than fixing the /disc locked at 8 hours right?  I am sorry this game is not fair, and it never will be . . . so do what everyone else has to do and deal with it.<br />
<br />
Comparing taunt to your problem is just outright silly.  This does not effect all warriors, this does not effect all zones, this is not between classes, and there is an easy workaround.  What is the easy workaround for the taunt issue . . . . kill RZ for a BoW??  <br />
<br />
I am sorry for you're problem, but get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Tradeoffs. You can't have everything. You get frontal stun immunity, and some higher stats (while they don't help you now, you must admit they did help you through your earlier levels), while they don't have to fork over money for illusion potions, or pin a mob instead of cornering. It's not like it's harder to wall or center something than it is to corner it... It only prevents people from going afk and meleeing a mob blindly into a corner. Besides, if your guild has any amount of dignity they would condone that type of behavior. Whenever I corner tank, personally, I always flip the mob on enrage to make sure anyone who thought that cornering means a free afk-fight will think twice next time. But that's me. &gt;=D<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not disagreeing that ogres should be returned to their previously geometry of being able to corner tank; however, I am saying that you are coming off very childish in your whining about how it's such a game-breaking change that makes you want to delete your character and uninstall EverQuest and go jump off a cliff because you have you stay awake for 10 minutes while you tank your lousy Vex Thal bosses with a small shred of skill that shows you know how to do something other than set up a water-pecking bird on your taunt key (or, as per the new skills, a second bird for your Incite key).</div></div><hr />

Basically, he came off as a dumbass on a crusade, so people went against him.  I mean, he still can tank just has to use a method other than cornering.  Big races should be able to corner, but it's not the end of the world and it's not a game balance issue.  As far as the posts being not needed, people who act like this, regardless of the validity of their arguement, always draw this reaction.

When you sign up for a race, you know the standard advantages.  It is common knowlege that ogres are unstunnable from the front, so it's not like that comes as any suprise to any of us.  Not being able to corner mobs is a BIG change, won't you agree?  It requires redefinition of many raid tactics against a good many mobs.  So how is it fair that only the large races are penalized?

<br />
I had the first wood elf crown on my server.  I use it constantly, and I have never had problems corner tanking mobs.  However, I can see how this would be a big deal for those of us that are not so fortunate as to have completed the quest, and may not play EQ enough or have the desire to do so.  This is a game breaking change for large races, whether you small races agree or not.<br />
<br />
You pick apart Tugs' words when he speaks of being unable to perform in raids.  You call him a whiner, and tell him to shut up and figure out some other tactics.  Are you really THAT resentful of the large races that have come off as being the &quot;best&quot; tanks for so long?  Whenever I read a &quot;what race should I choose&quot; post, it is almost unanymously stated that races in the end are generally equal.  This is not equality.  This is a slanted scale against large races, whether SOE intended it to be, or even to happen, or not.  It does need to be fixed, and it is incredible to me that the same warriors who bitched constantly about warriors not being good enough are now pleased to let their own kinsman down by not supporting them.<br />
<br />
You say it is so simple, &quot;just get an illusion cast on you, it's not a big deal.&quot;  Who are you to say it's not a big deal?  You aren't the one who has to go through the inconvenience constantly.  Who the hell are you to judge?</div></div><hr />

 Come on, this is just lame. How much has the game changed since Beta? Some of it good, some of it bad, but everybody had to roll with the punches - and we did.<br />

 Not being a good enough tank after PoP for groups was a lot bigger change, and I, like everyone else here, had to suck it up, go get the best aggro generation we could find, and learn all the little tricks to keep mobs on us just to half assed keep up with the Joneses. So how was it fair that only the Warriors were penalized? THAT wasn't in the book, certainly wasn't what I signed up for........but I lived.<br />
<br />
 Tug, everyone knows it sucks. Who knows, you may even have to step down from the MT position on mobs that HAVE to be cornered......would you do that for your guild, if everything your guild tried to do for you didn't alleviate the problem? Seriously, though, it's a minor annoyance that actually has a workaround. You don't like being shrunk to do your job? I don't like being tied to a handful of cookie-cutter weapons that everyone else has to do my job, either. Guess what the both of us can do about it, tho? :p</div></div><hr />

Stuff in VT was hit or miss, seru was but nobody did it - and the only things we regularly corner tanked would be the occasional AoW. We didn't even pin Vindi or Statue. Now you can pin all this junk. I would have loved to be able to pin emp - sliding him along the walls for 40mins at a time wasn't very fun. You know what though? It teaches your guild push control. Pinning mobs makes your guild lazy. You want to talk about basic tanking strategy - try controlling the push of 40 monkeys who are used to afk'ing because you pin everything.<br />
<br />
It's not the end of the world. I'm a barbarian - i still corner everything in pop fine. Everything in time is cornered (save quarm). I can corner most stuff in LDON Time raids... I don't understand why it's such a big deal really. If you understand WHY the mobs pin like they do, it's easy to find a spot to do it in.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is - theres probably less than a dozen raid-target mobs in the game that we can't pin without an illusion. You're arguing for the sake of arguing.

Raaj -- if I knew that only 10-12 raid targets couldn't be corner pinned by large races, that'd be one thing. I don't know that. Everything I have tried can't be done, though I readily admit I haven't tried everything. Anything that can be corner tanked WILL be corner tanked, as you yourself pointed out. Any tank that has trouble doing that is at a disadvantage. Yes, of course we can adjust, as I have said many times now. My guild is a perfectly competent Sol Ro flagged guild with excellent leadership (soon to kill RZ), so please spare the random attacks on my guild. But I'm an ogre, and I want to do my job as an ogre. I shouldn't have to jump hoops or spent $$ to become another race. This is not unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

I happen to think there are other issues a little higher on the priority chain, but go ahead push this up to the fore front, i'd breathe so much easier knowing they delayed any balance issues, and server stability issues so they could help you tank, heck why fix all the other million bugs out there first this has to be the A-1 #1 priority.

No where did I whine about racial armor, seeing as I don't give a fuck about them.  The point of mentioning them was the fact that things change that we don't expect and can make our choice of race seem like a bad one.  But as with racial armor, there is a work around for your problem.  It's not a game balance issue.<br />

Did you read the same thread I did?  Tug is the one who went overboard when someone just suggested a work around.

<br />
Tug -- ditch the whining like a little bitch, it doesn't suit you.  Come here, say that you think it sucks and should be fixed, and you'd get everyone on your side.

<br />
Except that the cases are not comparable.<br />
<br />
Small races *can* get up the stairs by jumping. I can't jump or anything else to corner a mob.<br />
<br />
Small races *can* get grow. I can't shrink to corner a mob. <br />
<br />
You don't *have* to get a racial illusion to move around in Kael. I do have to get a racial illusion to corner a mob.<br />
<br />
Moreover, Kael is one zone. As far as I can see, I can't corner anything. <br />
<br />
If you couldn't get up stairs in ANY zone even with grow or jump, you bet I'd agree that's a problem and that it should be fixed, and I wouldn't come down like a load of bricks on a frustrated person making that point.<br />
<br />
There is no instance in the game where you cannot do your job effectively as who you are. But when it comes to prime time, I can no longer be an ogre without asking my raid to accept burdens they don't have to accept with a different race warrior. That's a meaningful difference.<br />
<br />
I never said it was a game balance issue. I said it was a race balance issue, which it is. I used the analogy with the taunt problem to make a point about the structure of the arguments, which was fair. They are structurally comparable, even if not similar in magnitude. I never said it was as bad a problem and I'm tired of people misreading me on this point. I got annoyed because I was frustrated by an initial series of very pointless replies which included screaming obscenities directed at me, followed by yet more pointless replies. I didn't get annoyed out of the blue, though I'm sorry to have gotten as annoyed as I did. <br />

 OK jackass and what great ability is it barbarians get to balance this? A few extra stam that means jack shit to anyone worried about cornering? Some even more worthless strength? Or is it our stellar nightvision?<br />
<br />
 This isn't an ogre issue and it has fuckall to do with frontal stun OR ANY BALANCE IN ANY WAY. It's a fuck up. A bug. An unintentional side-effect of some model geometry changes. No one said &quot;Hmm large races have it too good, let's make them unable to corner pin normally&quot;. So quit acting like it's some counter-balance to some advantage, it makes you look stupid and smell like wet dog.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">You're both missing the point. Perhaps I should have lopped off his quote after the first sentence and maybe you'd see what I was talking about. Has nothing to do with whether you're large-race or Gnome - frontal stunning is something guilds have to work around if they're using a non-Ogre tank. If they use the Ogre right now, they have to work around the no-corner thing. Same basic idea - to claim one is SO MUCH more important than the other is fallacious at best. THAT'S what I'm saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">What exactly did I not grasp? The two things could hardly be any more unrelated and still pertain to EQ. It's a very very very stupid comparison. You will note my use of multiple very's, as the idea warrents at least that many if not more. You are comparing a racial balance issue that has been in game since release to an unitentional side-effect.<br />
<br />
 And all that aside, what special effort do guilds without Ogre warrior MT's have to make? We haven't had an ogre as out actual MT in...well...ever. had 1 ogre for a little while but he left. We make no special effort.<br />
<br />
 So, you being a human and all, what is it your guild has had to change to accomidate such an inferior tank as yourself when you are up? At least 1 extra cleric right? Surely fight strategies have to change vastly to allow a non-ogre to tank and I just haven't noticed in the 100's of raids I've run and even MT'd on(I'm not an ogre). I can only assume my raiders have been doing something tricky behind my back to sooth my ego and let me tank.<br />
<br />
 Not to mention our 2 top MT people, a halfling and a human(female, which must be accomidated for almost as much as her not being an ogre!). Or our troll twins, or God forbid the wood elf chick steps in. We usually recruit a few other guilds to keep her alive, what with being all un-ogreish.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
Please note that the preceding post has been brought to you by the letters B-O-R-E-D-O-M and should not be taken too seriously=P<br />
<br />
 More seriously, I *do* see the point you're trying to make. It just happens to be a really bad one. On a mob that I can't corner normal 2 things can happen. <br />
<br />
1&gt; I get an illusion. This uses a buff slot and can fall at inopportune times. Not a raid breaker, just an annoyance really because I have an inky mask. I may hafta cancel an atk buff at worst *USUALLY*. Though if I am getting Vie/DI/Ale/SS then it can become more of a hassle.<br />
<br />
2&gt; We wall pin. Also not a raid breaker, but this CAN make a difference in a raid. It extends the length of the fight as you are losing DPS from people having to be in the defensive ability firing arc of the mob to keep it balanced. It also makes people hafta pay attention more, MT included. While I'm not necessarily against this personally, it IS a drawback you don't have to deal with while corner pinning.<br />
<br />
 That is stuff that actually HAS to change on a raid to accomidate the lack of cornering ability. FOR NO REASON AT ALL. It simply should not be. Let that sink in. It was an accident that it ever changed.<br />
<br />
 As for what changes when a non-ogre is tanking(no frontal stun immunity). Nothing. The MT loses a very small amount of DPS and thus agro(infinitesimal amount with SE3). This was a very very very minor issue back in Luclin when the uproar over it started, and it's an even smaller issue now. Especially with the new warrior toys/tricks/weapons. I've cleric'd everything up to FR personally, and played a druid/shaman/ench/wiz for most everything below him. And I can say unequivocally that we make absolutely zero adjustment to account for a tiny bit of stun time on MT.<br />
<br />
 Choice of warrior race is currently more irrelevant than it has ever been aside from one issue. Cornering. And as I said, that can be worked around. It's not huge or gamebreaking. But it is ridiculously stupid. Making anyone who argues in favor of it, or just against someone who wants it fixed, ridulously stupid-looking by extension.<br />
<br />
 The only *VALID* reason anyone can give for arguing against fixing that/Tug wanting it fixed is that this is the Outhouse and they just felt like being an asshole. Any convoluted bullshit balance/in-game reason given is just that, bullshit.<br />

 In closing, fuck Whitey, and FREE CHONG!</div></div><hr />

 But when it comes to prime time, I can no longer be an ogre without asking my raid to accept burdens they don't have to accept with a different race warrior. That's a meaningful difference. <br />
<br />
 Especially when both you and I (and just about every other warrior in the thread) have pointed out just how much of a 'burden' that is. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh. I sometimes let the word chick pass if they're smiling when they say it but running down wood elves? I don't think so. The Emerald Warriors will be hearing about this you can be certain, sir. Besides my only cornering problem is staying out of them when the orge boys are around.<br />

 Big burden or small burden it's still a burden that simply should not exist. Just because he calls it a &quot;meaningful difference&quot; doesn't mean he, or anyone, thinks it's gamebreaking. And believe me, I'm no fan of Tug. When I see him post on the paladin boards as a 'warrior representative' I cringe every time thinking that's how people will see our class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anymore NO mobs &quot;have&quot; to be cornered. There are alternatives. I've heard so many tell me &quot;AoW HAS to be cornered!!&quot; Bull. AoW cornered is easier, yes, but I've tanked Aow w/o cornering or pinning with no difficulty. When I started playing you couldnt corner any huge mobs, you just dealt with it.<br />
<br />
Yeah, its a pain, yeah, it'd be great if it were easier...but its not. Deal with it. Improvise, adapt, overcome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They really need to fix Barbarians and Shrink.<br />
<br />
I am sick and tired of having to jump to go up steps that a gnome is STILL shorter than me can run up, just because I am Shrunk. Sol Ro tower and the Basements of HoH come to mind.<br />
<br />
Another complaint I have is climbing walls. I dont know if its just me, but running to Raid Spot 1 in fire, I cannot climb the wall high enough UNLESS I am shrunk...<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the Geometry  of the barbarian being the tallest of the races, along with EQ's Center of mass engine just plain sucks at times.</div></div><hr />
