<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DennyDarksavior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi i was wondering before i waste my ldon points on it, Would the Dodge 8% aug stack with my shoulder item (on magelo) it has imporved dodge I... how does that work? thanks for the feedback</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't waste points on the ldon dodge aug, its worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh i was just reading the local racing news page and thought he was talking about Dodge open wheel modifieds.....:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is there any proof that its worthless? The 5% dodge aug is worth 150 points. If that alone raises my dodge skill from 200 to 210 how can that be worthless? Now say I get the 8% dodge aug too and it raises my dodge skill to 227, still worthless? I'm only speculating about it, would very much appreciate proof/logic. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like haste, only the highest modifier takes effect.  So if you had both the 5% and the 8% dodge augs, you would only benefit from the 8% one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would go for an AC or HP augment given the choice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's been a bunch of posts about the effectiveness of the dodge aug and parses have shown no difference in avoidance other than the margin of error thanks to the RNG. Just do a search and you can find the old threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The dodge mod fits in type3 slots, so an AC or HP augment isnt really an option (well AC is, but that's better put into type1...I guess I could see 2 10hp augs there though...)<br />
<br />
To answer the original question, 8% dodge mod will stack with your shoulders.  One increases your skill, the other increases your CHANCE to dodge, which are two different things.<br />
<br />
As for the dodge mod, at a time 5% dodge wasn't worthwhile but 8% was because your skill crossed a threshold (I think 8% took you over 200 dodge but 5% didn't but I could be wrong...)  However, having a dodge mod increases your dodge rate a small but parsable amount.  I think I'm going to agree with the above poster and say that I'd rather get a 10ac aug there if the slot allows it.  If not, there's nothing better on merchants than an 8% dodge aug<br />
<br />
Disclaimer, I'm just going from memory and am feeling particularly lazy today so I'm not bothering to double check my facts.  Feel free to correct me.</div></div><hr />

Q1: The amount of damge parsed was fairly insignificant, it appears that adding 8pct to an already infrequently firing skill wasnt that big of a deal.  It was concluded that saving 300 more points and buying a 40 hp aug was better bang fer the buck at that time.<br />
<br />
Q2: Now whether the 8pct and Dodge I stack...well I have no idea.</div></div><hr />
