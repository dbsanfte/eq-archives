Problem is that my haste is on my waist atm (Soulscream).  Ive been saving all my Ldon points and was wondering if I should grab the Nro Helm and throw the type3 Haste aug in it.  My question is though is the haste from the aug worn or is it clicky? and will it stack with Ornate hands haste?  I would go with tribute haste but I would have a hard time keeping tribute up.  Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
BTW feel free to rip my magelo apart.......its ok I know I suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go tribute haste honestly, and save those hard earned LDoN points for AC augs or A3 augs (if you don't already have them).  Tribute haste isn't hard to maintain, only goes for 37 points per 10 mins, and it's really easy to get tribute.  Just turn in some old junk or buy something to turn in.  I always like to tribute Tactician's Bulwarks for a nice 11k tribute, and I can usually pick one up for 5k or less in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How long does that 5k worth of tribute haste last?  If you have the resources that is your best option.<br />
<br />
I would say your points would be better spent on A3 or Ykesha augs or as stated, AC augs..  At least having one of those in your primary slot would help you hold aggro much better.  For an alternative, you can go to Bloodfields and camp the Uken there for the Ykesha aug, see another post for info.  It's in my magelo.<br />
<br />
How big of an upgrade is the belt?  If you don't want to do tribute haste you may want to keep the soulscream and sell the belt and get an upgrade in a different slot.  Oh, your spell haste on your gloves stacks with tribute or worn haste and although I'm not sure, I would imagine that the haste is worn not clicky.<br />
<br />
There are such great helms available to us, it just seems a shame to spend points on the LDoN one (although it is real nice), when later on you'll be looking at a HoRZ or an OoW quest helm, or even hit BoT and try to get ornate.  I don't recall where ornate mold drops, but likely in BoT or Tactics somewhere....</div></div><hr />

No no, the shield costs about 5kpp, and it gives 11k tribute...... and that usually lasts a couple weeks depending on a few factors, like if I forget to turn it off, how much my playtime is that week, etc......</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, that long eh?  Those shields go for a bit more on Stromm (6-8k), so that's 3k a week or so.   Not bad.  Although over the course of a year that's 300k...   I haven't seen any huge upgrades for my neck slot that are easily obtainable or I'd try it, plus my neck is 41%, does tribute haste go that high?</div></div><hr />

Gridle of Bloodstained Stones (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24152) <br />

Its a big hp upgrade for me.  Ill be lookin into Tribute haste tomorrow when I have a chance to log in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">steelslave bladed boots, i get em for about 2.5k pp, fetch about 6k plus tribute.<br />
personally though for things like haste, i wouldnt waste pp on tribute for it. its not that i couldnt afford it, just seems like a waste. i think tribute is best used for times when u  need that bump in stats, or when you need a see invis etc. <br />
<br />
upgrading the helm and augging it personally is not a bad idea. put in a ac aug or hp aug into that helm and you will have a decent helm that should last you a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrya Anuuazz</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Tribute haste does go up to 41% haste and at 37 points per 10 minutes, it's easily sustainable with normal vendor trash and other loot that is so common that it doesn't sell well.  For example, the tactitians bulwark as already stated goes for 11k(49 Hrs) tribute, but there are tons of other items out there that go for decent tribute like &quot;a dragorn greatblade&quot; which is a very common trash drop from OoW that goes for 250 tribute(just over an hour of tribute haste) or you can sell it for about 10 plat or so to a vendor, various GE drops which go for a 2-3k tribute(9-13 Hrs) to include &quot;Book of Impracticallity which goes for 15K tribute (67 Hrs of haste).  There are tons of drops out there that are so common that they are next to impossible to sell in bazaar, yet are the type drops that you can not sell to vendors even if you wanted to, yet they still have a tribute value that is decent.  I'm a big fan of tribute haste and if you do the math on how many hours you play per week, you can see how long it will last you.  Use &quot;ALT+U&quot; to open up your tribute window and you can turn your haste off if you are setting up in trader for the night or doing tradeskills, turn it back on before you fight.  then upgrade your weak haste slot item to something substantial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... various GE drops which go for a 2-3k tribute(324 to 486 hours) to include &quot;Book of Impracticallity which goes for 15K tribute (2432 hours of haste).<br />
<br />
I agree that tribute haste is a great way to go if you can't easily find a haste replacement that's equal to or better an item you already have otherwise, but you might want to chck those numbers.  2-3k tribute should be about 9-14 hours, 15k should be about 67.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My only prob with trib haste is I hae HP/ac tribute bought so I only turn on when I am gonna tank or there is chance I may st/tt/ft whatever.<br />
<br />
Kind of related and not so much. How is the DI tribute? Does it work well is it worth the hefty cost to maintain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fjalarr</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a really important item to have worn haste. I get the tribute haste thing. The ldon haste aug is definitely worth your time to get. I put mine in my NRo Helm and it's been there a very long time. There's a nice earring from doomshade in Umbral Plains(luclin) with 41% haste. I suggest finding a haste item as soon as you can that is worn haste. The ornate gloves are spell haste and give a buff icon when used. Spell/Song haste will stack with worn haste. Shammy buffs 50% haste and chanters buff 66% haste usually at level 65. This would give you 86% or 100% haste if you get the 36% haste aug. The aggro factor is a big part of how many  swings you are taking. <br />
<br />
The cloak of flames is a common 36% haste back item that is nice for new warriors. The price in the bazaar makes it a wishlist item, but soulscream at 31% is a good alternative. If you can do a hard 65 level ldon in Everfrost there is a No Drop back slot 36% haste item that drops there. It's possible to hold aggro with an 18 to 20 delay dual wield combo(Droga). The haste cap is 100% without the bard overhaste song. The value of haste over 80% is really not that important if you are dual wielding 20 delay and lower weapons. EQdiva.com has alot of good number crunching of haste.<br />
<br />
 I am speaking from my personal experience. I dual wielded 18 delay weapons with no procs before the aggro disciplines came out. Speed of weapons will gain alot of aggro. If you are level 65 you are going to need 36% haste to compete with all the other players in your group. The haste buff should be the same for the group since it is usually by a chanter/shaman/bst/bard in your group. So if you have little worn haste you will need fast weapons (20 or less delay). <br />
<br />
There are some good two handers with special procs for massive aggro, but the two handers usually have large delays which require high haste numbers to keep aggro. The velium gemmed greatsword is a decent enough two hander with a low delay which makes it great for two hander aggro. It's the slow axes and swords with over 30 delays that really see the benefits of haste as compared to the low benefit of low delay(20 and below) weapons.</div></div><hr />

Soulscream is nice, and easy enough to camp if you can't afford one.<br />
<br />
I don't like tribute, I run full hp/ac and keep forgetting to turn it off while i'm afk / idling / bumming around and feel the pain for points. But I swap out my stat food and force feed too. I'm too lazy to go turn stuff in very often so I don't get much tribute from vt stuff, but to each their own. Try it out, maybe you'll like it. <br />
<br />
I haven't tried the innate DI thingy, but a couple guildies tried it and weren't real impressed for the cost, I guess.</div></div><hr />
