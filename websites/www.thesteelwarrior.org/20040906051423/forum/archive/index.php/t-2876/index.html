<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Traydan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Read a thread that said we should carry bat wings. Where do I get them, what do i do with them and what do they do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some peeps that cast floaty on you need them as a component. I have never in my eq life carried bat wings except at lvl tiny to sell them to a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can buy them by the stack for next to nothing at the first vendor on the left in the bazaar vendor shack.   Might come in handy someday if your levitation caster runs out of them when needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also can be useful if you carry around lev potions, since some require bat wings.  I personally don't carry them though, weapons / armor takes up almost all of my inventory space =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Never had the need for them. <br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you are hunting in PoNightmare, I can't think of anything in  BoT/HoH or lower where you would need them.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can always camp a pegusus cloak... but be prepared to be beat down by mages camping the horse for their epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">or kill the horse in SK and you'll never need bat wings again (check out the cloak on my magelo)... well unless you want to be  baker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quillmane sucks though =\ I've spent around 30 hours total there for it, and there are many many people who have spent a lot longer with no luck.<br />
<br />
As for a place lev is useful anymore, Tactics pit.. unless you want to run the long way down and hope invis stays up and there are no wraiths / tortured souls in the path =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also the common drop off one of the Underbosses in Chardok is a 10 charge potion that is insta cast, self only levitate.  It's lore, but if you do the mines on a regular basis, you'll have no problem keeping yourself supplied.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't carry bat wings with the advent of Spirit of the Eagle tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">clicks his Pegasus Feather Cloak..<br />
<br />
I almost MQed it with a guildie but he found one for his epic; I think the damn thing is soulbound to me or something. I got it about 3 years ago or something over in SK while levellign up on Aviaks at KFC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like being a hovertank, but sometimes it gets annoying to position yourself in front of a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hate to float tank. It makes it hard to position and get proper proximity aggro. Not to mention it makes me quesy looking at the screen bob up-and-down-and-up-and-down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lev-induced motion sickness is a common thing from what I've heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oulurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think a non bobbing lev spell would have been much better then a non component one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Crydee Ossirian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just cast SOE on people who ask for Levitate as it doesn't use a component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Except the people that aren't level-capable for SoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I hate lev tanking its just annoying for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The only reason they posted you should carry bat wings is if you also are carrying lev potions, which use wings as a component.  I don't think it's too useful to carry batwings just to give them to people that are too lazy to have the componentless lev.  I do carry around a stack of peri's tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Crydee Ossirian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Originally posted by uhrlik <br />
Except the people that aren't level-capable for SoE  <br />
<br />
They can all kick rocks then. Rangers don't get the no component version of the spell, and I don't always have Bat Wings.</div></div><hr />
