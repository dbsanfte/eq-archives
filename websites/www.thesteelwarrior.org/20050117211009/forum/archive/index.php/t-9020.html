<br />
I just wanted to ask you guys for your opinion(s) on my gear situation.<br />
<br />
I am considering selling my Helmet of Rallos Zek (I think they go for 250-350kpp on Maelin approx) and using the money from that sale to make some other armor purchases, such as a ring upgrade, leg upgrade, or whatever suggestions you all may have.<br />
<br />
I realize that the HoRZ is one of the best tradeable bazaar warrior helms. <br />
<br />
My current situation is un-guilded (coming back after a long break), most of what I am able to do right now would have to be done with pick-up groups. I plan to try to get myself geared and aa'd up so I can apply to a pre-ele guild. I am not close to having enough points for either EF or NRo LDON armor and the past few days back the LDON's seem pretty dead. I do have all expansions.<br />
<br />
Just a note I did attempt to see which setup offered more HP/AC but magelo seems to be down the last couple of days and I can't get in to change the gear around.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any and all suggestions, <br />
<br />

I think maybe I stated this question poorly or too broad for a response.<br />
<br />
Is this a really horrible idea? (selling the HoRZ) and I should just keep it and work on upgrading other areas?<br />
<br />
Or would it be a great idea for the cash and I should definitely sell it?<br />
<br />
Any responses would be fantastic, I just don't want to make a huge mistake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you Gaspie for the Str of the Ele response I will look into it, the only problem I see is convincing people to come with me to those zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<br />
Ground spawn in skyfire - all me.<br />
<br />
Phinny in KK - 65 Cleric and my 65 druid, warrior camped at safe spot. I suggest not going straight down to phinny, you get seahorse adds =\<br />
<br />
Guardian K something in WW - 63 Ranger/Shaman boxed by friend and me tanking.<br />
<br />
Animated whatsits in The Hole - 65 Cleric, me tanking, and friend boxing same Ranger, Shaman and a 51? necro for pulls. We had 3 adds because he positioned his ranger bad. More annoying then anything, ranger only one to die. The one on the right drops the piece you need, unless it's random. We killed both.</div></div><hr />

Get yourself some ldon armor or ornate.  Several ornate slots can be filled in single groups. LDON has some really nice pieces that are pretty much interchangeable with ornate and all they cost is time.</div></div><hr />
