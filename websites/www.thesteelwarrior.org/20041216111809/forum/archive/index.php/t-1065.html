<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talic Moore</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not enjoy being vocal on in-game issues here on the boards, but there is a reason for that, and it is this reason that I come forward here today.<br />
<br />
My fellow warriors, here within this community we have a conglomerate of some of the most skilled warriors that exist within the game. Here, more than anywhere else, is a place where a warrior's voice can be heard, but I ask you this...<br />
<br />
Look at our boards. Look at the topics in which the most grave matters are spoken of, watch how we speak and argue, curse and complain. Like children, we do not dive to the heart of the matter, as warriors should do, instead we revert back to some primal state. This site, this board, is a representation of the warrior body as a whole, a single voice. When you speak, it is not only you speaking, when you voice your opinion on this board you speak with the body of the entire class. I ask you now, not as a whole but as individuals, to stop and read those posts again. Now, imagine it said with your voice, without your consent? Is this not defilement in every sense of the word? We are taking what influence we have and smashing it against a stone wall, because we insist on acting like children. We abuse the very power and opportunity that this board gives us. We have a blade, but instead of using it, we dull it on the rocks of shallow complaint and pettiness<br />
<br />
So I beg each and everyone one of you, stop for a moment, and look objectively at warriors and their position in the game. Stop for a moment and think about that post before you make it, stop and think if you're acting fairly, and I implore you to consider the fact that you use each and everyone participant of this board's voice when you speak out here.<br />
<br />
If we are to have change, we must understand these things, and then present a united body free of these childish elements which sicken me and (I am sure) so many others. Every person in the world has the capacity for maturity within them, they must only be honest with themselves in order to find it.<br />
<br />
To fight, we must first be one. Think on it.</div></div><hr />

As it is now, Sony will not fix warriors. There are several reasons, most caused by the Devs stupidity.<br />
<br />
1. Itemization giving hybrids the same AC/HP and then on top of that 100+mana (a stat useless to warriors)!<br />
2. Weapons that are usable by all three plate tank classes.<br />
3. SKs actually doing more DPS than warriors because of the FT, spell AA, and KEI situation causing virtually unlimited casting of lifetaps, DoTs, plus a pet, its over DPS wise.<br />
4. Monks locking warriors at their present DPS levels.<br />
5. Charm spells<br />
<br />
How to you plan on fixing this bucket of fuck? Sony won't do what is required, so it is time to quit and move on to WoW.<br />
Notice monks will be in EQ2, they haven't learned, notice monks not in WoW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumblingdeth</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the problems that need to be solved:<br />
<br />
1. Knights out-damaging warriors when they should be doing 90% of our DPS max. (Slay Undead and Taps, Dots, pets most certainly should be added to DPS)<br />
2. Groups built around charm and AE's.<br />
3. Fixing our fucked up taunt, when it is more profitable to send a hybrid out, have him aggro the shit out of a mob through their spells. Then shaman slows mob prior to it swinging, which MORE than makes up for the very slight hp (if that even comparing some races/dieties) advantage.<br />
<br />
Good luck, then get the idiots at Sony to do it, yea right.<br />
<br />
Here is the answer!<br />
1. Nerf the fuck out of slay undead<br />
2. Shorten AE spells range to make it almost useless.<br />
3. Nerf charm so once a mob is charmed once it can't be recharmed.<br />
4. Increase the DPS for dual wield 30%! Helping monks, rogues, warriors, and rangers. Rangers don't need the help, but they do bow damage, almost no help really then for them.<br />
5. Increase the DPS on Paladin and Paladin ONLY to equal SKs with all their DPS adds so they NOW do 85% with SKs of the new warrior DPS.<br />
6. Seriously nerf the crap out of mobs riptoses.<br />
7. Taunt problem maybe taken care of just via DPS with the new dual wield DPS. If not adjust taunt to aggro  more in slow increments.</div></div><hr />

You know, apart from a few idiots, i am generally quite proud of the warriors who frequent these boards. Advice when asked is given, and given freely. A lot of other boards people will ask for help and never get any replies or some put down comment. <br />
<br />
Sure theres a lot of complaints on the boards these days about you know what  but rightly so and to be honest, i think we cope with our situation as well as if not better than other classes who were labouring at a disadvantge.<br />
<br />
I look at the other class boards a lot and I can honestly say that Im proud to be a warrior amongst the other warriors here.</div></div><hr />

I doubt SOE will change us much with aggro issues because a)they might want to split tanking jobs like pal/sk group war raid or b) where too hard to change and they think paladins are fine (i hope they don't think b) c) they think it is our problem to get good aggro and to keep it if not then obviously either we are doing something wrong or the paladin is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rebuttal to Talic;<br />
&quot;To Fight, we must be one&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tell me; honestly. IS the fight worth it anymore?<br />
<br />
Can you honestly look anyone here square in the eye and believe with the utmost confidence that Warriors; as a class; will in some way directly be taken seriously by Sony/VI and somehow be improved withot taking away from any others ?<br />
<br />
I dare anyone to answer that question. I feel Warriors are dead. A Dead Class. A dead issue. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I am jaded. I'd even be as bold to address Absor ( who only ever directly speaks to his &quot;pet classes&quot; ) to answer that same question because; you know as well as I do; he'd never go as far to admit that &quot;warriors aren't a priority right now&quot; or even say that &quot;we're seriously looking into it; and so far our thoughts on the warrior class since EQ went live are that the class is lacking greatly in design and needs to be looked at from the standpoint of Warriors who have played them for years and can provide an unbiased lengthy amount of information we can work from&quot;... not the usual Sony/VI autogenerated &quot;You're workign as intended&quot;...Intended as the bucket that's placed under the seat in the outhouse.<br />
<br />
Sorry Talic. You got the right viewpoint and are 100% right in how it should be accomplished; but the fight's just not worth it much anymore to a large percentage of the Warrior Class. Kick a dog enough times and it'll learn to just bite it's master as a knee-jerk reaction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talic Moore</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I could, if the backing here were strong enough. Like I said, Shik, I believe here we have a tool that we are grossly misusing.<br />
<br />
Were we to truly, honestly come together and use this forum as a real medium for conversion of the class, I think at least then I'd feel better than I would if I just sat down and died. And just maybe we could do something. But not if we just snap at each other and Verant like dogs...<br />
<br />
That's what we do, right? Fight to the last. As warriors, its our job, a grim task perhaps, but still a neccesary one. Perhaps I'm just a bit to optimistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Optimistic isn't the correct word; more along the lines of Realistic.<br />
<br />
Believe me; it's been years since I felt that Sony/VI has ever once taken my class, the Warrior class; seriously. I don't think I have ever felt this abandoned and ignored in my life. I'd bet more than many people would want to admit they feel the same; from the Uberguild_Overlord to the n00b_01.<br />
<br />
I don't mind fighting. Hell; I want my class to make people see us in our true light; Warrior thick and thin; inside out; and to actually make a difference in the game and not to be taken as some kind of joke by every other class in EQ.<br />
<br />
My thought fall upon the deaf ears of Sony/VI. Their words spoken fall only upon those who the eternal ever_wavering light of EQ happens to shine upon that day. <br />
<br />
Again, my apologies. I hate to keep playing that card but until there is a credible shred of evidence from a reliable source there's just no more steam left in the engine to keep pulling the load up the mountain. It's been chugging along for too too long without even a shred of interest. from the powers that be; only random acts of indifference which started the day they let wurmslayers fit in bags and took away the offensive output from the defensive discipline ( it always sticks in my head for some reason as funny ).</div></div><hr />

Maybe this just isn't the fight for them, it does take some thick skin when you see the same ol stuff each day and I can't say as I blame them for walking away. So leave us to carry this torch and just throw in the support when ya feel the need. We do not need to be brought down any further by our own class telling us how futile it is to bring our protest to Sony/Verant, whatever they are called this week. If you do not feel that it is worth taking the time to help us take up this cause then just support us or encourage us in our endeavors and leave the bashings for somewhere it is needed.   /Cheer Talic<br />

<br />
What I  see is a lot of people who are passionate in their views and their posts reflect it. I'm a firm believer that it takes a certain type of person to really play our class(got warrior?).<br />
<br />
While I am scratching my head wondering what &quot;influence&quot; you speak of considering the track record of dev interest here, I have to say sitting on our asses NOT getting angry about things is a good deal of what fucked us to begin with. I can remember myself and a few posters on the old board up in arms last fall about what was happening to warriors.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the majority was doing their best to &quot;not enjoy being vocal on in-game issues here on the boards&quot;. <br />
<br />
Well, here we are today.<br />
<br />
Why do you want us to not be vocal on issues our class is having in the game? Thank you sir, may I have yet another? Are we to let the class slide even further into the shitter SOE has built for it without a word edgewise?<br />

I highly suggest that you get something to drink, come back, and read what I said again.<br />
<br />
Again, perhaps I was unclear, and if this is the case than I will reiterate for the sake of clarity. The last thing I would want is for my point to be missed and for the entire purpose of my words here to go wasted, even if only on one individual.<br />
<br />
I never even came close to suggesting that we not voice our opinions concerning our class. Nevertheless, what vocalizing we are doing is being done in the wrong way. In introspection, honestly, what would you do if you saw the kind of flames, language, and criticism that you see here today?<br />
<br />
I know what I'd do. I'd think that warriors were being a bunch of snotty, uncreative brats. I'd think that a bunch of kids had just found a dictionary of foul language and decided to flex their new found vocabulary. I'd certainly not want to sift through that vile mess for whatever creative scraps might be within. Rest assured, they are there, but they are not worth the trouble.<br />
<br />
That is why I have not, until now, spoken up. I would rather correspond directly, even if my words fall on deaf ears. My effort here was to unite us, to produce a volume so great that it could not be ignored. <br />
<br />
Influence we have here, have no doubt. Here, we are heard. Doubt and fear will kill you before the battle even begins. Think on it, my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real problem with upgrading Warriors (and pure melee in general) is that SOE can't proceed the same way they do for classes with spells. Exemple :<br />
<br />
- lack of CH healers with pop ? introducing SHM and DRU mini-ch ! but because the clerics feel left out, they have a new proccing hammer, and a line of spell to reduce cast time.<br />
<br />
- Wizards lacked mana regen in xp groups in early luclin ? inc familiar, the level 60ish do :<br />
1:  Summon Familiar: Familiar4 <br />
2:  Increase All Resists by 25 <br />
9:  Increase Effective Casting Level by 8 <br />
10:  See Invisible(4) <br />
11:  Increase Mana Pool by 150 <br />
12:  Increase Mana by 4 per tick <br />
<br />
- new focus items for mages, potg, brell line before level 60...<br />
<br />
 I can take lots of exemples of simple balancing just by tweaking a spell... do we have a store bought upgrade ? no. the fact is the only increase we had is the dodge cap raised for every meleing class, and the /shield (which is useful, like a candy-eye &quot;I take damage for you&quot;).<br />
We have no spells, SOE need to use the hard way to balance us, so they wait, they wait... oh, they 're still planning to take a look  at melee damage abilities, but the numerous threads about warriors doesnt concern them... If you want Absor to talk about warriors, you need to post on Graffe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crist0</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think you can reach him on the bard board equally well, since that is what he plays.<br />
<br />
<br />
In introspection, honestly, what would you do if you saw the kind of flames, language, and criticism that you see here today?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd say well..it's better than most of the other class boards out there, with the possible exception of the overmoderated safehouse. All of the offensable material is kept in one section subtitled &quot;cursin, shoutin, and brawlin&quot;.<br />
<br />
Honestly, aside from the couple of people every board gets(such as imports from other classes ala seventhsword), this is a well behaved board. The mods read the threads and stop the real problems before they start.<br />
<br />
Other classes listen to us...they must, considering all of the warrior threads everywhere else. The reason the Devs don't - and won't isn't because of a couple flames or expletives, but because they don't care. <br />
<br />
They go wading through the PoN boards often(all the proof you need of that is the new exp bonus), and we definately aren't any worse here than they are over there. The only difference is that they care about paladins and their issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In all the various discussions to &quot;fix&quot; the warrior class, has not a list of ideas been compiled from what appeared to be majority aggreement in the threads and then subsequently  submitted to the dev-team or someone like Absor?  I was under the impression that this has been done several times with essentially no action taken on Sony's part.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I see in several of the threads deemed to be childish, is frustration and discouragement, which I feel more or less strongly at times.  I know it isn't constructive to rant but hey if I wasn't passionate about my warrior I would have given up long ago :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good post Talic.  More and more lately I talk to people in game and the SW comes up and people tell me &quot;oh I don't go there anymore, all it is is a bunch of crying.  <br />
<br />
I think people really need to step back and take an objective look at warriors in game and really compare them to other classes.  This community is beginning to look like druids and mages used to be.  So used to complaining that it doesn't even matter if we were fixed, we would just keep on whining because that's all we remember how to do anymore.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think warrior's problems are completely blown out of proportion on this board.  I play this class every day.  I've leveled up two warriors without powerleveling, #2 is 2/3 of the way into 56 now.  I am currently unguilded and have no friends with characters my level.  I get groups pretty easily, and after I have grouped with somebody a time or two, I often get tells from them when their groups need a tank.  I can hold aggro.  Sure I don't keep it 100% of the time, my group members have to pay *some* attention to their aggro, just like they always have, but it's not like I can't tank, or I'm causing a lot of downtime for my group.  <br />
<br />
Taunt works pretty darn good now.  I was in Fungus Grove last night, killing level 60 bugs in there (deep red to me at 56).  I was tanking.  I was &quot;mostly&quot; holding aggro off of a 65 ranger (that's 9 levels and 56 AA points he has on me, but my group still felt I was the appropriate person to be tanking).  The enchanter was pulling with slow, and it never took me more than 3 taunts to get it off of him.  A lot of times it worked on the first try.  Is that perfect aggro control?  No.  Is it a horribly broken class that can't do their job?  No.<br />
<br />
On raids, warriors still get all the glory.  Paladins and SKs tank adds, but they melt like sugar in the rain if you put them in front of high-end boss mobs.  Aggro or not, there's no question who's gonna be tanking the boss mobs, it's warriors.<br />
<br />
Here's the whole beef with warriors.  In experience groups...sometimes...we have trouble getting aggro quickly.  With a warrior tanking, there's a better chance that the slower will take a couple hits and it will take a few seconds for things to settle down and get the mob on the tank.  During this time the cleric might have to cast a fast heal on a shaman or enchanter and waste some mana.  In this situation, a paladin or shadowknight can get aggro right away.  They have a little less hit points, but a lot of clerics feel that the better aggro control more than makes up for it, so given an equally equipped and aa'd paladin and warrior, they would take the paladin.  I have never heard a cleric say that they refuse to group with warriors, or even that they don't like grouping with warriors.<br />
<br />
Folks, that's a minor imbalance.  That is not a horribly broken class.  That is not a reason to quit your warrior.  That is not a reason to daily post bitter complaints on what used to be the best EQ class board on the net.<br />
<br />
Any Dev that reads these boards is going to see the outrageous hyperbole that is posted here daily, go back and look at the facts, and come to the obvious conclusion.  &quot;These guys don't know what they're talking about&quot;.  Those of you that consider it your mission to save warriors by daily posting your exaggerated gripes are not helping the warrior class.  You are turning what used to be the board other classes came to to get away from the childish whining on their own server boards into just another whine-play forum.  No dev in their right mind would read half the crap on this board and take it seriously.<br />
<br />
Please try to keep your posts to valid concerns and make sure you are making intelligent, rational posts and not just whining.  This board would be a much better place if you did.</div></div><hr />

Interesting theory, shame it can't be tested since we've gone without the whole fixing bit for over half of the game's life. <br />

Keep shouting on the rooftops(well, /sigh'ing in threads about our issues) how warriors aren't really broken. It's all just a figment of the imagination of the vast majority of players with complete disregard for class lines.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think warrior's problems are completely blown out of proportion on this board. I play this class every day. I've leveled up two warriors without powerleveling, #2 is 2/3 of the way into 56 now. I am currently unguilded and have no friends with characters my level. I get groups pretty easily, and after I have grouped with somebody a time or two, I often get tells from them when their groups need a tank. I can hold aggro. Sure I don't keep it 100% of the time, my group members have to pay *some* attention to their aggro, just like they always have, but it's not like I can't tank, or I'm causing a lot of downtime for my group.<br />
<br />
Taunt works pretty darn good now. I was in Fungus Grove last night, killing level 60 bugs in there (deep red to me at 56). I was tanking. I was &quot;mostly&quot; holding aggro off of a 65 ranger (that's 9 levels and 56 AA points he has on me, but my group still felt I was the appropriate person to be tanking). The enchanter was pulling with slow, and it never took me more than 3 taunts to get it off of him. A lot of times it worked on the first try. Is that perfect aggro control? No. Is it a horribly broken class that can't do their job? No.<br />
<br />
On raids, warriors still get all the glory. Paladins and SKs tank adds, but they melt like sugar in the rain if you put them in front of high-end boss mobs. Aggro or not, there's no question who's gonna be tanking the boss mobs, it's warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I can shorten it up:<br />
<br />
<br />
Folks, that's a minor imbalance. That is not a horribly broken class.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm seeing people leave the class in droves. I'm hearing other people voice the frustration I also feel after years of neglect for my class. I'm even seeing people who fought tooth and nail for a long time just give up on the class or the game entirely because of how bad it has gotten. I don't find that to be a minor imbalance at all.<br />
<br />
If I didn't feel nearly as strong but knew there was a problem I definately wouldn't belittle people for bringing it up virtually every time they did so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd love at equal level to have 15-20% more hp then any hybrids.<br />
<br />
I'd love 5-10% innate mitigation and avoidance that no other class gets.<br />
<br />
Finally, I'd like AoE taunt to go down to a 2 minute refresh. Not overpowering, but definitely useful for exp groups, and on raids, thats plenty of time for the other classes to get killed if they aren't careful.<br />
<br />
I can live without all of that, but I'd definitely appreciate it.<br />
<br />
On a bonus note, next expension is sporting &quot;new powerful spells&quot; wouldn't it be nice if it also had some &quot;powerful discipline for those poor pure melee who are fed up of getting jack shit in that department?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I log on my warrior, the only people around here I can look square in the eye are Dobbo and Wandor.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
But seriously, nice post Tallic.<br />
<br />
I understand what you're saying, but, also you too have to keep in mind that on the hot topics, the debates are going to get heated, and as with any internet message board, some vitriol, some cursing and some general immaturity is going to sneak in.<br />
<br />
I'm guilty of that, a lot.<br />
<br />
When the topic really gets going, I forget this is the warrior board and revert to the knee-jerk/reactionary posting style of Monkly Business.<br />
<br />
Then I realize this isn't MB, and there is no need to fight and rage on the threds so vehemently, since it's just a lot of bluster anyways.<br />
<br />
And then the threads get fun again.<br />
<br />
As far as community goes, the warrior community, even with the huge influx of paladin bashing and SOE ranting and raving that has popped up recently, is STILL one of the nicest group of people out there.<br />
<br />
You guys and gals rock.<br />
<br />
The board re-vamp was impressive.<br />
<br />
The tone and demeanor of Steel Warrior is still very respectful, and SOE reps have no reason NOT to frequent this board and participate in discussions.<br />
<br />
The only reason, I personally think SW doesn't get more responsiveness from the sony reps and PR folks is, they really don't know what to say.<br />
<br />
Absor doesn't know what to tell the warriors, and so he chooses not to stir up a hornet's nest because if he does post, he will garner a lot of attention and his not having anything to say will garner a lot flames.<br />
<br />
If he had something to say, I believe he'd have said it, and people would not have flamed his as much.<br />
<br />
If that makes any sense.<br />
<br />
Anyways, my point is, compared to many of the other class message boards I post on and just simply read, SW is a worthy community. You all do a great job moderating here, even when emotions run high.<br />
<br />
Guess I'm just trying to cheer you up Tallic. You see a lot of the negatives right now. But I still see so many of the positives.</div></div><hr />

Ya, if you really think that the problems warriors have (IE : shitty mitigation compared to Hybrids, Taunt is iffy at best, and a marginal HP bonus over other classes) is really whining even half as bad as a typical Druids Grove thread, then I think you need to look again.<br />
<br />
I'll admit, the inability to confine discussion to 1 or 2 threads is annoying.  Everyone has to make their own thread about the thing in order to feel &quot;heard,&quot; when in reality it only leads to the perception you have Talic.  Eliminate that, consolidate threads, and we solve a lot of the perception problem some of you are having.<br />
<br />
I don't think warriors are being unreasonable asking for a bigger HP/Mitigation edge and taunt to work a little differently/more reliably.  Those are real, every day issues that we all have to contend with.  It's completely different from asking for Rez, animal only everything, CH, Divine Aura, et cetera, et fuckin cetera.</div></div><hr />

That having been said,  I love this board, and even though I don't always agree with you all, I have a great deal of respect for the vast majority of you.   Hell, most of the people here know more about playing our own class, and more about playing most other classes, than the people who play those classes. (We have to in order to be able to teach the LoIO, overthere, DL, PoP crowd to control their aggro).  I would like to point out to a few of you that swear words, when used in moderation, can really help to illustrate a point, and give a certain degree of passion to a written statement that would otherwise be missed because you cant &quot;write&quot; tone of voice.  However, if you have one or more swear words in every sentence in your post it just looks like the ranting of a 13 year old who doesnt know any better way to express himself.  I'm not saying anyone who posts that way is unintelligent, barely literate, or anything like that, but it makes you SEEM that way to people who don't know you or havent read enough of your posts to know that you're just really angry about that one topic and can't help cursing about it.  And no debate should ever degenerate into personal attacks and name calling.  Again, it's been a pleasure sharing information with all of you, and debating the things we dont agree upon.   And if SOE/VI/Absor doesn't come here because of the few problems the board does have, it's their loss.<br />

<br />
Without disagreement as well as a variety of opinions and ways of thinking, more problems would go unsolved. For if one could not find the answer, then none could. Or perhaps you would end up with a population with like minds that could no longer think for themselves.<br />
<br />
With it however, people can look at things from different angles, describe what flaws and perfections they see to one another, and thus work together for improvements.<br />

There is a saying that best describes what I am trying to convey:<br />

&quot;Steel sharpens Steel, Men sharpen Men.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
( I will thank you to get your mind out of the gutter now~ )<br />

<br />
I believe what Talic was trying elaborate however, was that while ideas and problems should be brought to light and worked upon, keep in mind they are being worked upon in the light. The tools you would use to shape thoughts are words. As with any great work, if you chose the improper tools, it shall be imperfect.</div></div><hr />

I personally don't see a problem with arguing, but when people run out of things to say and go into name-calling mode, the discussion ceases to be valuable immediately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I disagree with the statement as being too narrow.   Yes, in the most simplistic terms, that's a summary of 'what's wrong with warriors' to a degree, but there's significant other issues surrounding warriors which take what would be a small issue in a vacuum and magnify them into a serious problem.<br />
<br />
I tend to think that warriors are *major* fubared at the moment, but there's nothing you can point to that is the *one* major fubar.   This is why arguing against specific details seems to uncover so little, also there's all sorts of room for disagreement about those details.   <br />
<br />
One thing I've noticed about warriors that is amazingly different than other class' 'whine' threads is that we are able to disagree with one another, even violently at times, and rarely do we see &quot;bandwagon&quot; approaches like we do on other class boards.   I remember specifically a REALLY good thread when PoP came out about our takes on it while it was fresh.   It was very interesting to see the restraint, people willing to give it a chance, and the benefit of the doubt, pointing out things they liked and things they didn't like.    <br />
<br />
We come to this point, and well, people are casting aside their warriors (I never in my wildest dreams would've expected my necro to be able to solo in a tier 2 plane prior to PoP coming out when he was level 30, but a serious lack of opportunities brought on due to class balance has seen to it that that would happen).   If people are giving up on their level 65 warriors (except for raids) then there's a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the whole beef with warriors. In experience groups...sometimes...we have trouble getting aggro quickly. With a warrior tanking, there's a better chance that the slower will take a couple hits and it will take a few seconds for things to settle down and get the mob on the tank. During this time the cleric might have to cast a fast heal on a shaman or enchanter and waste some mana. In this situation, a paladin or shadowknight can get aggro right away. They have a little less hit points, but a lot of clerics feel that the better aggro control more than makes up for it, so given an equally equipped and aa'd paladin and warrior, they would take the paladin. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you disagree with this paragraph? Is that not pretty much the only gripe with the warrior class at the moment?<br />
<br />
<br />
No.  The main issue for me is that despite playing the premiere tank class in the game, knight classes have the potential to tank as well as I do, in some cases *outtank* me, *even in raid situations.*  This is in addition to having spells, buffs, and other special abilities.<br />
<br />
Where does this leave the average warrior who doesn't raid much/doesn't belong to a raiding guild?  You know, the one who's been to 3840 HoT raids to finally win an entire set of SS quest armor, the one who hit 65 several months ago but still scrapes by using a Frosty for aggro.  <br />
<br />
The issues surrounding the warrior class today cannot be summed up by saying we have &quot;aggro problems.&quot;  We do, but that's not the end of it.  We are a baseline class that has not been changed for quite some time, not even to raise our piercing cap. In these days of fast-paced xp groups, freely-flowing mana regen, and encounters where aggro management is critical, warriors seem to have gone out of style.   Oh, maybe not in elemental planes and beyond, but guess where your average warrior is?  <br />
<br />
What does a warrior bring to an exp group besides tanking and /shield?  Yes, we are marginally better than knights in terms of hp/ac if you compare a similarly-equipped warr to a knight, with a similar number of AA's.  But again, the knight brings so much more to the table, plus he has the ability to tank nearly as well as warriors do.<br />
 <br />
What does a warrior bring to a raid?  If you're MA/SA, that's all well and good, you're performing the way we were meant to.  Any other warrior is merely a possible backup tank plus a bit of DPS.  I can live with that, I don't feel we're really broken in this respect although I feel useless when not tanking.<br />
<br />
Someone summed it up nicely in a previous post when he/she said, &quot;Warriors are a one-trick pony with half a trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
When you render our &quot;trick&quot; (tanking) trivial by allowing two other classes to step in and actually be more wanted in exp group over warriors, then there is something wrong.<br />
<br />
I do not see a parallel between our problems and other class problems.  Druid/Shaman as main healer still take a back seat to cleric.  Bard as main CC takes a back seat to a chanter who can mez more than 4 at a time.  Yet replacing a warrior with a knight makes no real difference since a knight can do a warrior's job equally well, with more utility considering he has spells and abilities.<br />
<br />
Do you see where the average warrior might be frustrated and see that he/she is clearly not bringing as much to the table as a knight (or any other class for that matter)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you Talic for helping organize this board but you should be proud that its being used. <br />
<br />
This is the warrior board. This is the board EQ warriors want the Dev team to read. If you don't want warriors address legit complaints about their class falling behind, then you don't want to be part of the board that is recognized as the warrior's voice.<br />
<br />
You want warriors to fill post after post of &quot;I think everything is just fine with the warrior class&quot; then your not thinking clearly.<br />
<br />
Yes, there are decent reasons to play warriors. OTHER boards point those out just fine when they make their case to have their classes balanced. <br />
<br />
Its our responsibility to point out areas that warriors can be improved and make the case why these are areas that need improvement. <br />
<br />
As it stands now, even other classes are complaining about the balance surrounding warrior agro. When that happens its fairly clear there is a problem. <br />
<br />
And you think we are supposed to be silent? I dont know about you, but I like people thinking I'm useful in experience groups. I played a wizard for a long time and that was a class that was great on raids and the suck in exp groups - and I hate soloing - so I changed classes. Forgive me if I dont want to change classes again.</div></div><hr />

I can tank a Tier 3 mob to 80% without needing a slow - Some shaman and enchanter just cant comprehend that warriors soak up damage better than other classes.<br />
<br />
Actually, my last exp groups in Tier 3 (Bot, hoh, hoh, potact) I didnt even have a slower in the group and the cleric never got below 40 mana even on chain pulls. The necro got crushed once though.</div></div><hr />

Overall, we don't do that badly.  We still don't seem to be heard though, regardless.  Druids, as an example, can be far more....uncontrolled I guess is a good way to describe it.  Yet they seem to be heard and get some form of acknowledgement anyway.<br />

Get a bunch of posters here together in chat one day, or make it two days even, whatever you need but keep it simple. Make a serverwide channel just for this purpose. Get some general consensus on a spokesperson or two. If people can't make the meeting they can email their thoughts to a spokesperson who can bring them up at the meeting. Have it out, discuss what really needs to be addressed, then have that spokesperson draft a really good argument. Then have everyone sign on the dotted line and such and have *everyone* send a copy to the dev team.

<br />
I think mainly mana regeneration has unbalanced the game and brought problems for pure melee to the fore.<br />
<br />
Back in the day, casters had to sit for mana.  Groups had to wait to pull until the casters had enough mana for it to be safe.  You wanted to preserve all the mana you could because it was the blood of your group.<br />
<br />
You also had to watch your agro, if you over cast, you couldn't sit because you'd get agro and die and therefore slow down the group, because you were low mana or dead (wasting time, et cetera)<br />
<br />
Today...<br />
<br />
KEI, Flowing Thought, HORSES, et cetera.<br />
<br />
So, casters have &quot;virtually unlimited mana&quot;, I honestly don't remeber the specifics of the last time a group I was in had to wait for mana, but I think it was right after tanking a named in BoT.  Before that, I do not recall any instance of waiting on mana.... where as back in the day every few pulls you'd need to sit and wait at least a little to be safe.<br />
<br />
HORSES - you don't need to worry about sit agro in outdoor zones... oh wait... the best zones to XP in 60+ ARE outdoor zones.<br />
<br />
Other things that have gone to unbalance the classes are the variety of spells that have been added to the casting classes with very little in the way of &quot;new&quot; being added to melee.<br />
<br />
Melee have gotten-  /disc.  itemization.  AA.  /shield in the case of warriors.<br />
<br />
Casters have gotten - itemization.  AA.  Many upgrades to old spells, and new spell abilities.<br />
<br />
Hybrids have gotten - itemization.  AA.  /disc.  Many upgrades to old spells, and new spell abilities.<br />
<br />
Playing from day 1 (well, darn close to day 1, if you all recall NeverQuest *caugh*) just thinking about the way the game has progressed casters tend to get all the new toys melee do (cool new items) and then some (Spells).  I think this, more than anything else, has led to the current situation, the pure melee just doesn't have a mechanism to add nifty new things like spells can do for other classes.<br />
<br />
The other change is obviously better itemization for hybrids (specifically knights) since the origonal game.  Combine the changes to itemization, the mana regen, the lack of sitting agro, the outdoor dungeons and you end up with a lot of discontent for pure melee classes and warriors in specific.<br />
<br />
I am hoping that the next expansion will be something of a &quot;golden age&quot; for warriors, making groups head back to the dungeon crawl, where warriors seem to shine the most (because casters need to watch their agro and sit to med instead of horses)... although I am not getting my hopes too high, and until then I believe I will focus on an alt or another game.</div></div><hr />

I agree entirely with the majority of posters here, that there is a problem with the class, and that it should be addressed. and I believe this post is a giant stepping stone in the right direction.<br />
<br />
I don't play in the high end game, I'm 53 with pretty good armor (1080ac 2600hp) and i use a frosty + BCA or defender's lightblade for aggro. I do notice that establishing aggro is kind of difficult in the first 10-20 seconds of battle, and even moreso in PoP where the majority of mobs are still yellow-red cons for me. I believe this is more of a problem for the warriors midgame, as once you hit 50, there's really no mainstream place to level, everything is planes. KC, Seb, Velks, LoY zones, etc are all empty aside from farmers and the odd soloer. 64 and 65 toons are normally guilded with a good number of friends (not all of you, i know, but the majority) and even finding a pickup group is trivial if you have the time to wait for a while.<br />
<br />
I guess what i'm trying to say is give lower warriors a place to go where everything isn't higher than them, that they could maybe even solo if they were careful (the average warrior, not SoD + Horn of Hsagra, CoF Heavy Rubicite Girdle Fungi equipped one) to get them up to where they can group effectively. I think the mentality groups get that knights are better tanks come from the fact that a lot of the warriors with aggro control problems are warriors where they don't belong, but have been forced to go there because it's where the population is. I would gladly go to seb, kc, and velks again to grind out a couple more levels, because i know i can be efficient there. Hopefully the recent xp changes on test, coming out tomorrow, will help with that to some extent.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's just my 2cp on that topic.<br />
<br />
PS - I do realize that there are some other major problems with tanks in the high end game, from posts i've read and such, but since i'm not there, nor will i ever have any realistic chance of getting there, i can't make any comments on that area.<br />
<br />
Free period just ended, time to actually get some work done in school, lol...take care all, and i'll try and keep an eye on this thread, to see if i can take part in the meeting that might be coming up<br />

<br />
then, get the moderators to shitcan every new thread which in their opinion does not say anything new on the subject. because frankly, is there anything which hasnt been said which hasnt already been said?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talic Moore</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And in doing so, we cross the line from moderating the boards and maintaining order to policing the boards for any thought we don't agree with.<br />
<br />
I think that perhaps weekends would be good, during the evening. Have a meeting Saturday morning and then another meeting on Saturday evening, that way people in different time zones and with differing schedules could still participate to their fullest.<br />

He's already praising a game thats not even out yet... granted it may be 1000x better than eq... but really how does anyone kno until it is released for the masses?<br />
<br />
(not directed towards anyone in particular) If eq isnt fun anymore and you're dead set on quiting... man the fuck up and stop wasting your time and your guild's and quit already... and quit posting on the messages boards about how your going to quit...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zotha</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This board is one of the better balanced of the class boards when it comes to information, maturity and decent class discussion. If you look at other boards you can see what happens when either the moderators are the most rabid defenders of the class but have no idea about rational balance (druid grove). Or, perhaps worse, when the board is massively over-moderated and ends up just being a series of posts with the same whine over and over with no real discussion (the safehouse). <br />
<br />
Why these 2 communities get 99% of developer contact and all the other class boards (cept maybe Graffe's) get ignored is rather perplexing. Only thing I can think of is because they are the biggest (safehouse) and the loudest/most annoying (druids) class boards respectively.<br />
<br />
The Steelwarrior boards has suffered from the perception of being nothing but complaints because the same problems have existed for years and hence they get pulled up constantly, over and over. When nothing ever gets fixed, its hard to &quot;get over it&quot; and move onto new issues. The strength of this board is that the majority of the members who post here can see things rationally and realize that overall game balance is just as important as the warrior classes individual problems. Many other boards do not display this level of maturity, and sadly they actually receive alot more attention then us.</div></div><hr />
