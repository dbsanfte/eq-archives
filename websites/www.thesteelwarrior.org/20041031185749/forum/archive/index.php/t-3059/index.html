<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xasam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if I add an augmentation to a weapon with an existing proc (e.g. GSoT) will both the procs get a chance to go off every swing?  Seems like adding Ykesha to a GSoT would make a very nice aggro weapon (for practically free).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bump.<br />
<br />
I'm curious too.<br />
<br />
(Also want to make sure that proc augment doesn't remove any old procs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DO A FUCKIN SEARCH OR AT THE VERY LEAST READ THE TOP 10 GODDAMNED POSTS IN THE BUNKER.</div></div><hr />

Ah yes................<br />
<br />
Could it be.......................... (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2997)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">FUCK YOU HAAS.<br />
<br />
This is the one post that asked this very specific question.  Yes or no would have been alot easier to type then what you did asshole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NorokFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">same exact question has already been asked multiple times :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BigAlFoxTrot,<br />
<br />
Your whopping 8 post count is starting to show through.  Here is how it works, generally speaking.<br />
<br />
Read the board, and then ask new questions.  <br />
Post a bit, and then be a dick to old timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">First of all, I didn't ask the original question.  I just bumped it.<br />
<br />
Second of all, I don't think I was the one being a dick here.  I see alot of threads on procs, but reading them is mostly about how what they are, hate values, how much they cost.....  <br />
<br />
My point is, instead of being an asshole, he could have just answered the question or referenced the thread it was in.<br />
<br />
And just because I have only 8 posts doesn't mean I can't call someone who is an asshole and asshole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just for clarification, what is the post total before we can call Haass names?  Am I getting close yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well actually it says 10 post and would have been 9 when you posted that one, but, I did give you the answer in a link, did you read it? If so, where is my thank you, shesh :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks Sivok.<br />
<br />
I like the way you made the same point as Haas but in a much nicer way WITHOUT ALL THE FUCKING CAPS AND ATTITUDE!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">:)<br />
<br />
Your welcome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">does your total post count really matter if your posting 1 line <br />
asshole replys? i can understand the origional post being unnessiary if the poster jsut read a few of the other topics with similar titles, but there's never a reason to out right be a dick to some one you dont know. an answer could of easily been posted instead of a flame, or at the very least, an answer with the flame, but instead some one had to add another useless post and create more mindless threads to spam the boards with.<br />
and just incase anyone didnt answer the origional question, a weapon *can* have more than 1 proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can call me names at any point, but if you're a dumbass and asking the same shit that everyone else is without at least TRYING to find the answer, then I get to return the favor.</div></div><hr />
