<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently struggling though the second hard LDoN I have been in since OOW. For what will be 3 hours of play time.. .I will have 6% XP. For...150 hours played to JUST GET 67.<br />
<br />
Vx is not a place I can do easily for XP. There aren't pick up groups in OoW yet for non-ubers. So the ubers take 2 days to do what will take me probably until the new year, at this rate. <br />
<br />
The F'ing uber/casual gap HAS TO BE CLOSED!<br />
<br />
RIght now I am just pissed. <br />
<br />
maybe things will seem more reasonable when some time passes but when I hear about grinding 5 levels in one old world spot that most people can't get to, in one long camp *21 hours*  where as I put in the best effort I can and show a return of 6%--or a whopping 31.5% into 66 for a 21 hour stretch.<br />
<br />
On top of that I can die to a bunch of greens while looking for @#$^ pages in OoW for epic. <br />
<br />
I knwo 1.5 is supposed to be 1 time level group (or so they claim) to get and 2 way past that. I still want to work toword it. If I am still playing EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tables isn't anything I'd call &quot;old world&quot; <br />
<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
I understand your frustration though.<br />
<br />
My advice is to find a new game to play. One that is fun. Leave the frustration behind. It'll feel great. You don't even have to make it a permanent change. Just step back from the pressure. Get back to the basics. The reason you even picked up EQ in the first place. It wasn't to level 5 levels in 21 hours. It was to have some fun with a video game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry PoP is 4 expantions old...LDoN, GoD and OoW since (and LoY as I recall...if that one counts).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm feelin the same way Kailyn.  Nobody wants a 5.8k lvl 66 tank to explore OoW with and I'm not EP flagged so fugg that.  LDoN's are a joke, I'll be surprised if I EVER get invited to another considering I was averaging one every week before OoW.  Sewers 2 and 3 have been decent xp for the difficulty, but again nobody outside my guild is willing to go there just for xp, so during off peak times I'm SoL there.<br />
<br />
The xp rate is horribly painful.  My guild formed a group of 6 of the best geared people we have for BoT last night just to see what kind of damage they could do.  After 2.5 hours ... they had 16%.  That's 15.6 hours per level.  Or 78 fugging hours to get to 70.  Ahhh well, at least there should be some new games this winter (yeah right).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The reason why you're not getting anywhere is because you're doing LDoNS. Start a group, and try some of the easier shit in GoD. The draniks trials are 1% for 2 kills at 65 (not sure what they are at 66 probably 1/5 or something), and are so much easier then Hard ldon. People in the top end guilds don't do ldon runs (which have a lot of wasted time) for their exp, they find a spot and stick with it and grind, grind, grind.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to set up a group. If you are just sitting on your ass, with lfg tag up then it's nobody's fault but yours.  One of the problems with PoP is that the zones were locked. OoW doesn't have locked EXP zones.  <br />
<br />
Nobody ever said it would be easy to get to level 70, and it's obvious that it won't be handed to you on a silver platter.<br />
<br />
EVERYONE has to grind to 70, it's all about knowing where to go, and what to avoid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said...soon after that post I got invited to a wall of slaughter group and the XP is moving visalbe. Not &quot;Good I am used to dinging AAs&quot; good, but better than hard. ANd quite doable.<br />
<br />
Yes I did bring my GoD bunker mentality to OoW but that does not change the fact that the PoF Talbes are a sliver platter for those who can get to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tables is a pretty small camp. I'd think PoE would be more friendly to the grind, but that's just me.<br />

I don't grind anymore in that game and am happier for it. So how's Povar doing lately Kailyn? Anything new?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OoW is by far the best expansion casuals have seen yet.  Droppable 100-125hp items and 18/20 1handers are going to inflate the market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Silver platter?<br />
<br />
I've had 4 guildies kiting PoFire tables non stop since release, with a 65 wizard boxed outside group for damage + 66 ench bot. They are atm around 50% through 69, and are equipped in VT / EP / Early GoD gear up to Ikkins group trials. They have been slacking a bit due to need of sleep lately, but if you're prepared to give up alot of sleep and do a 48 hr camp then by all means go ahead.<br />
<br />
The teams that have already gotten 70 have been in end-zone GoD gear and with bots outside the group for damage as well, and have probably planned it for weeks.<br />
<br />
My experience is that OoW has lots to offer. Spent a few hours yesterday in The Dranik City Ruins (or whatever its called heh) and got quite nice droppable loot (7 ac / 95 hp earring, 28 ac / 115 hp helmet) and mobs didnt seem much harder than BoT level. Also xp seemed nice, about 3-4 kills to move 1% in 66, which is only a bit worse than Kod'Taz or Fire Tables.<br />
<br />
Its all about getting the right group to go with, which if doing pickups can be hard and has a lot of randomness or luck to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Look over on the stats and aa board. Warrior did it in 21 hours. Trion had at least 2 70s I saw. And its not that they are going 21 hours of played time all at once to get it, but that my played time will be at least an order of magnitude larger to get 70th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In their defense (at least somewhat) a LOT of those uber toons have absolutely stupid /played to get the gear /aa /flags they have that enable them to make XP at that rate. Fact is, us mere mortals have access to a few decent xp zones too, our real weakness is we don't play enough to have a consistent hardcore group to grind with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why do you play this game? Is it just a mad dash to the end? If so, congratulations! You lose! Look, they obviously intended the leveling to take a significant amount of time, even for the people able to get experience the fastest. That is a GOOD thing, because you can see significant progression for a longer period of time. My suggestion: Slow down. Stop worrying about it and find the loot camps you want to do and consider exp secondary. Trust me, if you're camping some of the random GoD items you'll be doing better gearwise AND exp wise in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Kailyn started a thread entitled:<br />
SOE and the Ubers can go F themselfs<br />
And contended:<br />
The F'ing uber/casual gap HAS TO BE CLOSED!<br />
How about closing the yawning gap between yourself and what casual players can accomplish first and then decry the uber/casual &quot;gap&quot;? A non-raid level 65 player can obtain 7500HPs. Your Magelo falls significantly short of that.<br />
<br />
If you think about it, there's really not a lot of difference between you and a level 60 player with ~5500HP's. Should Mr. Level 60 complain that the higher level players get all the good experiance and are more successful in harder zones? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
You have killed enough mobs to be level 65, but that only one measure of character development in this game. Another is equipment. Why having achieved level 65 do you understand that you will perform better than a level 60, but can't accept that with ~5500HP's unbuffed you will have a harder time than other casual players with 7500HP's and &quot;uber&quot; players with 10k HP's+?<br />
<br />
Yes, yes, yes:<br />
The F'ing uber/casual gap HAS TO BE CLOSED!<br />
CLOSE IT!!! That's what the character development portion of this game is all about. Just DO IT,<br />
<br />
I understand that it takes time and effort. But casual players can not define themselves as those that do not put in the time and effort and then say the gap is too wide. I was once at 5500HP's myself (not at level 65, but I was). The AC and HP indicators are NOT stuck there. Time and effort move them.<br />
<br />
I was given stuff on a silver platter???!!! I hardly think so. Most of my in-game time is spent raiding and experiance is notoriously low raiding. Yet, I took the time and made the effort to get max experiance in level 65 and 30AA's saved (in addition to 500+ already used).<br />
<br />
With further time and effort I'm at level 67 1/2. Tomorrow, I will be at 68. And I'm doing experiance in Kod'Taz - a zone ANY level 65 can reach, it doesn't take a raid. Can you fight there effectively? I doubt it. If a level 60 could get in, they'd be lunch meat just exactly like a level 65 with 5500 HP's would be.<br />
<br />
Like many players, you seem to be pretty casual when it comes to time, effort, and raiding. But you don't seem all that casual about the rewards you think you should reap given your level of investment.<br />
****<br />
OR follow Fitemore's advice and be just as casual about your character development as you are about your playstyle. It's not a race or an overall contest with what others achieve unless you choose to make it so.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The mobs in OoW are possibly the easiest 65+ mobs you'll find anywhere.  Low attack, low max (800 versus 1000+ in GoD), not much resist, and most don't summon and will snare/root (even some named, though named summon).  Not to mentino a lot of really great attunable loot.</div></div><hr />

Oh nos, some people who have more free time can get to level 70 sooner than I can!<br />

Clearly this means that all people who have over X unbuffed and are flagged for X possess a silver platter and can go fuck themselves.<br />
<br />
Hate to break it to you, Kailyn, but you seem to be suffering from a &quot;Grass is greener&quot; syndrome.   <br />
<br />
Why don't you think outside the box a little?  I went to class and work yesterday and today and still had some time to explore with some friends.  There's adventures you can get off that 1st zone that are decent xp.  The difficulty lies roughly in between a normal LDON and a hard LDON. <br />
<br />
Didn't think of trying to get a group together for that, did you, before automatically assuming that the ubers have it laid out on a silver platter because some are flagged for Fire?<br />
<br />
Poor you, having to xp in WoS.  You're clearly a victim of SoE's vindictive plans to keep the casual players down.<br />
<br />
N.B.: I've done over half of 66 in WoS, but I'd be more than happy to see SoE open up EPs so that ppl would shut the fuck up and go fight over that tiny ass silver platter tables camp.</div></div><hr />

No ammount of easy access gear, or free levels can give you a ingame social network to have that set of friends, nor can it effect how long you can play.<br />
<br />
I didnt shoot straight for 70, i grinded some in old world, i explored various zones in oow, and i just messed around. I'm barely 67 now, with people in my guild 70, but do I care? nto really I'm happy with the way I spent my time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>arlakisd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Honestly the XP Post 65 is were I expected it to be to give the Expansion any amount of life. As soon as I heard there wasn't a Required amount of AA I knew that levels would be on the order of 20+ AA per level.  Casuals Spoke they didn't want Required amounts of AA to level.  They got it. But there's no way that the levels were going to be as Fast as 60-65. <br />
Myself I'm still only 66. 55% in. sucks I don't grind as hard as some. And PoF Tables I knew were going to be where the first 70's would be. Quad kiters forever &lt;Grin&gt; <br />
<br />
Me I'll do Vxed Kod'taz OoW or Elemental. Amazingly my list is 50 50 Locked to unlocked zones. And of them I would do Vxed if I had the choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Levels have lost their meaning long time ago.<br />
Nowadays you pretty much MUST be at max level or you are out of the game.<br />
If you aren't at max level your chance for groups is noticeable lower. You are pretty much nonexistant for most people who follow the common path of &quot;grind &amp; loot&quot;.<br />
It was the case when PoP came out ... as soon as some people were lvl 65 you hardly had a chance for the &quot;best camps&quot; (which were in PoV those days ;-) ) if you weren't 65. <br />
<br />
And during the last year....how many of us have grouped regulary with players who weren't 65? or would willingy choose a lvl 64 over a lvl 65 if they had the choice?<br />
<br />
So seriously, the outlook to again grind for countless hours isn't really promising, but I can't change it.<br />
<br />
And as for the meaningless of the rate of exp needed to get to lvl 70: what may be a nonstop grind of 24+ hours for the best equipped people may be very well hundreds of hours for the casual gamer without uber equipment and without access to the sweet exp spots.<br />
<br />
And grinding 100 hours or more just to be &quot;part of the normal game&quot; again is no fun.<br />
<br />
In the early days of EQ (first 2-3 years I would say) it was different, you could find easily players at any level. Nowadays you are pretty much forced to get to the new max lvl asap if you want to be part of the system still...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Okay, other than Haass, there have been seven posters here who have, in various degrees, basically said, &quot;The fault, dear Kailyn, is not in the game, but in yourself.&quot; (Haass appears to believe that the fault is in Kailyn AND the game, lol).<br />
Here are the AC/hps of the people who are telling Kailyn/casuals this stuff:<br />
1899/7961<br />
2202/8902<br />
2006/8040<br />
2307/10652<br />
2003/8671<br />
2411/9139<br />
2410/10436<br />
<br />
<br />
That's a very impressive list of stats, when you think about it. It takes many many many days of playing the game to achieve those numbers, and almost all of those hours would probably be played in a manner that could not be described as casual. <br />
I've suspected for a while that this game has basically split into two or three games and that large groups within the player base have almost completely lost the ability to talk to each other. They think they are talking about the same game, but they are not.<br />
The power spread among groups of players is getting wider, but it certainly does not have to tighten up. In fact, it won't tighten up. People who have the resources to spend 21 hours straight in the middle of the week leveling from 65 to 70 are going to get farther away from, rather than closer to, people who, well, have jobs and what not. <br />
Better gear and higher levels are good, of course. But you aren't going to keep up with players in advanced raiding guilds. <br />
But you don't have to listen to them tell you you're lazy because you don't match some theoretically possible possible &quot;casual&quot; magelo, either. Nor do you have to listen to advice from them about how to gear up. Every second you spend successfully completing LDoNs, even hard LDoNs, puts you farther and farther behind them. Because they have more time for the game, more gear, bigger guilds, more plat and better places to go.<br />
I think that ultimately, to enjoy the game, you're going to have to stop approaching it the way they do. Which may not be that bad. After all, when they decribe the effort they made (which you are too lazy to make) to get their gear, they almost also refer to it as work -- often painful work -- rather than fun.<br />
Still, if you tell them to F-- themselves, lol, better put on a fireretardant suit before ya click the send key.<br />
Oh, and on the bright side, SOE spokesmen have more or less directly said that most players--not toons, but players--in the game have no lvl 65 toon. So, most players in the game would consider you Uber, Kailyn.</div></div><hr />

Hey, if you look hard enough, there is plenty of blame to go around most times :)<br />
<br />
Right now, if you're not in an uberguild, and participated in the MASSIVE (and I do mean fucking massive) Raider vs Non Raider discussions on this board and others, you know what you're getting into.  You know the game is going a direction that isn't going to please you, so why do you volunteer to be a part of it, and then complain about it?  You're supporting their design decisions in this game by telling them that you'll buy any piece of shit they produce.  If you want to change it, stop buying everything just because all of these people with 13000hp and 2500ac tell you that you need to.</div></div><hr />

Hey BB, last time you told me to get 7.5k you had to eat crow...and I can go show you...in the OoW thread in fact (or maybe the Guild Summit thread, I forget). 7.5 for a non-elemental warrior is darned hard--you correcte yourself and said get 5.5k. Well in the time since that thread I have indeed tacked on 700 HP (not including 66th HP) from 4.8 to 5.5, and about 150 AC . <br />
<br />
I have been busting my ass to improve my gear and be a better tanker. But to say--just because I can't raid and get into KT/Elements--that the played time required to GRIND the levels should not be 10x what you all require because you have some flags that I don't--in old world content.<br />
<br />
So--over in the zone forum-- I am told I can tank hards--yet you EQMila, turn around and tell me to get out of the hards--all the while the rest thing I should wave my hands and get the flags I need to get into KT. Gotta tell you something--tanks with 8k buffed don't get invited to work the trials. Everyone wants 10k tanks--there seem to be enough out there. <br />
<br />
From everything I have heard 8k tanks really don't have any business tanking KT anyway.</div></div><hr />

Word of advice; enjoy the game how YOU know how, not how people here tell you. When I started my Warrior it was after near 2 years of hardcore raiding at the bleeding edge of the high content game as an Enchanter. I swore I'd never go raiding again.<br />
<br />
5 months later I'm flagged for EP, wearing Vadds gear from Qvic. I'm wielding a weapon from Inktu`ta. I'm flagged for Txevu. I'm 35% from 68, which I took a day off from work to do, with over 140aa. I realized that I couldn't enjoy the game on the casual level, no matter how much I wanted to.<br />
<br />
If you want to have fun in this game, you have to make it what you want it to be. Every goal in this game has a required path to take. One of my better friends has 3 epic'd Cleric twinks and his main is a Cleric o_O he just has fun questing. But the thing is, he doesn't look at other ways to play and envy the outcomes of them. He just has fun doing what he does best.</div></div><hr />

Can you tank hards ? Yes<br />
Will you enjoy it ? No<br />
Will your cleric like it ? No<br />

Will you be a manasponge ? Yes<br />
<br />
I have to admit, it is rare to see warriors with 5x10 shows understanding of the game.<br />
Dual A3 + Dual Stun is considered the &quot;basics&quot;.<br />
<br />
Non raiders have entered KT. There was even a warrior without EP gear that killed DD.<br />
And DD was really really really mean back then.<br />
<br />
I am sure that if you do LDoN normals, you will say they go quite smootly.<br />
Why ? Because you are way beyond the &quot;minimal requirement&quot; for Normals.<br />
<br />
Make TWO 40hp Augmented Takish Bracers.<br />
Start the Loyalist Shield of Honor Quest<br />
Get a 2nd Valorium Ring.<br />
Find the PoN  Ac30 HP60 Pauldrons<br />
Get Some Helanic Tundra Boots/Legs/Pauldrons<br />
<br />
(I'm sure i forgot some gear that can be not too hardly obtained)<br />
<br />
Its gonna be HARD. Its gonna suck. Its gonna be a nightmare.<br />
Just like getting 30k was winning 1kpp Blue Diamonds was back then.<br />
When i wanted a Lamentation.<br />
<br />
Do you remember how agro was without DualStun DualA3 ?<br />
Well its the same thing here.<br />
<br />
There is a cap that has to be reached.<br />
And the day you are over it your life changes.<br />
<br />
Worked for your agro (thats 2 slots out of 20)<br />
Why did you think it would be as easy for armor (18 slots out of 20)<br />

Time / Hard work / Patience.<br />

Quit yer bitching. I have over 40 days /played on this guy and im not even 60, you think I give a crap that some crazy bastards ground out 5 levels with 24 straight hours of game time? Good for them, I hope their migranes go away soon from eyestrain.  It has nothing to do with being uber, if they didnt have access to Fire, they would have gone to some other nice exp spot and did the exp grind for an extra few hours instead. You are right, it most likely WILL take you hundreds of hours or whatever number you came up with. Why? Not because they are uber, but because you dont want the levels badly enough to grind for them like those people did. You will be spending time lfg, getting into crappy groups, dying every now and then, and generally just not moving as smoothly as the people who have a prearranged permanent group.</div></div><hr />

The most fun I've had in the last week was on early Sunday morning helping an actual brand new player retrieve a series of corpses scattered across Antonica and Luclin. I was on my re-rolled completely untwinked lvl 28 Troll SK. He's in PoK banking his l33t fine steel drops off some Feerott lizards he'd had a series of misunderstandings with, when he sees a shout for a SoW for a CR. It's quickly lost in the Stupidspam (TM) of PoK. A bit later it reappears. My troll does a /who. Player wanting a SoW for CR is a level 11 human SK. I finish my banking, and send a tell to the newbie asking if she'd got a SoW yet. She said yes. I ask where she'd died. Tox Forest. Asked if she wanted me to go with her, as I had coffins (those 1  plat coffins with the lvl 26 or whatever spell SKs get) and could summon her corpse if need be. She said she'd be okay.<br />
So the troll does some tradeskill stuff (hmmm. Lizard on a stick. Tasty. contemplate renaming my troll Homer, but decide not to.) Pretty soon I do a /who on the newbie sk. She's back in PoK. Send her a tell, asking how it's going. Not good. Now she has a corpse in Highpass. <br />
At this point, I begin to suspect that she hasn't played long. <br />
<br />
I said, okay, I'll switch to my shaman and buff you up. So I did. Then I switched back to the troll and told her I'd go with her. I could have done this with bigger characters, but pfffft where's the fun in that? I also gave her a Sporali Defender's blade, (&quot;Arm yourself, knight.&quot;) which the troll had happened to acquire after getting into a misunderstanding with some rude piece of Runnyeye mold that made the error of underestimating harmtouch.  Troll donates for a SoW and off we go. First to Luclin where my newbie friend had previously discovered that not everyone likes SKs. Summon corpse. This is the newbie's corpse that actually has her plat and gear, and which she'd apparently given up for lost. I ask her if the Sporali was better than what she was using, and she said yes, much, so I let her keep it. <br />
Then we went off to Freeport, ran to Tox forest, recovered another corpse, then went to highpass, where I realized with a start that I could, without trying too hard, get killed in this zone. Summoned that corpse.<br />
Then back home through Tox Forest, where I got into a minor missunderstanding with a couple more mobs, heh.<br />
Newbie polite throughout, and never asked for anything. Wants to pay me back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Get over it! I'm in an ele guild and still haven't hit 66. Why? Because I screwed around working AAs instead of regular exp until Omens came out. Who's fault is it that I'm still 65? MINE! I only played about 1 hour on release day because I had other things to do, played a few hours last night and will get 66 fast tonight, but I've heard how much a pain 66 is going to be, then 67, etc. I'm looking to go to Proving Grounds tonight with a guild group, pretty much have my group set up, and hope to get close to 67. I have friends in end game(GoD not PoP) guilds that are 69 and 70 from grinding in Qvic and other places I can't get to. GOOD FOR THEM!<br />
<br />
I'm not at a point where I can go kick out endgame GoD exp, I'm not in a position to grind for 48 straight hours durring the week. To those that can and are lvl 70 now, gratz! I hope to be there in a week or two. I'm in almost all(visable) ele gear and I know warriors in almmost no ele gear with more AC/HP then me because of augs, AAs, etc. This warrior is a new toon, created in April '04. I'm damn proud to be 65 with 99AAs and almost 10KHP raid buffed in that time frame but I put in the time, I'm right around 40 days played in 4 months, that's ALOT of time per day there. I've earned everything I have, I'm at 97% of my guilds raids. I'd be classified as a hardcore player. I love seeing people above me race for those lvls because as I see the HP boost, etc they get it further motivates me to drive myself harder.<br />
<br />
If you want to have the end game gear, exp, etc. You have to put in the TIME. Why do casual players think their 2 hours a night should yield the same return as  6 hours? What would the point of the game be if anyone could accomplish the same things in the safe LDoN zones as you do in the high risk endgame zones? I gaurentee you that you can get to 10K, buffed, HP without ever stepping foot in the ele planes. I know warriors that are there. They did however spend a TON of time in LDoNs, GoD trials. They have HP augs on most slots, all their HP AAs, and know where to go to get solid gear with 1 group of people. Do the research, learn where to hunt, and develop your toon. If you want to take the easy way out then don't complain about how X guild has 100 lvl 70 people and you're still lvl 66.<br />
<br />
And for the record my magelo reads 1700AC/7K HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">How about closing the yawning gap between yourself and what casual players can accomplish first and then decry the uber/casual &quot;gap&quot;? A non-raid level 65 player can obtain 7500HPs. Your Magelo falls significantly short of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jesus sometimes you guys make me want to puke.  You have zero idea who Kailyn was before she retired eons ago (year 1 she was on the most respected warriors in the game and did so much work to help define warrior mechanics on the old stratics board..pre cursor to this board).  At least couch your BS darwinian talk with a little less edge...I lose respect for a great many of you with your damned noise and feather strutting.<br />
<br />
Hey I'm mr &quot;no elemental no VT but have tanked Fennin Ro&quot;  myself...and I looked *bad* last night in the proving grounds.  All I can say is that she does have a point...grinding is ALOT easier to 70 if you have elemental/kodtaz access or can hack places like the proving grounds.  There is a gap (fortunately I have elementals so I am in the &quot;have&quot; part of the crowd as far as old world content) there.<br />
<br />
However you all have a point in saying that OOW has some nice 66+ zones.  I'm going to try somemore tonight cause I learned a long time ago its better to follow the latest SoE carrot than resist (Haass I respect cause he never did in PoP and still thrived) and stay in old content (something I believe Kailyn is doing atm).<br />

I think you should move to Cuba.  Communism is what you want, right?<br />
<br />
Edit: if you want to stay in old content, then what's the point of leveling up to 70 anyway?  There's no rush -- its tuned for 65s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">LOL @ Dobbins...for many reasons.<br />
<br />
1) Its the bitch board. Its here to be bitched on. And I am bitching. Notice I did not foul our other cleaner forums with what is a rant.<br />
<br />
2) Oh poor baby is not 60th in 40 days played. The woe! I was friggin 75 days to 50th!<br />
<br />
3) Notice I did not give them a hard time that they did there 21 hours of grinding in one sitting...but that, least from the LDoN hard experiance I had before I made the post--I was looking at 150 hours played for one level. <br />
<br />
4) I have been doing pickup groups almost excusively for 5 years now. I know how they go--and I don't count the time LFG as played for level. The 3 hours spend were in adv. And I can put together solid groups--becuase I know a number of the other pickup groupers too. <br />
<br />
Brabble--your experiance is really cool and should probably be posted somewhere other than this stinky thread. Too bad the SK forums dont' seem to have a good place for it. <br />
<br />
As for hards--I can carry my own wieght--but I am not a strong enough tank to help carry other though yet. And people have gotten crazy about what they will bring a long. Bard, chanter and 62 ranger, wiz (65th I think) cleric and me? What is a 62 anything doing in a hard LDON?<br />
<br />
And the terms raiding/non-raiding and uber/casual are being confused again. I am pushing 190+ days played. I do invest the time. Do I expect it to pay off raider dividends in gear? Nope. Do I expect to see my time rewarded at something better than 1/10th the rate of raiders? Yup. <br />
<br />
And probably will as we crack open more of OoW--if SOE is really making elemental quality loot avalible for non-raiders.<br />
<br />
PS I was happy with the XP in Wall of Slaughter. No I couldn't grind 70th there in 21 hours. But I was seeing visible progress (which was sorely lacking from my experiance in hard LDoNs).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vx is not a place I can do easily for XP. There aren't pick up groups in OoW yet for non-ubers. So the ubers take 2 days to do what will take me probably until the new year, at this rate. <br />
<br />
The F'ing uber/casual gap HAS TO BE CLOSED!<br />
<br />
RIght now I am just pissed. <br />
<br />
maybe things will seem more reasonable when some time passes but when I hear about grinding 5 levels in one old world spot that most people can't get to, in one long camp *21 hours*  where as I put in the best effort I can and show a return of 6%--or a whopping 31.5% into 66 for a 21 hour stretch.<br />
<br />
On top of that I can die to a bunch of greens while looking for @#$^ pages in OoW for epic. <br />
<br />
I knwo 1.5 is supposed to be 1 time level group (or so they claim) to get and 2 way past that. I still want to work toword it. If I am still playing EQ.<br />

Quit your whining sissy boy.    If your game consists of eating the dung that drops from the cow's arse why complain when your breath smells of sheize and no wants you around.<br />

If i am lucky enough to grind them out faster then that cool. <br />
<br />
Why sit here and bitch about some one else grinding those 5 lvl's in a zone that you don't have acess to. I look at it this way if you spent more time playing and grinding out those lvl's and less time bitching about how you don't have acess to that zone you would be that much closer to being done.<br />
<br />
I do have acess to PoFire but i can't always get a group to go there or Earth and even if i could i still know that it would take me a long time to Ding those 5 lvl's. <br />
<br />
LDoN's have always been crap for exp any way BoT is better if you are grinding and don't have acess to the planes. There is also GoD zones that have great exp hit a trial there if you want that one group in zone type enviroment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Flair makes a good point, but none of this changes the fact that both GoD and PoP were geared towards ONLY the highest end people in the game.  If you're not at that bracket, bought OoW, and leveled...you have absolutely no one but yourself to blame for that fact.  <br />
<br />
You can't say you didn't know it was going to happen.  It happened in PoP...you leveled to 65, and if you didn't have the flags, you were fucked.  Same deal here, you leveled to 66, and if you can't do a hard, you're fuckin hosed pal.  <br />
<br />
Why ANYONE expects differently I will never understand.  I refuse to make this an uber vs casual thing.  You know which group you fall into. You should also know that if you're casual, you've been getting the business end of the cleaver for long enough to know better.

<br />
OOW is pretty much wide open to anyone though, casual or raider.  The zones you have access to are restricted by what you can handle not by what you have a key or a flag for.  If you can handle getting quadded for 3k, go straight to the endgame zone and have fun getting the shit kicked out of you.  If not, try something that fits your level/gear/AAs...<br />
<br />
This game is about timesinks.  Any avenue for advancement MUST require large amounts of time invested or people will &quot;finish&quot; the game in a week and quit.  That includes stuff designed for single groups.  All the flagging bullshit of PoP was a big mistake.  It appears that they realised that with OOW finally.

What a wonderful conundrum. <br />
<br />
Dedicated raiders have apparently satisfied the &quot;time sink&quot; requirement for levels 66- 70 before OoW was released as they have access to zones that will get them there in less than 48 hours of played time. <br />
<br />
I'd be interested in knowing how many people who consider themselves dedicated non-raiders can match that feat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is wrong and Unnaceptable.<br />
<br />
65+ Should be able to take normal (for reduced reward) or hard (for reduced rewards).<br />
The power difference required to do Normal vs Hard is huge.<br />
Mob DPS more than doubles, i would even say it triples.<br />
<br />
As for LDoN beeing shitty xp .. It always was like that.<br />
XP is better found in Valor / BoT / HoH / Ferubi etc etc.<br />
<br />
I can do a Hard LDoN in under 40 minutes (refresh timer). Going to 70 wont help me at all.<br />
So actually that barely affects me. And for that reason i shouldnt care.<br />
<br />
However its sheer madness to force 5500/1400 warriors to do hard LDoN because they dinged 66.<br />

Vexd is not hard to have access too, need to have done 1-4 trials or won a vexd run. That zone is instanced. If you can't handle vexd, you are prolly not ready to go beyond 65 anyway. And only one member of your group needs to have access.</div></div><hr />

What you are missing is that non-raider &quot;tank class&quot; typically can NOT tank in Vxed without huge amounts of down time or a enchanter/snarer/stunner which defeats having the warrior there any ways except for an exp sink.<br />

Compare a Vxed lvl 66 mob to a PoF lvl 68 mob.  I've never fought PoF, so tell me, what's the damage difference between these two?  Can PoF lvl 68 mobs be fully slowed?  Do they hit harder than Vxed mobs?  More or less hit points?  Do they summon?</div></div><hr />

yeah the part you forget is, we log in for 5 hours a night, get our asses reamed repeadetly for maybe 2-3 loots, 1 of which probably rots, and then go back to our families.  Most of your average UbER raiders get maybe 1 loot a month.  maybe.  qvic is about the one thing that would be an exception to that, and as it gets more and more crowded, even the qvic farming is an overestimate these days on fast loot.  we don't see a fuckin thing.</div></div><hr />

While I haven't seen any warrior gear drop in WoS yet, I am told the caster gear that we did get was elemental in quality. <br />
<br />
Then other thing that was wrong about my rant is how long it would take to get into zones like WoS. I recived a random tell for an invite there. I had forgotten the pleasure of open zones. I ran over and zoned in. Capable of tanking for my group. <br />
<br />
Do I think that many of the keyed raiders had 70th handed to them on a platter? Yup. Do I think I should be able to do it in 21 hours myself--if I had the gear to handle XP mobs like that--yup. Do I think--going from the evidence of 6% XP in 2 hard LDoNs--that non-raiders were screwed on leveling? Yup.<br />
<br />
I also thing that OoW's open zones will solve those problems--if they aren't over crowded. With every non-raiding 65-70 heading there for XP and fat loots, the mear 11 accessable zone have to be able to support rediculous population loads.<br />
<br />
I have one uber friend who religiously updates me on what loots she gets. I can expect at least 1 link a week to some new goody.  With 20 slots and one item a month your average item would be 10 months old or older. Even at 1/week it would still take almost 6 months to rotate out all your gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I xp'd in field 2 of PoF one day this week, and then the next day in vxed. Field 2 has (i think) level 66 and level 67 mobs, they are all yellow cons. Vxed is white and yellow cons too. <br />
<br />
My group in PoF was across the board stronger, but I got well beaten on. They quad for a max of perhaps 800? PoF hp is probably about the same as vxed, I can check my logs when I get home.<br />
<br />
Vxed was easy enough I was able to stay alive botting my friends cleric, most of the time only using SE to keep myself healed. I'd say the xp rate was about the same.<br />
<br />
Fact is, anybody that can straight up tank PoF tables (the level 68 mobs) and chain pull is pretty sturdy and will make an absolute mockery of vxed. The only real benefit to fire over vxed is that the mobs don't run as fast , don't proc chaos claws, and can be pulled from a nice open area instead of a mountain pass. You can run bots there too, which would be nice for a long grind.<br />

You don't need any flags to go to vxed. Baadan looking at your magelo you can tank vxed fine, but you'll probably need to make your own group. You've got better AC than I do for cripes sake, and I was fine tanking it boxing a healer.<br />
<br />
Make sure the healer realizes that dps is streaky so they may need to use elixir+light, and that the slower realizes they need to get on it FAST, and you'll be fine. I realize this is all easier said than done, but thats the real advantage to having a guild, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">A lot of groups just use a chanter pet to tank vxed.  I wound up in a pickup group last night in vxed and they went balistic when I actually started tanking instead of the pet so I just sat there and soaked up xp and brushed up on my snide remarks in the various chat channels I have on autojoin.  The only times I actually did anything was to AE taunt the pet when charm broke or occasionally tank an incoming mob if they were kiting the pet around trying to recharm it.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that the only thing in the group doing any DPS at all was the pet, I got 23% of level 66 in about 3 or 4 hours.  My DPS was zero.  So was the druid's.  Anyone can do these with a chanter.  If you're a warrior with not very good gear, build your own group that includes a chanter and a ranger or druid, preferably with a bard to pull.  The xp rolls in and there's no competition.  The rate of XP is VERY comparable to PoFire and KT and only requires 1 person in the group to be flagged up to Vxed.<br />
<br />
If you don't know people who are flagged for Vxed, get some friends together and go do the sewer trials.  They aren't very hard and they're pretty fun.</div></div><hr />

When I was a new player, I wanted Indicolite Armor and Lightsabers. I also knew what I would need to do to get them. Those players with such items put in effort and raided to get them.

I honestly can not see casual players measuring themselves against &quot;uber&quot; players, thinking they have fallen far behind, can't conceivably catch up and being bitter about it. Casuals are not on the Big Carrot Super Highway, they are taking the back roads, driving more slowly and enjoying the scenery. If you don't enjoy being a casual player, I'm not sure what to suggest. But drooling over the Magelos of others and doing a /who all 70 to see what zones they are raiding isn't on the way to Carrot Town - superhighway or taking the back roads.<br />

My indo BP ended being given to the Rivervale PoD in the hopes that he would wear it. For a while you could equip the PoDs and they woudl change their looks. It seemed like the appropriate thing to do...though I do regret not being able to turn in the BP for 66th.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully this won't come across too harsh...  How can someone expect to get fast XP if they're unwilling/unable to kill the higher level mobs that provide fast XP?<br />
<br />
Accessibility is not an issue.  There are endless supplies of level 67-68 mobs in Drunder, Valor and HOHB who are equivalent XP to PoFire tables or Vxed.  Heck, Sleeper's Tomb trash is mostly level 67, and it has a good zone XP modifier too, since the revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Observation: everybody is *spoiled* by AA &quot;levels&quot;, which as I recall are like level 51 in terms of exp/ding.  Grinding thru 66-70 is NOT TRIVIAL.  Having the right tools to make it go faster/smoother is obviously quite nice, but remember- that amount of exp is equivalent to grinding out right around *56* AAs.  (1255 mobs @ ~4.5%AA xp/mob).<br />
<br />
So anyway, keep it in perspective, and remember that each level is gonna make things easier to get the next one.  Having leveled a number of toons through the old, REAL &quot;hell&quot; levels, I think I'm qualified to say that getting a few percent of a &quot;real&quot; level per night is NOT bad progress.  Sure, some folks can do it faster, but they've also (pretty safe assumption here) spent a lot more time/effort than you have to be able to.  <br />
<br />
If you can only enjoy it if you can &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot;, then be prepared to do what's necessary to do that.  I mean really, think about it- if there was a way for a &quot;casual player&quot; to level as fast as a hardcore PLer did, don't you think the hardcore PLer would use it too?  And if you'd prefer that the growth potential of characters was severely limited instead (to what casual players could achieve easily), then who exactly decides what &quot;casual&quot; is?  And why would anyone bother playing after achieving that (presumably relatively easy) level?  Neither option makes any sense, as many have already pointed out.<br />

<br />
As for the subject of the post...Meh.  I know a lot of the &quot;uber&quot; warrior population tried to sell casuals on the concept that GoD was the greatest thing to happen to casuals - when in reality we all knew that was bullshit.  Sure, some parts of GoD are doable by casuals; and sometimes, when the moon is aligned just right, something will drop that is equipable by warriors.  But, again, everyone also understood that GoD was really about raiding and being a high HP/high AC tank.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion, as a relative-casual player, the new expansion is actually one of the best ever for casuals and hard core nonraiders.  The zones are open and available - which was my problem with PoP - and they offer gear upgrades for almost all classes that will allow them to progress further into the content and also allow them to progress into past content.  I don't see much to bitch about, even if it will take me longer to get to 70.  Pfffft, why would I want my friends to be 70 anyway?  Their focuses will all be totally and completely fucked as they won't have access to VT (only 100% through 66?) or Time/God (only 100% through 67?) to acquire longer-lasting focuses anyway.  I expect we'll quickly break into the discussion of levels versus AA, and levels are almost always superior to AA, but it seems to me that you, Kailyn, and me both need a lot of AA before we are gtg on quick exp expeditures.<br />

I think the line is a bit blurred  about who is being told to fuck themselves.  Is it the uber player that spends 8+ hours a day and has the gear/AA's/ and level 70 to show for it?  I think just throwing &quot;uber&quot; out there is misleading, there are plenty of players in my guild, which I would consider &quot;uber&quot;, but don't spend every waking moment on-line, they just like to raid.  They spend their time online raiding 7 days a week, and if we get done raiding early, they log off.

Our first 70 was in PoEarth, but anyways, people its a journey. I cant believe casuals are bitching that hardcore players (raiders non-raiders is irrelevant) go to 70 in a day.

And for the record I have spent time in PoWater, PoEarth, PoFire, SolRo Tower, PoV, HoH, BoT, and Barindu/Ferubi since OoW came out. Lots of fun (especially Sol Ro havent been back there in long time) just figuring out where is the best spot for me. Only 35% into 66 but enjoying myself.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Ok ignoring all the casual/hard core/silver spoon/whiner etc nonsense in this thread.  I think there are a couple of principles coming into play here:<br />
<br />
Opportunity vs  Efficiency between players at casual/raid levels.<br />
<br />
A super equipped raider should have better efficiency and capability to kill a mob all other things being equal. So if say Kailyn and say Holywrath (sorry man that big BOW picture just popped into my head) were to both fight in the same spot against the same mobs ol' Holy is going to hit level 70 faster...odds are alot faster.  Why?  Becuase he has earned that increased efficiency (better ac/hps/buddies to group with etc all).  I think most folks will agree that this is a just and fine situation (despite side conversations about how they got that gear which are NOT helpful in this particular thread).  Folks that earn better gear well deserve greater effiency in killing the same mobs.<br />
<br />
Now I think the bone of contention is opportunity.  Certain areas of the &quot;old&quot; game (pre OOW) have much better time/exp opportunities.  These can be said to be &quot;perks&quot; of being a hard core raider (despite side topics about &quot;you too can be VXED in 1 week!&quot;).   So in this case there is complete apples and oranges in the opportunity of WHAT each person can kill.  I found this really out when In got flagged POE and could grind so many more AAS for very little real additional effort over hard LDoN.  I'm not sure that this opportunity gap was ever a good thing.  With OOW though this gap is hitting people right in the gut though; speed to level.<br />
<br />
Its the combination of these two things that lead to this big big gap between the &quot;haves and have nots&quot; with the new release. However, all these arguments are based off the OLD world.  Last night in the wall of slaughter zone I found a couple of spots, while difficult, were not that much harder than hard ldon, and the exp flowed in 66 rather nicely.  BUT in order to do not experience this multiplied gap YOU MUST LEAVE THE OLD WORLD AND SELL YOUR SOUL TO OOW.  So man I can see the point of folks just saying shut and play thev game...the only problem is you have too play SoEs game (so little lemming to NEW content).  <br />
<br />
Like I said this doesnt bug me cause I gave up a long time ago thinking with new releases I had any choice in the matter...it doesnt mean though that folsk dont have a right to be annoyed about it.<br />
<br />
/shrug I dont make the rules I just look for the opportunities.  If you are a pissed off casual all i can say is start hitting Nobles Causeway or Wall of Slaughter...otherwise you are just going to get incredibly frustrtated.  Its not fair but &quot;you are in their world now&quot;<br />
<br />
Side note: its a travesty if they have really broken LDoN this badly..it was one of the best things they have added to EQ in 5+ years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">My advice is to find a new game to play. One that is fun. Leave the frustration behind.

Oh, the truth shall set ye free! or something like that.<br />

After playing some other games out there, it becomes blatantly obvious that the crap we put up with isn't justifiable. Why play a game for fun if it isn't fun? For a variety of reasons. But if they stop being decent reasons, stop playing.<br />

This will be the second major online game I've left (the first having been a MUD, some years ago, when I switched to EQ in '99), and though it's not easy, it is very rewarding to have moved on to something better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I agree with what Brabble posted a few pages back:<br />
<br />
&quot; I've suspected for a while that this game has basically split into two or three games and that large groups within the player base have almost completely lost the ability to talk to each other. They think they are talking about the same game, but they are not.  The power spread among groups of players is getting wider, but it certainly does not have to tighten up. In fact, it won't tighten up.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are clearly different circles of players, and always will be, and I agree that the gaps will get wider as the end game gets higher and higher.  I do not view this as a problem, or something to be fixed.  While yes, I would love to get my hands on some of the uber drops I see linked in the game, I do not feel the game is unfair, because if I spent as much time and effort as the high end warriors, I am confident that I too would be one.  No matter what guild I was in (I am fortunate in that my server has a fair number of open raids).  If the game was set up where for some reason I could never acheive what the other players have, even if I put the time in, then it would be unfair.  Some say this is the case, I am not convinced of it.<br />

I use to play the game of golf, and I sucked at it.  However, I enjoyed it and put a lot of time into it.  I did not get upset that there were pro golfers in the world that could out play me.   I never meet a pro golfer, and certenly none were at the courses I played.  It did not matter to me.   EQ is the same way.  In the places I typically go, LDoNs, BoT... I see warriors at my level, a little above and  below.    I do not bump into the  12k hp, 2200 AC warriors (except occasionaly on an open raid one shows up).  They are not part of my EQ world.  I have no ill feelings towards them.<br />
<br />
Vent your anger at the  @#%^&amp;! players who out right cheat (myEQ) or style of play ticks you off (trainers, named stealers....)  Named stealers are  the ones the tick me off.  You do a camp for several hours, a named spawns near you, and a couple higher end players swoop down out of no where and take it before you do  (different thread, I know)..<br />

Agreed my anger is reserved for SOE because there is little new content being developed (on a relative basis to high end raiders) that many casuals will ever see. If it was more about design than hp/aggro then maybe some casuals could do more of it but when you get 1-2 rounded that kind of limits things. So far OoW looks a little better than GoD in that regard, once the trains stop.<br />

It's all about finding the decent EXP spots for your gear/group's gear.<br />
If you bring a slower it's  extremly easy. It'll be tougher without one though.<br />
<br />
Mobs in Nobles Causeway and Bloodfields would probably be good too (but I havn't exp'd there personally).<br />
<br />
Just need to find a group of people that have similar playtimes to you (if you are guildless) and make friends with them. This is a social game btw! Getting a group is half the battle.</div></div><hr />

if you go straight north from the PoD right in Draniks, there is a Grand Historian?... I can't recall the name off  the top of my head. But he's a dragorn and he's a red con. He's near 3 caves. Talk to him, with your group ready and he will give one of 3 instances.<br />
Oh, I forgot to answer your question. It's just like a ldon instance. Not sure if there is a min number of players or not, but a full group would be best here just for the added DPS.<br />
<br />
Exp was 1% for 2 kills at 65, and 1% for 5 kills (I think, I was only 65) at 66. However, the mobs here are EASY. <br />
<br />
If you can, bring some DPS, mobs have a relatively good HP count. With a slower your healer will be set np. While the mob was slowed, a holy elixer was enough to keep me up most of the time.  It got a bit rougher unslowed (obviously).<br />
<br />
If you can't deal with adds reasonably well (as in someone can't root park etc), bring a chanter/ bard if possible.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Explore man, Explore!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Something  I forgot...<br />
<br />
Always be on the lookout for named. If you can get a solid group of people that you group with all the time it will be that much easier to progress.<br />
<br />
But the thing is, there is a ton of pretty fine loot dropping of easy as hell named. Named that are no harder then normal mobs. If you see a named, and it's yellow or something don't be afraid to try it. Or at least send in an expendable (laff) class to guage how hard they hit.<br />
<br />
There is a TON of 1 groupable stuff just waiting for people to kill it (from what I've seen), you just need to find it.<br />
<br />
And one last thing before I go to bed or something... Yellow EXP mobs are not that difficult. Make a couple of cracks at them before you say &quot;I can't do this&quot; or &quot;Fuck this shit, back to BoT&quot;. I think you'll be surprised in a lot of cases.. of course, if you have a slower!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Lakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">If gear is your problem there are a lot of solutions out there. I'm not sure if you listed how long you play each week, so here's what I did to get gear before I started joining raid guilds.<br />
<br />
Some friends and I started a raid channel. We started with BoT towers, and eventually started farming harder and harder content as our gear level increased. We would invite certain people here and there to raid with us to see if they'd fit in. We grew to about 25 - 30 members, and we were able to do quite a bit. Best times of EQ for me was with that channel. We raided maybe 4 - 5 times a week, and would start at anytime we had enough people on with enough interest. Gear didn't matter to anyone since we'd get enough of it to go around anyways. I think I was roughly 5.5k unbuffed when the channel began, by the end of it, maybe 5 - 6 months after, I was around 7k with a lot more AC.<br />
<br />
This was around early - mid PoP. 90% of us began as pre-EPs, and almost all of us are in Time+ guilds now. <br />
<br />
I met some of the greatest people and players I'll likely ever meet in the game from that channel, and still keep in contact with them even after I x-ferred.<br />
<br />
Some targets:<br />
-BoT towers<br />
-NToV<br />
-Kael (had 5 BoCs drop within 2 kills once)<br />
-Ssra (XtC, Arch Lich, Rhags, Cursed)<br />
-Seru<br />
-Some PoP events<br />
<br />
There's a lot. Doing a couple LDoN everyday would also help out a lot when you aug all your slots with 40hp/10ac (no point in saving points since you can switch augs around if you upgrade).<br />
<br />
Anyways, that's my advice. Send me a tell if you need more help.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">The thing I find ironic is that everyone assumes my gear and what not has not been getting better. Been back about 3 months from my last break--I was  4.8khp, 1250 AC tank. 3 months later I am a 5.6k, 1455 AC tank.<br />
<br />
Assuming I have not found beter in OoW the next targeted upgrade is the sands BP. 54 AC BP is getting kinda weak now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Iyacc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Actually I think the open structure of OoW will help open up GoD to the non-raiders. While I haven't seen any warrior gear drop in WoS yet, I am told the caster gear that we did get was elemental in quality. <br />
<br />
Then other thing that was wrong about my rant is how long it would take to get into zones like WoS. I recived a random tell for an invite there. I had forgotten the pleasure of open zones. I ran over and zoned in. Capable of tanking for my group. <br />
<br />
Do I think that many of the keyed raiders had 70th handed to them on a platter? Yup. Do I think I should be able to do it in 21 hours myself--if I had the gear to handle XP mobs like that--yup. Do I think--going from the evidence of 6% XP in 2 hard LDoNs--that non-raiders were screwed on leveling? Yup.<br />
<br />
I also thing that OoW's open zones will solve those problems--if they aren't over crowded. With every non-raiding 65-70 heading there for XP and fat loots, the mear 11 accessable zone have to be able to support rediculous population loads.<br />
<br />
I have one uber friend who religiously updates me on what loots she gets. I can expect at least 1 link a week to some new goody.  With 20 slots and one item a month your average item would be 10 months old or older. Even at 1/week it would still take almost 6 months to rotate out all your gear.<br />
<br />
The raider that did LdoN would get the same 6% you got. Raiders have no advantage there.<br />
<br />
The advantage is all the raid time spent unlocking other zones, whether you feel it's right or wrong.<br />
<br />
As you just pointed out, you can tank in a new zone that requires no key and casuals and raiders both have the same access. <br />
<br />
The problem wasn't the fact you can't get better xp than LDoN possibly, it's that you hadn't found it or been exposed to it yet or looked for it. There's been a ton of threads debating if those other zones should be locked, that's no longer the point. The point now is take advantage of what you DO have access to. IF it's too hard, move to a different zone until you find one that isn't. <br />
<br />
<br />
As an fyi for people without EP flags and who can't tank in Vxed or whatever - go kill yellow and red cons in Tactics. On my server Fire and other leet xp spots are crowded as hell, so when I have 30 to 60 minutes I kill there. I get a % of xp every 4 mobs or so. Not burning it up, but it moves and although they might be difficult for non EP geared people, if you have made up for missing gear with AA then you at least have a shot at better xp in a more accessible spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">A couple of things have happened in EQ that are to my mind sloppy design.<br />
<br />
/ooc Level 65 Warrior /lfg<br />
<br />
Seriously, what in the world does that mean, the grind-o-meter has been moved often enough so it says level 65? For an all too brief period I will /ooc 70 Warrior /lfg, but within a couple of weeks many others will flip that number on their character too because the new &quot;gold standard&quot; says you've got to /ooc Level 70 Warrior /lfg.<br />
<br />
I suppose I could say /ooc Level 70 Warrior - 500AA+ /lfg, but that's just another grind-o-meter. You can sit at the zoneline and have a Necro (or formerly a Bard) get you kills without ever raising your weapon.<br />
<br />
For good or worse equipment matters. You can not buy a naked level 70 toon, walk into the bazaar, and walk out ready to do the most challanging content in the game. With no drop equipment, you've got to get yourself flagged to go into the zones where the good stuff drops at a minimum. It's not only the equipment itself, it's the accomplishment it signifies.<br />
<br />
It would be too gauche to /ooc Level 70 Warrior, 500AA+, PoTime/QVic+ /lfg. But, that's what you are selling when you /lfg - you've got your visable equipment, it says 70 Vanquisher should someone do a /who, your guild tag, and the experiance others have had when grouping with you..<br />
<br />
I certainly think casual players should have plenty to do (OoW adds to that IMO) and should have a progression path. But I do want a refuge from them, a raid/Senior curcuit where players WANT the mobs to quad for 1200+, and /ooc is not filled with beggars, gigglesnorters, and 'How do I inspect my gear?'<br />
<br />
If I had my way there would be an instanced single combat in your current gear vs. a hard hitting mob to be allowed to ding level 60, 65, and 70. Gear up to handle things that are a challange for &quot;elite&quot; Warriors and your /ooc Level 65 Warrior /lfg all on it's own would mean something. As it stands now, it doesn't mean anything and hasn't for a very very long time.<br />

<br />
By and large, most people will take the path of least resistance. Fire was known to many of them, didn't require as specific a group with certain classes as Vxed and didn't require them to spend time exploring, find others to explore, and find that good xp spot in OoW. <br />

for many/most people a known good xp spot will win out over an unknown spot, at least for short term immediate gains<br />

Form of defense 1 of the cloak is the same clickie as it is off the RZ ring in time. <br />
All the gear that drops in WoS is elemental quality so in fact their is no more uber and sub uber. You just have to be willing to fight in WoS to gear up which is insanely easy. <br />
Just...have someone other then you pull.. like a ranger or a bard.<br />
<br />
But till you try and gear up in WoS dont even talk about not being given any oppertunites. Three weeks in WoS and you can be over 6.5k unbuffed. Yes give OoW 3 weeks. of grinding in WoS and your almost assured 1k in gear alone in pure upgrades.<br />

First, I assume all people are stupid, unless they overwhelmingly prove otherwise.  That way when I meet someone who's not an idiot, I'm presently surprised.<br />
<br />
You walked into a store, and picked up the Everquest Gold package.  Most people probably know what I'm talking about, but, you probably don't.<br />
<br />
You have no idea what Everquest was ever like, and when you find out, you whine and cry and moan.  You're probably one of those people who would have quit the game upon reaching level 54 or 59, because it was &quot;too hard&quot;.  Now that you actually have to work to accomplish something... wtf =(  I remember in Sebilis, you judged experience gains by blues to hours, like, i got 3/4 blue for that hour I just spent experiencing.  Without power'ing it, you'd only get 3 blue a day max.<br />
<br />
You spent your time leveling in CAKE zones, and then started AA'exping, and now you have no idea what experienceing is all about.  It's about sitting in one spot and GRINDING THE FUCK OUT OF IT.  If you were 66, or 69, you're going to grind the same.  AA exp and normal exp isn't the same thing, stop wishing it wasn't.<br />

And stop being a whiney little bitch.</div></div><hr />

Must be nice to be pleasantly surprised nearly all the time. Most ppl are intelligent, genuinely stupid ppl are rare.<br />

In my country (England) the attitude still exists that learning another language is an elite activity which only the particularly gifted (intelligent) can accomplish. I actually read the following in a text book... &quot;and then those with a gift for languages will move on while the other fall to the wayside&quot;.  <br />
<br />
But in other european countries just about everyone learns another language, or more than one, to the point where they have some kind of fluency.<br />

<br />
This is really the problem for a lot of warriors who are out /lfg. Other classs are frequently looking for a tank with significantly more AA's, and much better gear than the other members of the group have.  To the point where you can often not get groups in the content that you are able to be fighting in, because people are looking for a tank that can carry the rest of an undergeared group through a trial/LDoN/exp camp/named hunt/etc...Anyway, this makes the problem of exp'ing and progressing that much more frustrating to people with &quot;average or casual&quot; gear.  I dont agree that there is no pregression path for &quot;casuals&quot;, but I can see where the frustration could come from.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I have found some pretty good spots in OoW for both exp and loot that are easy to get to and at least for now have lots of people in them to help with the LFG. WoS has been mentioned a lot, and its pretty good.  The trials off of Draniks Scar are also really sweet. These trials have respawn and a lot of named that can spawn more than once. You can just take a group right from PoD's and farm exp/loot/spell runes till you have your fill.  The higher level the person asking for the trial, the tougher the mobs are so you can kinda tailor it to what you think you can handle.<br />
<br />
Also, you can do normal setting LDoN as a 66+ player. You just need to have a lower level member of the party get the adventure.  I did one last night at level 66 with a level 59 in the group, got 51 points for the win. So this is not ruined by leveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now onto discussing Uber vs non-uber and what has EQ done to balance out this issue?  Not much I am afraid.  I have /played over 500 days and have seen what the game has evolved into since the beginning of the world.<br />
<br />
I have been a full-time/part-timer and one thing never changes.  The uber get more uberer/sell their accounts to someone else who wouldn't know how to differentiate their head from their arse and that in turn destroys the game in general for people on both sides.<br />
<br />
There are several paths to take as a warrior to gain enough HP/AC to tank in places you normally couldn't.  I knew a long time ago I couldn't/wouldn't try to keep up with the Jones's.  I had to keep raising my AC/HP as new expansions came out to get into groups.<br />
<br />
So I looked at all the options along the way:<br />
Tradeskills<br />
LDON<br />
Uber Guild<br />
AA's<br />
Levels<br />
Armor's<br />
Weapons<br />
<br />
I tried the uber guild path at first but ran into a problem not having enough time to do AA's.  So I left uber guild and over next 2 years go to 200 AA's and 250 plus trophy in 7 Tradeskills.  From those tradeskills I fully outfit myself (outside any guild) in regular ornate armor and the top weapons I could buy.<br />
<br />
LDON?  Didn't like them that much.  Joined another uber guild.  Now am in the elementals.  Am I going to try and race every warrior on my server to top AA status?  Nope not worth it.  Am I jealous about any warrior in GoD or Time gears?  Nawwe still not worth it.  Do I take offense at anyone flaming my posts anymore?  Nawwe not worth it:)  I am going to play the game at my pace.<br />
<br />
My opinion on OOW so far is such:<br />
Another expansion that was not fully tested.<br />
Unbalanced Task System.<br />
Unfinished Task System.<br />
Unfinished Epics.<br />
Bugged Epics.<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
Will uber vs non-uber ever balance out?  Nope what you put into the game is what you get back out of it.  Will the rewards balance out for full-time vs part-time players? Nope sure won't.<br />
<br />
The closest thing to balancing out full-timer vs part-timer people were the AA's as anyone could get those in a group.  What EQ forgot was that its a combination of AA's, levels, skills, armors, weapons etc not just one thing.<br />
<br />
Regarding some of what some other posters have said  about Kailyn.  Hmm..guys before some of you came out into the cold,brisk, world of EQ Kailyn had developed a lot of strategies, and statistics about defense, offense, weapons, armors etc. a long time before you showed up so lets show some respect there.  Kinda reminds me of my several years in Gemstone III (text-based RP game long before EQ came out) when we had to do the same thing over there just to put a value on an item.<br />
<br />
Lesson learned today is:  Enjoy the game and go at your own pace.  One of the main secrets to being a good warrior is learning how to adapt.  Don't matter if you are full/part-time warrior.  Is it going to be easy?  Nope but we will survive.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents,</div></div><hr />

40 hours a week is about 6 a day. A good portion of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds players play at LEAST that much.  Hell my guild just got into Ele's for the first time a few months ago, and we have a few Toons with around 400 days played.

Replace boots and greaves of the myrmidon with ornate. Option for boots is to camp MM hards until you can get Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites.<br />
Born Hornspiked Shoulderpads (or something, droppable off of Vhak'siz the shade)<br />
Kill the Discordling Warfiend for a Tainted Cloak of Treachery (this may be hard for you right now, he triples for upwards of 2450 and rampages), or buy one (they're attunable).<br />
I see you've already replaced 8th ring, woot.<br />
Get Muramite Plated War Vambraces (attunable, 110 hp, that might not be the exact name).<br />
Buy a Steel Ring of Earthen Resiliance OR camp hard MM ldon until you can get the 100 hp 8 ac ring.<br />
Buy two Bloodmetal Earrings. One other option is to camp Takish hards until you get an Earring of the Sand Tides.<br />

The ultimate, and final responsibility for such a gap rests with the game designers. As they were the ones that designed a game that even required such a large time committment. Events that take 40 to 70 people over 5 hours to do ... that's not good game design.<br />
<br />
The game designers should have kept standard &quot;entertainment&quot; in mind, and shot for 2 to 3 hours MAX for events in their game. Like a movie. <br />

Instead, they designed Vex Thal. And kept going from there!<br />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
40 hours a week is about 6 a day. A good portion of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds players play at LEAST that much.  Hell my guild just got into Ele's for the first time a few months ago, and we have a few Toons with around 400 days played. Like it or not the &quot;uber&quot; people had to work for what they got too.  We didn't have PoP to get us from 50 to 60 (and I say 60 because there was nho 65 back then) in 1 week.  We had to get our exp a little at a time in crappier exp zones then you have access to now.  You want for free, what alot of us, and I am by no means an &quot;uber&quot;, worked for months even years ago to get.  We had to do it, so do you.<br />
<br />
 I'll be charitable and not outright state that you're a complete flaming idiot. Wait, no I won't. If you SERIOUSLY think that Sony's business model involves a 'successful' player playing the same amount of time as a full-time job, your head is full of water. That's one. Second is the 'birth date' of my character. I was here before Velious, chuckles. That was the days before 65 and PoP, last I checked. Thirdly, I didn't say WHAT the hell I wanted. And you're obviously no kind of mind reader, either.<br />
<br />
 I can understand wanting to feel superior once somebody smacks you in the face with the realization that the time you've sunk into this game could have pulled you 50k+ a year, though. I mean, it'd be debasing to admit I had 400+ days /played and still had cultural gear on - that's an admission of the smallness of your E-Penis, man!</div></div><hr />

Some people have to work 40+ hours a week for a living ... others do not.  This is not fair.  This is, however, life, and life has never been fair.<br />
<br />
I've known several people on limited time play who are now in Time and beyond.  To do so, though, they had to give up a lot of the fun &quot;play&quot; time and simply log in to raid, log off , sleep, work, log in, raid, sleep, work .... get the picture?<br />
<br />
On the flip side, how many of these uber people are lonely in real life?  How many of them desperatly crave a relationship with another person of the opposite sex or just plain RL friends but had to give that up to be uber-eq-goober_0245?  On the same note, they could argue that it's not fair that they can't have a loving relationship and not put in the time to cultivate it and go out and find it.  Rarely you find someone who enjoys playing as much as you do ... and then you are truely blessed  ;)  .<br />
<br />
You choose what you want in life and go for it.  If you want to be an everquest god then go do it.  If you want to enjoy life in the real world then do it.  If you want both then you have to find some middle ground and be content.  This is what i've had to do.   I COULD be in the highend game if i wanted it badly enough.  I know i have the skill, i just am not willing to invest the time.  You can't have your cake and eat it too (unless you've got millions in the bank).<br />

<br />
While I imagine this may be true, as far as there being better xp to found in OoW that hasn't yet been found, I find your characterization of anyone who doesn't play like you as &quot;lazy&quot; to be rather offensive.<br />
<br />
I think the main objection Kayiln had was regarding the fact that the experience available from previous expansions quickly drops to a trickle once you hit 66.  Maybe that was to be expected, it certainly is reasonably consistant with SoE's previous expansions.  In fact I would go so far as to say that SoE probably intentionally makes the xp so much lower in old expansions for new levels in order to &quot;encourage&quot; (or you might read that as &quot;coerce&quot; depending on your point of view) people to adventure in the new expansion.<br />
<br />
And most non-raiders are at this point pretty damn skittish of &quot;adventuring&quot; in a new expansion after the hose job that was early GoD.  It sounds like OoW, at least so far, isn't a repetition of GoD, which is excellent.  But it's going to take people a while to get over their GoD trauma and be willing to run risks with the expectation that they may even survive.  Taking risks that are pretty much guaranteed &quot;suicide&quot; with no real viable chance of success isn't what most people consider &quot;fun&quot;.  Maybe some do, here and there, but not most people by far.  And early GoD was all about suicidal risks for non-raiders.<br />
<br />
So I'd suggest you ease up on your, &quot;everyone who isn't as gung ho as me, even if they're not geared as well or AAed as well, is a lazy SoB!&quot; attitude.</div></div><hr />

The only reason that Fire (C2/Tables) is where people are going is not because the exp/kill is better, but you can get more kills in an hour than other places, with a high ZEM/Level bonus.   <br />
<br />
I did about a level (midway through 66 to midway through 67) in Fire C2 and wanted to poke my eyes out with a rusted fork I was so bored.  Yesterday I did pretty much all of 68 in Ruined City, group got 7 nameds with really nice attuneable gear and a bunch of runes.   It's nowhere near as boring as fire is, and I've never really been into &quot;Max efficiency&quot;, rather just into doing cool stuff that makes me feel like I'm doing something semi-&quot;heroic&quot;.    Being an exp-factory at C2 doesn't do that for me, killing jellyfish doesn't do that for me.    Finding muramites oppressing the local populace and exterminating them kind of does do that for me, going to the &quot;core&quot; of the Muramites DOES do that for me.</div></div><hr />

There has been a new and great point brought up in this thread - tanks are expected to have better gear than the rest of the group and carry the rest of the slackers through because they are fighting mobs that are below them. If you take a Wizard/Ranger/Rogue/Monk/whatever in full Ornate + bazaar gear and a Warrior, you don't exactly have compatible groupmates, even though the gear is the same. For the Warrior to be worth of the other people, he has to be a step above them in gear. I think from now on I'm going to ask if the Cleric has 6k mana, and if not, I won't group with them. Fair is fair, right?</div></div><hr />

Sewers is pretty fun too, and named drop 2 loot + 1 rune.  Even if the rune is random, that's 2 per mob instead of 1.  Haven't got any of the super named that the expedition giver warns you about.

I never stated I had 400 days played.   I'm creaping up on nearly 200 days played, I play a few hours each day.  I wanted to get the gear and see the zones that the top end guilds are getting and seeing.  I joined a raiding guild doing Velious at the time, when the high enders were just getting to Time.   Now we are working on the gods of the Ele's.  You want the gear you want the zone access go get it YOURSELF.  You  want your cake and to eat it too?  Gotta make the cake yourself first.  No ones going to give it to you.   Lets face it the game is about progression, you need to do &quot;A&quot; before yoiu can do &quot;B&quot; all you &quot;casual&quot; people want to skip right to &quot;C&quot; and can't seem to get it throu all the thick skull that you can't.  Go back and do &quot;A&quot; get geared up in what you can, then move on.<br />

You say that my &quot;E-penis&quot; is small that must mean that your gear is close to mine?  Then there is still alot you can do...Me and some RL friends have  1 grouped Klandi/Zlandi for ST keys and we we've 1 grouped MoTG/Prog/The final abirator  we tried to 1 group the ancients but we didn't have the dps. If  we can do these things you certanly can, just because its Velious zone doesn't mean there is nothing there for you.

There are only so many leaders you can have in a uber guild.. and most people aren't leaders. They show up on time, hit the buttons when needed and loot. There is no great secret to being a raid monkey. <br />

I know, I have been there. If you are anything other than MT/ST you better have a book by your PC to kill time.<br />
<br />
Raider's EQ time is no more valuable than mine becaue they have 71 friends.  I have been in a hard core raiding guild. Its all ticket punching. There is the same mix of players that you find anywhere esle. I would suspect that the best tanks are actaully the ones who post here--raider or non as we show interest in the game beyond the game.<br />
<br />
Half of their ability to grind 70 in 21 hours has nothing to do with HP/AC. It has everything to do with access. Could I grind 70 in 21 hours in fire? Nope--I don't have the HP/AC to support the constant pulls that would be needed. I do, probably have enough stats to tank there and get better XP than I would other places, even with teh down time. <br />
<br />
Raiders raid for the loot. They don't raid so that later on down the road, in 2 years when the cap is 80, that they can level 75 to 80 faster. And I suspect that may raiders have less time than many of the non raiders here. <br />

<br />
<br />
As for leveling to 66-70, 1 hours after omens went live i settled into MPG with a group of old guildies, and we explored the zone. I did not leave the zone until I was 70 (50 hours later and firts legit 70 war on TP..go go ikkins exploiters getting to 70 in 12 hours). I made groups, I brought people to the camps, and I helped on thier CR's in WoS and died in the process many times myself, causing downtime.  In my camps I also upgraded countless people from the loots that named mobs in MPG dropped.  I did not want to packpeddle into EP's or even KT to grind. I wanted to utilize the current expantion. MPG imo pulled right is comparable and even better to anything outside of POF tables. Certain places in MPG you can have to yourself, no KS'n, no training, you are that far away from any other group. <br />

If they don't play as much as other people who put time into raiding, or grouping or gearing up thier toons and improving them. Then that person deserves the right to get whatever greater experience out of the game that they worked for. <br />
<br />
I read post 34...<br />
<br />
Grats on helping define our class &quot;year one&quot; of everquest....that was 5 years ago. <br />
<br />
You choose to have static playing time over the years, it's not SoE's responsibility to gear or improve YOUR character. <br />
<br />
<br />
So again, please refrain from trying to make people that have worked for thier RIGHT to faster xp, it is not thier fault....only your jealousy.</div></div><hr />

I directed you to post 34 not because I was concerned that you (or I, for that matter) don't know what year it is, but because it appeared to me that you were making K's character an issue. It's not your strongest argument; in fact,  you do identify and touch on other pontentially strong argements that are, if anything, made less strong by arguments against K's character.<br />
I think the same is true when casual players make similar arguments about the characters of raiders, and several examples of that are around here too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">you insult people who work hard for thier loots  <br />
<br />
Oh come ON now. Who in their right mind works HARD for anything in Everquest? It's a video game for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
 past the childish pity-potty  <br />
<br />
Pity Party is the phrase you're looking for there. Unless you're trying to make some sort of joke with this forum being the outhouse? I dunno.<br />
<br />
 How about dedication, the desire to better and improve the character's abilities, how about the satisfaction that drives people to want to beat encounters.  <br />
<br />
Dedication? That's stretching it. I think Kailyn's right that time and patience are far more seminal to being a good raiding warrior. Dedication is more of a byproduct of having both time and patience. You can be as dedicated as you want, but without the time you're not a going anywhere in EQ. And dedication ends up giving you the more important quality of patience.<br />
<br />
Desire to improve your character is null and void. Everyone has that. Even Kailyn, who's desire to improve her character is high enough to make her want to keep playing this game and grind through 5 more levels.<br />
<br />
And satisfaction doesn't drive people to do anything. Motivation does. Satisfaction is the reward. You get X, you are now satisfied because you got X. You didn't go after X because satisfaction was driving you. You didn't have X, and thus couldn't BE satisfied. You got X because you were motivated to strive toward X. The satisfaction that you got X was part of the reward.<br />
<br />
 There are countless things that make up a &quot;good raiding warrior&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Kailyn's 3. And your 3, even though I think some of yours overlap or are dubious, still only brings the total to 6. Seems pretty countable to me.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

If I have to live without your sympathy and pity, that is a burden I will just have to live with. It will be tough, I know, but some how I will muddle though.<br />
<br />
Moving on to your ad hominem (http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/attack.htm)  argument I will refute it with the same level of logic and argument that you did: <br />
<br />
AM NOT!<br />
<br />
As to paying an complaing, yes I think that is one of the best things I can do for EQ, it vision and the eperiances of warriors. Just because I agree to pay does not mean that I can't make suggestions as how to make the game better. If you really think that &quot;shut-up and take it&quot; is a good position--I disagree on such a deep level that continuing a conversation between us is pointless.<br />
<br />
And--knowing that you ground 70th in 50 hours (I hope not in one sitting) in a zone I can get to does not bother me. You are reaping the rewards of your better gear--as you should. My argument with SoE on this is when raiding leads to double rewards of better gear and abibltiy to enter places I can not. Not that I choose not to, but can not physically (virtually?) enter. But your 10k/2500 profile has almost no realation to my experiance ad 1/2 your HP and just over 1/2 your AC. <br />
<br />
I saw how WoS was in beta, and I could pretty much determine that it was going to be a heap of shit in a basket when it live, and I was right. <br />
<br />
Umm and the point of this? Its a good zone with fun fights and WAY too many people. Povar peaked over 140 in zone last night--slowing XP way down. So I am moving along--levels over gear and maybe it will get less crazy in time. <br />
<br />
How about dedication, the desire to better and improve the character's abilities, how about the satisfaction that drives people to want to beat encounters. There are countless things that make up a &quot;good raiding warrior&quot;.<br />
<br />
And the hard core non raider does not have these attributes? Or are you saying that for a long time I did not have a goal of tanking a hard LDoN? Or that I did not have the dedication to grind 50 LDoNs for the 80 AC I could get from those points? Or the deicationto grind another 46 LDoNs for 2x anger 3 agus? Those motivations are the same for raider or non-raider who play EQ alot. <br />
<br />
Raiders raid for the loot <br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
I have been in a hard core raiding guild <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you presenting your current charater to be the example of these statements?<br />
<br />
Since that character is the only main I have, yes. <br />
<br />
People play at the high end level for many reasons, Everquest is a visual<br />
gratifying playing enviorment, some enjoy that enviorment fast paced, at the edge. The mind-set of every &quot;raiders&quot; perception is most likely not loot, I'm sorry if you honestly have been there, then you would not of said this.<br />
<br />
Yes--they do do it for many reason--but the top 3 for most people will be loot, loot and loot. <br />
<br />
The visual stuff while nice--is not true. Most first kill, weekley kill updates for a LONG time (as I have not looked at guild boards lately to get a sence of kill boards) show the old model characters in them. Its not the view that gets people to kill mobs. <br />
<br />
As for pushing the edge--yeah that is a lot of fun. But most often happens in groups. I have been in a raid or 2 with bad adds and come out victorious on the otherside--but that happens far more often in groups. Getting a group onto tha edge succesfully is one of the things that makes EQ great. <br />
<br />
If you are going to call me a liar, at least come out and say so. I was in a hard core raiding guild.  What drove the guild on a day to day basis was loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">I have stayed out of this conversation, largely because as a raider, I see the raider veiwpoint, but as most of my friends in game are 'casual'(god I hate that term) players, I can see their point as well.  But one comment Kailyn made kinda struck a nerve:<br />
<br />
Yes--they do do it for many reason--but the top 3 for most people will be loot, loot and loot.  <br />
<br />
Loot is nice, loot is good, I love getting new loot.  Truth is tho, I could quit raiding today, never upgrade a slot again, and have good enough gear to do just about any non raid encounter I want to, expecially at level 70.  I am far far from high end tho, there are players with 2k more hp's, 1200 more AC than me out there.  At a certain point, loot only makes a significant difference in your ability to raid, not your ability outside that raid environment.<br />
<br />
I raid because raiding is fun.  Most people I know raid because raiding is fun.  Raiding is like grouping with 60 friends, all at once, instead of being limited to just 5.  Raiding is also more of a challenge frequently than most  single group exp experiences.  Just coordinating that many people, to all do the right thing, atthe right time, is a serious challenge.  Raiding also allows an extra avenue of progression that is not available to non raiders(and yes, I think that is a fault with the system, non raiders need another form of progression that is available to them).<br />
<br />
Loot is an issue, we all want better gear.  We all take pride in that new upgrade.  We enjoy getting loot, and we want to get more.  We also enjoy seeing our friends get loot, and their is always a real sense of happyness whenever we pass out some nice uprades, even if we got none ourselves.  Loot also helps to make our progression a little easier, and we enjoy progressing thru the game.<br />
<br />
Trying to lump raider desire as primarily loot is a flat out insult to us.  Some raiders have come here, and offered you insults.  Insult them back, blow up their arguments, make them look stupid, I will cheer you on.  I understand your frustration, and think that you have some very valid points.  But also understand that blanket comments like the one quoted above serve only to lower the level of the debate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy shit!  I'm going to assume you are either too blind or too stupid to have actually caught the contradiction in your very own post....and how it relates and supports directly the only real gripe that Kailyn made in this thread.  <br />
<br />
If, when you ask whether we have done &quot;everything possible&quot; to &quot;better&quot; our character, you mean have we joined a raiding guild that will get us into Fire so that we can gain exp twice as fast as anywhere else in the game....Then the answer would be no.  And that, my friend, is why this rant exists.  How about SoE, in its vast wisdom, create a new expansion with new levels that we all must grind to, and also populate this new expansion with new zones in which to level that actually *gasp* provide as good or better experience than the old zones from three expansions ago that are LOCKED to nonraiders.  <br />
<br />
That is the only gripe here, but many folks seem completely blind to it.  No one is suggesting that someone who puts in 50 hours of grinding ought not be higher level than someone who puts in 25 hours of grinding.  The problem comes in when someone who puts in 25 hours of grinding in FIRE takes home just as much experience as someone who grinds for 50 hours in KOD'TAZ.  Which is what you claimed in your post. /shrug<br />
<br />
I reiterate, in case someone is so stupid they don't undertand what I just said, Omens is a great expansion and I think Sony is maybe possibly on the right path finally.  But its a downright fucking shame that the experience flows freer in a zone three expansions old locked away behind &quot;raid&quot; keys.</div></div><hr />

Ok, but your sitting at 8.3k/1825/349 so that isn't saying too much.<br />

Then you hang with a different crowd than I do ... most people that I know that raid have trouble staying awake ... except for the MT, puller, and the RL of course.  Maybe we should run a poll and see what results we come up with?  Didn't SoE have this as a question a while back when you first logged onto the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Ok Red--maybe I did get unlucky and have a synical view and friends. If you are insulted, I do appologized. However after raiding 5 days of 5 on line I really don't care what I am hitting the only two things that seem to bring most along are peer pressure and loot. There are raids that are fun--more so if its one of your first times and you happen to win. But I don't think they stay fun for most after the 5th time and certainly begin to loose their appeal when you are raiding for the XXth consecutive night.<br />
<br />
I had an invite from a friend to join one of the raiding guilds on Povar--it went no further than looking at their probationary requirements. 18 raids in 21 days. I would need to skip classes (asusming I did not skip work) and break standing social engagements (IE change around RL for EQ) just to get it. <br />
<br />
To do that you need the most motivated players--and I think that that motivation is greed for most. Yes it can be fun to hand out gear--or even force you GM to take a loot--but rarely is that enough to get people to show. Just look at how hard it can be to get people out for epic fights. (Yey...epic fights v1.5 coming soon.)</div></div><hr />

I usually take my xp shifts in 8-9 hour brackets chain pulling with my buddy, and we build our groups for pure dps ie 3 rogs bard war cleric.<br />
<br />
Today i started at 5% into 69 ... by the time i logged off 6 hours later i had gained a whopping 50%.  That's an average of 9% an hour, and we were chain pulling a new mob into camp every 40seconds.<br />
<br />
by the time i ding 70 it will have taken me 55ish hours ... that's hardly 25 hours.<br />
<br />
You've fixated yourself on the PoFire anomalies who sat in fire for 24.5 straight hours chain pulling the entire 2nd castle and &quot;tables&quot; area.   Let me clue you in, since you obviously have none: These jokers were all in end-game GoD gear, and they all had 2 and 3 boxes outside said group boxing for bardsong, buffs, and mega dps.  It was effectively an 18 man effort to level 6 toons to 70 in record time.  I'm betting that the same people could have done this in the prayer grounds or a number of other GoD or OoW zones, its just that they knew PoFire and they knew it would be a safe, easy grind in a zone they were familiar with.<br />
<br />
Fire and Earth kick ass for xp, but they are not the golden child you portray them to be.  It is only marginally better than KT, and thats only because the mobs dont hit as hard and arent as group intensive.<br />
<br />
My guess is that if you got into your magical Fire group it would still take you 60-100 hours to hit 70, because quite frankly, anything faster is extremely hard to pull off.  <br />

Taken in context of the posts, the word &quot;opportunities&quot; took on slightly different meaning.  It's therefore a fallacy to present them in such a manner (presenting them to be equivalent).<br />
<br />
I'll spell it out for you once more:<br />
Everyone in this game has the same opportunities available to them &gt;&gt;&gt; if they take advantage of whats there.  IE nobody is holding you back from raiding or killing x mob to get into y zone.  Does this mean you should get into y zone without killing x mob like everyone else?  No.<br />
<br />
The same opportunities are present for everyone, but unless you do what's required  to actualize these opportunities then no you dont have the right to have them simply given to you.  This zone as a raid zone is the &quot;reward&quot; for a a long series of hard raid encounters that progressively test your ability to work together.  The loot on the mobs leading up to the zones sucked, so you might as well view the zones themselves as the reward.<br />

As for the &quot;equal opportunity&quot; BS, play the fiddle all you like.  We've been down that road.  I'd think you are bright enough to know by now that lots of people simply choose NOT to join a raiding guild.  Now, as a result, they cannot raise new levels made available in a new expansion as efficiently or quickly as they could if they went to three year old content locked behind raiding requirements.  It's a simple thing Kailyn noticed, really, and I don't think its much disputed.

Well, EQ's gonna learn pretty fast how horrible their design focus has been since Luclin. The competition's out there. Things are coming. The focus of these games will still be fun, just like EQ. But they're going to be fighting for market share. And part of the plan will be to attract more of the short attention span video gamers. (You can see this in City of Heroes ... with its easy, FPS-like combat system and it's Doom reminiscent Assault Rifle/Devices Blaster character option they are trying to appeal to more standard gamers who use video games as disposable entertainment).<br />
<br />
Content tuned and completely focused on Raiding ... and high amounts of time consuming raiding requiring more than 20 people is merely going to narrow the playerbase of EQ.<br />
<br />
In short, the only people who love this style of gameplay are the people who are currently involved in it.<br />
<br />
If there were another option for plane of time which didn't require 72 people to complete 4+ hour raids, for example, who here wouldn't take it?<br />
<br />
When there's competition that puts forth content that doesn't require this, and the competitive game is just as fun ...<br />
<br />
Well ... we'll see where the raiding/non-raiding gap gets EQ. We'll see.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">That would be because gear works correctly as a throttle to XP. <br />
<br />
IE the better your gear (since that group and yours has the same access)  the faster your XP.  And his gear is about as much better than yours as yours is than mine. Well--what is to keep me from grinding in PoF at say, 1/2 the rate you do--going by reletive gear stregths. <br />
<br />
Only the fact that I can not get there.<br />
<br />
The other things that limit people from raiding are (off the top of my head): jobs, school, family, systems that can't handle the lag and a lack of enjoyment from raiding.<br />
<br />
And its not a matter of twisting what you say, but your use of weak logic. I haven't quoted you out of context. <br />
<br />
The raider should be able to accumulate power faster than the non-raider. <br />
<br />
The non-raider should have largely the same experiance as the raider. <br />
<br />
The raider should be able to progress though the same content as the raider--though lagged by some period of time (and not a matter of weeks--a game the size of EQ lagging beind raiders by a year or more is quite acceptable).<br />
<br />
At this point the non-raider--speaking in the general and not of specific, exceptional cases--is stuck at a point in the game that is 2 years old. (PoP was released 10/02).<br />
<br />
Even the raiding guilds find the flagging system in PoP a PITA. <br />
<br />
Elementals--a deeply locked set of  zones in PoP--is the general break between the haves and the have nots.<br />
<br />
To crystalize my rant: the gear differances between raiders and non-raiders is more than enough to medate their experiacnes in EQ. To double reward and double penelize non-raiders with access issues  is exessive, bad, wrong and harmful to the game. <br />
<br />
The limit to a warriors ability to tank should be limited by her gear and AAs--not her ability of find 71 dates for 10+ proms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is, people would still be raiding NToV / WToV/ HoT if it weren't for LDoN. Mudflation  and LDoN caused it so that content could be skipped. VT is getting that way also.<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to say is this I guess; People who have already gone through this content got their flags. They did all the stuff and thus they gained the PRIVALAGE to exp in the higher areas. What have the non raiders done to gain the privalage to gain entrance to these zones?<br />
<br />
This is why there are TONS of open zones in OoW. You don't need to exp in fire. It's monotonous, and there is similar exp other places. The grind-to-70-in-21hrs crowd picked it because the mobs are high level. You can easily find comparable EXP elsewhere, and if you can't hang it in some of the similar areas, then you probably aren't going to be ready for PoF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">What have non-raider done to be perminantly banned from Elementals?<br />
<br />
You do raise the good argument that the entire point of this rant maybe moot in a couple of months as OoW depopulates PoP. <br />
<br />
I still don't think that addresses the issue of having all of one expantion (GoD) and most of second (PoP) locked because people can not/do not raid. <br />
<br />
(Assuming, of course, you agree that GoD was until OoW, efectively locked out to anyonoe not at the post Ornate level, if not elemental level.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Here is my basic problem with the entire concept:  OoW is supposedly a &quot;higher&quot; level and it is the expansion that actually gave us higher levels....so why is it that two-year-old content in PoP is considered the &quot;higher&quot; area?  I don't mind the fact that raiders are using this content to level.  I mind that Sony created three expansions since this time and yet Sony still feels players should get the most bang-for-their-buck from old locked content. <br />

As for &quot;privilege,&quot; assuming it exists raiders gained the privilege to hunt and raid in PoP during PoP.  That these zones are still the experience crutch for present content isn't a &quot;privilege&quot; its a fucking game design and development problem.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind the fact that raiders are using this content to level.

There is a TON of work to get elemental flagged. Don't belive me? Go look at the quest. I assume you know this, Vigis, because you have a peice of time gear. Why should all the work that I've done mean nothing? Why should all the work that every single elemental person mean nothing? Just so you can EXP different zones? There's a whole new expansion out there, and I'm sure the dev's didn't think that &quot;Well, unless you are elemental flagged, you can't get to level 70&quot;. Get out there and EXP. I've heard great things from respected people about The Ruined City of Dranik, yet I only see 8 people there. It can't be too difficult because they're in pre elemental guilds.<br />
<br />
The point is that you don't need elemental access to get to 70. You don't need these zones to AA at 70. The Dev's somehow saw this and prepared for it..</div></div><hr />

I would agree with you 100%, if it weren't for GoD, which, IMHO, as release dwas an expantion for the ELemental+ crowd only. And I just left WoS yesterday to head over there when I next log it. Homework--supposedly--tonight and class tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

This was ok when it was small parts of content (aka ST, VT) as a part of an overall release.  But when you had PoP and GoD seal off a ton of content it was just plain wrong to propogate both a gear and an access gap.<br />
<br />
I think though they got wise with OOW.  There is alot of challenge in new zones and pretty comparable exp compared to ellies.  So I guess this release in a way validates that SOE no longer sees zone access &quot;perks&quot; as being good for the game.</div></div><hr />

Binn, I&quot;m going to assume you are a bright guy but you still haven't understood a fucking word I've said.<br />
<br />
MY POINT is simply that when a new expansion is released that includes a &quot;feature&quot; of making level 70, Sony really ought to consider making the experience in those new zones (that theoretically Sony wants us to explore) actually equal or exceed the experience gained in zones locked behind raid encounters and created three expansions ago.<br />
<br />
Do you understand my fucking point?  It has absolutely ZERO TO DO WITH opening up PoP.  That was a discussion for a separate thread and I really don't feel like bringing it up again in this one.  You, apparently do, to which I simply recommend that you read the 46+ page thread because I'm sure you'll tire of the subject quickly.  But, shit, since you brought it up, I totally get that getting elemental is a PITA - I'm there on two characters.  That's doesn't make you somehow automatically entitled to get the best shit there is every.single.expansion.down.the.line.  What it means is that, at best, you are then entitled to reap the rewards of the elementals and Time which for goddamn sure ought to be worth it enough. <br />
<br />
I do not want VT or any other zone to become unlocked.  I want a Sony-fucking-developer to take his head out of his ass and realize that he ought to give superior experience to new zones so that this expansions doesn't create teh age-old dichotomy between the raiders and the non raiders.</div></div><hr />

This is different, VT and Emp chamber and all those are raid targets, anyone who goes there to XP is insane.  Elementals have raid targets in them but at the same time are excellent XP zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Elementals isn't that big of an achievement anymore for any group that can field a large enough force, there are quite a few guilds on Vazaelle that are far from uber and are still elemental flagged (I should know, I despise every time one of their members asks me to join an EP group).  The problem WAS that people like me could not possible field that large of a force due to real life factors that determine my play time.  This arguement is kind of irrelevant it seems though because while WoS XP might not be screaming fast it is more than tolerable enough at level 66 to advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same with Emp. They wanna see how brutally NON-casual friendly that encounter is ... by all means, go right ahead. <br />
<br />
The expansion is years and years old. The content is dated. Even the loot is starting to look gimpy here and there. Open it up, let casual people bang their head against it. The key quests were great at  doing their bottlenecking job when the content was cutting edge. It's not even close to being needed anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">Ok Red--maybe I did get unlucky and have a synical view and friends. If you are insulted, I do appologized. However after raiding 5 days of 5 on line I really don't care what I am hitting the only two things that seem to bring most along are peer pressure and loot. There are raids that are fun--more so if its one of your first times and you happen to win. But I don't think they stay fun for most after the 5th time and certainly begin to loose their appeal when you are raiding for the XXth consecutive night.<br />
<br />
To do that you need the most motivated players--and I think that that motivation is greed for most. Yes it can be fun to hand out gear--or even force you GM to take a loot--but rarely is that enough to get people to show. Just look at how hard it can be to get people out for epic fights. (Yey...epic fights v1.5 coming soon.)<br />
<br />
Deleted one paragraph from the what you posted, just for brevity, don't think I changed the meaning at all.  You are right, the 10th time you kill mob X, it gets a bit dull.  Reason you do it tho is not because of 'greed', but because it is part of the proccess to progress.  Raid guilds are about progression.  We want to do more, see more, go more places.  Look at the effect PoP had on guilds.  I rememeber it.  To get access to most zones, you had to be in a raid guild, and there was a mass exedus from family/casual type guilds to raid guilds.  I was in my low 50's at the time, in a family guild, and I remember it well.<br />
<br />
Loot is needed for a guild to progress, and for each of us to progress our characters.  I would be lying if I said getting loot was not a motivation for people...it is.  It is not the primary  motivating factor tho.  Progression is.<br />
<br />
  Let me give you a little history of the guild I am in, Endorean on the Luclin server.  Endo was first guild to get into Time on our server, first to kill Quarm.  Very shortly there after, things fell apart.  People felt like they had beat EQ, they had no place to progress to.  People started leaving in droves.  Note that most still had many many upgrades they could have gotten, but to what point?  There was no progression left.  Since then, Endo has been in a long rebuilding process, and we just this week finally got back to Time.  Thankfully, we did have a nicecore of people left from the Endo of it's glory days, people who have not gotten one single upgrade from a raid in many months.  These people could easily have left for one of the guilds that blew past Endo, and are now endgame GoD.  If loot was their primary motice, they would have.<br />
<br />
Point of that history is that people left not because they had no more loot to gain, but that there was no more progression to gain.  The ones who stayed, and struggled thru the hard times, where obviously not motivated by loot, as they could easily have gone on and gotten that in another guild, and actually gotten some loot upgrades.  Where does this fit into your portrait of loot as primary motive for raiders?<br />
<br />
You also mention the trouble people have getting people together for epics.  I find this amusing sorta, as just tonight, we got one of our monks his epic 1.5(gratz Laein).  He had very little trouble getting the people together to do it, despite the fact there was not much in it for anyone else.  Maybe Endorean is an exception, maybe we are different(I know I think the world ofthis guild, and the people in it), but I do not think we are that different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u168"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p168">I can see your point, but--going way back to your family guild days--do you remember how much talk/cajoling/begging there would be to help someone else with epics? <br />
<br />
And compairing server (or at least guild) first 1.5 with #20 Fayder kill or #43 monkey final fist battle is also a bit humorous. The only thing I really like about the last stage of the druid epic is that it can be trioed--and possibly duoed. Druid, warrior...maybe cleric. <br />
<br />
But the second you have to go out of guild to do some high repition of epic battle, just getting the people together becomes epic in its self.<br />
<br />
Ok...but what motivates the progress. <br />
<br />
I will however retract my loot, loot and loot. Progression goes in there somewhere, but there is a very fine line--internal line--we can't jusdge it from the outside--between the two. <br />
<br />
If the two aren't the same thing, then one feeds the other, which feeds the first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find this odd.  I have EXP'd in Fire, and I have EXp'd in OoW, and I find that OoW exp is not far off it at all from Fire.  Why did the people who made 70 in 21 hours choose Fire?  Level 68 mobs, in an area they knew well.  No lost time exploring, learning the pulls, figuring what you can and cannot kill.  To a certain extent I pity the pople who did it(tho have an understand of why), as that to me is the worst  way to exp up.  I have been exploring, learning the new expansion, dying learning that x mob is not  an exp mob but a raid mob, and having a blast.  I love OoW so far, and part of what I love about it is that I can EXP group with both my raid/guild friends, and my 'casual' friends, at the same time .<br />
<br />
So here is the deal.  You can complain all you want that Fire shoud be opened up to non raiders(I agree, it should), but truth also is, Fire is not the promised land, not some holy grail of EXP.  This expansion so far looks like, at least in some ways, really is going to close the gap between raiders and non raiders.  The only complaint I have about it is size, it really needs more zones, if only some new insticed zones.</div></div><hr />

If(and this is debatable) keeping EP's closed was ever a good idea, it certainly no longer holds true today.

<br />
PoF C2 really simply is too good, if you disagree its mostly cause you prob xp there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">From what I can tell, Fire is faster 66-68 because you Fire has only level 68 mobs, so you get a pretty significant yellow/white con bonus whereas OoW mobs range from 66-68.  There doesn't seem to be very much xp difference between a 68 and a 66 once you're level 70 though.  68 gives a bit more, of course, but has more HPs too.  I don't find mobs in OoW having an especially high # of HPs, and so far the most dangerous ability I've encountered in OoW is Chaos Claws.  Now some areas in ruined city at least you've to worry about gaters/runners but gaters are pretty rare (no GoD Mastruqs gating 3 feet from their bind) and runners are easy to deal with if your group is at least awake.  <br />
<br />
But you're really shortchanging yourself if you're xping in Fire instead of OoW if you're a casual.  For one, stuff hits less in OoW than Fire, and you can get a lot of good loot while you're leveling up.  You will get to 70 a bit slower but assuming you are actually able to find a real camp area (most areas in Ruined City, for example) you're looking at having quite a few gear upgrade and a head start on spells as well.<br />
<br />
Actually Ruined City Sewers is pretty good to xp too.  Named drop 2 loot plus one possible rune, and stuff is no harder than what's outside (66-68) but you don't have to deal with other people.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I think so too. In some sense the game design direction changed with LDON and even GoD. I have a feeling that the PoP flagging arguments will largely go away at some point, not because SOE will unflag places, and not because the entire issue wasn't painful to non-raiders, but because new expansions without flags will provide better loot easier gotten. <br />
<br />
/salute Red's posts.<br />
<br />
A lot of the issues casuals/nonraiders/raiders argue about here have to do with game design features that are a direct result of a substantial and specific pressure the design folks at SOE are under: a good many people who play this game are playing it at a rate of &gt;100 days per year. What sympathy I have for SOE designers largely comes out of contemplating what it must be like to develop content for a bunch of pretty smart people who are playing that content more hours per day than you get paid to design it. The people playing the game this way not only outnumber the people who are designing it, they work longer hours! <br />
That's why I agree with Solanthus: &quot;EQ is meant to reward those who spend ridiculous amounts of time and energy on it. It's been that way since day one and it will stay that way, because thats why it is successful.&quot;<br />
SOE doesn't have a choice about making the game a time sink because that's what it's customers want, it would seem.<br />
<br />
Personally, I try not to get too worried about it. A long time ago (as such things go in gaming chronology) I was playing at a rate of about 100 days/year, for a few months. Had to put in the time, because the boat to Kunark was a little slower than the PoK books are now. <br />
So, now I play 10 hours a week, because of rl (which, by the way, I find more interesting that EQ, although I'd also note that from my point of view it also has significant design flaws). I just can't worry about how much faster other people advance or the game would be no fun. I retired my first warrior after a break from the game because I knew if I returned to the game on a warrior that retired when Luclin was new then eventually some taunt-spamming dipshit who had been playing two months would tell me my gear sucked, and I wasn't up for that.<br />
<br />
Apol and other raiders insist that fun, not loot, is what they value most. It seems logical to me that the best players in the most functional rading guilds would feel this way. Sure, loot is good--obviously--but getting a job at Burger King and using your wages to buy plat online would get you ornate molds faster than playing for them. So, it ain't the loot, at least not for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Because you shouldn't have to play a game with 71 of your closest friends in order to accomplish something.  This SHOULD be self evident.  Obviously if you are in that demographic, and reaping the rewards of that demographic, you'll think otherwise, won't you, Mr. Hoss?<br />

Just because you don't value your job, or don't have one, or don't value your schooling, or don't attend, doesn't mean that you're more entitled to anything in a game than anyone else.  Requiring 10+ hours at a time for a video game, and then REWARDING THOSE FUCKING TARDS with the best gear in the game only leads to the phenomonen we see here...you idiots telling us that you work more in a game, when the fact of the matter is, you don't.

You equate 'casual' with lack of effort and desire, which could not be further from the truth.  I know many 'casual' players who play more hours than people in hard core raid guilds, who strive as hard or harder to progress...but choose not to go to a raid guild for whatever reason.  Some simply do not enjoy raiding, some have schedules that do not allow it.  Some do not like the loss of freedom that raiding allows(ie, if you want to hang out with friends, but cannot since raid is called).  <br />

I have some friends right now working on getting KT flag.  These are typical 'casual' players, wearing ornate and bazaar and LDoN gear.  AA's are in the 200 range.  They are struggling mightily, but are determined to make it, and they will.  They have more drive, more ambition, and most of all, more class than you ever will.  They just don't have quite the ego that you do.<br />
<br />
You do make one point:  no one is entitled to anything for free.  You should be required and expected to put in time and effort for a reward.  The problem is, for 'casual' players, they run into a real block as to what they can expect to get with their time and effort.  Raiders have a nice set of progression they can follow, they can continue to advance thru the game.  'Casuals' lack that.  That is a very legitimate complaint.</div></div><hr />

We've flagged 80% of our guild and just need to kill RZ one more time to finish it up.  It would be a megalithic slap in the face to negate the last 6 months of work and let every random 65 on the server run willy-nilly around our new raiding stompin grounds.<br />

Bah ... sorry to jump back in this mess, but everyone here is talking about the EP's as old trivial content that should be just opened up.  I just want to remind you guys that there are still hundreds (thousands?) of people on the brink of making it into EP with their guilds or newly EP flagged peoplein guilds.  These zones are still very viable progression paths ... this is not old content  like NToV that never gets tackled and is up 24/7.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the one hand, you're saying that it sucks that non-raiders can't get into elementals -- okay, that's fine... I remember being excited breaking into the elemental planes, and thinking it was the cat's ass at first.<br />
<br />
The thing you don't seem realize is that people who are in the elemental planes worked their butts off to get there.  Lots of flagging.  Lots of backflagging.  Lots more flagging... backflagging... flagging again, and well... you get the idea.<br />
<br />
To me, it seems you want all the fringe benefits of the game without having to do the work that raiding guilds put in to get where they are.<br />
<br />
Also, remember Sony is a business.  They have to keep people interested in their game and give the people who are willing to play EQ 50 hours (or more) a week something to do, or those people will get bored and leave.<br />
<br />
They have to balance that requirement with not alienating more &quot;casual&quot; players, such as yourself.  As far as I've seen with OoW, they've done a decent job of that.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I'm a little annoyed that there's elemental quality gear (that *I* had to put in countless hours to get, back in the day!!!) dropping from mobs that can be duo'ed by a couple 65s in LDoN gear, but I'll get over it!<br />
<br />
They also need to make those people feel like they've achieved something for their efforts, a special status that not everyone gets -- otherwise, what's the point of making the effort at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
May I suggest that you actaully more reading. With proper exerecise you should get used to the consentration needed for reading, have the headaches lessen and it may even improve your reading comprehention. <br />
<br />
May I aslo suggest, as a newcomer here that you may want to find out who the people around here are. <br />
<br />
May I point you to the 12 pages of posts after my first one as a step in your remedial reading course? I have yet to find the mythic causal who just wants to have everything now--and not get the sence of accomplisment that comes with achiving something.<br />
<br />
We did not assume you were an idiot, don't come here and assume that we are. We can very much fathom that there are differances and why they are there and even why they are good. <br />
<br />
You argue that /played time should show the differance in power--and I agree. At 513 days played you either have a real problem with EQ--and should seek conseling-- or a bazaar bot, or both. That is more tha 40 hours a week since release.<br />
<br />
However most of the power differance between you and say Haass--rests not on time invested, desire or ability--but that fact that you can raid and there by get flogged through the planes.<br />
<br />
However, Haass needs no help from me in stuffing you. Heck Haass probably doesn't need to stuff you, you will take care of it yourself. <br />
<br />
Cardianl may I suggest, STRONGLY, that you take a gander at Haass's GOD experiment thread (at least) in the Tavern. You are prooving yourself to be a popmus jack ass to anyone with any sort of posting history here. Frankly, I would suggest if you are going to take on a firery old timer like Haass you read more of his posts than just that. <br />
<br />
Aramelus<br />
<br />
Something you (and I think that most casuals) are over looking is that if the access is blown open that does not mean the differance between raider/non-raider will disappear. Just because the non-raiders are in the Elementals the raid targets are still going to be raid targets and probably beyond the reach of any family guild for a long time to come. <br />
<br />
The prestige of beating the elementals doesn't go away--but is properly transfered from being there to beating the boss mobs. <br />
<br />
The 4 guild that are floggin the elementals can work on something that is far more interesting than making sure Jobober has his MB flag--getting down the real work of beating the elemtal bosses and working Time. <br />
<br />
Opening the elements--or any other zone--does not take the &quot;shiney&quot; off it. Beating the boss mobs is where it is at.</div></div><hr />

I would argue that beating RZTW is where it's at.<br />
<br />
I know I've never felt such a feeling of accomplishment as during the 2-month stretch where my guild learned to beat Agnarr, LMM, Bertox, and RZTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Aramelus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">Fire can be fully cleared by a mid-range elemental guild in less than an afternoon, and this was when people were level 65.  With level 70s, I'd expect that most AEs in the planes will be a joke to resist, and some &quot;bosses&quot; will definitely become one-groupable.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, since I don't think it's been mentioned, your truly &quot;uber&quot; people have long since left the elementals entirely, perhaps running back once in a blue moon to hit a god (for time flags).<br />
<br />
Guilds are breaking into elementals now that are considered &quot;casual&quot; or &quot;family&quot; now on my server.  There are open raids for pre-elemental flag mobs, on a weekly if not daily basis.<br />
<br />
You just need to put forth the effort to get there, just like everyone else did, who has gotten there before you.... I don't see the problem.  By virtue of raising the level cap, adding a bunch of new AA, tribute, guild tribute, and everything else... Sony has already made it way, way, way easier for anyone to get through old content.  Heck, some of the gods in Plane of Time are yellow con to a level 69 now!<br />
<br />
Also, though about 15 people have tried to dispel your notion of this already... I'll jump on the bandwagon and say that xp in Plane of Fire isn't _that_ much better than what can be had elsewhere.  Sure, it's good experience, but you can crank in experience just as fast in Plane of Tactics or HoH for example.......... sure, it's not 5% aa per kill in a full group, but with a charmed mob in tactics, you're probably killing mobs at 3x the rate a fire group could.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u199"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p199">AArrrgghhh!! These posts are making my head spin.  The thread is so so convoluted it does not make sense.  The theme of many of the posts (not all) are:<br />
<br />
1.  You do not play like me, so you suck.  (It  is a game.  We all have different circumstances, we all have different styles.)<br />
<br />
2,  You are not as far as me in the game so you suck.  (Either you had unfair help, or you are lazy or...   There are lots of different paths in the game, not one is the &quot;correct&quot; way to play eq, it is all good.)<br />
<br />
Everyone seems to have their own notion of what a good player is.  I honestly am not sure how to define a &quot;good player,&quot; or if we should even try. <br />
<br />
1.  Hp/ac/AAs/flags are not intended as a way to keep score or determine if you are a good player.  They are what they are.   <br />
<br />
2.  More hours played does not mean one player is better than another, it just means he played more hours.<br />
<br />
3.  Accomplishments/hour played is not a good way to determine if someone is a good player.  (As said above, we all have different circumstances.)<br />
<br />
4.  What  guild you are in is not a good way to determine if you are a good player (To some extent, I do believe that if you are in a higher end guild, you are more likely to be a good player since most have screening procedures and probation periods, but it is not a full proof litmus test.)  (OOW has provided firm proof to me that the uber guilds have have some  really bad players despite their time flags, and insanely good equipment.  Some (key word is some) of these people just do not know how to play.  I beleive it is due to the guilds relying on zerging to get flags.) <br />
<br />
5.  Completed quests.  Some people do not do quests.  If this was an indicator of how good a player you are, heck I may be an elite player.  I have done the newbie armour qeusts, Coldain ring quest, loyalist shield, PoS,......<br />
<br />
6  Number of LDoN completed.  Not a good determator if a player is good or not.  Just means they had &quot;Ldon&quot; next to their name when they went lfg.<br />
<br />
I feel strongly about my points above because some &quot;lesser&quot; players have lead roles in small guilds and some &quot;uber&quot; players have third string roles in big guilds.  I am in a small guild that currently does not have the people or levels to take down any decent targets, but raids are usually executed well, and due to small numbers, most are in key roles.  <br />
<br />
I said it in an earlier post, I do not have a grudge against the so called &quot;uber&quot; players because I do feel the game is fair.   I fall into the casual camp, and while I  do think the math works against me at times, it is still a fair game.<br />
<br />
I am really liking the OOW expansion, because it is  providing a path forward.  Prior to OOW, the only options I had to improve my character was:<br />
<br />
1.  Grind xp in Bot  for AAs (no elemental access yet, GoD too hard)<br />
<br />
2.  Grind LDoNs (aarrgghh!)   It is just plain unrealistic to equip a character entirely with ldon.  I think it would work out to about 1000 normal ldons or more, if you spent 1 hr per ldon total, it would equal about 41 days non stop, 24 hours a day.  It is realistic to get one or two nice peices fully augmented out of ldons.<br />
<br />
3.  Get flags on open raids.  Given time, I will get my elemental flags, just have to catch the right open raids.<br />
<br />
4.  Quests.  I actually enjoy the quests, and do them more for the fun of doing them, than for the equipment. <br />
<br />
Now, my progresion path is:<br />
<br />
1.  Grind xp for levels in OOW and get to 70.  We now can get to 70, and have place to get it.  So far I like the OOW zones.  They are not instant death like the GoD zones, have good xp and are fun (yes fun, this is important).   Getting 70 will also open other doors.<br />
<br />
2.  Grind LDoNs.  Yes xp is non existant now, but I never did them for xp, just points.<br />
<br />
3.  Get flags on open raids.  I would like to think this will go even faster, since I expect average level of players to go up, and player equipment to have gone up due to OOW drops.  The open raids that usually wipe on certain mobs, may win now.<br />
<br />
4.  Quests.  Old quests should be easier when I hit 70<br />
<br />
5.  GoD. Yes, I believe GoD will open up for me and other casual players when we get 70, and get a few gear upgrades from OOW.  When I get  to 70, if not sooner, I will start doing to GoD again.<br />
<br />
All in all, I am fairly content, and have plenty of stuff to do to keep improving my player until the next expansion.  I am also confident that most of you would be great to group with and are good players.<br />

Well, I suspect he hasn't but what he actually said was that his friend was chain pulling in KT for the same amount of time and got half the experience so it didn't sound particularly clueless.  Regardless, the point remains.   I hear a lot of raiders telling the nonraiders that they are essentially lazy and can find equal experience elsewhere if they stop bitching (much like they told nonraiders they were lazy and could get almost as good of gear elsewhere - guess what, I've been in those &quot;elsewhere&quot; zones and have yet to get any of that gear, heh).  At the same time I'm hearing other raiders contradicting those statements.  Whether or not one or the other of those positions is born of ignorance is irrelevant.  We are being told two things and one of them is the typical raider &quot;laziness&quot; line so I hope you'll forgive me if I'm a bit skeptical. <br />
<br />
As for me, personally, I really couldn't care less if raiders are in Fire.  I think that going to less-rich exp spots in OoW is more beneficial overall for nonraiders as we get experience, gear, and spells.  But I DO think its fucking ridiculous that Sony designed a new expansion in such a way that the majority raider view (including apparently those in your guild?) is that the best experience can be obtained in old, old content. <br />
<br />
<br />
but instead, lets bitch about fire exp! FUCK THOSE UBERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO FIRE.<br />

Hey, Lubor, aren't you in that Povar guild that actually trained a group exping the first day at the Fire tables so they could take it and power through to 70?  Thought so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my server the first people to 70 to my knowledge were from our furthest progressed guild rotating into a group near tables with a lot of botted out of group dps.It's not a shock or unfair that they beat me and my guildies to 70.They played crazy amounts of time raiding in the last year on Stromm to get where they are.Sure lot's of newer memebers got dragged up to that level and didn't do all the work themselves.Heck I'm pretty sure a fair number of them got ripped out of low pop guilds to the frontlines of GOD.So what it's a social game.They had the opportnity and were willing to skip a lot of content and rely on other folks to gear/flag them.Now they will have to play the hardcore game to stay there.Those guys raid like 6 days a week for most of their playtime and they have to show up a lot.They like a few guilds on Stromm took time off raiding to level,because,obviously it was deemed efficient.I can watch those folks pop naked to bind endlessly when learning new content in GOD for hours and hours.They put up with a ton of crud to do what they do. <br />
<br />
Don't be so worried about what Joe Shmo is wearing in his wrist slot or how fast he AA's and dings.He's not playing against you,It doesn't matter.Play you own freaking game.If being competitive with the high end players is what turns your crank then you have to be able to put eq near the top of your priority list.Most grown ups are not lucky enough to have that time and play EQ a differant way/shrug.The vast majority of time I am logged in it is to raid with my guild.It's not as relaxed and even as fun sometimes as grouping with friends,but,it's a way to play the game that makes stuff seem more worthwhile to me for my time.We don't have mandatory raids and raid about 10-20 hours a week after folks get off work.There is no way that we will keep up with hardcore guilds that raid/play far more than us.So what?I don't care if they ding faster or have 500 hp bp's there is still a game for me to play on my own with my friends.With a working older crew we've gone from level 1 to getting Quarm to 24 pct our first day trying him in little over a year on Stromm.We often raid with low numbers and rl strongly affects our attendance rates/shrug.The game is there to play as you will.<br />

There are good posts here about improving the game for everyone,but, it often desolves into this stupid comparison stuff.I never cared that guys who spent the majority of their waking hours raiding had xbp of uber stardom.When I was unguilded I did my own thing with friends and had fun.Now I do our thing with 50ish friends and have fun,tho it's a lot more stressful for me.It's easier to go to these places you want now then ever before.If you really want to get flagged for fire just do it like everyone else did.Raid a little.If you want to ding 70 and have fun ^%$# fire.It's not the best camp for real casuals anyway.That place can be very contested and unfriendly.Go kill stuff in GOD and OOW.My friends in the top guild here xp in the same places I do in OOW and it's great xp.There's stuff there for you now and hopefuly more coming... go find it.Stop worrying yourself with measuring sticks.If you think raiding is so easy go make yourself a guild and lead it thru pop to GOD and OOW.Or jump on one of those trains to uberness you're crying about.Just do what gives you the most fun for the time you want to invest and don't worry about what the other guys wearing or how fast he dings.Play your own game with your own friends and enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u205"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p205">Well, I suspect he hasn't but what he actually said was that his friend was chain pulling in KT for the same amount of time and got half the experience so it didn't sound particularly clueless.  Regardless, the point remains.   I hear a lot of raiders telling the nonraiders that they are essentially lazy and can find equal experience elsewhere if they stop bitching<br />
<br />
Ok, so one zone has less EXP than one camp in Fire, and you are using this to support the idea that those of us saying that there is just as good EXP to be found as what is in Fire, at tables?  Note also, that I for one am not calling anyone lazy, but I do reiterate that Fire, while nice, is not the be all, end all of EXP spots.<br />
<br />
Just to give you one quick example:  Been farming spells for my group, doing the Dranik's Hollow instinced zones.  Our shaman decided she wanted to crank out a couple AA's to afford increasing FT cap 1(she had not enough banked when OoW came out), so turned AA exp to 100 %.  She was reporting 3 % per kill AA EXP, on mobs that hit for under 600, that we where chain pulling, keeping generally 3 + in camp at a time, killing 50ish an hour.  Took her an hour and a half to get those 2 AA's.  This was at level 66, so if you are closer to 70 your mileage may vary some.  Also note that these instinced zones get higher level mobs if the person getting the instince is above a certain level(I have heard either 68 or 69 for the highest level instince).  Also note that Dranik's Holow is no where near the best exp in OoW.  We just hunt there since it is isntinced, and so quite, with no trains, and easily farmable named mobs that can drop spell runes(farming spells while EXPing = good).<br />
<br />
KT EXP is not as good as Fire, this is true.  But KT is one zone, and just because one zone is less than Fire, does not mean that all zones have exp less than Fire.  I say this not with the intention of hoarding Fire to myself(I could never step foot in EP's again and not shed a tear...I certainyl do not plan to ever EXP grind there if I can avoid it), nor am I implying that Kailyn or anyone else is lazy(I do not believe that to be true).  I am simply passing on what my experience has been, and that is you can get Fire like EXP, with a possiblilty of loot or spells, and explore new areas, all in OoW.  Don't envy those people who ground out 70 in short order in Fire, pity them.  Boring exp grinds suck, and they made it all the more boring by doing the same old thing for them.</div></div><hr />

Preaching does nothing when I personally wrote in my post that I don't care if people are in Fire or not - that I felt OoW was better for casuals because of the other non-exp items and spells it had to offer.  Nothing you said had jack 'n shit to do with what I posted.   It's as if you turned on auto pilot and just let the shit spill out.   I don't necessarily disagree with much of what you posted (in fact, some of it unknowingly paroted _exactly_ what I posted previously).   I just can't figure what in particular prompted you to post it then. <br />
<br />
Red, put simply, I don't believe there is better exp than that in Fire.  I could be wrong, but the massive raid guild mentality to experience there tends to confirm my belief.  I.e., Sassanik suggests that there might be better exp elsewhere but in the same post confirms that most of her friends practically live in Fire for exp; Lubor laughs at the whole Fire discussion, but at the same time I know that his guildies trained out other groups so they could take the sweet spot over; Apolyon claims that everyone has the same opportunities available to them, but in the same post states that he doesn't believe you can get better exp than in Fire.  You argue to the contrary, but also note that you haven't stepped foot in the Elemental Planes... Come on, now!  It may be an issue open to discussion, but it just seems to me like a bunch of fucking raiders believe its the best and fasted place to be experiencing.  <br />
<br />
Whether or not these raiders' beliefs are true isn't particularly important to me.  Neither is the fact that a gap may in fact exist.  I'm just arguing the point because as soon as the issue was raised by Kailyn it was immediately attacked as untrue.  <br />
<br />
I'll say it again, personally, I just don't care.  If I wanted to experience in Fire, I could do it.  I choose instead to see new content.  And I find it sad that Sony actually created a new expansion with new content where the experience apparently doesn't match up (in the eyes of the raiders) to experience earned in three-expansion-old content.  When PoP came out, people weren't training each other to get into the sweet Luclin camps.  So why is it happening with OoW?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't know what my guild did that night, i wasn't in fire, i was exploring oow and trying to find good places aside from old world zones to exp. and i still managed to get lvl 70 in 3 days without setting foot in fire.<br />
<br />
fire ain't the end all zone for exp, granted i only exped in there for maybe 30 mins since the release of oow, it wasn't that great. proving grounds is 4-5 percent an aa at lvl 70 and the mobs are insanely easy. i hear even better things abouts riftseekers zone, i never been myself, but i hear its good exp. and you know the best part of all these zones? you don't need a single flag to zone in.<br />
<br />
i'd still choose proving grounds over fire any day to exp, similar in terms of exp + droppable loot + runes + easier mobs.</div></div><hr />

I didn't.  I responded factually to your smartass comment re: bitching about Fire. I.e., You can post on this thread that Fire is meaningless to you and then make a smartass comment; then I can point out the seeming contradiction when I hear about your guildmates vieing for a Fire camp.    The point of your post, as I understood it, was to attack the concept that Fire was a superior exp spot; but the actions of other raiders, including those in your guild, belie that idea. <br />

I could ask the same thing.  If you agree with what I posted, then why make a three paragraph diatribe?  &quot;/agree Vigdis - get into OoW and earn those loots and spells!&quot; is a lot easier to type.  What I understood was that you were telling me (and others) that the experience differential ought not be examined at all for a multitude of reasons.  I confur with that insofar as casuals get more out of OoW content anyway.  I disagree with it insofar as Sony ought to have developed new content to equal or exceed the experience earned in old content.  And telling me and others that we should stop comparing ourselves with raiders is absolutely and utterly irrelevant.  I'm not comparing myself with raiders; I DO RAID.  I'm pointing out a shitty development implimentation.</div></div><hr />

Going to try this one moretime, just for the hell of it.  Fire has 2 big advantages foir those wanting to level fast.  1:  at Tables camp there is a plentifull suplly of level 68 mobs.  This keeps exp moving nicely.  2:  The people EXPing there already knoiw the area.  they know the pulls, they know the mobs, they know the pathing, they know just exactly what to expect.  No surprises.  Reason number 2 there is the biggest reason that those people got 70 first.  I 'wasted' a lot of time exploring, learning that certain mobs cannot be single grouped(think I have tried to single group most the raid mobs in NC now, finding out that they where raid mobs the hard way), finding where to camp, and where not to.<br />
<br />
BTW, I have not set foot in the EP's since OoW came out.  I have spent more than enough time there before.  I know what EP EXP is like, and I know that OoW exp, expecially in the best places, is at least comparable.</div></div><hr />

Give me a break, Lubor.  I bitch about the game about 1/8th as much as you used to when you were in Blades, heh.

My, uh, warrior is, uh, Fire flagged.  As is, as I'm sure you are aware, my enchanter. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'm having a fine time with the expansion and I posted in one of the first two pages that I also believed OoW was one of the best expansions to come out in some time, so it seems we are in accord.  This thread was about a particular issue with balance.  My concerns are with a particular issue with game design.   The only other thread in this forum in which I've &quot;bitched&quot; recently was the Epic 1.5 thread, and, yes, I see problems with design in that quest too.  Because I think Sony made a shitty development decision doesn't mean I don't enjoy the expansion.   One can actually see, understand, and share flaws about a game while enjoying it overall.  I hope that isn't too much of a contradiction for you.  <br />
<br />
Red, Why do you believe you have to try this &quot;one more time&quot;?  I don't believe I disagree with anything that you say, except that I'm not convinced OoW offers better experience than fire.  That said, I'm basing it on the mass influx of raiders to Fire, which as Sass noted might be due to a phenomenon other than pure knowledge of the experience differences.  I have also exp'd in Fire on several occassions and I am now experiencing in OoW.  It's hard for me to tell the difference since experience from 66-70 is so slow and I was always grinding AA in Fire.  I do agree with you that experience may come more readily in Fire because of the easily pulled level-68 mobs and the knowledge of the zones.  The former is a direct correlation to game design and latter is personal preference.  I am only concerned with the game design as I'd like to believe that newly created zones yield more experience than old ones.</div></div><hr />

Firstly, it isn't &quot;flinging mud&quot; to have a discussion.  Secondly, I have about as much fear of &quot;burning bridges&quot; with ubers as I suspect the ubers have of burning bridges with casuals.  That bridge doesn't seem to stop the name calling and insults on your side.  Why exactly must it on the other?  If people cannot take a discussion of game mechanics seriously enough to keep from insulting the casual player base and suggesting we &quot;quit&quot; if we aren't happy, that is their own failing.  If some &quot;uber&quot; doesn't care to be associated with me because of this discussion, I'll laugh and go happily on with my life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now this is an argument is that is hard to beat. I think we can assume you would still need to do the flogging to get to time/sol ro--but the rush would not be same if you already had XP access. So you would still need to beat the encounter to procced. I will grant that under the new senerio that fight would have less meaning for the guild that actually beat it.<br />

I've seen trash mobs drop that's not only better than anything single groupable elemental minis drop, but decent loot for folks who've farmed Time and all of GoD to death. At the risk of being pied, get off your whining asses and go sink your teeth into the new expansion. All the crying in this thread... elemental level xp, raid level loot... it's been given to you. It's much easier to obtain than it ever has been for raiders. Silver platter? Interesting choice of words - yep, you've got that now.

The next day, I zoned into Proving Grounds and killed 4 trash mobs, and a range item approximately FT4 110hp/mana dropped off the 4th trash mob. I was in a group there again last night for about 5 minutes before I won a tradeable 100hp belt about 4 turns from the damned zone-in. And Epic 1.5 anyone?

Close your browser. Log onto the freaking game. Make some sort of fucking effort to explore further than Bazaar, Plane of Knowledge, or a Wayfarer camp and go have some fun in new lands. You know, the way we all (casual and hardcore alike) used to do it back when you couldn't click a book to take you from grand central to anywhere in the game. It doesn't get any easier than this for EverQuest players, casual or non-casual. The game is so friendly for casual players now, it's amazing. If you'd stop wasting your time wishing you could log in and find a full suit of Vadd's in your inventory, you might realize your character can be very powerful with relatively minimal effort to the &quot;ubers&quot; and all the time they invested ... and, believe it or not, it can be fun too.<br />

And it looks a lot like SOE is not really interested moving in the direction of raid-flagging access to large portions of new expansions. Because although it works as a time sink and as a way of separating rewards for players who have high playtime and are raiders, it also sucks for a big portion of the player base. <br />
<br />
Now then, there's this quote: &quot;Make some sort of fucking effort to explore further than Bazaar (...)&quot;<br />
<br />
As a casual player who has always studiously avoided buying bazaar gear in favor of looting or making his own gear with a stubbornness that is eccentric at best and plain stupid at worst, I think that exactly the opposite advice would be at least as good until only post-ornate stuff is an upgrade: do nothing but exp grind as fast as possible in as few zones as possible. Spend almost all your time in the bazaar, buying on thursday and selling on Saturday night. Don't be a chump and loot the stuff yourself when you can make everyone else on your server your bazaar bitch. You're a complete loser if you can't afford to be in ornate as soon as you can equip it, and indeed getting flagged is a mark of inefficient use of your time--it shows that you were wasting your time fighting rather than upgrading your gear smoothly and efficiently in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I'm only partly kidding.</div></div><hr />

May I suggest that you actaully more reading. With proper exerecise you should get used to the consentration needed for reading, have the headaches lessen and it may even improve your reading comprehention. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From the postings that both you and Haass make, I do not fear any stress on my reading comprehension, or on my ability to count the number of expletives you may require to get whatever point you think you have to make across.<br />
<br />
As for the days played, I wholeheartedly agree /days played has absolutely no bearing on determining the skill of any player. The presence of the bazaar, cheap / continuous internet connections, and the tendency to afk large amounts of time, render it a largely pointless stat. I merely tossed it in there as evidence that at least I have been around a reasonably long time, and yes since 1999.<br />
<br />
My entire problem with the thread is the underlying belief by the &quot;casuals&quot; (and term was started my the originator of the thread , not me) that &quot;ubers&quot; have had the EQ world handed to them on a &quot;silver platter&quot; (Haass's words I believe), and that the poor oppressed &quot;casual&quot; gamer deserves everything that the average &quot;uber&quot; has ...  That is a total crock.  <br />
<br />
The point I made in my last post, and one completely ignored by your idol Haass, is that there are things that even the most casual gamer can do to improve his warrior. Things that do not require 70+ person raids (btw my guild was never one of these 70+ person raid ubers, we tend to average 40-60ish people, and as low as mid 30's back in the early VT days..).  The fact that someone can post on here and raise hue and cry about not having access to all the things an uber has, and yet have done NO LDoN's, is testament, at least, to the fact that either 1) he knows nearly nothing about how to play a warrior in post luclin EQ; or 2) he is so casual a player that it is utterly unimportant. Either way, it boggles the mind that such a player would demand equality to the &quot;uber&quot; level warrior.  In case you do not understand the role of warrior in EQ, and why even the most modestly geared warrior can benefit from even a tiny little bit of effort in LDoN, is to AGGRO !! You Kailyn have Anger III augments in your weapons according to your magelo, but the idol Haas has, by his own admission, done NO LDoN's and thus has NO Anger augments, yet he is terribly bitter about not having the riches &quot;ubers&quot; do.  <br />
<br />
I am sorry if it boggles my mind as to why this augmentless warrior feels he is oppressed by the &quot;Uber&quot;, and that Sony has crippled his ability to advance in EQ. I call TOTAL BS. This is not about grinding in 70+ person raids for 6 hours a nite for weeks on end. Hell, even the most utterly casual casual warrior could plunk down and do a normal LDoN here and there and at least get a single Anger 2 augment. Yea, it sucks that we warriors have to depend on the crutch of weapon procs in order to perform our core duty, but ya know what? Its how the current game mechanics are laid out and we have to deal with it. <br />
<br />
So am I to feel sorry for the augmentless warrior who cannot hold aggro in any even moderately dps ladden group? Hell, if I was playing my lowest twink 65 alt I would not want Haass as my tank, wizards and rogues must LOVE him!  Should Sony perhaps give him some augments since he obviously cannot find the time or the effort to grind out a little LDON here and there?  Now if a group seeking a tank, whose entire reason for being is to hold aggro and take a beating, decides to select a better equiped warrior who CAN hold aggro (albeit &quot;an Uber&quot; or even a &quot;casual&quot; who has more of a clue than Haas) over him, should I feel sorrry and hate Sony for obviously horrible hand it has dealt him?<br />
<br />
There are many ways to enjoy EQ, whether you get you rocks off tanking a 6k hitting goat, or prefer the more serene path of solo questing or even doing tradeskills. Nothing says one way is better than another. But if you choose the less intense, non-powergaming path, you should also accept the fact that you will not be a 10k+ HP unbuffed warrior. Should you really need to be? If you are not MT'ing a quad 3.5K hitting beast with nasty near unresistable AE's do you need the same gear a &quot;uber&quot; guild warrior does?  Can you not exp perfectly well with what is available?  Can you not enjoy the game on a different level and yet not begrudge one who chooses to be that &quot;uber&quot;?<br />
<br />
The pathetic whines and rants about &quot;ubers&quot; being handed everything on a silver platter is nothing more than a reflection of the poster's ignorance. Obviously, having not ever done any of these things that the dreaded &quot;uber&quot; has done makes it very easy to dismiss them.  Not having the memories like those of countless necro corpse summonings in Ssra while trying to figure out the strategies needed to do the Emperor at lvl 60 makes it easy to say &quot;ubers&quot; are spoonfed everything by Sony all to the detriment of the &quot;casual&quot;.<br />
<br />
I pity Haass if he feels that his enjoyment of EQ is blocked by the disparity of gear and relative power bewteen he and an average &quot;raid&quot; oriented warrior.  In the final analysis, if being all powerful is really so important, then by all means put the effort in to do what it takes to become so.  If you prefer a less time consuming approach to EQ, take that path. Many do and still enjoy the game. But don't go about rant and raving about &quot;f*ck Ubers and Sony&quot; for the woeful state you are in. <br />
<br />
You are what you make of yourself in EQ, no one says you HAVE to &quot;uber&quot; and there is no one saying you can't be &quot;uber&quot; if you really want to ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean fuck..46 hours of EQ a week..that's gotta take it's toll on the ol' ass. <br />
<br />
Oh, and one more thing.  I don't fucking care what level anyone is at in EQ.  I'm happy being where I am, and when I'm not, I don't fucking play the game.  Simple.<br />
<br />
What I do have a problem with, is you fucking assclown dickwads, coming here and acting like you 1) work harder, 2) play better or 3) Know more about EQ than anyone else, when the truth of the matter is that you just have more friends, and the ability to play between 5pm and 10pm EST.   You're not more skilled, you're not more knowledgable, and you're not even necessarily hard working at this point in EQ anymore.  You're just a fucking douche who takes the game WAY too seriously and thinks he deserves some kinda respect for it.  News Flash -- No one gives a shit.  Take your &quot;E-Penix&quot; elsewhere, or try to contribute to the conversation without the bullshit.  I'll fully admit that there are non raiding people who don't try, who don't give a shit, and who complain all the time that they can't get what they want.  I'm not one of them, and I hate those whiny bitches just as much as you do.  But when you ignore the extremes of 65 warriors wearing fucking Thurgadin gear and crying about how they can't hold aggro, and then the Time flagged people who were picked up in a massive backflagging run and thinking they're cock of the walk, there is major difference (Which albeit appears to be growing smaller with Omens) in Work involved vs Reward obtained.  <br />
<br />
Don't fucking tell me that everyone in your guild with 13khp raids 9 hours a day, because I know it's not true, and you know it's not true.  So if you deserve your l33t mangelo for playing 46 hours a week, how do you justify the people who log in for raids and then log off to spend time with their family?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u237"><b>Cardinal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p237">I don't need your pity Cardinal .. <br />
<br />
You still seem to have the reading comprehension problem that your tool accused me of having...   How can you pose as being so oppressed, and truly believe the fact that our guilds are just stoked with people who are &quot;carried&quot; through on the coattails of a few people.  You have the chip on your shoulder, not I.  I don't care if you feel LDoN's are not worth the time, that anger augments are not worth getting, so long as you don't start preaching about how rough you have it and how easy &quot;ubers&quot; do. You, son, brought up the point that &quot;ubers&quot; have it easy. <br />
<br />
If you attempt to preach to me about how hard you work in EQ, and how you put as much effort in as the next guy, and then start bashing &quot;ubers&quot; for the free ride you feel they get, damn right I am going to call you on the carpet and point out that you should be the last person to throw stones. <br />
<br />
Hint: Go about and play the game at whatever level you find enjoyable. No one says you have to do it one way or the other. But for god sake, chill on the &quot;uber&quot; bashing. WTF do you want? Open Time access? Fine, but are you going to put the effort in to building you character up to be able to stand up to the mobs in there? Would you then go out and do a couple LDoN's to get those little Anger 3 augments? I mean really, if you talk the talk, sooner or later you will need to walk the walk. If you get Elemental Plane access, and eventually Time , and so forth, you are going to have to do a little bit of work on the side to catch up...  if you didnt do LDoN's before, its going to be harder and harder to do them now... and as far as I have seen through GoD and OoW so far, no aggro augments have yet dropped ...  you need to get the the old fashioned way ....  EARN THEM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u238"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p238">Ya know, it's funny, you sit here and talk about people making assumptions about you, and then you go and do it here.<br />
<br />
Do you see me fucking crusading because the &quot;Non raider&quot; Is being held back?  No.  I'm ripping on you dickheads who think that you work harder than everyone else and have the right to come here and tell us how to play the game.  If you wanna make broad generalizations (Which is all your first post in this thread was, by the way), then I get to do the same.  And believe me, I can deal just as much watered down bullshit as you can.<br />
<br />
Did I say LDoN's aren't worth the time?  <br />
<br />
Did I say the augments aren't worth getting?<br />
<br />
Did I say half of the shit you think I said?<br />
<br />
I didn't, I said I haven't done any LDoN's at all, and that is it.  You don't know the reasons why, you just made them up.  You extrapolated from everyone else in this thread and painted a picture of me, and then you get insulted when we do the same to categorize all raiders in the same group.  Not cool.  The ONLY reason I'm in this thread, is to keep your retarded egos in control.  I know that you think you're hot shit cuz out of the last 1500 days you spent 500 of them playing EQ, but to be quite honest, that doesn't make you cool, that just makes you sad.</div></div><hr />

I look forward to replying when I get home...just going to take to long to do it here from work.<br />
<br />
Couple of quick things:<br />
<br />
1) I am the post originator, not Haass.<br />
<br />
2) I respect Haass--he has earned that--but he is not my idol.<br />
<br />
3) You still display a lack of reading comprehention as your arguments against Haass (the LDoNless one) fall part when applied to me, the person you intended to address as I have plenty of LDoNS under my belt. (PS my magelo is about as current as can be made--last I checked it would not let me raise my skills.)<br />
<br />
4) Only the most deliberate mis-characterization of my agrument would lead you to think that there should be no differance between raider and non-raider. Either a lack of comprehention or a lack of disapline to read--or even skim--the other 12 pages of this thread.<br />
<br />
5) I did not say the raiders have everything handed to them on a silver platter--just 66-70.<br />
<br />
6) All your assumptions about Haass are wrong. I suggest, again, you read his GOD experiment thread in the tavern.</div></div><hr />

You non-raiders have it far too easy on the messageboards. Posting is clearly designed around how much time you have to devote to reading and composing coherent arguments.

Dude, you're so right.  I think we've all learned something here today.<br />
<br />
I learned that you can't just go around insulting the uberguilders.  They don't have the time to be wasting reading messageboards, they have to spend every waking hour playing EQ.  All of that mental effort required to research material and compose a clear and concise argument with several people is put to much better use in their day to day lives of &quot;Move to me pls.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think we've taken a big step in understanding more of the world here today...and maybe we understand ourselves a little better too.</div></div><hr />

I mean you log in, while waiting for everyone to get together, read and post.<br />

Start the raid, flip over into EQ often enough to make sure you don't lag behind and then, once engage is called, have 30-40 minutes to uninterrupted reading time.<br />

Jailer is in the open room of the jail (across the hall from the doors).  He's like the front of the middle mobs I think.  If you keep that room clear, you should be able to pick one up.</div></div><hr />
