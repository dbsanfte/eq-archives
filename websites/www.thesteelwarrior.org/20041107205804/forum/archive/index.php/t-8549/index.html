<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">actually from CNN.com; but hey it's newsworthy here (http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/West/08/18/bear.beer.reut/index.html)<br />

SEATTLE, Washington (Reuters) -- A black bear was found passed out at a campground in Washington state recently after guzzling down three dozen cans of a local beer, a campground worker said on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
&quot;We noticed a bear sleeping on the common lawn and wondered what was going on until we discovered that there were a lot of beer cans lying around,&quot; said Lisa Broxson, a worker at the Baker Lake Resort, 80 miles (129 km) northeast of Seattle.<br />
<br />
The hard-drinking bear, estimated to be about two years old, broke into campers' coolers and, using his claws and teeth to open the cans, swilled down the suds.<br />
<br />
It turns out the bear was a bit of a beer sophisticate. He tried a mass-market Busch beer, but switched to Rainier Beer, a local ale, and stuck with it for his drinking binge.<br />
<br />
Wildlife agents chased the bear away, but it returned the next day, said Broxson. They set a trap using as bait some doughnuts, honey and two cans of Rainier Beer. It worked, and the bear was captured for relocation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">haha bears in campgrounds are getting to be as bad as animals in urban areas. I go camping yearly in the adirondacks in NY, and the campground I stay at always has a bear problem. The trash/recyclable center has an 8 foot fence with electricity running along the top, and there are bear warnings all over the place. Last year, myself and a bunch of others were sitting around a fire, and across the road, probably 50 feet away, a black bear suddenly jumped (yes no shit, he jumped) onto the back of a pickup, broke open the sliding windows in the back of the cab, pulled out a cooler and opened it. And made it look easier than many a human could do. Now we cover coolers in garbage bags hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when I was younger (sigh) I was a commercial salmon fisherman in Alaska for a while. One time a fishing/hunting guide showed me a large ball of what looked like crumpled up aluminum foil. It was the remains of a 1-gal. steel can of peaches that had been stored in a remote cabin. A brown bear had decided peaches would go well with his salmon main course, and that was the end of that can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm not so sure Ranier is really a step up from Busch hehe.  Used to see that when I lived in Montana, but I was under the impression is was just cheap swill on the same level as Busch, Keystone, and most other $5 a 12-pack beer.<br />
<br />
Funny story tho  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gruda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am from the Seattle area.  Rainier is about the same level as Budweiser in taste/cost, but it has really funny commercials.</div></div><hr />
