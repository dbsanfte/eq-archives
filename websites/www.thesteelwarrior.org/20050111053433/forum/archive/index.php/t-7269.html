<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toesniffer</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so i'm coming back from a 1 year 8 month leave of everquest. and i'm wondering where a lvl 60 war would go to lvl these days.  Keeping in mind i probably wont know anyone anymore so everything will probably have to be pickup groups for a while anyways.<br />
<br />
Also wondering if the red epic is still a decent weapon to use?<br />
<br />
And i'm mostly equipped with myrmidion armour (except BP) 6ac 65hp rings.. a 21% haste belt from PoS... Earring of solistice... is this gear going to be totally out of date or will it pass for a little while until i start finding better stuff?<br />
<br />
thanks for any help, and keep in mind i pretty much don't know anything about any expansion since luclin, so i might be easily confused  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The epic isn't very good anymore, get a sword of the bloodsworn and copper hammer of striking. Your armor sounds like it'll keep you for now, just look around for armor with better ac/hp and where to get it. Get PoP and level in Plane of Valor or Plane of Storms. LDoN is also decent exp, with a good chance of loot. Just keep an eye out for upgrades, there has been TONS of new stuff released that'll be better than your current gear.<br />
<br />
  EDIT: For specific suggestions on gear, go to http://www.magelo.com/ and link your gear in the bunker. Title it &quot;Help level 60 that hasn't played in a long time and needs tons and tons of help with my gear 'cause I think it sucks but I'm not actually sure if it sucks thanks you uber warriors I love you lots and lots and lots.&quot; Or something like that. If you want to get yelled at by Haass, ask repeated newbie questions in 4-5 different new threads.</div></div><hr />

Plane of Innovation has to be the spot for loot however, although experience will be a little slower due to the odd train.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">05-23-2004, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep the Red epic it is just as good as the 2 weapons mentioned and will be fine for aggro. Also go and get your disc's and make sure you get incite it helps a ton. Will need a magelo too see what help you need in gear, but if you worship Rallos Zek then just go buy some Fierce heraldic armor and you will be fine. Also welcome back to Bertoxx. For 2hb if you can stand how stupid it looks Great staff of thunder is a good aggro weapon and very cheap in Bazaar. For exp stick to PoP zones Pod, PoI, PoV, and when you hit 62 you can head to Karnors V2.0 Bot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the chardok quests are still good to do :)<br />
<br />
as to your gear..it should hold you for a bit as you work on getting new stuff... I didnt have much better at lvl 60 myself... the red sword should be fine till you can get better...once you get some cash you'll be able to pick up some relatively cheap upgrades... look for a GSoT (great staff of thunder) in your local bazaar if your 2hb is good...decent 2hb for pretty cheap (thing drops like candy)<br />
<br />
too bad on the not being rallos zek as the cultural has coem down alot in price... possibly could look for the non deity version (fine heraldic..etc)<br />
<br />
if you have LDoN start grinding those... you won't be able to do them on the hard setting, but if you do the Mistmoore (butcherblock) there is a decent set of armor that is buyable with points there..for really cheap.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">05-23-2004, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try Valor or Storms decent xp there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I'd make sure to buy LDoN, that expansion is worth it.  Then I'd focus on unlocking the armor from Everfrost or North Ro camps.  Your epic 2hs will do just fine in there for aggro if people aren't total idjits.  From there, I'd just get levels and defensive aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pickup a GSoT from the bazaar for like 100p, better dps than 2h epic.</div></div><hr />

The Chardok quests for thr rings and spirit wracked cords are still good. All the old Droga goblins were relocated to what used to be Burynai Mines in Frontier Mountains (Approx Loc -2000, 2000. Also labeled B on EQ Atlas map of FM) This is a good spot to farm faction, and with the new Healing Will discipline at 61, that's really all the healing you might need if you grab a buff or 2 from the buffbots in PoK beforehand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that LDoN would be a good option.<br />
And the discipline tomes, too--don't fight anywhere until you get them from Heldin Swordbreaker in the PoK library. He's on a balcony with the clerics in the SW corner of the building, loc neg 100, pos 1110, neg 28. Other threads in here somewhere will tell you how to get yourself fixed up with these.</div></div><hr />
