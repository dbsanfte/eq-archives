<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, before you redirect me to older threads... yes, I have read them.<br />
<br />
I'd just like a clearer answer (if anyone even has one) as to whether avoidance gives you a flat % extra avoided hits.<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter if this is because avoidance ac 'just works' like that... ie the higher your avoidance ac the more attacks you avoid as there is no such thing as what I would guess would be accuracy for mobs. i.e. that avoidance works independent of the attributes of a mob.<br />
<br />
Attitude on the SK board is ... well it just raises your avoidance AC... pfft who knows what that does even /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;%&quot; mods increase off a base amount, &quot;+&quot; mods stack on to of each other. +'s are linear, they will always stack unless an artificial cap is put in place, such as the Atk hardcap, or FT and Regen, as I understand them.<br />
<br />
I would tend toward the SK board's atitude and that the reason its called avoidance is because it effects the avoidance portion of AC. Think +atk, more exactly..+ accuracy portion of atk, for defense.<br />
<br />
These values won't change based on the mob you are facing, but they will be more effective on some mobs than others. Namely mobs with lower accuracy atk values.<br />
<br />
I could be smoking something too. I don't think we've ever gotten a real answer about how these effects work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;Namely mobs with lower accuracy atk values.&quot; - quote<br />
<br />
I've never heard of this before.<br />
<br />
AFAIK mob's chance to hit is affected by their level and absolutely nothing else.<br />
<br />
That's why I was asking if *because of this* +avoidance amounted to a flat % more hits avoided.<br />
<br />
I wasn't at all asking about how effects stack (sorry if the way I worded my post was confusing).<br />
<br />
Basically I'm wondering if I should prefer say a 10avoidance item to one with a lower value (say 2%) of shielding. Baring in mind that as a SK I don't main tank anything that takes an appreciable amount of time to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your weapon skill affects change to hit too, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To my thinking shielding is good on high DB mobs.<br />
<br />
On high DI low DB mobs avoidance is better....<br />
<br />
I don't care if you have high AC and most hits are mitigated to min... who gives a  ^$% in GoD if you take consistenly a small % less each hit. It's the bad rolls (for you) where the mob gets some high hits that one round you and there I'd prefer avoidance.<br />
<br />
Actually I'm pretty confused over this whole thing... so if someone could explain it  :) <br />
<br />
On the SK board Brael posted that shielding is better because it's better to to take smaller hits than to avoid it all together... but here he's confusing shielding with mitigation and they're not the same. <br />
<br />
As far as I can see on high DI low DB mobs (the normal trash mob) mitigation ac works allot like avoidance anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Avoidance is basically hidden ac from my understanding. Whether its AC over the softcap or not I dont know, maybe a dev can clear it up for us. <br />
<br />
I dont think you can pick one as being better than the other overall though.<br />
<br />
edit: I would guess it adds to the avoidance AC value which could previously only be raised by levels and agility and likely doesnt have a cap in place at all since no equipment could make any player go over the max avoidance ac value. Ofcourse avoidance mods have a cap though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Brael (the new SK rep) opinion is this...<br />
<br />
Get good ac to mitigate most hits to minimum, then shielding to lower that minimum... avoidance is not really worth anything<br />
<br />
This sounds attractive but I don't think it makes real world (ok, game) sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">avoid = mob miss= cant proc on you.<br />
<br />
avoid is also a set number not a % so avoid +10 is just +10 more avoid ac.<br />
<br />
stick &amp;debug=true&amp;resize=true on the end of you mangelo link to see avoidence ac.<br />
<br />
edit: opps allready had it in the link to the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If AC has an avoidance (chance to be hit) component and a mitigation (how much a successful hit will be for) component, couldn't we surmise that ATK would have equivalent formulas. Meaning wouldn't ATK have an accuracy (chance to hit) component and a damage (how much a successful hit damages) component that would be checked against their AC equivalent values?<br />
<br />
It seems to me that there is a sort of symetry to this design. I would be suprised if it didn't behave this way. This means that ATK and AC values on itmes effect the mitigation side of the formula, while up until these time effects, only level and their skill increases and relevant stats effect the accuracy/avoidance portion. These values may not be seen, but that doesn't mean they aren't there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't think so.<br />
<br />
Back in beta avoidance and mitigation ac were seperate numbers, they were only stuck togther later on.<br />
<br />
Attack is just... attack. That's it? I think...<br />
<br />
Pretty easy to this from the fact that +accuracy items don't change your attack number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but niether does avoidance (AFAIK), so you see what I mean....we just dont see the value that it effects, but we now that it effects something, might as well be this. Unless someone else has a better explaination...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok, instaed of mysticism about the unknown factors in the black box... what underwear the mob has on etc...<br />
<br />
I'd like to know... does avoidance amount, basically, to a % reduction in the hits you take from a mob? In the same way that combat agility and lightning reflexes do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The avoidance number isn't exactly comparable to shielding. Shielding is a percentage of the damage bonus. Avoidance is an absolute number added to your avoidance AC, not a percentage.  from Kavhok<br />
<br />
thread link (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7461) <br />
<br />
how it works no idea. will have to ask the devs and such.<br />
<br />
am going to guess the higher the avoid ac the greater chance to get missed, what percent a number will add idunno. so yea ca/lr like. in a all out guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, well its the black box stuff that keeps us being able to say how it works. No one came right out a stated it, but from the discussion I thought it was more apparent. It will increase linearly like AC does below the softcap in general if what I'm saying is true. Think AC except it affects the avoidance part of your shown AC, whereas the normal AC bonus on items is mitigation. Otherwise I have no clue about how it works and of course all this is all speculation until we get some data or a post from the devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My problem is that I can see that shielding is good on mobs with a decent DB... the kind of mobs that a warrior tanks with defensive on.<br />
<br />
For the rest (low DB mobs) I reckon avoidance is better.<br />
<br />
Brael's argument was that ac mitigates hits to minimum and then shielding lops a % off the DB which is just about all the damage you are taking.<br />
<br />
This just seems like poor thinking... an obvious fallacy. <br />
<br />
I would think that, even in the case where you mitigate allot, 10 avoidance (which the ball park figure is 1% less hits landing) would be better than a small amount of shielding (say 2%). This is for a one healer to one tank situation, say offtanking... rampage or one group content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I guess I'll make it more clear what we want to know in case a dev would like to stop by and clear things up for us.<br />
<br />
About + avoidance bonuses...<br />
<br />
Just gonna trown out some numbers, they don't mean anything except an example.<br />
<br />
Say I have 1500AC showing on my inventory. 800 of that is my &quot;mitigation&quot; AC, 100 is from class AC bonus, and 600 is my avoidance AC.<br />
<br />
We know that higher defense skills increase the avoidance AC as does agility.<br />
We know that higher defense skills increase the mitigation AC as does item AC.<br />
I have no clue where the class bonus is put. Is it entirely dependent on where it comes from, or is it all mitigation AC or all avoidance AC?<br />
<br />
Now to the meat of the discussion.<br />
<br />
Where does + avoidance come into play? Does it effect only the avoidance AC portion and is simply not displayed in the inventory? Does it modify the defense check formulas in some way?<br />
<br />
On a related note, what about + ATK and + accuracy bonuses.<br />
<br />
Is it analogous of AC in its workings? Is ATK made up of 2 components like AC and work in a similar manner? Does + accuracy effect ATK the same way that + avoidance effects AC/defense calculations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have 2629ac on raids usually and I do get hit for minimum a lot which is great and all but saying shielding is &gt; avoidance with high ac makes no sense. It doesnt matter if I'm getting hit for 400 or 4000 a missed hit is a missed hit which is always good when tanking.<br />
<br />
And besides, how many slots would a decision need to be made on anyway? I cant think of any choices of avoidance or shielding offhand other than rz cloak vs. quarm cloak which is a pretty moot point with GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">sk items and all/all are different though i think, choices are a bit different then a warriors.<br />
<br />
your avoidenc ac is 456 vikken magelo with avoidence displayed (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=989385&amp;resize=true&amp;debug=true)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">sk items and all/all are different though i think, choices are a bit different then a warriors.<br />
<br />

<br />
I wasn't wondering what my avoidance AC was.<br />
<br />
Ok, now that I'm not so tired, I'll try to explain what I'm asking better, I don't think my question was coming across the way I wanted.<br />
<br />
In my mind, this is how I see how the combat formulas stack up against each other to determine hits and damage.<br />
<br />
AccuracyATK + rand(n) vs AvoidanceAC + rand(n)<br />
<br />
AccuracyATK is determined by offensive skill values and dex.<br />
AvoidanceAC is determined by defense skill values and agi.<br />
The rand(n) adds a random roll into the calculation for a probability distribution.<br />
<br />
In my mind, + accuracy items add directly to this AccuracyATK value and + avoidance items add directly to the AvoidanceAC value.<br />
<br />
Of course, only after a higher roll on the AccuracyATK value will a successful hit be determined. Then a separate roll is made to determine how much the hit was for in a similar equation.<br />
<br />
DamageATK + rand(n) vs MitigationAC + rand(n)<br />
<br />
DamageATK is determined for offensive skills and str.<br />
MitigationAC is determined from defensive skills and AC.<br />
rand(n) being there of course to provide probablity rolls.<br />
<br />
Its this comparison that gives the damage distribution probabilities in line with what we already know about damage calculations. In other words, DB and DI fit in here somewhere.<br />
<br />
So damage ditributions would then be modified by +ATK items on the damageATK side while standard + AC items work on the MitigationAC side to determine damage distributions.<br />
<br />
My question is does effects like + accuracy affect the avoidanceAC rolls dirrectly in the way I've shown, or does it come into play somewhere else? Same thing for + avoidance items, do they modify the probibility distribution? Does AC and ATK come into play as I've shown?</div></div><hr />
