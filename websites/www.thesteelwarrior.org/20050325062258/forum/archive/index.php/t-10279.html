My guild just broke into ToFS last night, after 4-5hours of working to get all that stuff turned in. FInally it came down to a a named spawning. We killed him, and got Firiona's Hair. When we broke into ToFS... Well..<br />
<br />
The named there is quite literally impossible to beat.. His Regen is to insane, and he shadowsteps people way to often to even be considered an encounter, but you can't go any further until you beat him..<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

We killed him. Its pretty much a zerg fest. =/</div></div><hr />

His melee is gimp, and is IS undead, so even some of our clerics were dotting and nuking.  Anything you can throw at him and he'll eventually wear away.  Once you get beyond him, the rest of the tower is an absolute BLAST (cept for floor 6A).  Even Tserrina is way easier than he is.</div></div><hr />

I've been seeing links to a lot of stuff but some of it looks elemental quality while some looks Anguish quality so I'm sure a lot of what I'm seeing isn't really from there.</div></div><hr />

Was a fun event overall, I really liked the npcs in Iceclad and how the pally (with uber suck dps) goes off and kills the mob guarding the entrance to TOFS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah ok thats the kind of stuff I expected to see dopping, the stuff that looked like Anguish loot turned out to be Anguish loot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You get a title upon completion of the event as well. And it's a one time deal, kinda like waking the Sleeper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had someone selling the Aegis of the Valiant on our server.  He wanted 850k pp for it I think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FyRe610</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what difficulty are these mobs? like by floorish....i used to 2box(65 war 66 cleric) the whole tower for S&amp;G's...so from what i read i wont be able to kill a damn thing huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took 30 odd for the whole tower. The first and second floor are the hardest tbh, the spectre at the start isn't hard, just annoying. The second floor white cones have adds that will catch an unprepared raid hard, nearly wiped with 34 people of which 20 odd at least we're Qvic +.<br />
<br />
Rest of the tower is a blast, well worth trying if it has not been done on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grayhelm</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it revert to the old ToFS once complete, or do the mobs hang around, or do we not know yet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it does. Once you kill Tsserina and finish that part, it reverts.<br />
You also get a title (Chosen Guardian).<br />
<br />
Like... hmm, someone up top said, its a one time deal, so get 30 and do it! Second floor is killer btw, wiped 34 txevu flagged people off pretty fast(I was the only one left after about a minute. They come in force and will wipe through your forces). Just imagine the scene from Lord of the Rings where the humans charge into the orcs, and keep going, and going, and killing like half the orcs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradin</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CV on TP beat the whole thing and its not impossible.   Just takes teamwork and thinking it out.   Brains over brawns so far its been two days and it aint reset.<br />
<br />
If you can make it past the 2nd floor books its not bad.   But some of it is puzzles or sorts.</div></div><hr />
