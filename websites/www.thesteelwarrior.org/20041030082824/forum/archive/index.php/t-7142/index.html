<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if this question is old or has been asked a bunch.  But I'm at work and don't have much time to research today.  I recently aquired a boc for my warrior.  He was using the droga combo.  I have Anger II on my sotbs, ditching the chos ( un auged) for the boc.  I'm assuming the sotbs with Anger II will still stay mainhand until I can get up enough points to get the Anger III for the boc ?  I had a boc when I was a 56 and it seemed to be streaky, some fights proc'ing alot and other times not as much.  I know it's a calculation and all,  but it seemed streaky to me.  Anyways my main question is this: will the damage from the boc and the EB ( when it does proc) give me better aggro in my main hand than my sotbs with Anger II ?<br />
<br />
Second question, hypothetically if down the road I end up with a sceptre of destruction and boc, both with Anger III, which goes in my mainhand?  The SoD has a nice low delay (12/18) with the 288 DD proc w/stun.  Which then would go mainhand?  BoC or SoD? Each with Anger 3.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep the CHoS and get rid of the sotbs, it's better dps and higher dmg proc. Just eat the 510 pts you spent on anger2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Offhand the BoC until you can get an aug for it. I wouldn't bother getting an SoD, its only a marginal upgrade for either Droga weapon. Magelo is down ATM, but chances are that you can get a lot of upgrades for what you would spend on an SoD (unless your server still has a sleeper and you can actually loot one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First get the sod/boc question out of the way. Almost everyone I have talked to who used a sod feels it has about the same agro as a boc proc. So there really isn;t a reason not to mainhand the sod for more damage and offhand boc if both have anger 3.<br />
<br />
Most people prefer chos vs sotbs. I personally ahve found the stun proc from sotbs very useful and is still carry one around to help with casters everyonce inawhile.<br />
<br />
Considering your sotbs has anger 2. Mainhanding it for ahwile is still a good idea. You will get more procs with the auged sotbs, than the boc. On average, mainhanded, at 305 dex you would get 2 boc procs for 700 agro and with the sotbs you will get 4 total procs. 2 for 400 agro each and 2 for about 400-500 agro each (the stun). Not to mention the sotbs will be less streaky since you have mutiple procs. Any proc from your weapons should take agro from a slow.<br />
<br />
It should go without saying and I am sur you already plan on it, but save and put anger3 on the boc. For an all round improvement on your dps and agro, you could grab your chos and put a 510 ykesha proc from guk on it. But the change to your offhand might not be worth it, depending on how much ldons you want to do. It also seems that you could benefit alot from ldon gear so my suggestion would be save and anger3 the boc, then mainhand it.  Keep your sotbs the way it is and then save for a nro BP and 40 hp augs etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you'll get more mileage from a BoC then you would a SoD.  i'm not at all impressed with SoD.  you would honestly be better off with a CHoS.  its an overprices twink toy and collector's item at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SoD = overpriced useless piece of shit<br />
<br />
200+K when a 15/20k Droga/Nurga weapon would do the job.<br />
Agreed its a collector's item, but its probably the worse deal in EQ history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SoD is the most overrated item in ALL of EQ.  The agro from the proc is not anywhere near as much as BoC.  In fact the agro is so low when we were doing ST during Velious we had monks dual wield SoD's with NO agro problems.  I once tested Jaelens katana vs SoD for agro on the dorfs in Thurg b and the Jaelen's out agro'd SoD...and thats with a lifetap proc!<br />
<br />
So in my opinion ignore SoD entirely, its worth about a 10th of what they sell for.</div></div><hr />
