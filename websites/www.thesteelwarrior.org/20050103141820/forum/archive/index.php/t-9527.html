Seems to coinside with enchanters landing tash line or cripple line spells. Anyone else seen anything like that?</div></div><hr />

Were you with another 69 warrior who had it, who was using it after you did? I think that would cause you to get that message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll see if it keeps doing it, if not I'll assume it was just dispells :)</div></div><hr />

And it happened to me  a couple nights ago; so yea some stuff overrides it.</div></div><hr />

It isnt a wears off early issue, its the dispell problem, its the only one of our line that a mob can actually have dispelled off them.  Ive been feedbacking/bugging it since I got it early on in OoW but have seen no changes nor plans of changing.</div></div><hr />
