<br />
Taunt should be 100% works, fails has a chance to partially taunt (i.e. adds Hate of 10-90% of what a full taunt would have given you determined by your taunt skill, level, mob's level etc.) or should fail.<br />
<br />
Taunt will not help you if you are at the top of the mob's hate list (just as it is today).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's because taunt don't work that way. Your idea assumes taunt adds a certain amount of hate if successful, and will add nothing if you're at the top of mob hate list.<br />
<br />
The way it actually works is, it puts you at top of hate list +1, or fails. No amount of hate generated at all, other than that 1 point; think of it as a tool to steal the hate of others.<br />
<br />
Example 1: mob hasn't been hit, agroed some ranger. You run up to it and taunt, mob turns on you. You now have a very small amount of hate since that ranger didn't build any up; maybe 1 or 2 points. Wizard nukes, mob turns RIGHT back at him provided you didn't attack since agro from 1 nuke is tons more than the little agro taunt got you from that ranger that was at the top of the list.<br />
<br />
Example 2: mob agroes ranger, ranger casts 5 snares in a row on it, nukes it and melees it. You taunt, mob turns on you. You now have massive amounts of agro since you stole agro from 5 snares, nuke, and melee. Note ranger is now 1 point under you on the hate list, so unless you attack and proc or he jolts, you'll lose agro to him. But the wizard can nuke his ass off and the mob won't budge from you (or the ranger if he don't jolt).<br />
<br />
Seeing as this is how taunt works, if it fails, what's it going to do? You want it to give you half of a failure? That's still nothing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you missed his point Deadalus. He knows how taunt works; he even described how it works. What he's suggesting is a *new* way for it to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It could calculate the amount needed to jump to the top and divide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/e cringes, waiting for Hulanta's return...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, I probably did. But even if it calculates the amount needed and divides, how is that a help? Someone jumps 200 points ahead of ya on the hate list; you partial taunt and get 100 agro. They're still on the top of the list, taunt seems like it did nothing from everyone's perspective cause the chanter's still getting a healthy dose of anal justice (let's assume we're exping in PoJ ;) ).<br />
<br />
Seems to me like taunt would still not get you agro unless it worked 100% each time...<br />
<br />
Something more reasonable from my point of view would be to make it add like 500 points of agro; then the partial thing would work better, cause ya could build yourself up a nice lead while you're holding agro as a buffer against the chanter who decides tash/slow/cripple/nuke all in a row were a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Assume that you are in a group where the level 30 mob_012 is attacked by your band of level 30ish (warrior, ranger, wizard, shaman, druid, monk).<br />
<br />
ALSO assume that the taunt button is now pushable twice as often as in the past.<br />
<br />
The warrior watches while the monk pulls the beast into camp and feigns death (no hate from the mob now), the ranger snares (generates imaginary number of 100) and the shaman slows (generating imaginary number of 150).<br />
<br />
The warrior hits attack, misses and then hits taunt and gets a partial success of 70%.  This puts 105 hate on the warrior and the mob is on the shaman at this point.  <br />
<br />
Then the wizard hits the mob with a mighty nuke (generates imaginary number of 400) and is now on the top of the hate list.  The warrior swing and hits the mob for 40 points of damage (generates imaginary number of 40 + the 105 already from the partial success on the taunt for a total of 145) and hits taunt and gets a partial success of 70% which would be factored from the wizard who is at the top of the list with 400 which would be an additional 280 hate + 145 = 425 hate! <br />
<br />
Woohoo!  Even though the warrior did not succeed fully on either taunt, the added hate from receiving part of the agro that a fully successful taunt would generate gives the lucky warrior agro for a time.<br />
<br />
To make this an honest scale, with low taunt skill, the warrior should have a success rate similar to:<br />
<br />
40% fail<br />
30% partial (10-50%)<br />
20% parial (60-90%)<br />
10% Total success<br />
<br />
But that with a low skill.<br />
<br />
At level 65 with maxed taunt skill it should be more like:<br />
<br />
20% fail<br />
25% partial (10-50%)<br />
25% parial (60-90%)<br />
30% Total success<br />
<br />
This is a much lower success rate than our normal success of about half.  (I don't have the exact percentage parsed, I don't parse).  However, with the extra hate generated by the partial successes, a warrior can still command pretty nice agro.<br />
<br />
However, I know that this ONLY works when the warrior is NOT at the top of the hate list and that the taunt button does NOTHING when the warrior has agro.  This would continue to be the case.  However, this new way of computing what happens when you hit taunt would mean fewer times when the mob will turn on you in that initial push of the button, but the ability to grab agro better when the mob has turned on a ranger, wizard, cleric, enchanter, shaman, etc and you have pushed the button twice or thrice.<br />
<br />
The thing that aggravates me the MOST about the taunt button is that because it is like flipping a coin, you can hit some nasty dry spells where nothing you do will turn the mob on you because some other player has done something very heinous to the mob and I can't get a successful taunt to generate.  Also, by allowing twice as many presses when you don't have agro, you can build that agro until you get the other player's hate +1, or generate enough hate on your own to keep the mob on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hulanta's model seems to me to be more in line with reasonable mob reaction than the current implimentation. Even if stripped down to barebones it's superior to a binary result. For arguments sake:<br />
<br />
Mob is infuriated - top of the Hate List +200 Hate<br />
Mob is angered - +200 Hate<br />
Mob laughs at your puny insult - nada<br />
<br />
Making the current implimentation worse perhaps is the way the RNG might be being used -<br />
<br />
A random coin flip has a 50% chance of coming up heads totally independant of the previous results and while there can be statisically improbable runs, each flip is random.<br />
<br />
However Taunt should not be a coin flip - it's a skill. It is a lot closer to a baseball player with a .500 average. The batter may have slumps, but he's also a profesional with techniques designed to put him back in the groove and break slumps. Can you imagine a baseball player with a .500 average going 20 at-bats without a hit? It's quite unlikely.<br />
<br />
A method to simulate a skill vs. a random flip is easy to impliment. Instead of each coin flip being an independant event, previous results are stored and used to modify the odds as a hot streak or slump lengthens. This is intended to produce expected results (eliminate unlikely runs not generally found in a skill).<br />
<br />
The higher percentage of sucess for a skill, the less likely a long run of failure should be. And, as Hulanta points out partial success is more skill-like then a binary system in the first place. Our baseball player is a skillful hitter. He may not always hit a homerun - but a single, double or triple is a good effort and is recognized as such.<br />
<br />
It should be relatively easy to establish if tradeskills and Taunt are implimented as skills or coin flips. The length of runs is a dead giveaway.<br />
<br />
Now it may very well be that since the RNG is run on the server side this becomes more complicated, but it's not undoable. It's also quite likely that such a system exists in EQ (it's been known for 30 years) and players merely take note of slumps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Warrior at 145, wizard at 400. 70% taunt here gets 178 points, not 280, for a total of 323. Wizard still getting hit.<br />
<br />
What ya missed id that taunt puts you at top of the hate list counting from where you are, not from the bottom. In other words, a warrior who has nearly no hate and taunts from someone with 400 hate gains 401 agro and gets attacked. A warrior with 300 hate taunting off someone with 400 gets 101 points of agro for a total of 401.<br />
<br />
This can be observed in game quite easily: when someone takes agro from you mid-battle (after you've been building up hate) and you taunt successfully, you should get all their agro in addition to yours, which is near the top too, giving you a massive amount of hate that totals nearly double what the top agro was before. This should give you SOLID agro after a successful taunt; instead, you often lose it in the next combat round, indicating the amount of hate that partoicular taunt added wasn't much since you were so high on the agro list to begin with.<br />
<br />
Taunt, once again, simply gives you the difference between your current position on the hate list and the top position on the hate list +1. 70% of that still won't help, because as you get closer to the top of the hate list the number needed yo put you on top of it gets smaller, and taunting for less than that number gives you an even smaller amount, never enough to hit the top.<br />
<br />
The idea of a partial taunt succeeding in getting the taunter agro won't work;  partial taunt, the way taunt works now, would be a lot like a cosine curve - it gets ever closer to the x and y axis, but never actually touches it.<br />
<br />
Another idea Hulanta presented has some merit, that about taunt refresh being halved. This is good, if only because it gives taunt more times to succeed (fully). However, the way taunt skill works now, partial taunting won't work - not unless the skill is reworked to add a substantial and fixed amount of agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Daedalus, he's proposed a change to taunt. Why do you keep confirming exactly what he's saying, while framing your response in terms of educating people about taunt? We know how taunt works. *He* knows how taunt works. What's being discussed is a *change to taunt*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why do you keep confirming exactly what he's saying, while framing your response in terms of educating people about taunt? <br />
<br />
I'm not. I'm pointing out why his change wouldn't work. It's not that hard to understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Daed, from what i understand the percentages are taken from the current top hate total indiscriminate of where you are in comparison i.e. if your current generated hate is more than 30% of the wizards hate total then that 70% (of his total hate) chunk will boost you ahead of him.<br />
<br />
Trying to apply current conventions to an idea which postulates a totally different way of operating is a little silly. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All we need is really one hate generating skill that we can activate on demand. Yes, ramp up taunt success rates. 60% is pathetic considering the skill is maxed, and it has a huge tendency to fail in strings.<br />
<br />
Two things SOE needs to do in order to make taunt more effective<br />
<br />
1) Make the taunt skill announce to the player with a pass/fail message so the player can determine what action needs to occur next. Sometimes it is difficult to determine if your taunt has been successful if the mob has been slowed, rooted or mezzed. Also, increase the range of taunt so it is twice normal melee range (your voice and gesticulations do carry further than the end of you sword). Also, while you're at it, eliminate the greyed out taunt key if the mob is out of range. This really sucks.<br />
<br />
2) Give warriors and innate hate generation method, something that can be used on demand. Maybe a button that gives an increased chance of triggering a proc on the weapon the primary slot, or an innate EB kick (to the jewels) that gets the mob's attention. Something that can be used right after a successful taunt to put the warrior over the top on the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i like the fact that 100% success means instant turn around on to me, but i would like a &quot;50%&quot; mark where the total agro of the person in the lead is put agesnt a 20% caculation and the result added to our hate, but that would mean it would be a last resort button and a aggro button</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Daed, from what i understand the percentages are taken from the current top hate total indiscriminate of where you are in comparison i.e. if your current generated hate is more than 30% of the wizards hate total then that 70% (of his total hate) chunk will boost you ahead of him. <br />
<br />
Aye, I kind of saw that and was hoping I was wrong, so I ignored it. I mean, every taunt adding 50-100% of the current hate total, indoscriminate of where the warrior is on the hate list? What's to prevent a warrior from constantly mashing taunt even when he has agro, doubling and redoubling his agro every time to the point where the whole Roman army wouldn't be able to peet the mob off him? Seems this way warrior's agro would increase exponentially making him 10 times better than any hybrid at holding agro.<br />
<br />
Tried not to see it since it would trivialize all raids as long as the MT can be kept alive agro and position-wise, meaning SOE would never implement it. Unless I'm missing something here again?</div></div><hr />

Some nights, I just wish a Taunt failure at least netted me an improved chance of success the next time - even if it capped below 100% chance of success.<br />
<br />
F'rinstance ...<br />
<br />
Taunt 1: 60% chance (fail)<br />
Taunt 2: 70% chance (fail)<br />
Taunt 3: 80% chance (fail)<br />
Taunt 4: 80% chance (success)<br />
<br />
Dunno if this has been mentioned anywhere ... it's late, and I'm tired.  And I'm not saying that any other notions are bad, I like all I see here.  Just riffing on them.<br />
<br />
For a real world model of this ... flash back to the last time you were at a bar with some yutz in the booth behind you taking umbrage with the world at general, at great volume.<br />

Example 2: mob agroes ranger, ranger casts 5 snares in a row on it, nukes it and melees it. You taunt, mob turns on you. You now have massive amounts of agro since you stole agro from 5 snares, nuke, and melee. Note ranger is now 1 point under you on the hate list, so unless you attack and proc or he jolts, you'll lose agro to him. But the wizard can nuke his ass off and the mob won't budge from you (or the ranger if he don't jolt). <br />
<br />
In my experience of playing a warrior for 65 levels there is cap at which a single taunt will not allow you the &quot;highest hate+1&quot;.  A situation like you describe above is a perfect example of it.<br />
<br />
Basically there is a limit to how much aggro you can gain from single taunt.  If one class gains a huge amount of aggro above yours you need to work in some solid damage aggro before you can hope for a successful taunt.<br />
<br />
If this wasn't the case I should be able to ping pong a mob between myself and say a Palladin during the duration of a given xp mob fight.  However, (and I used to have a good palladin friend i grouped with alot) if the palladin is going full out aggro generation I may only be able to pull aggro off him once or twice for a split second for the whole fight.  more than likely I will NEVER pull aggro off him at all.<br />
<br />
If successful taunt really gives &quot;highest aggro+1&quot; then i should see ping ponging as I taunt and he grabs it back.  In my experience this doesn't happen which leads me to believe that if I get too far behind in hate generation then even a successful taunt will not put me to the top of the aggro list.<br />
<br />
This is just a further little harm to the warrior class, one of a very many that come together to make us the least desirable tanking class for any single group situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Depends on if you remain at the top of the list for more than a split second as your taunt gets overtaken again :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Basically there is a limit to how much aggro you can gain from single taunt. If one class gains a huge amount of aggro above yours you need to work in some solid damage aggro before you can hope for a successful taunt.  I don't know about that. I have had it happen where I taunted a mob I know mezzes, after a few mez resists it turns on me and tries to pound me into the ground, gets mezzed finally and then when MA breaks mez it is on me the whole fight. From one taunt. Taunt is a mystery to me though, sometimes it works really well, others not at all. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
