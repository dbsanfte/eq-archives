<br />
More people duel on my PvP server than I ever saw dueling on hellscream.  it's ridiculous.  Why the fuck do you duel on a PvP server when you can just go out and find some of the other faction to kill?  It's assinine.<br />
<br />
Secondly, WHY OH WHY are warriors fucking complaining about duels?  You KNOW GODDAMNED WELL that your class is gimped severely if you can't get a charge off.  Every single one of  you knows this.  SO STOP DUELING.  Goddamn. <br />
<br />
Go out and PvP.  Find people and kill them.  Warriors aren't in that bad of shape in PvP balance.  I saw a rogue ganking people in gadgetzan and then vanishing before the guards could kill him.  A warrior pulls him outside and absolutely owns the living shit out of him...I mean seriously, 12 ways from sunday.  DON'T FIGHT LOSING BATTLES.  After I told the rogue he got exactly what he deserved for being a ganking jackass, he came back with the &quot;Lol, warriors are teh weakest, I let him win.&quot;   Uh huh.  Whatever helps you sleep at nite.</div></div><hr />

I let warriors charge vs me, or else it's boring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodmane</div><div class="date">04-06-2005, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know what you guys are complaining about. First off Haass.... ur a horde member so you don't fully understand the main complaint put forth by the original poster. On my server Paladins out number Warriors 2 or 3 to 1 on the Alliance side. So there is a big concern about paladins taking alot of MT positions. <br />
<br />
 I personally happen to love paladins in WoW. I'll take them in my group any day of the week. Even tho paladins are adequate tanks and main healers I've never once had a paladin in my group go &quot;Hey let me MT I'm better then you&quot; It just doesn't happen. Paladins are way more effective left to assist so they can heal others in the group safely and are free to offtank if needed.<br />
<br />
I play both a lvl 60 Warrior and a Paladin alt lvl 50.  A skilled Paladin is almost unstoppable by a warrior if they are talented out towards PvP/Tanking. A Retribution Pally with Holy Shield/Seal of Command/Consecration and who uses Judements properly on a warrior should never needs to worry about dying.<br />
<br />
Here is my Warrior killing method. Works about 99% of the time. <br />
Dual Wielding warriors are the funniest.  I use Judgement of Light/Retribution Aura/Consecration/Seal of Command/Holy Shield and watch them heal me almost as much as they dmg me While I use my flurry axe to rapidly cause double dmg hits thanks to Seal of Command. My blocks do 95+ Mith Shield spike dmg with Holy Shield. Seal of Light Heals me 50 dmg almost every time I get hit. And consecration does 280 dmg over 8 seconds. I almost never get low fighting a Dual Wielding warrior.<br />
<br />
Only thing i do differently vs 2h users is I use Judgement of the Crusader to add 110 dmg to Each Holy dmg effect. ie. 110 dmg to Consecration 110 dmg to each Seal of Command Hit and 110 dmg to Holy Shield Blocks. If I get low I step back and heal with my immunity or I stun and heal. I do as much dmg as most DW'ing warriors and take significantly less thnx to high block % and Armor. Warriors beat themselves to death on me or are surprised by my dmg output with seal of command procs I get a 150+ dmg on almost every swing or every other swing. I block 30% more with holy shield and if you crit on me I Block another 30% more. each block deals 175-200 dmg back to you. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I know enough about my warrior to know I should start my heals well enough ahead of 20% and to avoid allowing a charge. As most Paladins I've grouped/pvp'ed with know.<br />
<br />
You get the idea. A talented out Pally with proper talents in retribution and shields with a fast weapon can almost always win a duel with a warrior. I've played a Warrior PvP specced and a Paladin PvP specced and in battles with Warriors my Paladin should never lose unless I get ganked when I'm low on life or mana.</div></div><hr />

from now on you lose any and all right to bitch about misspellings of &quot;aggro&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">04-07-2005, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a rogue, a warrior will beat me 3/4 times if he's arms spec'd.  I can stun and stealth from pallies all day long and usually end up winning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">04-09-2005, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those @$#%$#@% pallies. Why do they keep stepping on our toes in every mmorpg i play? They have 4/5 of our hp's, same weapon and defense skills, they have more Armor than warriors. They can hold aggro, tank bosses, the only thing they lack is the taunt button. They can heal a hella lot better than they did in EQ. They own PvP. Any joe shmoe playing his gimp pally can beat an above average warrior. In group situations pallies stack well. They can wear lightforge and will roll on valor too and being the whiny little bastards they are and because lightforge just sucks for warriors we cant return the favor. Not to mention weapons.<br />
<br />
Now tell me why would anyone want a warrior over a pally? Maybe things change at MC?<br />
<br />
that's the way it has been meant to be... agaisnt single encounters. but when it's time to tank multiple mobs and hold aggro on all of them, only warrior can do the job efficiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">04-09-2005, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, a little backwards on that!<br />
<br />
Against 5 or more mobs, a paladin produces far more aggro than us. They are the kings of AE aggro.<br />
<br />
Against 1-4 mobs, a paladin can't touch our aggro.</div></div><hr />

They are not meant to be &quot;the&quot; only main tank, a warrior will never be replaced in that regard. Untill such time as they gain more abilities to hold agro with they will not replace warriors.</div></div><hr />
