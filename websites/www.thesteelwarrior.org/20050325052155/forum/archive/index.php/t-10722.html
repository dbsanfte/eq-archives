<br />
We have tried one or two and we have some limited info to help us decide but our guild is working on hard on progressing with what I will call &quot;sub optimal attendance levels&quot; and picking and choosing our targets carefully can only help!<br />
<br />
Our experience of Trial of Corruption, while really fun, was that high raid numbers is important for it due to the sheer numbers of mobs at once near the end.<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: When we tried them originally we were sporting about 50ish in the same gear as I presume you're in.  We decided to push though and do txevu/tacvi and get our numbers up to above 54 every night so that we'ed be able to pick what we need and  run with it.</div></div><hr />

Its all about getting stuff slowed.<br />
Simon says depends on how well your ppl function during it. If they can go a long time before dying, then u can do it w/ 40s, if not well then have fun in that one.<br />
The other trials really depend on strat / gear/ classes imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure you can't do Foresight with 40ish. Since the encounter is designed for 54, even with 40 people in the zone, every time an emote is let out, its still going to be telling 54 people something, meaning, 14 people will get 2. If you try Foresight with less than 50, your asking for a wipe.<br />
<br />
Corruption is probably the easiest if your guild is good at offtanking. You can even have a rest period to med/rez before killing one wave and moving to another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a limit to how fast the emote can come and it is in theory possible to avoid every one of them even if you're the only person alive.<br />
<br />
In practice, you're most likely going to get nailed by Flashfire (Dragorn AEs) while dodging the arrows or vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when we were flagging for anguish, we had beat all of the trials with 35-40 ppl.  Some of those trials you can still beat with that many, but a few I would want closer to 50 for the likes of adaptation / hatred / and specialization now just because of his massive hp.  <br />
<br />
Foresight we beat with 34 dodging the emotes with that amount of people is easy long as everyone is paying attention., Corruption lowest was about the same amount of people.  Those are really the only two trials that you could prolly do with low numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">londo</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Corruption is pretty easy with low numbers especially if that includes a lot of tanks and clerics (especially with the extra arb from epic 1.5).  Endurance is also easy with low numbers with solid offtanks and healing.  Hate is really pretty easy with a good number of knights (preferably 6) and clerics with epics so that could be done with low numbers also.<br />
<br />
Specialization is very much sensitive to numbers and especially to cleric numbers.  Adaptation is just hard with any numbers and tactics gets much more difficult with low numbers, although having a full raid of idiots won't be any more effective than a small raid of competent people.</div></div><hr />

Ok we just tried to do this one, and had a mix of warriors and knights on the moms, and got about 50 pups, and wiped us in like 2 minutes.   :mad:   We killed 1 mother.  All clerics got eaten.  Only a few clerics have epics.  is that a key?  Knights on all a key?  not damaging moms a key?  a little help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Where is your CC? 50pups? You are definately doing something wrong. Think this is enough hint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our chanters were mezzing the Feebles, the pliants and the ferocious could not be mezzed, and the resists caused agro and that wiped the casters in the middle :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coroq</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Corruption is the easiest, always was and still is. Well I'm talking about the trial that's simulated pvp, think it's called corruption. There's no trick, it's just applying the skills you should have acquired in uqua: tanking a bunch of no-mez mobs rushing camp before all your healers die. Most wipe the 1st try but then figure out the order, then it's easy with 40ish or less once you really get it.<br />
<br />
Foresight, simon sez, is no longer easy. And don't believe the people who say gear doesn't matter in this trial. Great gear won't pull a raid through it, but it sure will give them lots more room for tiny errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our chanters were mezzing the Feebles, the pliants and the ferocious could not be mezzed, and the resists caused agro and that wiped the casters in the middle :(<br />
<br />
Right only Feebles can be mezzed, but then again why are you putting knights and wars on moms? This is last hint I can give you, do not want to spoil your fun.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pling</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Hatred the moms are rooted and do not summon, ie leave them alone until you have figured out everything else thats going on.<br />
<br />
Even though Pliable are charmable we oftank them; when slowed their dps isnt much. Thats way better than charm breaking and casters eaten before the free Pliable is controlled again, YMMW.<br />
<br />
Also, luck is a factor in Hatred; the more mezzable you got the easier it is. And as Pliable hit for 800 and Feros hit for 300 it's better to have as few Pliable as possible too (if you offtank em).<br />
<br />
Hatred is a farm trial when you got the tactic perfected, but it takes a lot of perceverance to figure out everything thats going on. Could be done with 40-45 non-anguish people if you have the correct classes (the biggest problem would be having enough dps to finish up all 6 Moms + Master before 60 min timer runs out).</div></div><hr />

We only had two warriors and I died to boss rampage at 50%. MT went down at about 25% from an 8000+ hit heh. We jsut WS'd and burned him down from 25%. After the amazingly ghetto win we got two of those fucking worthless shields. ARG :mad:</div></div><hr />

I don't know why people act like this is something you've to discover yourself, because I'm sure most people didn't find this out and just had some inside info (or read Cestus Dei's homepage).</div></div><hr />

What the hell do you mean you are sure? When we were doing the hate trial most of other uber guilds were doing the hate trial too. We learned the hate trial by hard way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 19 plate tanks total and are getting swarmed with seas and seas of adds.  Everything is getting locked down as they spawn, but about three minutes into the trial hordes and hordes of pups start spawning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Corruption - Doable with fewer numbers.  This is more about the raid focusing and prioritizing what class needs to die next.  If the raid is all over the place, then they will win.<br />
<br />
Endurance - Prolly doable with 45-50 as long as you have 3 clerics per tank.  It's no secret, the Ancients kill themselves, hence why it's called the trial of Endurance (~25 minute fight).  You can pump all the dps you want on the ancients, but it's not going to move their hp bar.  Focus on kill the adds (except for the defenders which are mezzable) and keeping your tanks alive and you're golden.  This, however, is a little harder than it sounds.  The Ancient's dps can be a little spikey at times, and the difficulty in this trial is really because the adds move almost faster than you can see them.  The second they pop, they're halfway across the room.  It's pretty stupid imho.<br />
<br />
Specialization - Depends on your progression.  If you're Txevu level and have beaten Noqufiel, then it's probably doable with slightly less than 50.  If you're like my guild who is just now realizing the importance of higher end GoD loot, it's 54 or nothing, and no we have still not beaten Spec yet.  Master of Specialization has a metric fuckton of hitpoints.  My guild is pretty dps heavy, and after 12 minutes he was still at 25%.  I'd guess he has upwards of 4 to 5 million hitpoints with some pretty crazy regen.<br />
<br />
Foresight - It's about the guild following directions.  The raid itself gets harder as more die off simply by design.  It always assigns tasks for 7 individuals at a time.  If more and more people are dieing off, there are fewer and fewer to assign the tasks to, and eventually it gets to the point where you're getting spammed with tasks left and right, and of course you die.  This trial would be easily doable with lower numbers, but you're optimally going to want a full raid (54) of no two boxes.<br />
<br />
Hatred - Control the ferans and you win /shrug<br />
<br />
Never attempted adaptation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">most people that got into anguish (if not all) pre dec-15 were well aware of the designers intentions with the hatred trial.  it's just that, their intentions werent necessarily doable with 3 warriors, 2 knights, and 40 people total.  Unless of course, each of those plate tanks was going to magically tank 4 mobs that hit for 1300 each and live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geeta</div><div class="date">03-24-2005, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">got a couple questions about the trial of hatred   if it in farm for you and you dont mind answering them pls PM me .  im not asking for full spoiler info just an answer to 2 questions.<br />
