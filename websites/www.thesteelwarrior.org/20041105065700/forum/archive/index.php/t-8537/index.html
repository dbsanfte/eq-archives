<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klopo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild will be hitting up aow soon.  I have seen him drop both the boc and helm at the same time many times when other guilds killed him.  so, incase this happens to us, i need to decide which i'd want.  The helm would give me a large jump in my ac and hp, but the boc would also give me 350 more hate per proc, so it is kind of a toss up for me.  I am the mt of my guild, and one of the top tanks for my alliance.  my guild is a family guild that raids once a week, so we will not be able to farm aow very effectively.  any opinions will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly if you are the guild's MT then you should get both (depending on how far behind you your current Tank line-up is).<br />
<br />
But, if not possible then I would still take the BoC.  The extra aggro added and additional dps it allows your group/raid to produce is &gt; than the 25 AC and 65 HP that the helm will give you at this point. <br />
<br />
Also, there are a few upgrades atm that you can get for the helm such as the Takish Helm or even Ornate. BoC, however, is not upgradeable at your current position.<br />
<br />
BoC + GBoS seems to be the win.<br />
<br />
edit: Additionally you will want to get into SSRA and start farming there if you are not already. If your family guild can take down AoW you shouldn't have too much trouble hitting up Cursed in SSRA. If you can get your hands on a BoC and BF combo you will be set until a BoW comes your way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">blade of carnage. you can augment a decent enough helm; even from LDoN's; but to get a weapon the caliber of a BoC isn't too easily done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd say BoC because it will resell for more and helms are certainly allot cheaper to obtain in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
<br />
the resale value on an item you got on a raid should never factor into your decision on what to go for. if someone sold their BoC when they upgraded it, and obtained the BoC in their current guild id expect them to be disbanded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you on this, however, if you were to loot one and then buy one it would be cheaper to loot the BoC and buy the HoRZ than it would be to loot the HoRZ and buy the BoC. Without being dishonorable to the guild, it is just simply more efficient to get the BoC if it is simply a choice to loot one or the other.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'd go for the BoC. The helm rocks, but as other people have said, you can get pretty good helms elsewhere, but you can't easily match the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After checking your magelo I would go for the hat first. It will be a much larger upgrade to you. chos and whatever the poi hammer is called is good enough aggro for what you are killing, and not far behind boc aggro if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You had said you wont be able to kill this guy often, so you might not be able to get more than one AoW loot. With that in mind I dont think you can make a &quot;wrong&quot; choice.  /agree Cimmar that your agro weaps are pretty nice atm and Helm might be bigger upgrade. Might make sense to hold off on BoC and save merit for a Ssra weap when you start doing that. Also, at 30ac 100hp his ring is nothing to scoff at either if neither the helm or BoC drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd rather have the ring than the helm personally but the ring is VERY rare.  My guild probably killed 15-20 AoWs back in the day and only saw 2 rings while RZ helms and BoCs were going to twinks and to the guild bank to sell for cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">BoC.<br />
<br />
While you could stand improving your AC/HP's, you have room to do this in several equipment and augment slots. In contrast to this, I can only think of 2 major aggro weapon upgrades in the near term for you - BoC or Bloodfrenzy.<br />
<br />
Armor upgrades are a lot less rare IMO than aggro weapon upgrades. It's more likely that at some point you would kick yourself for not getting a BoC when you could than lamenting that you didn't loot a helm.<br />

You can get a 100hp helm in LDoN with 2000 points. And thats using the cheap 25hp aug, it can be 115hp. Check my Magelo if you wanna see an example :).</div></div><hr />

selling gear that you got on a guild raid is a totally crappy thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">selling gear that you got on a guild raid is a totally crappy thing to do.<br />
<br />
this isnt &quot;selling for real life cash&quot; here. its selling for an upgrade. and selling to finance an upgrade is generally a smart thing to do. now you might argue that the boc is the end all of equipment (which it isnt by a longshot to any guild that would consider ornate to be junk). honestly i dont know why anyone but purchased twinks use a boc. they are fine weapons but hardly worth the price which is why i never bought one.<br />
<br />
suggesting that anyone trade raid loot for comparably priced gear of his choice, which at his judgement he wouldnt do unless he considered it a good trade, to be a &quot;guild offense&quot; is just another way of saying that your guild owns your character rather than you owning it yourself. is it any wonder the communal guild system has always left a bad taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
there is an obvious situation where i would agree that he should be forbidden to sell it. and that is if the boc is given to him without him having to pay raid points for it. then its understood to be a free loan independent of normal raid loot. it still smells of paternalism but an argument could be made that its still fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Equirs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Selling for an upgrade makes it right for you to sell off a loot you are awarded on a guild raid? What about the people who would actually use the BoC instead of selling it off? How do you think they would feel? A BoC gives great agro. <br />
<br />
The guild got you the loot buddy. You didn't earn it soloing, so in essense, it IS A guild offense for you to sell off a piece of loot you earn without at least holding onto it for a year or two or consulting with an officer. And once you got an upgrade to your BoC, it should be handed down, or returned to the guildbank.  It was guild effort that got you it, everyone put time into it. <br />
<br />
By your logic, it also implies that a cleric, or god help me a wizard,  in the raid has every right to put in DKP points or ask to be awarded it because it might buy them gear upgrades. How would any warrior in that raid feel? To be perfectly frank, if you want a BoC to sell, do a guild greed raid or join an open raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Equirs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Get this: the BoC can continue to benefit the guild as long as there are warriors who need it.  Converting the BoC into almost any other item will result in a comparative loss of value over time (if it's tradeable), or in the case of a no-drop item like ornate, a total loss of value.<br />
<br />
And this is a better argument :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">BoC without any doubt.<br />
<br />
Warrior value is in hate generation. You have two slots to fill only that will generate Hate. You have a bunch of other slots for AC/HP and what not.<br />
<br />
All yur consideration should be primary or 2H and then secondary if yur not going 2H, before any other slot.<br />
<br />
BoC is a fine Hate Proc weapon and probably like 100-300 more hate then the CHoS or whatever. <br />
<br />
I offhand a BoC (with my OSoW in mainhand), both have AngerIII, I have good hate generation (9.75 procs per minute of 400-500 hate and two 600 hate and one 700 hate). <br />
<br />
And as pointed out the BoC is worth 250K the HoRZ is worth 100K..... <br />
<br />
There is really no question here.</div></div><hr />

first of all this  &quot;the guild got you the loot buddy&quot; type talk is pretty immature. and what about loot i get in groups? &quot;the group got you the loot buddy&quot; right? get a clue jerk. if i spend months of my time with a guild jumping when they say jump and missing work when they say miss work dont you tell me how lucky i am to be blessed the the benevolence of this wonderful guild which is doing so darned much selflessly for my sake. i earn my keep in any group or guild im in.<br />
<br />
if a guild wants to have a rule that everything belongs to the guildleader then they better advertise their paternalistic greed to me before i join. and i wont join. some of you will because you dont know how to advance your character without others to lean on.<br />
<br />
de ja vu. i have flashbacks. i remember what a friend told me. he was a very advanced guild and he was always flat broke. i loaned him a ton of cash that he never payed back. i asked him once why he was so broke if he was in such a good guild. he said because the guildleader doesnt give money to the members for their raids. he saves it for when someone needs something. i asked him what the leader does with all the tradeable loot that is not needed because it was made obsolete through upgrades. he said &quot;it all gets stored in the bank for new members.&quot; i asked how much was stored. it was enough to equip close to a hundred characters. i asked him how much cash the guildleader was hoarding and he said &quot;about 30 million plat.<br />
<br />
30 million plat.<br />
<br />
wake up.<br />
<br />
you are being ripped off by your guildleaders. both your life and your game.<br />
<br />
but you cannot see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
well i have an announcement to make. im fed up with eq. im fed up with the vice of not being able to say no to logging on. im fed up with sony marketing the game first and formost to fanatical powergamers with the latest in hardware and a savvy knowledge of how to tweek their machines. im fed up with the guilds who rip off their members and hoard enough cash for every single member to be given 300000pp in cash. im fed up with all the crashing. im fed up with 5 year old bugs that no one seems to have any inclination to fix. im fed up with developer staff telling me &quot;maybe you should try reinstalling your motherboard drivers&quot; because THEY cant get it right. im fed up with guildleaders saying in their MOTD that anyone who does not join the raid this coming wednesday will be disbanded regardless of reason, regardless of seniority, regardless of performance. im fed up with guildleaders demanding i give them my password. im fed up with GM's refusing to take harsh action on guilds that train and ks other guilds repeatedly.<br />
<br />
im tired of the whole thing.<br />
<br />
and im especially tired of people telling me that if i win a roll on something in the guild or buy it with dkp that i dont own it - that it's owned by the guildleader.<br />
<br />
i havent played in 9 days. i really havent missed it. and here's why...<br />
<br />
we go to halls of honor and invis up to a camp. we pull one. we kill it. we pull one. we kill it. we pull one. we kill it. we pull one. we kill it. we pull one ....<br />
<br />
sound boring yet? there are no adds. there are no roamers anywhere near. i can go afk all day long and i will not die. i have a fighting chance of not dying for hours even if another group decides to pull while im standing there in the middle of it all.<br />
<br />
the game has lost its original charm. west commons and oasis were challenging. the new content stinks.<br />
<br />
all this raiding stuff is nothing but self pride. the pride of wearing 200hp armor that you could have won just as easily if you were drunk out of your mind. because you are relying on your guild and not your own skill.<br />
<br />
goodbye to all of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
as for the next argument that you make which is that most everything will lose value over time but the boc wont. this is just plain wrong. the boc is only slightly better than a copper hammer which is worth 5k. this means that all sony has to do is add a new tradeskill 1h aggro weapon a little better than the copper hammer and that boc will drop to 10k in less than a year. and your worthy guildleader will be hoarding the guild stock of them (yes in the guildbank because all the members have the 15k tradeskill item already) through that entire plummet in price and sell them for 10k each.<br />
<br />
and they will learn nothing from it. because ive seen them do it before and they learned nothing before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
35 more hitpoints than a copper hammer. no doubt offhanded because even a gbos is better in main hand. copper hammer has 65hp and is 13/20 but dps is like a 14/20 because of damage proc. boc is 15/20. offhanded total dps increase is less than 2 percent. and all this for a 300-500k weapon? thats an insane price for an item that adds 2 percent to total dps 35hp and a pretty small amount of agro increase over the copper hammer. i think the cult of boc worshipers needs to come down to earth.</div></div><hr />

Then get lost and stop posting on the forums dedicated to a game you hate. I will stand by 'the guild got you the loot'. You done your share, but what makes it that the other odd 40-50 or hell, 71 people in your raid less important then you? 5 points of DKP? 30 points of DKP? 120 points of DKP? You would spend your dkp points on a weapon you don't need, to sell at a price you don't think its worth, for an upgrade that would get replaced easily by the 90 dkp you have left over? <br />
<br />
I'm not precisely sure about the point your making with your friend... It would be nice if the guild pays us dividneds of maybe 300 plats every end of the raid. Would be nice if all tradable loot got sold off and all the members in the guild get a fair share of the profits, is that what you are saying? Allright...it would be nice... Now, how do you feel, if a rogue you know that frequently AFKs during trash clearing get part of the share? How would you feel that wizards who sit on their asses for 50% of a mob HP doing jackshit get part of that share? How would you if any of that situation goes that way? You claim you pull your share in a raid, fair enough. What if someone else doesn't? No real fair way to distrubite plat gain on a raid. <br />
<br />
I feel sorry that you feel your guild leader screwed you over. I feel even sorrier for you that your guild would ask you to miss work. (Of course, if you joined a guild that clashes with your work schedual, I feel sorrier for your intelligence) <br />
<br />
Actually I'm going to stop saying anything else in regard to your post. Basically you feel Everquest fucked you in the ass without lube. Nice sob story buddy, it does make me feel sorry for you.</div></div><hr />

LoLZoRs! The BoC is hands down better. 15sta, 9dex, 65HP... better. <br />

The CHoS might give 450-550 hate as a wild guess whereas the BoC is a solid 700 hate proc. Given the weapon is used mainly for Hate generation seems to me the BoC is a clear winnar.<br />

<br />
just because you know 1 or two shitbag guild leaders doesnt mean all of them are like that. any guild that doesnt pay people back for components used on a raid sucks too. not everyone is like your warped view of EQ.<br />
<br />
and yes the BoC is alot better than the CHoS but the CHoS is a much more economic buy. 300-500k is pretty extreme for a BoC and that takes away from its overall efficency. but if you were to have a chance at a BoC or a CHoS to pick one for free, youd be idiotic to pic the CHoS</div></div><hr />

You can only expect an organization to treat you with dignity if you extend dignity toward others yourself.  This is not an EQ issue, it's a values issue. :) <br />

You want guilds to be up front about their policies about loot ownership.  Now be up front about your own policy about loot ownership, and see how many guilds want you in their membership.  Not all guilds hoard 100 chars / 30 million plat and treat their members like crap.  And whether they do or not, that has nothing to do with whether you feel it is &quot;right&quot; to offer tradeable gear back to the guild when you leave it.<br />
<br />
As for the worth of a BoC falling over time at the same rate as other gear, there is only one thing that will devalue the BoC, and that is an equivalent or superior tradeable weapon becoming widely available in OoW.</div></div><hr />

the boc is only slightly better than a copper hammer which is worth 5k. <br />

LoLZoRs! The BoC is hands down better. 15sta, 9dex, 65HP... better. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
15sta, 15str, 15dex ... useless to anyone in a guild where as was previously mentioned in this thread &quot;ornate would be junk&quot;. you KNOW such person already has these three stats maxed right? ( /tangent .. bazaar twinks dont have all 3 stats maxed so they benefit more). the main ones that make a difference are<br />
<br />
1) boc has 35 more hp. (big whoop de do...)<br />
2) boc has about 250 more hate.<br />
3) boc has a marginally better ratio (15/20 and no damage on proc compared to 13/20 with a high damage proc for hammer).<br />
<br />
weight of the weapon is meaningless. my warrior has never been encumbered with less than 3000 plat on him. the resists are of debatable value and on magic resist which is the most important the hammer wins.<br />
<br />
in order to get the most of your extra 250 hate you have to mainhand the boc. suppose you had a gbos (14/18 with dd proc) in the mainhand which is now forced into the secondary to make room for the boc. you lose a ton of dps making that switch and so lose any dps advantage you would have had with gbos primary and chos secondary. this is why if i had a boc i would likely most often offhand it. the 250 raw hate advantage is like a 175 hate equivalent advantage for offhanded weapons.<br />
<br />
conclusion of the matter. the boc is better. but nothing worth elevating it to god status over. its &quot;a little bit better&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Interisting conclusion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">you only need the agro for raid mobs. so i stick to my argument of offhanding the boc &quot;most of the time&quot;.<br />
<br />
ahh .. you have a boc. no wonder you so religiously worship them.<br />
<br />
back of envelope dps comparison is now in. i come up with:<br />
<br />
compared to gbos main and chos secondary:<br />
<br />
boc main and gbos secondary dps shows 3 1/2 percent loss on common blue mobs worse on red cons.<br />
boc secondary gbos main dps shows 1 1/2 percent gain.<br />
<br />
loss of agro from offhanding the boc compared to mainhanding it about 75 hate per 30 seconds. some of the lost hate however is made up for by the increased dps.<br />
<br />
bottom line. exp groups get the boc in the offhand; raid targets get it mainhanded.<br />
<br />
assumtions for calculations (which could be way off) are:<br />
1) secondary hits 65 percent as often as main and procs 65 percent as often.<br />
2) gbos/chos combo gets half of all agro from dps.<br />
3) all weapons assumed to be anger III auged.<br />
4) assuming 700hate on boc 450 on chos proc and 500 on anger III (it was my best guess).<br />
5) assuming damage due to damage bonus comparable to base damage on a dmg13 weapon. on blue mobs base damage probably more important. on raid targets probably less. but the dps ratios between the 3 setups are only modestly sensitive to that relationship.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">First, if you run a parser I you'll find that you dual wield a lot more often than 65%.

Third, how do you come up with &quot;loss of agro from offhanding the boc compared to mainhanding it about 75 hate per 30 seconds&quot;?  As I recall from the Safehouse combat experiments, it was shown that weapons proc half as often in the offhand as in the mainhand.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Well, Rysingsun is right on a couple points, and wrong on another.<br />
<br />
First of all, no matter how much you don't want to believe it, the BoC IS NOT 400kpp better than a copper hammer.  <br />
<br />
My stats are maxed, they're always maxed when I'm in combat due to avatar.  Anyone who can get a BoC should be in the same situation.  Stat difference?  35hp.<br />
<br />
Copper hammer mainhand, with WA5 and Ingeunity 3 = 10DPS to proc damage on non MR mobs (come fuckin on..with Malos and Tash and whatever the fuck the bard is doing, I can't remember the last time I saw a resist).  Does 15/20 beat 13/20 by 10dps?  I highly fucking doubt it.<br />
<br />
Hate generation -- Logic around here seems to call stuns 450 hate.  I don't honestly believe that there is a 250 hate difference between Stun and EB.  Stun locks aggro thru a slow, EB locks aggro thru a slow.  Both locks aggro thru a snare.  What exactly are the extra 200 points of hate getting you anyway?  That's right, jack and shit 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
A lot of people paid a lot of money, or spent a lot of time drooling over the blade of carnage and their perception is skewed.  It's the same thing with the epic.  So many people are so captivated by the weapon itself that they refuse to see any flaw in it.  It's simply not true.  The blade of carnage is a fine weapon, but it's not worth the price tag it carries.  <br />
<br />
However --<br />
<br />
you are being ripped off by your guildleaders. both your life and your game. <br />
<br />
This is something that sounds like it came from me.  It's a pretty cynical view of the world.  I ran a small (10 or 12) guild and even tho I ran all the raids and dealt with all the bullshit, I never once assumed I owned any loot I got for the guild.  However, if any one of those motherfuckers thought for 1 second that they were selling off a piece of loot that we got for them, without first checking to see if it could be passed down to someone else inside the guild, they were getting the fucking boot right then and there.  You do not take items that 6-12 people (or more) worked for and use it for your own personal profit unless you have the express consent of those people.  Anything else is complete jackassery and not tolerated in most social circles.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry your guild leader was a plat whore.  There are indeed plenty of those around too.  But to characterize all of them that way is definitely incorrect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This differs from individual to individual.<br />
400K PP means more to some than to others.<br />
I look strictly at the weapon.<br />
<br />
Plat loses value as you aquire items and cap tribute, but BoC is definatly not the budget weapon by any means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Plat loses value as you aquire items and cap tribute <br />
<br />
Not true.  Platinum, just like real world money, wanes and waxes with the times.<br />
<br />
Right before and into the first months into a new expansion, platinum becomes very valuable.  As we near the end of one (like now), it becomes less useful since people have what they need that is currently purchasable.<br />
<br />
The value of platinum will rise again here in a couple months.  Will the BoC finally be overthrown, and your 400k investment tossed into the crapper by an easily equivilent small group obtainable weapon?  Greatblade of storms is fucking close....I think it's gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'll say it again since I just got done with an XP session with the Chanter twink, where I was trying to use his pet for some additional DPS.  Stun locks aggro thru the debuff portion of combat.  There is no way in hell I can get that mob on to the chanter if i proc from either one of my weapons before I tash to draw aggro.  I can tash, I can slow, I can nuke, I can sit down...that mob will not budge off Haass.  What is the benefit of Enraging Blow that you're getting above and beyond that exactly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I am not sure that your back of the envelope conclusion means much.<br />
<br />
<br />
ok you say anger III is 600 hate not 500? then the 700 hate of eb (boc) is less significant than my analysis suggested. you say secondary procs more than 65%? ok then there is more proc hate being generated by secondary than my analysis suggested and this again means the boc in primary has added less percentage agro than what i had come up with (but more in secondary).<br />
<br />
also if we go by haass' analysis of proc damage on the chos/gbos then there is actually a dps LOSS with boc in secondary and a MAJOR loss of dps with it in primary. so perhaps my analysis made the boc look too good after all.<br />
<br />
you see sass i wasnt deliberately skewing the numbers to give me the outcome i desired. <br />
<br />
anyway if you dont like my analysis give us something better.</div></div><hr />

I agree, Haass, and I didn't buy one or own one so my perception isn't skewed by that.<br />
<br />
My point is simply that, there is nothing better to buy at this time, the BoC is the last weapon you will buy with platinum, and therefore it is worth whatever you pay for it.  Once you've bought the BoC, your remaining platinum is useless (in terms of weapons and aggro).</div></div><hr />

I'll agree with this.  If you have the plat in the bank and there is nothing else for you to buy, then there's no reason not to buy a BoC.  It's better than anything else you can get.  If you are someone that gets their armor upgrades in the bazaar then your money is probably better spent elsewhere. <br />
<br />
Off Topic babbling inc:<br />
<br />
Maybe my perspective is skewed from playing on test where there isn't much to buy in the bazaar, but I don't understand these uberguild players with 2 million plat in the bank if they don't sell their plat to Yantis, and trust me there are tons of these people.  I am by no means uber, and I have 20k in the bank that I made absolutely no effort to obtain.  Any exp group drops I get I either give to somebody that can use it or turn in for tribute.  I haven't had a bazaar vendor up in 9 months (and I have plenty of stuff I could sell, 3 or 4 dragon haste items, Tormax loot, etc.) but above and beyond what it takes to keep my cleric bot in peridots and me in Halas meat pies, I have no use for plat, and every cent in my bank is built up surplus from exp group splits and selling gems and such to vendors.  I don't get why uber guild people would take the time to farm Tormax or velium gemmed weapons or whatever to sell in the bazaar when there is nothing to buy.  Even maxing your tradeskills takes maybe 1-200k, so why build up millions in plat?  I don't get it.<br />
<br />
If somebody handed me 1 million plat today, I would dump every cent of it in the casino trying to get a dark elf mask.  Just because I can't think of anything better to do with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the trends that expansions have been following, even if there is a better aggro weapon that is non-raid obtainable in OoW, it won't be droppable. So even if it devalues a bunch by some new no-drop weapon, there still won't be another weapon to spend your plat on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Well is it 400K more valuable, I doubt that a lot. But thats not really the point. You pay 5K for CHoS and when your done with it you sell if for 5K. If you are bazzar savvy you pay 250K for BoC and if you know what yur doing you sell if for 300K when you are done with it. <br />
<br />
Well 15Sta 9dex and 35HP is nice if you are not maxed.... <br />
<br />
I offhand the BoC (with A3) and mainhand a OSoW (with A3) and with WA5 I have 9.75 procs per minute of hate. <br />
<br />
If the CHoS has say 500 Hate then the OSoW should also ... <br />
<br />
Offhand procs at 1.0 times per minute, without wa5, and its no matter how many times you hit or swing or whatever.<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7390&amp;highlight=9.75<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway with WA5 you get 1.5ppm from the CHoS or the BoC. Say a 200 Hate difference. You have 300 more hate every minute with the BoC in the offhand, and double that in the mainhand. Worth 400K - no. Better - Yes. A lot better - well if you save a wipe once a week cause of yur 300 more hate per mintue I would call that a lot better.<br />
<br />
And mainhanded you have 600 more hate per minute, assuming WA5, thats not insubstaintial in anyone's book I dont think.<br />
<br />
The damage proc on the CHoS is not going to be greater then the extra DPS on the BoC ratio so I just ignor their hate values....</div></div><hr />

point well taken.<br />
<br />
it's true  if...<br />
<br />
1) you leave enough plat for the next expansion<br />
2) you have all the important tribute going at all the important times.<br />
3) your important alts are well equipped too.<br />
<br />
for an amazing number of people all three are true.  for many numbers 2 and 3 are not. this is a matter of personal preference. i personally am too worried about the price dropping through the floor with the next expansion to risk it. but for others it still may be a valid argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I for one am simply shocked.  I was informed, on this very board in fact, that uberguilders need to farm platinum for their various activities by bottomfeeding and killing off all the content they can.  In fact, if I understand correctly, this only provides them with the minimum amount of plat required to buy food...they can't even upgrade their gear with that money.<br />
<br />
No longer will I chastise time geared players for killing Gorenaire and selling me a white dragon scale.  They clearly need the money more than I do.</div></div><hr />

For some people, it's a measure of E-Penis size. And, of course, there's the cozy feeling of 'Gee, I could buy anything I want, ever.' I don't have much use for money right now besides gearing up my cleric and my warrior, but, I can't say I don't like having a big bank account.</div></div><hr />
