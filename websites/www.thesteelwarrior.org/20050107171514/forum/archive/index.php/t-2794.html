I want to make sure I make the right one and want to hear some opinions from you guys. Any input would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you looking for aggro , dps or ?  If you want something decent aggro wise with proc GBoS with a nice offhand.  GoS4W is a nice amount of DPS due to the ratio.  I wouldn't trust tanking with it in raids due to the fact it's just dps.  Either weapon will be nice when you get it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on your preferance.  What do you prefer wielding, 2h or 1h?  GSo4W is actually a great aggro weapon with good dps.  I use it exclusively for all my tanking (even def / evasive) with no issues.  If you have a very good 1h to pair with the GBoS then that route works also.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2h all the way. significantly more dps in xp groups and 6 or so seconds solo with any raid mob and you are golden.  agro problems in xp groups are way overblown imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the GSo4W.  <br />
<br />
The dps of this weapon is phenominal.  I parsed 113dps against Master of the Guard and usually average 110dps (100dps tanking) against BoT mobs.  That's not including the procs which my parser doesn't pick up, and this weapon procs its 75dd constantly.  Mind you, I have no offensive AA. :)<br />
<br />
Because of the extremely high dps nature of this weapon, the agro is great as well.  While it doesn't generate as much agro over time as two EB/Stun weapons, it does generate agro faster and far more consistantly.  Think about it, you're not relying on procs.  This makes the GSo4W extremely useful for trash clearing since you can grab and hold agro very quickly, not to mention give fellow melee a good run for their money in the dps department.<br />
<br />
While I'm still looking for a second EB/Stun weapon for boss tanking, I've had huge success wielding the GSo4W.  You won't even be able to pry this pear stick from my dead fingers. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a reason you can only have 1? Both drop pretty regularly and are pretty farmable. If possible, I would try to get both and sell your SoD to buy a ton of upgrades. I don't know about your server, but on my server you could get a Helm of Rz, Mith gaunts, mith boots, 2x mosquito leg ears, ornate arms, and forged shoulderpads for what you can get for an SoD these days. Those upgrades would do a lot more for you than what ever difference in agro you will experience when switching from an SoD to a GBoS or a GSo4W.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For that matter, GBoS &gt; SoD as well. Better ratio, better stun on the proc, better stats. SoD is not an overrated weapon with the choices available today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the procrate on GBoS come even close to a SoD? I had none yet, but most weapons that were called &quot;mini SoDs etc&quot; inclduing myself, are FAR behind the SoD due to the fact that SoD procs three times as often</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have yet to see a parse that shows an SoD has 3x the proc rate of any weapon. Even so, it would have to have that kind of an increased proc rate to keep up with the sheer DPS advantage a GBoS has. It's really a no brainer - 14/18 &gt; 12/18.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I almost always use Go4W in xp groups or raids when not MT.  When I am MT I use either GoT or GBoS/CHoS combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well with SoD and CHoS you already have a decent taunt combo.  GBoS is better than both of those weapons, but I think that the GSo4w is a bigger upgrade overall for you.  But really BoT mobs are easy to farm I dont see how you won't get both eventually</div></div><hr />

ST is farmed on Stromm, plenty of SoD around already... they do proc like mad.</div></div><hr />

ST is farmed on Stromm, plenty of SoD around already... they do proc like mad.  I am not disputing that there are plenty of SoDs around or that they can be farmed on SH. I could have an SoD if I wanted one, but until I see a parse showing that it has a proc rate significantly higher - like 2-3x more than a GBoS,  then it's just an overrated weapon with a ridiculous price due to its rarity on most servers.<br />
<br />
People complain/praise the proc rates of lots of weapons, but when you actually parse proc rates you'll find that even weapons with noticable differences like BoC vs. BF, the proc rate is not nearly as different as you think. If the proc rate of an SoD was really 3x that of other weapons with a somewhat standard 2 procs/min that most weapons seem to hover around then you would see considerably higher DPS numbers than most SoD parses suggest. If an SoD parses out at around 2 procs/min, the procs would account for about 9-10 DPS, which most parses I have seen support this. If it really proc'd 3x as much and was doing 6 procs/min then the proc by itself would account for 27-30 DPS, which would make an SoD an incredible DPS machine, which the parses do not show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me 1h-ers are toys, yet I managed to get a GBoS recently on a raid cuz no one else wanted it and I must admit its aggro is awesome. Paired with a Copper Hammer of striking (bad dps but same wonderful proc) its damned hard to shift aggro off me - easily hold off a BoC/CHSD combo. <br />
<br />
However my first desire and first loot from BoT was the GSo4W and that is what I wield for any fight that counts. Its more dps that those two and I hold aggro extremely well with it (and max offensive aa's).<br />
<br />
Get the Staff, there's not really a 2h-er in the same level of the game to compare to it for a warrior. There's numerous weapons with similar abilities to the sword (BoC, BF, HG, Emp Sword etc) that a guild doing BoT raids can get and sooner or later you will get one - although by that time I hope you'll be converted to 2h-ers and be looting it just for kicks like me!</div></div><hr />
