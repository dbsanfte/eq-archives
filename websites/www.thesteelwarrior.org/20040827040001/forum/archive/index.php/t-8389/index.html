<br />
You think you're gonna be ready for everything that happens if you've played Doom 1/2/final doom, but you're really not. Every time, you know something bad is gonna happen, so you try to prepare, but you're caught off guard anyway.<br />
<br />
Like this ---  how the hell are you supposed to headshot a headless zombie?<br />
<br />
Man this fucking game is creepy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes very errie game.  Takes a monster of a machine to run though.  But I love it when the lights just GO OUT and your filpping through to find the flash light and you turn it on and BLAM there's evil nastees in your face.<br />
<br />
Good game.  Hope HalfLife2 is better !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doom3 is evil.<br />
I expected an amazing graphics engine + a nice game to show its performance but it has some nice ideas (the PDA, useable &quot;computers, flashlight OR weapon, ...) and the atmosphere is just amazing. If you love to get the shit scared out of you, its the perfect game for you. One means of ID was to make it so goddamn DARK. Since you cannot use the flashlight AND a weapon at once (thats evil btw :/) you either run into some beast and have to pull your gun or walk with your gun ready to fire but you probably just see some glowing eyes in the dark or hear strange scary sounds that are anywhere anyway. Almost all rooms or hallways have dark corners you can't see and in which often either goodies or mobs wait for you. That and stuff like teleporting mobs keep your stress level up all the time. <br />
Some of the scripted scenes are very cool too, like: (little SPOILER inc ;p)  You are in a room which has a heavy door and bullet proof glass next to the door. Now a heavy monster enters the room as you see trough the glass. It recognizes you and starts to bash the armored door several times. The door gets deformed more and more, its almost broken and you prepare to send some lead trough it. You hear the beast backing off to make its final breaktrough trough the door. What happens? instead of breaking trough the door, it jumps back and jumps trough the glass window in one second, surprising you quite a bit :p.</div></div><hr />

really really wanna give this a go. biggest complaints I've heard so far are: relatively few multiplayer maps, conehead humans during cutscenes, and too-quick disaster scenario. not bad.</div></div><hr />

Ditto, only I've got half the ram.  When SoE says that their game won't run to it's fullest extent on today's systems, they mean they don't know how to code.  When Carmack + Co tell you, it means their game fucking RULES.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking of picking up an ATI Radeon 9800 pro, but Im not too familiar with the GeForce cards that are out lately.  Plus I dont want to spend more than $160 if I can help it.  I know Doom3 takes a LOT of hardware to run.</div></div><hr />

yah that was my point =D the game is pretty awesome if those are the biggest gripes.<br />

also just a general fyi, Doom 3 was originally developed as a SP-only game.</div></div><hr />

You obviously do not remember the mass ownage dealt out by the plasma rifle in Doom 1.  The ownage is definitely recreated in D3. <br />

But that was on my friends AMD 2800+, 1gig ram, 128mb 9600 XT and it doesn't play as well on my 1.5GHz P4, 512ram, 128mb GeForce 5600 Ultra so I'm hoping someone can post links to those tweak sites as well..</div></div><hr />

<br />
try this :<br />
<br />
in the &quot;DoomConfig.cfg&quot;, lines : <br />
<br />
seta image_cacheMegs &quot;xx&quot; <br />
seta image_cacheMinK &quot;xx&quot; <br />
<br />
put 256 (try 96 or 128 if you have 521mo ) et 300, so to end with <br />
<br />
seta image_cacheMegs &quot;256&quot; <br />
seta image_cacheMinK &quot;300&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
you can then compare the results with the on-screen dps :<br />
still in the same file, find the line &quot;seta com_showFPS&quot; and put 1 instead of 0</div></div><hr />

<br />
With mirrors you will see the mole on your left cheek end up on the right cheek of your reflection, the same goes for the room, the door on the left will reflect as the door on the right.<br />
<br />
The error they made was they had the player reflection right, but the left door was reflecting as left, which is impossible to do at any angle but straight on, yet if you walk to the right side of the mirror and look along it parralell you see the left door reflecting, even tho the left door and the doppleganer door are DIRECTLY infront of you now, meaning that reflection is impossible.<br />

thats what it says so far, not sure if that has my video card or not, so far ive heard that doom3 only needs 300 RAM which puts me definately at enough there, only worried about my video card. when we ordered the dell 1.5 years ago i got the upgraded video card, not the standard one, but still not sure where to look for that.</div></div><hr />

Go to hardware tab, open Device Manager.  Click on your display adapter and it will tell you there.<br />
<br />
You're probably fine for D3 if you've got a decent vid card.  Just make sure the drivers are the newest ones available.  You won't be running on High graphics, but it doesn't fuckin matter, the game looks incredible on Low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the MX line is the value or business line from Nvidia and the 420 is the bottom of the lot of those.  It isn't going to play games like Doom 3 well if at all.<br />
<br />
You can pick up Ati 9800 Pro or Nvidia 5700 for under 150 bucks these days, those are both very descent gaming cards.</div></div><hr />

Running at 640x480 to get a nice smooth framerate and I have all the bells and whistles turned on minus any anti-aliasing.  It will run decent at 800x600 but not as smooth as I'd like - especially during those times when things are going to hell.  The games looks suprising good at 640x480 though - I'm impressed, what a ride so far!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, finally beat the game and got to come back to the mirror.  You're wrong dude, I dunno what the fuck you're talking about, but the left/right orientation is dead on.  In the first restroom, look at the no smoking sign on the wall and look at it in the mirror...it's perfect.<br />

Seriously bro, 640x480 looks DAMNED fucking good in this game.  It's not like other games.  The game will look incredible, and you'll be happy with it. Trust me.</div></div><hr />
