I tried to use it with /disc fortitude and although I didn't take damage I dont think I was in the right position to help the shielded player.  <br />
<br />
Should I pause befor /disc fort?<br />
<br />
Should I stand right next to or in between the shieled player and mob?<br />
<br />
Taunt like crazy when doing this or save it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashurr</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it sometimes after the main tank gets rezzed and needs a few secs before defensive pops.  Besides, its fun to get hit for 800 by AoW using /shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless they changed it, you cannot use a discipline and /shield at the same time. As for its use, I wouldn't get too excited, generally the time required to target a caster and use /shield is more than the time it'd take to taunt the mob off.<br />
<br />
Most people use the command: /assist /shield /assist<br />
using this with the mob targetted will switch to the caster he's agro on and back to the mob. But generally it's not worth it as the command usually gets bugged up due to lag. Aslong as you're within melee range of the caster you're shielding it will mitigate his damage, so just be close to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a nice hotkey setup, I had been using<br />
<br />
/tar player_name<br />
/shield player_name<br />
/assist other_melee<br />
<br />
Can you attack while /shielding? For some reason my in-game hotkey has /attack on at the end and I don't know why I put it there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoar</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use this <br />
I start by F# key to target silk wearing caster manually, then... <br />
<br />
/shield <br />
/g I am shielding %t pls stay cloes to me<br />
/assist <br />
<br />
since I dont turn of attack once I assit said caster Im back to atacking, only glitch is if ENCH is mezzing the add I hit the mezzed :p  but I hit attack off easy also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an easy set-up I use in xp groups. I have 2 hotkeys &quot;SHLD SLO&quot; and &quot;SHLD CLE&quot;. The 1st has /shield &lt;slower's name&gt; and the second has /shield &lt;healers' name&gt;. It's a simple matter to change the names as your groups change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont like /ass /shield /ass hotkeys for a few reasons. Mostly, I dont like stop attacking my target. I simply type /sh xxx where thts the first couple letters of the person who I see gets summoned or I know has aggro. In XP groups I just make a /sh slowername hotkey and hit that if slow is resisted, he gets aggro, and taunt fails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found the most useful purpose of Shield, a prank =)<br />
<br />
One time Tima came by with her BoW, being all kick ass, and while they were going through a proc drought, I /shielded her.  It's a great tool for making a good laugh.<br />
<br />
Also, someone mentioned using it to /shield a Knight to show them who the boss is.  I'll have to try that one time =)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I use mine /shield Slower's name.  Groups I'm in are amazed to see it used, and how effective it is keeping the slower alive.  I use it right after slow with a failed taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlea</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have any complicated strategy for disc.<br />
<br />
I have a disc hotkey, simply saying /disc (name). When I'm in a group I pick the person which will most likely get aggro over me (normally the slower) and insert his name in the hotkey. <br />
<br />
Whenever he aggroes I use /disc.<br />
<br />
Voila.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shield soandso is far superior to doing an /assist /shield but you might not have enough macros to do this in a raid setting.  The advantage of /shield soandso is obvious.  You don't lose your round on the mob (which does matter), and you make sure you're only shielding the ones who really need it, whereas /assist /shield sometimes gets useless targets (i.e. some cleric got summoned, you hit your macro, but another warrior already taunted it off, so you're now shielding another warrior).  <br />
<br />
Of course, /assist /shield is much easier to do.  Just hit the button when it looks like something's wrong and you'll probably get a good target to /shield 50% or more of the time anyway (though not necessarily the best ones).<br />
<br />
If you can type fast enough for /shield soandso or have the macro room to do it, there's no reason to do it any other way.  You get a shield on exactly who you want without losing your target.  Can't really do better than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I make use of the new targetting function (swap back to previous target) I have it mapped to my minus key with /assist command on button 9 /shield command on button 10 in the hotbutton bank.<br />
In a pinch you can then target mob then hit 9, 10, minus to return to attacking the target - saves the problem of the shielded individual who isn't targetting the mob that's hitting him... in a basic group situation there is some merit in just setting up straight hotkeys though.<br />
