<br />
so my advice won't be:<br />
1. lvl as fast as possible to lvl56 to make the CHoS proc<br />
2. put it in main<br />
3. find any other procing weapon (but not a stupid 2/40 with 20HP lifetap :) ) and put it in offhand (you can buy a BoC for main or a SotBfor off).<br />
<br />
zone advice :<br />
you are hunting ssra and keal : perfect there is BoC, BF, BBotE, Hategiver that are drop from theese (the three last from ssra) zone and that all fit in the top 10 of 1Her aggro weapon and that start to proc before lvl55.<br />
<br />
Have fun,<br />
