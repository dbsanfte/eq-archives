<br />
Chain taunting is a bad idea as noted above, also disarm does all of jack shit for aggro imo, I'd just stick to kicking seperately unless your trying to work the skills up still.<br />
<br />
you still benefit by taunting when mob is facing you b/c aggro is modified by range for people not in melee<br />
you can still gain aggro based on your casters aggro totals(and more aggro is good thing)<br />
<br />
simple test is this:<br />
pull a mob hit it few times for a few dmg,punch whatever<br />
have a wizard blow a 3k nuke into it from max range w/ focus ~220 or so<br />
watch the mob stick to the tank<br />
have wizard get into melee range and see mob turn<br />
this proves the wizard has more aggro,but mob was still facing the tank,and the wizard didnt get summoned<br />
<br />
repeat process but get a sucessful taunt before wizard approaches mob<br />
watch mob NOT turn to the wizard under same conditions<br />
this proves that you taunted,While the mob was facing you,and Gained aggro(which clearly Disproves that taunting while mob is facing you does not gain aggro)<br />
<br />
the myth about never taunting when your tanking is just plain wrong, you can be tanking and a caster can have 20k extra pts of aggro you could have with a single touch of a button,but some tanks still Refuse to taunt when they &quot;Think&quot; they are on top of the aggro list</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
nothing have been immune to taunt for like 5-6 months,it moved from max level tauntable only by a warrior<br />
To a modified skill check based on taunt skill,player level, mob level,and zone modifier<br />
<br />
The range modifier on most normal mob is utterly insignificant.  <br />
<br />
that is part of the myth that is continueing this huge error,its not true<br />
<br />
<br />
Once a while you get an exception, but realistically there is no reason to taunt when you're at the top of aggro unless the mob was rooted.<br />
<br />
and theres no possible way to tell when your at the top of aggro w/o <br />
A) having every other person enter melee range to check<br />
B) sucessful taunt<br />
<br />
every other time your tanking your probly Not top aggro w/o taunting b/c of caster/range aggro</div></div><hr />

taunt takes 6 seconds to repop. <br />

<br />
I did a simple test tonight..  Find random mob in newbie zoneXX (in this case, GD), taunt it, and see how long it takes my cleric to pull aggro off me with stun (Sound of Might). Results:<br />
<br />
aggro mob, successful taunt 1 time: cleric stun pulled aggro off immediately<br />
aggro mob, successful taunt 2 times: cleric stun pulled aggro off immediately<br />
aggro mob, successful taunt 3 times: cleric stun pulled aggro off immediately<br />
aggro mob, successful taunt 4 times: cleric stun pulled aggro off immediately<br />
aggro mob, successful taunt 5 times: cleric stun pulled aggro off after TWO casts<br />
<br />
I was able to reproduce the above about half a dozen times. Perhaps not statistically significant, but I'm a lazy bastard and it looked pretty clear to me: multiple taunts = more aggro. I wasn't doing anything except taunting in every case, autoattack was turned off.<br />
<br />
If my SK and Warrior were on different accounts I'd test this more precisely with the aggro spells, but alas, they are not.. and I don't feel like wasting anyone's time on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There *is* a bonus, but it isnt big enough to make a stitch of difference.  63 successes wasn't enough to outweigh a CH<br />
<br />
I can see support for mashing taunt for the first four times (18secs) a mob is there, just to outweigh the puller's initial aggro -- but almost always the puller doesnt have to worry about regaining aggro because he's either a bard (aggro on a bard is rare, if he pulls without damage), a monk (FD immediately thereafter), or a ranger (isn't in melee range, pulling aggro is increasingly difficult)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That cannot be right based on my brief tests above. If that were true, then it wouldn't matter whether I taunted 1 time or 50 times before the cleric tried to pull aggro off me. I'm showing if I successfully taunt 4 times, the cleric can pull aggro off me with a single Sound of Might (which is just a stun with no damage btw).  But, if I taunt 5 times, then he has to cast TWICE before he gets aggro. <br />
<br />
Since I wasn't doing anything other than taunting, that pretty clearly shows that taunting builds aggro, and isn't just total hate +1.<br />
<br />
I think you're looking at my example the wrong way, I wasn't trying to pull aggro off the cleric after he stunned - I was taunting a certain number of times and then seeing how many times he had to stun before he got aggro.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Hate_of_Stun / 4 &lt; Bonus_Hate_from_Taunt &lt; Hate_of_CH / 63<br />
<br />
The taunt test in the library pretty much proves that there IS some insignificant value...I suppose if the aggro on a CH is set high enough, and the aggro on a level 5 cleric stun is set low enough, that this is possible.<br />
<br />
But then again...paladins use that stun for aggro, don't they?  So......I guess I would like to see Havyk's test + a log of it for proof before I even try to come up with an explanation</div></div><hr />

It would be quite logical ( Verant logical? ) that the +hate bonus on taunt is depend on both level of warrior and mob. The whole gamed is based on that fact.. why would it be a constant fixed hate ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good test Madrone.  It wouldn't suprise me if the level 5 cleric stun was very low aggro, but I also saw the same thing happen with CH.  Now I believe over at the cleric board they would tell you that there is a random chance for a heal to get you no aggro at all, so it's probably not the best spell to test with.  If anything I would say that taunt still works the way it always has (putting you at the top of the hate list + some small amount) but it's possible that the small amount has gone up a bit.  Need to see more tests to get this nailed down.  <br />
<br />
If a successful taunt adds FoA/12.5 hate I would still think the appropriate to save it rather than mashing it, since that's still only ~30ish hate but apparently more than it used to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But ya as Brutul said, it looks like its just a very small amount of hate, that really has a low effect on actual gameplay/usage, but its definatly interesting to try to figure out<br />
<br />
I forgot to have someone else pull to negate the initial aggro bonus, mostly testing to just confirm if there was a change in how much + hate taunt was<br />
<br />
Another Interesting thing to test would be ae taunt, if it functions as taunt + hate wise, or if its different, although the amount of time to refresh it might be annoying</div></div><hr />

About half a dozen times? What does that mean? 4? 5? 6?<br />

Do this test 100 times and show me logs and then we can debate on if they have changed taunt.<br />
<br />
This sample is way too small to mean anything.<br />
<br />
The big question I have is: You say with XX number of successful taunts you stunned after, but how long was the time between pulling and stunning? 5 sucessful taunts can take a long time if you get a bad string of unsuccessful taunts in there.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of factors to consider with aggro, no one needs to jump on the taunt give hate bandwagon just yet.<br />
<br />
A possible counter theory: That hate builds with time when a mob is aggroed on you even if you are not attacking back. So a stun will pull a mob off within a minute but after 5 minutes of attacking it takes 2 stuns to pull aggro.<br />
<br />
Try your same tests without taunting at all Havyk, and base it on duration and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

yup, I already said it wasn't a very big sample:<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps not statistically significant, but I'm a lazy bastard and it looked pretty clear to me: multiple taunts = more aggro. <br />
<br />
<br />
and no thanks, I'm not going to do this 100 times, I'm really not that concerned with it. Incite gives me plenty of aggro in most situations. I just thought you all might want to know in case anyone is ambitious enough to try to repeat what I saw in a more significant test - or - let's get 20 people to try it 5 times and we'll have our 100 tests :)<br />
<br />
I did however consider the time issue - I tried several tests later where I taunted twice and waited about a minute before stunning with the same results as above.</div></div><hr />

When I did my first round of tests with taunt, I was doing it with a lowbie ranger (30ish) and my SK. I'd pull with my SK using terror of death (+450 hate). The ranger would have to successfully taunt at least 4 times to get aggro, and more if she got alot of failures early. Over 17 tests, it ranged anywhere from 4 to 12 successful taunt attempts to pull aggro. In two thirds of the sample it took exactly 4 (seems to be a magic number for taunt).<br />
<br />
yes, this isn't exactly a scientific test either.. big level difference between ranger &amp; SK, green mobs to SK, blue to ranger, but it seemed interesting to me. Fixed hate spell (supposedly) and it took a variable # of successful taunts to pull aggro. Perhaps nothing is really a 'fixed' amount of hate.<br />
<br />
What is even more interesting (and perhaps this is the strange behavior with the SK hate spells that was mentioned earlier): If I cast Touch of Death twice on incoming - supposedly 900 hate total - it made no difference in how many times it took the ranger to pull aggro off me. In most cases, it still only took 4 successful taunts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A successful taunt without getting aggro doesn't mean that you didn't go to the top of the hate list.  Successful taunt essentially puts you equal in hate to the person you're taunting off of.  If that person is a melee or has a dot active, they can easily get aggro back before you even get hit by landing another swing or getting another tick from their dot.  If the person with aggro is doing nothing to the mob and not sitting or the puller then you should always get aggro with a single taunt.<br />
<br />
The 4 taunt thing is do to an aggro bonus from being the first one on the aggro list.  If you pull with one character, and taunt with another while autoattack is off it will always take 4 successful taunts to get aggro.  After the initial successful taunt however, you can turn on autoattack and you will have aggro in one or two hits.  This was the main discovery in the library taunt thread (there is a summary post linked in the original post if you don't want to read the whole thread.<br />
<br />
It had occured to me that maybe they had upped the +hate amount on taunt to cover that bonus and let you get aggro from a puller with one successful taunt, but I did a quick test last night and the 4 taunt thing is definitely still there, which only confuses me more with regard to the other tests in this thread.  If the +hate has gone up, then the bonus for pulling has too.  I seriously doubt that this is true, so this is even more of a mystery now.  You can still pull aggro off of a puller who used prox aggro with an arrow or two, so if taunt is 1/4 of that aggro it's very very tiny.<br />

We are definitely missing a piece of the puzzle here.  I can't explain holding aggro with 4 or 5 taunts over a stun.</div></div><hr />

   What I do is simple, I taunt Constantly, and use Breate if the mob turns off of me. I never have Problms keeping agro last half of the fight.<br />
<br />
Just what I've learned playing the game myself. I do and always will Taunt when avable.</div></div><hr />

If the mob is beating on you, who cares where you are on the hate list? If the mob turns to beat on a caster, I want that button there so I don't have to wait 6 seconds to get agro back. The amount of hate being generated is not significant enough to risk giving a mob 6 seconds free on your chanter.</div></div><hr />
