<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fools_Errend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Recently on Luclin server a guild killed RZtW for the first time. A well earned kill. Congrads to them.<br />
<br />
Loot was collar and BoW.<br />
<br />
BoW was awarded to a SK because the SK bid the highest DKP for the BOW.<br />
<br />
Discuss.<br />
<br />
(I am not in this guild or anything, I have no personal interest in this other than the merits of DKP v special high end loot)<br />
<br />
Cuch<br />
Overlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's stupid. There, it's been discussed. What else do you expect to be said? The guild is retarded, the SK having BoW doesn't help them in any way. That is all. And you misspelled errand in your sneaky sneaky name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fools_Errend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">grim,<br />
<br />
Fools_errend has been my handle for over 3 years. And the reason is it mispelled it because I have it linked with my hotmail  address. Pure and simple. No need to think this is some sneaky way of causeing trouble for people. There is absolutely no point in that for me. The guild who did this has no influence on me and I on them. I have absolutely no contact with them in any shape or form. I just saw the loot decision and thought it was quite think.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to discuss. I did not wish to pass judgement on the decision on this board. I just was looking for the opinion of others from here. And as a member of the boards here for over 2 years I thought this was the best place to ask opinions. I am not an active poster here, but I read and watch the threads almost every day for the last few years. <br />
<br />
I too think this was a very poor decision. But I was never in a DKP guild. So I can not comment on the workings of one.<br />
<br />
As I have been inactive in EQ for a good few months now, maybe the conventional wisdom is that BoW is no longer Warrior Specific. To me this is a poor decision. A sk will have a BoW bagged half of the time on raids. And with the rarity of it, there is a strong  chance they might not see another for a long long time.<br />
<br />
Grim,I know you are normally argue points very well on these boards and you do tons of excellent work on parsing etc. But no need to shut me down like that. I am only raising a valid point. When SoE puts War, SK, Pal on a 2HS that is basically a bandaid for warriors, it is kind screwed up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cuch.<br />
Overlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah all you're saying is that straight DKP is retarded, and you're already preaching to the chorus chief; we all know it.  This thread is a needless redundancy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My guild is in a similar situation. <br />
<br />
We havent had any BoWs drop yet (out of 2 RZTW kills), so it hasnt become a problem yet, but it has been discussed a lot in the past. <br />
<br />
Our top 2 DKP earners are SKs, and since there is no rule against it, they could get one if they wanted it...luckily they have said they would let the most active warriors get them before they bid on it...but since we only have 3 warriors that raid a lot, it might become an issue fairly soon, unless some SEWs drop first. <br />
<br />
I am not totally against the idea of hybrids getting BoWs (a hybrid that raids every day should get one before a warrior that logs on once a week), but in a DKP guild, all one can do is hope that people think about whats best for the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SEWS is a lot more common, and a lot more usefull for a knight.<br />
<br />
Its not really the system itself that sucks...<br />
what sucks is the SK that bid on it.<br />
<br />
Most people that DO bid on a BoW, are actually just trying to say &quot;Fuck you&quot; to the warrior. You basically can't piss off a warrior more then this :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wel, the fact that SOE even puts other classes on an EB weapon is a big 'FU' from them to us.<br />
<br />
Hmm, lets see the SOE logic hard at work...<br />
<br />
There are problems with taunt..<br />
<br />
Warriors need something to help them gain aggro, because knights and rangers always out aggro them..<br />
Well, we cant fix this so lets make a bandaid..<br />
I know,<br />
Lets make EB, a pure hate proc to help them...<br />
Viola! Lets put EB on BoC,BoW...<br />
<br />
Oh yeah lets put knights and rangers on them too..<br />
<br />
WTF..<br />
<br />
Not the most assinine thing in EQ, but pretty damn close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pure dkp w/o item restrictions for some things = retarded. Not much else to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gratz 5R on RZ (http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1231) <br />
<br />
Here is a nice bit of discussion on this subject.  Also a bit more detail for anyone who is at all interested(such as: the SK who got it actually bid on it only to block another knight from getting it).  I got to spend the better part of the night that it happened in tells with a couple 5R warrior friends, who where hot .  I hope 5R learned something from this episode, as it cast a pall on a nice achievement for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dkp works quite well aslong as there is officer override power. Once the precident is set that officers will override loot in special cases then this isn't a problem anymore. For example, my guild overrides all BoW's to warriors and all Sews to hybrids. Warriors also get discount on hate weapons so that we are geared up faster relative to other members in the guild.<br />
<br />
Dkp is only a tool to descide where items are best placed, some guilds use it to distribute loot evenly among all guild members, and cases like this arrive where they get burned. The best possible loot system (for a high end guild who has an abundance of loot anyway) is dkp with some form of officer control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As a SK the drop im praying for from RZ (for myself) is the red eyed mask not BoW.<br />
<br />
-edit, enraging blow is the one and only exception from DKP i would make... otherwise you can end up with hybrids getting a raw deal. For example the range of flowing thought items we can select from is severly limited but you can end up with all ft items being preferred to casters and priests (even those ones which are the only reasonable upgrades available to hybrids). Same goes for focuses.</div></div><hr />

Oh and after reading the thread about the kill the sk took it to prevent another sk from taking it. Man whoever that other sk is should have his balls stuffed in a blender.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">simple solution to the issue.. let the sk that got the bow be mt. <br />
<br />
when he dies hit aoe taunt and laugh at his corpse. he wanted the aggro weapon.. he got it..<br />
<br />
our guild not at that point yet (only up to boc) but it is pure dkp.. if a druid gets it, hes mt  or the warriors flat out refuse to tank while hes in the raid.<br />
<br />
easy enough if you can get every warrior in the guild to agree to it.<br />
<br />
***quick edit***<br />
if you think the druid can cock block the guild then your wrong. the raid leader then needs to say to that person your mt or you have a tl out of here so the warriors tank.<br />
<br />
that will keep people in the future from bidding on somthing they should not be biddding on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hraldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was formally the raid leader for the guild in question but have since moved on, and yes the SK who got the BoW does MT for them most of the time.  If I was still in that guild i would of thrown a royal shit fit about the other SK not retracting his bid.  Probably would of deguilded him a few times to shut him up actually.  It is a necessary evil of the dkp beast but from what i understand 5r plans to farm the crap out of RZ until at least their most actives warriors have BoW's.  Killed him as soon as he repopped as a matter of fact.  Could of all been resolved by the dkp officer restricting bids to warriors only, but the fact that the other SK wanted to bid so bad that even tho he knew he wasnt going to get it no matter what he kept his bid in.  <br />
<br />
Willing to bet it taught the warriors to stockpile dkp when it looks as though they are getting ready to kill RZtW in the upcoming weeks / months.</div></div><hr />

If that isn't the greatest statement summarizing the entire incident; I don't know what is.</div></div><hr />

i was thinking crush since when has there when a frappe button?<br />
<br />
in words to thread: you tell that retard NOT to use bow when one of your warriors are tanking or he's gonna be dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think a lot of you guys haven't read the thread, or my understanding of it is wrong.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen, the Sk that won the BoW didn't want it originally. However other Sk/Paladins wouldn't pass on it. Once he realized that him sitting out still wouldn't put it in the hands of a warrior, he grabbed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">What Raaj said, the Sk who got it did everything he could to get the other knight to not bid on it, and then took it partly(I believe) to block this other knight.<br />
<br />
i understand 5r plans to farm the crap out of RZ until at least their most actives warriors have BoW's <br />
<br />
7 Bows on server so far, how long do they plan to farm RZ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fools_Errend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Aye,<br />
<br />
Harm got the BoW, but he did not want it. He was bidding to try to stop the other SK from keeping his bid in. ie his thoughts being if the other SK retracted his bid, then Harm could retract and a War get the BoW. Ie other people could see and told the SK to retract the bid, but he would not. (from my understanding)<br />
<br />
<br />
Harm is actually a great person, and deserves the BoW completely. I just thought it was a poor display by the officers to allow this to happen. Rather than having the guts to stand up and say it was wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well his intentions may have been noble but if he really wanted the warriors to have it he should have declared after he won that he changed his mind and let them reroll.  That would have given teh warriors 2 chances at it.  Unless it's just highest pts wins.<br />
<br />
IMO there are enough excellent knight 2 handers out there that a knight should never be rolling on this if there's a warrior that needs it.  This is bar none the best 2 hander in the game for a warrior.  Nothing else is even close.  Knights have at least 1 (SEWS) which is better for them.  <br />
<br />
I can understand that it's a nice knight weapon but they don't need the EB, they can generate aggro with spells.  There's no comparison for a warrior.  And any ranger looting this is just gonna use it as a toy.  A ranger that goes in on it when there's a warrior that needs it should be told he's a retard and removed from the roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>lelara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hey warriors,<br />
<br />
You've just witnessed the wonders of what sometimes DKP can do to a guild. <br />
I hope that guild learns it's lesson and imply a penalty on members that bid and then retract thier bid or lots of exploits will happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lelara</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Whatever. DKP works for them. DKP works for others. Its all a question of motivation. If they are motivated, this will be a bump in the road.<br />
<br />
The in-fighting caused by flaming and second guessing members and internal strife of people siding with one side or the other will be 100x worse for the guild than not having a BoW in the hands of their warrior.<br />
<br />
You would think life began after the BoW. Just suck it up and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Even tho we do use DKP; some items go to certain classes with a priority</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yes, like the fantabulous Fine Steel Short Sword you looted off that mean Goblin, right? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Josephian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As I've said before, straight DKP is about as retarded as /random.  And members of the guild 5R don't seem too broken up about a non warrior looting the BOW, at least from the thread I read, except for the person that looted it.  They deserve whatever fallout they suffer for just not /gr'ing that other SK in the first place and letting only warriors bid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well, from my perspective, this just confirms how screwed up the game is for Warriors.  If Warriors were able to hold aggro relatively well without something like a BoW, who would care who got it if they had the DKP to purchase it?  It wouldn't have really mattered all that much, would it?  It's only the fact that Warrior aggro generation is so fubared that makes this such a huge issue, right?  Think about that for a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Carnican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Which direction do you take this topic, in reality?<br />
<br />
1) You can look at it from the perspective of a guild capable of killing RZtW and using DKP.  <br />
     a)  First of all, if the RZtW script is content that you are not able to &quot;beat&quot;, why fester over the topic in the first place?<br />
     b)  Secondly, if you are in a guild that is able to beat the script, you probably beat it because you had guildmates that knew thier role and had warriors that know what to do and when to do it.<br />
     c)  Thirdly, there are warriors in that guild that will not hear a peep from that particualr SK in terms of bids for a long time.<br />
    d)  Fourth and probably the most critical of points, who gives a rip?  Guys, Shammys bid and win the Vindi BP, Clerics buy the Cursed's BP (Breasplate of the Void), rangers and warriors can out bid the knights on the Emp's sword every day, on every server.  <br />
<br />
2)  You can look at it from the perspective of a gamer that is around people that can beat the script and does not have DKP.<br />
   a) You rely on merits or randoms.  You'ld still bitch if &quot;the most uber tank&quot; was merited the blade.  Or would cry foul if the newest member to your player base won it by chance on a fluke from a good roll.<br />
<br />
This topic is nothing more than a whiners attempt at a troll.  And both whiners and trolls are just drama queens in disguise.<br />
<br />
I raid in a DKP guild.  And the fact of the matter is: once you learn your class, then you learn your role, next in line is learn the encounter, then you learn how to play DKP.  DKP is a game within a game.  Get over it.  Every warrior, and knight in that guild is seceretly rejoicing the fact one SK has lost a lot of points to a bid that was redundant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Vindi BP is arguably the best Shaman and Bard BP up until Aten Ha Ra.<br />
Back when we did Vindi we still used merit and awarded it primarily to those 2 classes with preference to shamans.<br />
About every one of our warriors had skyshrine bp at the time, we got either Vindi or statue bp later and had no luck with bp drop of either cursed, Seru or AHR so far (and thats on 6+ kills on either one).<br />
Since last november my guild is using dkp, as it made things a lot easier (i was and am still part of the loot council handling the whole thing, although no officer).<br />
We had some strange things going on like a druid getting ancient wyvern hide legs or a beastlord buying AHR mask.<br />
But all in all it worked quite well.<br />
The only item our officers deemed to make an exception on is the BoW.<br />
Blade of Carnage was never an issue as all our knights prefer 2handers over 1h/shield but there were obviously some sure signs that knights intended to outbid warriors on BoW so officers took steps beforehand.<br />
Once this was decided there was about 2 days arguing in a thread over 4 pages why this would not be necessary but in the end the whole thing settled down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Small update to this whole thing.  5R is having unreal luck with BoW drops, having gotten 3 in 5(I think) kills.  Last 2 have gone to warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Nice to hear, for 5R's sake :p</div></div><hr />

Gratz Elli.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">if you read into a few of the posts by the guild members, the prick of a knight forced the winning knight to loot it, it looks like the knight that one it, tried to let a warrior still take it but the prick forced him to loot it.<br />
<br />
Sorry Harm was forced to take BOW because of a greedy individual that would rather see his/her own gear increase rather the the guild ability to do more. Oh wait if the guild could do more they would get better stuff too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Dall18or</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I believe that Blade of War should be warrior only for the fact that it drops off the god of war and warriors empower that god. Its kinda like our non-gimp epic upgrade. <br />
<br />
On the other side though, If you are in a DKP guild how is it greed to go for a loot drop you want if you saved your dkp? Regardless of what class you are. *shrugs*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">We had a situation like this before.  At the time, had only seen 1 sews from many, many clearings of Mud ring (went for 120+ to a warrior) when our first BoW dropped.  <br />
<br />
As a paladin, its handy for my offtank roles, letting me save a bit of mana, which adds up, and thought nothing of spending 75 on it, which was a bargain on it compared to what the equivalent weapons were.<br />
<br />
I won, amazingly, and only after taking much shit from a few people, did I retract my bid.  A warrior won with a bid of 35.  I dont really care, neither did a lot of people, he holds aggro the same with it as he did a norge tal or the 2hander from tov he used on boss fights, to me it was the principle of the dkp system and warriors claiming &quot;Bow is warrior only&quot; while bidding and winning the only other option for 2hander upgrades we could get at that point.<br />
<br />
DKP works, but mob frenzy can impact it as well.  Quite a few of the people cursing myself out when I won have no idea what kind of upgrade weapons actually are, the warriors spouting off &quot;Bow should be warrior only&quot; was the only factor, NOT usefullness to warriors as mt's (our usual 2nd has a sews and said he prefers it over bow) ands knights to help us offtank.  <br />
<br />
Its all kind of interesting when you thionk about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ellisand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">As a memeber of the guild in question I can say this caused quite a bit of wiggage, 3 days later though we dropped him again, then again 3 days later, um then again four days latter..<br />
<br />
 Our main concern (warriors) was we were being cheated out of an advatage whilst tanking, but at the same time we had got this far Without any BoWs, after tanking in EPs both using one handers and 2handers, no bow doesn't mean a wipe.<br />
<br />
 I still believe it should be warrior only, one thing I will say though Its made me look alot closer at items I bid on (mana/focus effct ect)<br />
