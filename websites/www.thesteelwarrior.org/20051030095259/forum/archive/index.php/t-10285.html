Looks like other servers are having similar problems too, since the infrastructure update. I joined Hyjal when I started because it was recommended to me by the client as a low population server. I guess it was wrong, or at least misleading, as it looks like it gave me a recommendation based off of current server load.<br />
<br />
Lately, it looks like a backend server keeps going out. I'll doing fine one moment and then all of a sudden the world stops responding. Mobs keep moving around, but you can't attack them, or even loot or mine. /1 chat always gets interesting during those times though. Anyone else having similar problems on thier server? Does anyone know what is wrong, I haven't seen anything but the most vague explainations from the WoW team. Not that it matters if the tell us or not, I'd just like to know whats interupting my play time.</div></div><hr />

When the normal world server is working fine, it seems either their setup for npc's or loot/quests blows up.  Granted, its better than I expected it to be,  however still annoying.<br />

Hopefully they'll get this crap tuned so it works right.</div></div><hr />

I sure hope it gets a lot better than this.</div></div><hr />

I always fucking said it about SoE too..and you know what? Getting an extra day on my subscription DOES in fact shut me up and I don't bitch about downtime like this.</div></div><hr />

Haass, we got credited for one day of not being able to play.  This is the now fourth time in the past week (server went down again) that I can't log in because of a server crash.  After 3 unexpected crashes, 16 hours of scheduled downtime, and two rollbacks I get a bit cranky regardless of an extra day on my account.</div></div><hr />

Must have got lucky with server selection.... lag isn't too much of an issue either.... except Ironforge around 9pm.... monster lag in the Auction house.</div></div><hr />

Honsetly for how new WoW is we've had very few technical/server issues or down time.  (compared to other games)</div></div><hr />

If that's the case, why not offer a split?  I'm sure that there would be certain groups/guilds of people that wouldn't mind migrating in order to get a stable server.  I mean I wouldn't start over for it, but...<br />
<br />
It really is disappointing.  Very few technical/server issues or downtime?  I'm not sure what server you're playing on buddy, but Icecrown makes me sad in the pants.  Stress test should've taken care of this.  I'm not paying a subscription to do more beta testing.  What's frustrating is that not all of the servers are like that.  Make broken part &quot;a&quot; work like part &quot;b&quot; and everyone will be happy.  3+ server takedowns and countless, COUNTLESS random continent crashes are unacceptable.  I hate mmorpgs : /</div></div><hr />

<br />
You got credited for one day, RECENTLY.<br />
<br />
When the game was released, if you bought your copy on release day, you were credited 3 more.<br />
<br />
This is WAY WAY WAY fucking more than SoE ever did, so I really don't see how you could play EQ for so long and think that this is a piss poor way of handling it.  This is leaps and bounds above any reach around that SoE ever gave any of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ's DX9 upgrade anyone?</div></div><hr />

I get him to corner ... CH rot is goig fine ... EMp is at 80% and I have aggro locked solid ... we have add's locked .. yep . we're gonna dorp him again.  What's this?  Emp is shoved THROUGH me .. and into wall?  I&quot;ll try to pull him back out .. He summon's me??  I'm punted to zone line?  We're wiping! .... Thanks SoE for the wonderous DX9 upgrade ... it was flawless.<br />
<br />
As long as in game glitches like this don't screw us over in WoW, and build frustration to ever new height's ..... I'll be satisfied.    <br />
<br />
But, this IS getting rather annoying.  I tend to think that, if the code is the same on teh various server's that it's possible hardware related on some of these server's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They need to fix this shit.  It's awful.  I can't complain much about Hellscream.  The server hasn't had random outages, we only have queues every once in a while, and lag is often manageable.<br />
<br />
But, jesus christ, it's just plain sad that Blizzard released such a fabulous product but has such shit poor servers that it can't manage the load.  It's fine and dandy to say &quot;well, they didn't expect this many people&quot; and &quot;the game is just such a success&quot; for the first few weeks.  But it's now been a couple months and they need to get this shit under control.  I have friends who literally cannot buy the game because Blizzard isn't shipping more boxes to stores until they fix the server problem.  I'm glad Blizzard is doing it - shows a commitment to the problem that is a little unprecedented in this industry - but so far I haven't actually seen them FIX the problems they appear so committed to fixing.</div></div><hr />
