<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barboki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please let me know if this has been discussed or thought of before.  I have not seen it so I thought I would post.<br />
<br />
This idea has come out of spell crits and Ranger Bow Crits.  Judging them against our normal crits and cripples when fighting I seem to think our crits are lacking.  I think they should be upgraded.  Not only in damage output, but there should be a stunn associated with it and should have the agro generation of paladin spells.  Further warriors can improve this skill through AA progression to up the dmager and frequency.<br />
<br />
Secondly I believe the refresh for the Taunt key on warriors should be halved.  Couple a faster refresh with Taunting weapon procs and stunning crits could cause a balance in agro between the tank classes.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
please feel free to tear apart and analyze.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not a totally wrong headed way of looking at things. But increasing the success rate of the Taunt button is much better than decreasing the refresh rate. Rolling the dice faster is not a reasonable substitute for decent house odds especially if you don't know if you've gotten any winning rolls.<br />
<br />
With all the crit related disciplines, crit rate is somewhat scalable to effort put in. I agree that our crits and our offensive disciplines lack the flash and probably the effectiveness of things like Endless Quiver and SU3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hell I like this idea, and it would help balance duel wields horrible snap aggro via more crits compared to 2handers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've brought up reducing the refresh rate on the taunt button a number of times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
still looking for more replys.<br />
<br />
Glatius - ya I sort of knew that a shorten taunt refresh had been bantered around.  I guess i should have clarafied I meant only on the crit proposal part.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just to play devils advocate, this would mean basically all warriors would have to sit out fights where they werent MT beacuse just by normal melee they would generate high aggro.<br />
<br />
IMO we need something that generates aggro on command, not just all the time, so that when 5 warriors are present at a raid, the other 4 can do something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">More crit agro from non-tanking warriors on raids would be bad.<br />
<br />
Extra agro per hit type ideas have been brought up before, but as Solinar says, if it is implemented and isnt toggle-able then you have just nerfed the DPS of every raiding non-MT warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;Crit aggro&quot; is a myth.   You are awarded with the base damage for aggro, but not additional &quot;crit&quot; aggro.    Go over to Graffe's and check, they've done a hell of a job figuring it out, because well, they needed to, seeing that they'd be splats on a wall otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If we want to open the biggest can of worms on SoE it would simply be request 1 of 3 Taunt messages to be displayed globally,<br />
meaning everyone can see them, and ALL 3 displayed locally.<br />
<br />
the current taunt message : You taunt a moss snake to ignore others and attack you<br />
requested message 1 : a moss snake seems unaffected.<br />
requested message 2 : a moss snake becomes angered by (insert taunters name here).<br />
<br />
EVERY OTHER ACTION in EQ has a success and fail message, <br />
Mez : global msg (drools, what have you),  Mez broke Global in bright yellow.<br />
Mobs : casting, interrupt.<br />
Mobs : hit, miss.<br />
Kick : hit, miss.<br />
Bash : hit, miss.<br />
Swing : hit, miss.<br />
Disc's : disc msg, global.<br />
Heals : heal msg global, local hps healed and who healed, local healer hps healed who healed.<br />
Spells : global msg associated with spell, pelted with ice, engulfed with fire, sorrunded by a swarm, including damage by dots now local also, resists.<br />
Quests : NPC response, experience<br />
Archery : hit, miss.<br />
Pet use : guarding area, master, change position.<br />
Tradeskill : fail, success this is displayed to group.<br />
Pet Casting : casts a spell.<br />
PC Casting : Fizz, casts.<br />
Feign Death : fail global, success apperant.<br />
Instill Doubt : success global, fail local.<br />
<br />
Taunt is the ONLY melee action in the game without a local or global response,<br />
and SoE is too afraid to add these messages, not because they dont want us to know the mecahnics, because they dont want us to know how screwed up it is. Want to see our aggro issues repaired? get SoE to make these taunt messages.</div></div><hr />
