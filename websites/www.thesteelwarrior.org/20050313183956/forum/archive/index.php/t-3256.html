<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So we were messing around the other night with CT in Time.  We had a million warriors online so a few of us did /disc aggressive...<br />
<br />
This is w/o proc/casting damage.  Just pure melee.  A couple of the wars w/ lower damage had EDs (750 DD proc) so their DPS was a bit higher than shown here, plus all Pal/Sk/Ranger/Monk/Rogue have some sort of DD procs...<br />
<br />
rogue1 153 DPS<br />
rogue2 156 DPS (disc'd)<br />
rogue3 243 DPS (JTB/DoD) (disc'd)<br />
rogue4 167 DPS (disc'd)<br />
rogue5 222 DPS (DoD/Ifir) (disc'd)<br />
<br />
monk1 128 DPS<br />
monk2 140 DPS (disc'd)<br />
monk3 124 DPS (disc'd)<br />
monk4 138 DPS (disc'd)<br />
monk5 149 DPS (EPW/BF) (disc'd)<br />
<br />
warrior1 151 DPS (EoE/ED) (aggressive)<br />
warrior2 238 DPS (VDD) (aggressive)<br />
warrior3 91 DPS (SoPP/AoE)<br />
warrior4 124 DPS (Norge`tal) (aggressive) (me)<br />
warrior5 84 DPS (ED/EoE)<br />
warrior6 124 DPS (BoW)<br />
warrior7 111 DPS (EoE/SEM)<br />
<br />
Might have been partially out of range while using bow, shrug.<br />
ranger1 168 DPS<br />
ranger2 116 DPS<br />
ranger3 86 DPS<br />
<br />
Likely doing some healing and curing along with melee'ing.<br />
paladin1 86 DPS (GEA/SoSE)<br />
paladin2 79 DPS (RWM)<br />
paladin3 40 DPS (I think she was too busy looking at her new GoC to actually attack).<br />
<br />
sk1 93 DPS (VDD)<br />
sk2 84 DPS (SoS)<br />
<br />
bard1 38 DPS<br />
bard2 26 DPS (EoE)<br />
<br />
BST1 31 DPS (was mostly busy healing herself and curing I guess)<br />
<br />
wizard mass pets 45 DPS<br />
mage mass pets 56 DPS<br />
mage mass pets 106 DPS<br />
mage mass pets 55 DPS<br />
<br />
Anyhow, not so bad that a warrior w/ aggressive can come pretty close to top end DPS for a major fight.  If you're high on warriors and low on rogues/wiz and you will keep 1 tank up the whole fight, you can always use some aggressive! ;)<br />
<br />
I didn't add necro or mage 'real' pets because I don't know which is which with those odd names.  The best was 67 DPS though.<br />
<br />
Not sure about 1 guy's aggressive, but mine started at 50% health and lasted about 1 min after he died.  The war with top DPS started his disc at 90% life and it lasted till about 20% or so, so he got full disc in.  He also obviously put on full ATK gear and got FA, SoT, etc he was at 1800 ATK for the fight (didn't have a bard).</div></div><hr />

<br />
wtf? <br />
<br />
A warrior using vanazir can at least sustain 150dps on a normal mob.<br />
<br />
Hmm, add what, 40% dmg from aggressive to that?  Let's say it goes up to 210 dps.<br />
<br />
Assuming you totally destroy CT in like under 3-4 min (pretty hard imo), and assuming bard overhaste, FA, etc, etc.  Maybe it's possible but that retardly high compare to your other melees.<br />
<br />
But yeah, on all the easy boss I use aggressive when I bother, pretty good dmg.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, our average fight is under 3min for CT.  Eight wizards all chaining SoS for 350dps each tears him up.  <br />
<br />
One of our warriors did agressive too, he had all attack buffs except Ferocity and he did 234dps.  Our top monks only managed 190ish dps.  And only 3-4 rogues beat him.  <br />
<br />
Luckily it is a rather long refresh time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh I was one of the warriors... All the warriors went aggressive the last fight too... Beware: EoE and ED with max atk buffs WILL get you killed heh.<br />
<br />
Think in every instance when a warrior with EoE and ED did aggressive we died early :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did this again last night as Moze said.  This time the Pal didn't get quite as good of a lock, so our was DPS took a big hit and 2 of them died real quick from overaggro'ing ;)<br />
<br />
I pulled out 143 DPS w/ EoE/HG... and I had aggressive run from 75% - 3% or so.<br />
<br />
Here's the DPS for our highest DPS in each class:<br />
<br />
Wizard 469<br />
Rogue 259<br />
Warrior 206<br />
Necro 193<br />
SK 188<br />
Monk 170<br />
Ranger 170<br />
Shaman 120<br />
BST 56 + BST Pet 57 = 113<br />
Ench 109<br />
Pal 88<br />
Bard 66<br />
Ranger, BST etc weapon proc Pets 30-36<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that BST and Pal were likely curing/healing group as well as just doing DPS.</div></div><hr />

Was that wizard nuking for the duration of the fight or did he start halfway and just chain nuke? Could you post the total damage done?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The wizard did 101424 total damage.  He was chain nuking more or less the whole fight and did by far more damage than anyone else.  He had glamorus visage on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm not sure if ranger damage is getting counted right in these, and I know that none of them used TS.  Probably no bows at all, since the whole wall problem.<br />
<br />
Our monks don't have any Shinais and we got our first Staff of Trancendance from this last CT kill.  I'm sure our monk's DPS will improve a lot once we get some more luck on monk drops in Time (which I hope isn't anytime soon! we get enough leather that rots anyhow! More war weapons and plate!).</div></div><hr />
