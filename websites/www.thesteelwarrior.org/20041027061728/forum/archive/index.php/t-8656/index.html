<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always liked Overthere, and at least on my server, there are still groups fighting there.<br />
OT is not the fastest experience per kill, but there are lots and lots of mobs, and conditions favor a warrior pulling if the warrior has a good bow. I always thought that a puller who can run the mobs at the optimal rate for the group simultaneously maximizes exp and minimizes the risk of group wipe/stand around waiting for rezes. Reducing deaths/group wipes in pick-up groups generally gives you better exp in a normal zone than repeated dying will get you in a high-zem zone. Of course, if you get in a zone with a good exp modifier and you have a good puller, you're set.<br />
However, you should check out LDoN adventures and also read the patch messages to find out where the &quot;hot&quot; zones are--they've got an experience modifier boost.<br />
don't forget to hotkey /shield, heh.<br />
And, if you go to OT, make sure everyone knows what a 'goon is, so when you see one coming and say &quot;Run!&quot; half the people in your group don't stand there saying, &quot;Why? There's just one of them.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nezlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I agree.. OT and LDoNs are great suggestions.. You could also check out the Gulf of Gunthak and Frontier Mountains. In Gunthak, you can just hunt on the shore, should be able to get/start a group. Great xp there for sure. In FM, fight at the giant keep. They drop decent money, great sellable items (Leg-Chopper = 50p, Giant Vest = 60pp), but not a very popular zone... Finally, you could also head over to Dawnshroud Peaks, should be able to pick up a group fairly easy there, gl  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
For grouping, go to DSP. Else, try do a who all on other players your level to see where they hang out.</div></div><hr />
