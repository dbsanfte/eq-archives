<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mbahansen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a Blade of Strategy equiped primary and a CHoS secondary.  I had thought that the SotBS would be better agro then the CHoS because the proc was effective against higher level mobs, but a guildmate tells me it really doesn't matter if it is effective and that the CHoS is better agro.  Opinions?  Should I keep my BoS primary or move it?  BTW stats don't matter I always proc avatar to max stats then change to main weapons.  I did the hand in to get my Epic converted to an augmentable weapon so I plan to install 2 Anger III augs on these weapons if this ends up being my final setup for now.  I just want to be sure that the CHoS is the right weapon before I aug it.  Either way it sounds like it is time to retire my Wrath's Edge and Acrylia Handled Broadsword.<br />
<br />
My current guild is about to start farming named in SSRA so hopefully all of this will not be and issue soon.  <br />
<br />
Also I 2 box in POV alot with my 61 Shammy do you think I could switch to a Greatstaff of Thunder and still keep agro off the Shammy to up my DPS a bit?<br />
<br />
I do have Ambidexterity AA and Punishing blade 2 AA<br />

65 Warrior 96 AA</div></div><hr />
