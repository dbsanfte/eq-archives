<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparantly I need to explain why these things are bad.<br />
<br />
Enable weapon set cycling via hotkey and tabs in inventory. Up to 3 sets.  <br />
<br />
Right clicking weapons to Equip them is too much hassle?  Come on now, the most you'd EVER have to do is manually remove your shield in a weapon swap, and that's only if you're going to DW from Sword/Board, and you might as well just go to 2h if you're going to do that and bypass it all.  This is seriously not an issue at all, and I'd prefer they work on about 1000 other tweaks before they bother with this one since weapon swapping is already 10x faster in this game than any other I've played.<br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive: You absorb 20% of any damage taken, but deal 15% less damage while in stance. <br />
<br />
This would make it so there is a bonus for being in Defensive, and there would never be any reason to use Battle.  There's a reason that there's different stances, and it's because there are different situations for using them.  Defensive is perfectly fine as is, and does not need an upgrade like this.  Ditto with the Berseker change.  It makes both of them MORE useful than battle in all circumstances, and that's not how they're supposed to be.  <br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery: Requires level 25<br />
You retain up to 35 rage points when you change stances. <br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason for a 35 rage number at all, other than for the mortal strike freaks. This is frivilous.  The way the class is set up is to encourage you to pick a stance and use it for awhile. <br />
<br />
 Tactical Supremacy: Requires level 35 <br />
<br />
Retarded beyond belief.  See above.  You're not supposed to have all skills available all the time.  I realize some people have been playing with cheat codes on for all these years, but as I said before, Balance =/= overpowering a class.<br />
<br />
Battle Shout: Increase duration to at least 5min. <br />
<br />
Battle shout is already the best damage per rage point ability we have, especially in groups of 5.  It doesn't need a buff.<br />
<br />
The rest of your talent suggestions are basically completely ridiculous, and it's clear that you gave no thought at all to them other than &quot;WE NEED MORE DAMAGE!&quot;<br />
<br />
You do understand that the damage you deal generates rage right?  And by dealing the fuckin insane amount of damage that you'd want, we'd have infinite rage right?  And you do realize that the game is designed around us NOT having infinite rage?  <br />
<br />
There are things that need a slight tweak in this game.  None of the things that you listed are in that category.</div></div><hr />

Right clicking weapons to Equip them is too much hassle?<br />
Get cosmos with its /equip and /unequip commands and macro them.  Works MUCH better than trying to use your mouse.<br />
The way the class is set up is to encourage you to pick a stance and use it for awhile.<br />
Hmmm, not right now it aint.  If that really were the case there would be a forced cooldown between stance changes.  Instead we have this notion that you can change stances instantly, but it makes you completly 100% calm.  Uhhh.. yea.. right.. sure.<br />
I really don't see the reason to naturally allow rage to be kept.<br />
And I really dont see any reason we should loose it all for changing the way we stand.<br />
<br />
I can understand that they might want us to pick a stance and use it.  If they really meant it, there would be a cooldown after you switched.  Instead we have this talent point sink called Tatical Mastery.  Its annoying, but hey, its one fun ass game.  I'll play it either way =)<br />
Also, increasing the max crit is a bad idea for PVP.<br />
huh? How is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I woudl do.<br />
<br />
1) QUick swap weapon set up's....agree with 3.  1h / Shield, dual wield, 2h.  While not necessarily needed, it's DEFENITELY a nicety I'd like to see implemented.<br />
<br />
2) Get rid of Tactical mastery ... replace with another aggro attack similiar to sundar, and just keep rage between stances.<br />
<br />
3) Increase our innate DPS.  Either through the damage we produce per hit, or an increased hit percentage ... we miss to much IMO (woudl prefer the latter actually).<br />
<br />
4) Get rid of the 20% threat penalty from battle stance.  This &quot;middle ground&quot; stance should NOT have a aggro penalty.  This would make Berserker stance ...20% penalty.  battle 0% penalty.  Defensive 20% bonus.<br />
<br />
5) Add a &quot;increased HP&quot; talent at like 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%.  TO help increase the &quot;gap&quot; between us and other classes(read Paly) a lil.  If they are gonna make Paladin's a TRUE hydra calss, i.e. useful heal's, they can heal themselves or others WHILE TANKING .... then the gap in HP to begin with need's to be larger.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO, that is all they need to do to fix us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what makes me cry with warriors is that we have too much talents. ok some are designed not to have all of them (specialisations : you take one or two but not all of them of course).<br />
but look at the mage talent tree : it perfect, you can max any of the trees (magic, cold, fire) and you still have some point left for a minor second mastery/specialisation.<br />
but for warrior you need 55 for maximazing furry, or 49 for full defence built, or 58 for full battle build (actually only 38 if you consider you can't specialise in two weapons).<br />
some talents are almost a must have : we can't tank without rage thus increasing crit% helps us alot in all stance, switch stance without to much loss is a must for adaptability, and the list goes on.<br />
a good way to help us would be to:<br />
1. put a little cooldown in stance switching.<br />
2. allows 4 rage per 10 lvl above the stance lvl to be kept when exiting this stance. Thus a lvl 60 warrior would keep 28 rage when quiting battle stance, 20 when quiting defencive stance, and 12 rage when quiting Berzerker stance.<br />
3. and maybe reworking a bit the bonus/malus of each stances. essentially on the def/off ratio and on the rage generation. something along the line : def generate rage more from domage receive and less from domage done (the better tank you are, the more angry you get when someone strikes trough your defence); oppositly a berzerker would have not feel the domage thus decreasing his dafence and having no rage from it, while being fullfiled in his opponent blood making him more starving for more.</div></div><hr />

You mean the game of the millenium isn't perfectly balanced and fair and every class is complete bliss to play like everyone was touting for months?  I was expecting to see posts of fanbois years from now still having wet dreams about the perfect game that was WoW.<br />

<br />
We said it was superior to EQ, and it is, in literally every way.   You may not be playing WoW now, but you will be when SoE gets done taking ideas and patching EQ to &quot;WoWQuest&quot;</div></div><hr />

Its not perfect but its still more enjoyable than EQ to some of us. I spent 5 1/2 years playing my warrior without being able to accomplish anything on my own, having to rely on a group if not a guild to support me in everything I wanted to do to improve my character. Even with some of the class balance issues, I can still solo; I can still tradeskill to create some top notch gear to use; I can still log in and do something productive with an hr. There are some negatives, because nothing is perfect, but its still enough of an improvement that my EQ warrior is now retired.<br />
<br />
Now if you want to keep fighting the class balance war with the same people, almost 6 years after release, as well as deal with the game imposed cockblocks that EQ has, feel free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In WoW I can solo...for good xp, in EQ up untill recently (and only in certain places like PoV) I could solo with alot of downtime between pull's, or could kill light blues nearly anywhere, again with significant down time every other pull or so.<br />
<br />
I WOW at lvl 32, a good portion of my gear is self made.  I can work traaeskill's pretty easily without a 50% failure rate, or 100 successes in a row before I get a skill up.  THen I can sell the gear to a vendor for profit, OR depending on the item, sell it to plyers for REAL profit. <br />
<br />
In WoW Item's drop from soloing, or in group that I can actualy use at my lvl, in EQ this only started happening with OoW, and then rarely.  I WoW, quest's give out either great gear, or Juicy xp ... or both ... in EQ in 4 years, I could coun the number of Quests I have done that didn't have to do with progression or an expansions &quot;quest armor&quot; on one hand...cause they were simply not worth it.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not saying that WoW is perfect ... not at all, what i am saying is that it is 100% mor balanced in the classes than EQ ever was ... it just need's some tweaking to make it better, especially in PVP...this is an area that most EQ player's never bothered to look at as they didn't play on a PVP server, and who the hell cared about Dueling.  If PVP had been as big a part of the game in EQ as it is in WoW ... I can guarentee you the warrior class in EQ woudl have been almost nonexistent ... no one would play one.  YOu'd have one or two per guild TOP'S...and that woudl be just for MT-ing the raid mobs.....would prol been a part time hydra even, and only pulled out when needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they are crazy for trying, but Blizz has done a great job balancing 3 different games into one: solo, group/raid, PvP  <br />
<br />
EQ PvP was pure ass.  That there were even PvP servers made me laugh.  While WoW warriors may not be the offensive powerhouses folks want them to be, they are quite viable in PvP.  We've got more tools to mess up the others guys game than you can shake a stick at AND we can still deal some really wicked damage.<br />
<br />
Its gonna be real intersting to see the battlegrounds and if its gonna be totally raid, group, or 1v1 oriented.  I'm hoping the warrior class is gonna shine in the group PvP setting there.  I think they do pretty damn good already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Balance is only a perception.<br />
<br />
For soloing people are satisfied that they can solo, even though it is certainly not balanced.<br />
<br />
For grouping, the game is easy enough that you can get away with stuff like having no healer and a pet tank through an instance.  So for the most part people are happy too.<br />
<br />
For PvP, Blizzard knows very well that an extremely imbalanced PvP game is balanced from their previous experiences in RTS games, because the overpowered people will do everything they can to squash opposition so they can continue to enjoy being overpowered.  For example you see alliance clearly has an advatage PvP (have more people), and clearly some classe are harder to kill in PvP than others, but that's okay because the side that's powerful is the majority (at least relative to the weaker side) who will drown out legitmate concerns anyway.<br />
<br />
It is not that WoW is balanced, it is just not relevant to most of what you're doing, especialy for PvP.  It hardly matters if you're an overpowered class when you're ganked 3 to 1 anyway.</div></div><hr />

I guess you've never played Diablo 2, a Blizzard game.  This doesn't just benefit warriors.  It would benefit  any char that needs to change weapons depending on the situation.  One shouldn't need to spend hours setting up macros to switch weps, or constantly have a bag open while in combat.  That just doesn't make sense, a fighter rifling through bags in combat searching for a wep while he's taking a beating from a monster.<br />
<br />
This would make it so there is a bonus for being in Defensive, and there would never be any reason to use Battle.  There's a reason that there's different stances, and it's because there are different situations for using them.  Defensive is perfectly fine as is, and does not need an upgrade like this.  Ditto with the Berseker change.  It makes both of them MORE useful than battle in all circumstances, and that's not how they're supposed to be.  <br />
<br />
 I disagree, since one can't use many abilities in defensive, including POTIONS, I don't see many solo or PvP warriors running around constantly in defensive.  All I would propose is a buff to these stances to make them more situational.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason for a 35 rage number at all, other than for the mortal strike freaks. This is frivilous.  The way the class is set up is to encourage you to pick a stance and use it for awhile. <br />
<br />
 In no way do I see that Bliz intended for warriors to chose a stance and use it 99% of the time.  The change would remove the penalty for the player to actually use his head and adapt his fighting to the situation.  Currently, without TM talent, a warrior might as well just stay in Battle and autoattack.  Any attempt to adapt just puts him farther behind the situation.  The 35 rage is indeed for MS, the ONLY decent Teir7 talent at a warriors disposal.<br />
<br />
Retarded beyond belief.  See above.  You're not supposed to have all skills available all the time.  I realize some people have been playing with cheat codes on for all these years, but as I said before, Balance =/= overpowering a class.<br />
<br />
 How is giving a player a more enjoyable, but less effective way to play his complex char retarded?  One may coast through the game in battle with this change, but in no way would he be as effective as a player who utilized all 3 stances.  This would also promote the changes to DEF and BER stances.  Give the player choices and reward him for making them.<br />
<br />
Battle shout is already the best damage per rage point ability we have, especially in groups of 5.  It doesn't need a buff.<br />
<br />
So, you think it's okay for Paladins to cast a 5min buff whenever they want , in combat or not, without a single talent spent.  But, warriors are required to use 20 rage points every 2min or less to achieve a similar effect.  Rage is almost our only way of tuanting and increasing DPS, why should be sacrifice a chunk nearly every battle?  I just want it brought more in line with similar buffs.<br />
<br />
The rest of your talent suggestions are basically completely ridiculous, and it's clear that you gave no thought at all to them other than &quot;WE NEED MORE DAMAGE!&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
You're right!  That's why I offered suggestions for ungimping Anticipation and widening the gap between warrior and paladin hitpoints.  Warriors in any RPG are supposed to be the masters of armed combat.  I want the warriors put ahead of the other fighters in terms of weapon mastery.  That's not to say warriors should out DPS rogues.  Rogue abilities with their weapons should always outdamage warriors due to the sacrifice in mitigation and defence they suffer.  As for rage, I don't see why Blizzard couldn't scale down rage numbers to account for the increase in warrior DPS.<br />
<br />
There are things that need a slight tweak in this game.  None of the things that you listed are in that category.<br />
<br />
You're entitled to your own opinion.  I hope talking to yourself never gets old.  Thanks for the clarification though.  Your first responce was less than helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree, since one can't use many abilities in defensive, including POTIONS, <br />
<br />
This is news to me since I use anywhere from 3-5 potions per instance, and I never leave Defensive.<br />
<br />
 In no way do I see that Bliz intended for warriors to chose a stance and use it 99% of the time. <br />
<br />
The fact that you lose all your rage is the intent.  If they wanted you to be able to use all abilities all the time, it wouldn't happen.  They encourage you to play smart and figure out what you're going to need beforehand.  Once you learn that, you are old enough to unlock TM and get 3 or 5 ranks to handle your situations better if you prefer to spend points on it.  Once again, god mode isn't how this is gonna work.<br />
<br />
 How is giving a player a more enjoyable, but less effective way to play his complex char retarded? <br />
<br />
What you're asking for isn't less effective, it's &quot;I'm too lazy to switch stances when I need certain abilities.&quot;  This is a men from the boys type thing and it exists in all blizzard games.  You can do things the easy way and get by for the beginning of the game, but later on you're going to need to learn how to do more complicated things or you're not going to progress.  All of my mobs in instances end up hamstrung, even tho I prefer to be in defensive for the aggro generation.  How do I do it?  Well, by golly, it must be fucking magic.<br />
<br />
So, you think it's okay for Paladins to cast a 5min buff whenever they want , in combat or not, without a single talent spent. But, warriors are required to use 20 rage points every 2min or less to achieve a similar effect. Rage is almost our only way of tuanting and increasing DPS, why should be sacrifice a chunk nearly every battle? I just want it brought more in line with similar buffs. <br />
<br />
Mental note...paladins are not warriors.  The warrior's augment to his group is by being a leader IN BATTLE.<br />
<br />
That being said, it's not hard to pop bloodrage every 2 minutes and have your  20 rage to shout.   I guess that never occured to you either.  Don't try to tell me it's inneffective either...you're either in a group where there is enough healing to use it, or you're soloing and you can easily make up for the 10 seconds it takes to use it by slapping a bandage on as soon as you hit bloodrage.  I'm starting to see why you think you need all these improvements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unclebong gave an easy solution for the weapon switches w/the cosmos suggestion.   But here's another solution for it involving cosmos, put your sword/board set up in and type /saveset 1, then make a hotkey that says /loadset 1 and everytime you hit that hotkey you'll load your sword/board set up, do the same for your dw/2hand set up or whatever else blows your skirt up.  <br />
Hope that helped a bit, Aka</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the weapon switching, the way I see it is that since you can do it with Cosmos and presumably other mods, and it obviously provides a benefit, and it isn't illegal, might as well make it part of the game.<br />
<br />
Now whether they've time to implement every thing that 'would be nice' is another question entirely.  Until they do just use Cosmos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some good points made regarding being willing to use all the abilities that Warriors bring to the table and that sometimes is going to require stance changes.  I see some problems with this though in that if you're in a group where you need lots of aggro control, that means you need lots of rage to dump onto mobs.  And losing rage switching stances makes it more difficult to hold that aggro.  It's teeter tater kind of thing, which is not something required by the other classes to a high degree, that I've seen.  So it appears to me that playing a Warrior well in an instance requires an even higher level of skill, ability to anticipate, knowledge of the class' capabilities than is required for any of the other classes.  Which means to me that when I'm in an instance I'm working my ass off all the time while my group may be in cruise mode.<br />
<br />
My Warrior is now level 51.  I spend perhaps 15% of my time in instances, maybe 5% or 10% in small groups outside of instances, and the rest solo.  And I'm finding it harder and harder to solo effectively as I level.  It seems that the Warrior class becomes less effective solo as it levels rather than more.  I'm finding that the AH doesn't offer any more significant improvements and that the flow of gear begins to slow to a trickle past level 50.  And I'm finding that the quests get harder to do alone with a higher precentage of them being elite quests that are typically in an instance.<br />
<br />
So, I'm about ready to table my Warrior indefinitely, because the class doesn't support the majority of my playing time well at all.  If I were spending more like 80% of my time in instances perhaps I'd feel better about the class as a whole.</div></div><hr />
