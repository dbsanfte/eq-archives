<br />
There is a patch on the 8th. It will more than likely do NOTHING to address any of the problems myself and a myriad other warriors have brought up over the past year in regards to the Warrior class. After that, though, supposedly some type of melee retrofitting is going to take place. As usual, the only thing to do is wait.<br />
<br />
Will we be happy with the results? IMO, no. If it's the Taunt Energy idea that Rich Waters is toying with, it'll be far too little too late. If it's introducing major hybird penalties and about 300 new Warrior only items, there may be hope.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind if they do anything at all, it's likely to be extremely minor, (ie a 10-20 percent taunt increase) and 15 percent DPS increase so  I wouldn't get your hopes up for major retuning.<br />
<br />
If they do major warrior overhaul, it retunes all the NPC warriors as well, and as it is now, they are easy pickins :)</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'm being the myopic one here but I would love to see my Taunt DoT idea implemented. Kills several birds with one stone. Makes us the masters of a basically untapped resource (multi-tanking) and has the side effect of upping our DPS along with certain caveats. I just wish some of these developers would actually READ these ideas and throw us a bone.</div></div><hr />

Insider information says that the patch on the 8th adds Type 8 Augments and a slew of other augments to LDoN vendors as well as some tweaking to the normal/high dungeons as well as Raid level tweaking. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, amongst all bloodletting here and on the SK boards, there were a few decent ideas.  One SK posted a list of ideas, some that I liked, others that I didn't, but the main idea was that SoE needs to come up with some ideas to make warriors more fun.<br />
<br />
Anyway, setting aside for now the numerous ideas on taunt, aggro lock, mitigation, unhooked disciplines, etc that we have beaten well beyond death for over a year now, here are a few ideas I either blatantly stole or came up with I think independently-<br />
<br />
Rampage like a mob - stolen from Vicaire on the SK boards.  Either change the current rampage or give us a new AA and allow us to get an extra round of attacks on a separate target.  Mostly importantly, we have to be able to turn it off!<br />
<br />
Sharing mana/brains - either a new innate ability or AA that allows a warrior to increase the mana pool of all the casters by some (subtantial) percentage of the mana on the warrior's gear.  Similarly, for every say, 50 combined points of additional intelligence and wisdom on our gear, we boost the mana regen of all casters in group by 1, over and above the FT cap.  This would definitely increase the value that we bring to a group as well as deal with carrying around a ton of brain stats and mana that do us absolutely no good.<br />
<br />
Increase the berserk range substantially.  Maybe tie it in to the Combat Fury AA progression.  Perhaps once someone has all of the improved critical AAs they be berserk at all times.  Someone else mentioned something like this so I thought I'd throw it in.<br />
<br />
Just a few ideas, only one of which would really create a change in our desirability, but it is at least something different from the endless debates regarding aggro, mitigation, taunt, disciplines, knights.  These changes should not be in lieu of significant changes to the warrior class but happen along side.  Hopefully others have some ideas for changes that might be outside our normal box of gripes.</div></div><hr />

We're not bards. We're not buffers, healers, or anything else that deals with using mana on others. If we have to live with multi class gear, WE need to benifit from everything just like all the other classes that can use said items can. INT to SAVES, MANA to HPs. 1:1 ratio might be overpowering, but 1:3 wouldn't be too much.<br />
<br />
Warrior gear should make warriors better not other classes. No way in hell I'm going to sit around with a LFG tag on waiting for a raid to start because I didn't have high enough wis/int/mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they are stumped.  The framework they have for EQ now has zero application for anyone that is just melee.<br />
<br />
Basic melee has been stretched as far as it can go.  In some cases its been stretched too far.  More HP/AC/whatever won't fix Warrior problems.  Monkeying with the numbers on Warrior gear I fear won't help that much.  I keep saying Warriors need new skills but I now wonder if new features need to be added first to allow new skills to integrate easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have the exact quote, but the comment that said in essence that 'We are aware of the issues Warriors are facing and are looking for a way to help them without breaking the game.' does give us a hint what they are thinking IMO.<br />
<br />
IF we assume that Paladin abilities are not seen as game breaking, it must be because their survivability is viewed as not great enough to cross the line.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the concern must be that improving Warrior aggro abilities in combination with our perceived superior survivability would be potentially game breaking.<br />
<br />
This is consistant with what I've heard was SoE's stance on this issue. I would expect any change that occurs to reflect this viewpoint even if it can be demonstrated that it was in error and resulted in the situation Warriors currently find themselves.<br />
<br />
EB weapons, stun procs, the Taunt button, and AE Taunt were all an effort to give Warriors functional but vastly inferior taunt. We claim it's too inferior and they seem to believe it's working as designed.<br />
<br />
I realize this is all speculation, but to be honest they haven't given us much information to do anything else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruk the fat</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly dont see the point of nerfing SKs/Pallys. What should be done is increasing warrior taunt in some way. Perhaps add a /disc taunt that increases aggro by say 200% during 3 minutes and a big initial taunt. This would enable warriors to choose between greater damage migitation or superior aggro depending on the situation. Nerfing knights will not help clerics/shamans etc dying when warriors tank. This method would also be fair to the knights since they wouldent be totally outmatched by wars on all encounters since the warriors cant use defensive if they choose to generate more aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Furor's dot-taunt idea really is the way to go. We're talking about additional DPS, multi-warrior agro stacking, and most importantly, very viable agro generation. Only 2 things I'd fix about it.<br />
<br />
1) Range. Currently, warriors have no level of ranged agro. Because it will take 1 tick, 6 seconds before the first wave hits, it should have some range. doesn't have to be tremendous, but should have more range than regular taunt by far<br />
<br />
2) Damage output. 25dps is a bit too high adjustment at 65. Not that I mind, but this will just shove monks in an even deeper hole. Vs. knight damage output, it's an arguable increase but it will just destroy monks. I think scale the damage to about 15dps and increase monk damage output and rogues accordingly. <br />
<br />
That + a 5% innate increase in HP and warriors are balanced. Barring fucked up itemization of course, which will happend, but we can keep hoping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As retarded as it sounds Oderry (and yeah, I'll admit, it isn't the greatest idea ever), the mana/brain sharing idea does give us something that we have never had.  Utility.  As well as value to a group outside of tanking.  Personally, I've advocated in other threads converting mana to hp but that idea has been around for a long time and if SoE hasn't implemented it by now, I doubt they will ever do it.  Thus I came up with the retarded idea since it is at least something different.<br />
<br />
I wonder how it is that paladins are not considered game breaking anyway.  Almost total aggro lock combined with the ability to eventually tank almost every boss in the game.  Sure some guilds may choose to continue to use warriors as MTs but as many Time guild folks have mentioned, Paladins (and to a somewhat lesser extent SKs) can eventually tank most of the Time gods without the benefit of our 3 minutes of glory discs.  That would suggest that our vaunted mitigation advantage is nearly meaningless.<br />
<br />
Since it seems obvious that SoE is in no hurry to return warriors to the state where they are the best at the only role they have and specialize in then perhaps we should look for other solutions.  I honestly don't think that SoE is capable of finding a solution to the abject state or warriors and to a lesser extent the other pure melees.  Thus it seems to me that our best option for any kind of continued viability as a class is to come up with ideas that give us new and creative roles and abilities beyond tanking.  This will obviously not fly with the &quot;I made a warrior to be the best tank, not X, Y, or, Z&quot; crowd but perhaps it is time to wake up and smell the coffee that it is now our job to brew.  We are dinosaurs, relics of the Kunark era.  The rest of the game has evolved and the small furry mammals aren't so small anymore and they've have grown some big ass teeth.  We either evolve and fill new roles or we go extinct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it's not inferior, per se. The weaker aggro generating abilities of a warrior would be just fine, IF the aggro generating abilities of knights in comparison weren't so superior, and IF the game engine the way XP grouping works didn't create a path of least resistance where SNAP aggro was the way to go.<br />
<br />
In other words, if PoP mobs were different, and if knight aggro were much shakier than it currently is ... Warrior aggro would be fine.<br />
<br />
It's not necesarily the classes that are designed bad. It's the way they act in the limited combat environment.</div></div><hr />

However, I do like the group boosting possibility.<br />
<br />
Since we are warriors, why not increase the atk and ac of the group.  Each additional warrior in a group increases the atk of the group members by their level.  They increase the AC of group members by half their level.</div></div><hr />

This would be viewed as great utility for all LDoN (all indoor zones in general).<br />
<br />
Need to add this to the general brainstorming thread too.<br />
<br />
Sorry, talk about giving warriors utility along the lines of mana regen and this just popped in my head.  We now return to your original thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been over this so many times :p, my old post 'Three into one doesn't go' has disappeared from the forum now :p<br />
<br />
Basically I believe consigning plate tanks to all fight over the same single slot is one of the major root problems and advocated increased ability to fend for themselves as 'viable' secondary group members and  to (at the extreme)even be able to form all plate tank groups if neccessary. <br />
<br />
For warriors one of the primary abilities I included was a skill called 'cripple' in effect  a slow spell (50%) on first glance that might look massively overpowered, however the costs associated were also high :- Cripple was melee range only and could only be retried if resisted every 10 seconds (a marked disadvantage vs normal slow casters), soon as the warrior tried to cripple he would be dropped to aggressive disc level mitigation for a minute  period and the slow carried similar aggro to a standard slow therefore the warrior could not tank effectively whilst slowing (thus avoiding 'god mode') and promoting the expectation of a second tank to grab aggro off him to prevent serious difficulty (tanks stacking!), there would have been a requirement to limit such an ability against uber mobs (although the warrior would almost certainly die anyway). <br />
<br />
This gave warriors a useful secondary ability when not tanking (one of several proposed) without impinging to unfair levels upon the 'dedicated' classes. Any number of skills/spells currently considered the domain of casters only could be provided to a warrior as neat little tricks to help out the party, none of them on their own would be massively powerful 'oh my god we must have a warrior' type skills but they would bring new opportunities to the warrior to actively support the group's efforts in any number of small ways.<br />
<br />
to my mind, one of the greatest fundamental flaws with the warrior class set up is that the warrior is often a very 'passive' contributor to the group. He tries to hold aggro whilst everyone else manages theirs, he relies on everyone else to keep him alive and generally doesn't get much chance to pro-actively 'make a contribution'. (DPs and successful aggro control are in many ways a meaningless abstraction you don't 'see' anything happening).<br />
<br />
For me at least this lack of ways to make a 'noticeable' difference when tanking was always something of a frustration, When NOT tanking it's twice as bad, you feel more like a burden on the group with no way to pay the debt back apart from making groupsay a bit more fun :p, to me /shield is much more important than it's actual impact simply for that reason. Wether you 'fix' the class or not greater ability to make a contribution that both the warrior and his groupmates can see would greatly increase this warriors enjoyment of a class he refuses to quit. <br />
<br />
I ramble. :p<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
*edit* To my mind, any skills thus provided to a warrior should all be the consequences of special attacks or similar melee range (or group based) only processes - the Warrior is all about being upfront in the thick of things not standing back in a calculated 'cowardly' fashion. <br />
<br />
Given SoE is apparantly unsure of ways to 'spice up' pure melee within the current framework that they have set for them then perhaps their only recourse (as i said in the Absor thread a while back) is to start thinking 'outside the box'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was thinking today...<br />
<br />
Paladin aggro is just a little bit better than Shaman Aggro..<br />
<br />
I think to balance then Paladins should have HP/AC on par with shaman...<br />
<br />
That would seem balanced, since it would be UNBALANCED to give warriors aggro on par with paladins..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kether</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple question: Should a Knight be able to tank this mob with zero problems? Should a Knight be <br />
<br />
able to tank all of the mobs in this phase and prior phases with no problems? <br />
<br />
<br />
You are defining the case where hp, an effective mitigation or avoidance discipline, and healing power is no longer critical to the success of the engagement because the encouter is trivial to your force in those regards.  If all of those conditions exist it is no surprise that the other tank classes could tank such an encounter.  This is nothing new.  That SK has 7 time loots, including a Quarm item.  Toss 7 nice VT items on a Knight and they could have tanked VT named during SoL provided the healing was 'sufficient'.  This is nothing new.<br />
<br />
So there is nothing *inherently* wrong with that person being able to tank adequately a scenario that by raid force and personal gear have defeated many times.<br />
<br />
I could do earth rings with guild rangers tanking, ating, etc.  Does this mean they are too powerful?  <br />
<br />
No.  They can do so *only* because the items they acquired from raid after raid of warrior tanking the mobs that dropped the items.<br />
<br />
The BALANCE issue it multi-fold.<br />
<br />
A large part of the problem is CONTENT unfortunately that cross the traditional main tank and add tank lines.<br />
<br />
AS IS warriors do not have sufficient fast aggro to enable the pulling/debuffing you NEED to do in LDoN raids given the time and death counts.  Hence knights may be more effective given healing is sufficient and aggro is paramount.  AS IS said fast relative aggro is the *sole* reason for a knight to ever AT.  With lower hp/ac/no disc/lower taunt/no ae taunt and aggro generation reliant upon cast times and channelled spells.<br />
<br />
Saying there is the 'non-tanking utility' role for knights that has large value to play on raids would be akin to me claiming that warriors would be fine relegated to /shielding other persons and going for DPS.<br />
<br />
There may be more to a raid than the big boss at the end.  But unless your people are different folks don't get excited by:<br />
<br />
Me:  &quot;X is up, we  have great knights on so we are going to clear 95% of the mobs&quot;.  <br />
raid: &quot;What about the final Boss with the best items?&quot; <br />
Me:  &quot;Well, we don't have a warrior and without a ridiculous healer turnout it's not feasible, so don't plan on killing him.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am not here to &quot;prevent a knight nerf&quot;.  I have held to balanced lines far into the past including refuting fellow knights pleas for a rip disc during RoK and a defensive one during SoV/SoL.<br />
<br />
How weak knights were during RoK isn't relevent except as a lesson of how a class can slip into an 'irrelevent' state and to use that lesson to prevent it from happening again.  Neither is it relevent that stuns didn't originally generate agro.  CH rotations, main tanking (esp using defensive for tanking as opposed to using it to flea), and knight aggro abilities may not have been 'envisioned' originally but it is hard to argue from the encounters of the past 2 years that such is not the roughly desinged case.  Encounters such as Creator and Emp in Ssra were explicitly designed to relay on no to low damage ATing that was done by knights, this is nothign new. <br />
<br />
Defaming persons as 'exploiters' who use spells to garner aggro that may otherwise not affect the mob is neither productive nor fair.  Arguments that similarly portray mob reaction to spells like stun as illogical based on a an assumption that the mob would be an intelligent creature are flawed.  Should mob X care if you try to stun him if he can not be stunned?  No.  Should elemental god Y of presumed intelligence focus on the one tank being healed by a bunch of clerics because the warrior at his feet are jumping up to their ankles and biting them?  No, of course not.  The god would ignore the tanks completely and wipe the raid in seconds.<br />
<br />
So what IS important is the synergy of class and ENCOUNTER design.  <br />
<br />
I doubt any would actually argue that warriors are anywhere near irrelevent or replaceable on raids through the elemental level when said encounters are a challenge to the guild.  These knights that may be tanking Time encounters are doing so on the backs of many rewards made possible by the tanking of a warrior.  Hence it seems clear that warriors are already dominant in 'cutting-edge' boss tanking.  Even though discs do not last the length of the encounter it does not indicate they are not valuable; they add an undeniable margin of safety vs. death by massive mod dps on the MT for that period of time.  The fact that our warriors die far more frequenly when their disc is down that: A. the disc is important, and that B. we have yet to trivialize the encounter (by numbers, gear, or skill) to the point where it is only a small factor.<br />
<br />
As far as I know no one has completed the time level raids.  So we do not know what lays at the end.  <br />
<br />
What if its a mob(s) that *require* defensive warriors to tank (possibly even transitions)?  If said raid is futile without those warriors to tank the boss why is it inherently unfair for the raid to be difficult, even impossible without knights to tank the trash?<br />
<br />
In regards to XP settings:  Knights have more utility (warriors have less, not zero).  Warriors have more shear tanking power should it be necessary for a single defining encounter (again, boss-at-end scenario).  The logical scenario is for one tank type to possess an 'edge' on one of those, but the edge should be simply that, an edge, not an insurmountable barrier.  Therefore the possible need for a secondary healer for a knight on a named/etc is a valid justification for the need for some degree of cautiousness in regards to group aggro.

<br />
However increasing it (and/or decreasing knights) to the point where there is no perceivable difference between warriors and knights for said mobs removes the tanking 'strength' of knights all together.

Its not a legitimate platform to want to &quot;give up everything for X&quot; when X is an irreplaceable role as a justification of complete role dominance.  Hence power should be balanced with power, and utility with utility.  The means SOE will use to achieve that end is unknown at this time but I would predict it would please most of the warriors who find themselves unfairly LFG but not satisfy those whose contention is that they are no longer the only class able to tank mobs of worth.</div></div><hr />

This can still basically be translated back to 'you tank in raids so we should be better than you in exp.' Sorry, but it cannot work like that either. Setting aside the poxy itemisational fixes and giving knights and warriors identical weapons, you can likely tank now perfectly adequately in comparison with a warrior even without aggro spells entirely, the warrior might have an edge in that respect but then there has to be some cost to that spellbook that is relevant to more than 1-5% of the exp content. <br />
<br />
The situation i agree is fubarred, but in this imperfect situation the class that gains least from additional abilities (how many times throughout my career i wonder would i have killed for a heal spell, a root, a stun or two?) isn't really being an evil greedy git to expect a mild advantage, it makes doing without all that neat stuff seem foolish otherwise.  <br />
<br />
I do not believe loss of an unassailable aggro advantage will 'return knights to Kunark'. They'll simply be warriors with a few less hp's but a number of extra abilities to add to the mix instead. Campaigning to change the environment so that your abilities are more properly valued is fairer than protectionism of an unbalanced advantage. LdoN seems to me to be an example of an environment that does exactly that.<br />
<br />
In my more depressed moments I feel that it's impossible to make the game truly balanced to all concerned.  Ideally all plate tanks would have virtually the same mitigation, virtually identical ability to control a mob and lots of secondary utility to make them viable in a back up position. As we stand now defensive is too deeply imbedded to remove, and if you did so on raids warriors would have nothing much in their favour anyway, warriors would need to be rebuilt from the ground up to give them anything of use..<br />
<br />
However, if the ideal can't be obtained then i'm sorry to say that I do not see why warriors should be the 'fall guy' class, knights as they stand now will have throughout their careers much more in the way of positives to 'balance the books' than any warrior. <br />
<br />
Lets get real here, just because a warrior has a mild advantage in the only role that he was made for doesn't mean knights will never tank or get spaces in a group where their 'unneccessary' abilities provide a useful contribution, we all know this and we also know that a warrior who doesn't tank provides far less and is a far less enjoyable class to play in a secondary capacity. <br />
<br />
Kunark involved so many more factors than a few less hp and ac....<br />

<br />
Where the hell did this idea come from anyway?  Lemme break this down for you.  WARRIOR'S ARE TANKS.  THAT'S ALL THEY DO.  In no case, EVER should anyone be a BETTER choice than a warrior to tank things.  It's in the same logic that a cleric is a healer, and that's all they do.  Do druids not get groups because clerics are the best healers?  No, of course not.  In fact, I rarely group with a cleric, and there is a 65 druid healing me most of the time.  Saying that knights will not get groups is like saying druids can't get groups because clerics heal better than they do.  It's bullshit.  The obvious counterargument from knights would be &quot;Well you don't get a druid just because you want healing, you want healing and utility&quot; and of course the irony will go right over their heads.<br />
<br />
I don't want knights to not get groups, I don't think anyone here does.  I think that the majority of knights are just mortified by a couple of horror stories from the few knights that have been playing since Kunark (that's right, I'm willing to bet the majority of you people who claim you've been around that long are full of crap).  In a perfect solution, the warrior will be the best tank in every situation...considerably less mana will be used to keep him standing, but that does not mean that things will be untankable by knights.  Much like a druid can not completely fill the role of a cleric in terms of healing power, knights should not completely fill the role of a warrior as a tradeoff for the utility they bring to the table....BUT YOU SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO TANK ADEQUATELY.</div></div><hr />

Uhm, not that I agree with all of Kether's post - but I believe you misinterpreted it.  What he is saying is that Knights should maintain an advantage with aggro leaving them a group role and a raid role.

Hello to Pre-Sol (I personally think SoL was very balanced).  Knights had a ton of utility in Velious.  With all of that utiltiy I was still laughed out of many zones during the velious time due to the fact that we were inferior tanks to warrior's.  Sure, our healing spells are better - however, how many xp groups is anyone in today that does not have an adequate healer (druid or cleric)?  If warrior's were the clear cut tank, then why would a group invite a knight?  Or put another way, does a warrior get invited for dps?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I do think knight aggro has to be reduced (I also vote to remove KEI from the game).  Number one thing I would do is eliminate aggro from spells that do not affect a mob.  The AC/HP difference between knights and warrior's would be the next thing I would increase.  However, I also firmly believe that balance will occur when groups grab the first available tank because the advantages/disadvantges balance out.</div></div><hr />

OMG me and Haass agree on something!!<br />
<br />
Seriously though i don't think any warrior was asking for a full out knight nerf UNTIL the knight started arguing the fact that warriors were even broken......<br />
Now alot of warriors are jumping on the NERF THE KNIGHT bandwagon out of pure fustration. Warriors as stated in the above quote have no utility. So you tell me honestly is it okay to have your ONLY job taken from you because you can't keep the mobs attention?</div></div><hr />

<br />
firstly i don't believe i misunderstood kether :)<br />
<br />
Perception used to favour warriors in Luclin, perception favoured knights in PoP. there is always going to be a percieved 'best' option. I'm willing to bet even between paladins and SK's in PoP there was not a balanced 50/50 split on groups, simply put though there was enough demand so that supply was outstripped whilst warriors were a clear third choice - that meant all the knights made hay while the sun shined. <br />
<br />
If we accept that one of the three tank classes will always be percieved as the best overall, can you please tell me why the class that provides least in a support capacity should not be mildy favoured for the primary tank role?<br />
<br />
So long as choices are made someone will be tank of choice - the ONLY way to proceed is to mitigate this problem as much as we can by fostering an environment where multiple tanks can stack (much like multiple priest classes, DPS and support classes can) and attempt to provide to all tanks valid 'stacking abilities' so that both they and groups can see that they are making a meaningful contribution. <br />
<br />
Even so, when it comes to the crunch warriors are sad to say supposed to be the specialist - to make them enough of a generalist that we can ignore them in that respect would require a massive overhaul that i can't see happening.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I'm wrong but from what I've seen of my knight friends capabilities LDoN seems likely to favour the overall package provided by a knight tank even without snap aggro (certainly on normal) from that viewpoint what we're asking here seems quite minor.... :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am the clear cut tank in my guild (read as &quot;Small group of friends&quot;), period.  I'm the best equipped, i've been playing the longest, I have the most AA's, I have the most in game knowledge.  I pushed like mad to get a paladin in my guild and in my groups...do you know why? Brells, group heals, Symbols when my group doesn't contain a cleric, even downtime heals like Celestial cleansing get used quite often in my groups, simply because my groups aren't composed of idiots and we know what UTILITY is.<br />
<br />
Why is this so fuckin hard to understand?  I WANT PALADINS AROUND, NOT FOR THEIR TANKING, BUT FOR THEIR UTILITY.  Jesus fuckin christ.  I can make the same argument for shadowknights as well if you'd like, and i'm sure it will be necessary at some point because of the inability for the Troll Knights here to understand simple concepts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sort of true, I'll admit.  It certainly is possible for people to not learn everything they should as a support class, particularly a DPS support class, when the tank has aggro lock.  But lots of very smart players who know a great deal about their class aren't particularly thrilled with having to constantly agonize over whether or not they can afford one more nuke without getting pwned by the mob.  Or whether or not they should wait another 10 seconds before slowing, as the tank drops faster than a brick.<br />
<br />
And to reduce Knight aggro control down towards Warrior levels would require some massive nerfing to the aggro produced by a ton of spells.  And you'd have to consider how reducing the aggro on these spells, particularly those shared with other classes, would impact the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
While I'm sure my opinion doesn't carry any amount of real weight, it seems that nerfing the Knights aggro control has the potential of dumbing down the game even more for everyone but the Warriors and the Knights.  Because once you nerf the aggro to all those things Knights can and do use to gain aggro, how do you keep the other classes from over using the crap out of them with little to no fear of pulling aggro?<br />
<br />
This would require that you tune them just for Knights.  How realistic is it to expect that kind of fine tuning from SoE?  I'm dubious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm sure I'll get reamed for this, but here goes anyways. Warriors and Knights are all &quot;tanks&quot;. This word &quot;tank&quot; gets thrown around a lot and used in different contexts, but the fact of the matter is, they are all designed to primarily be the one taking the damage from the mob. The warrior, the &quot;specialist&quot;, is supposed to be the best at absorbing punishment, and for the most part, this is true. The other tanks are supposed to have lesser ability to absorb punishment, but have other skills (spells) that make up for this. The desired result is a package of equal value. The abilities of one might be better suited to a particualar environment than the skills of the other, but all should be viable choices for a group to choose as a tank. The problem is that the advantages of the specialist are not big enough to offset the additional skills of the generalist.<br />
<br />
Look at clerics and druids for instance. Clerics will always heal better than druids. That however does NOT mean that a cleric is always your best choice for filling the healer slot, because the additional utility of the druid might prove of more value than a bunch of healing power that isn't even required for what you are doing.<br />
<br />
Clerics are much better than druids at healing. Warriors should be much better at taking punishment than knights. But in many circumstances, a druid is just as valuable or more valuable of a group addition in the healer spot as a cleric, as it should be. The difference between cleric and druid healing is significant, as is the difference between cleric and druid utility and DPS. The total package value should be about the same. The problem is that the difference between warrior and knight ability to take a hit is very small, whereas the difference in other skills is very large. This can either be addressed by making the gap in damage absorption larger in relation to knights, or by increasing other warrior skills, or by decreasing knight skills. But the value of the whole package should be equal.</div></div><hr />

As has been pointed out by many and various people the dev's ability to tinker with spells is 'relatively' easy to do compared with melee changes. Can it be that much harder to assign paladins a 'tailored spell list which takes into account the fact that they WANT aggro? You're not talking about redesigning any concepts from scratch simply applying less aggro to the base spell that's already in game.<br />
<br />
lets get back to 'class balance' anyway this is the wrong topic for this discussion.... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gimmel, i doubt that we'll ever see that balance unfortunately, so what we need to do is ensure that as clerics can and do still find groups WITH druids (or vice versa), so Warriors can group together with knights and neither party is a particularly weak link that will passed over as a useless addition. <br />
<br />
The perception at this time is that Knights have acceptably similar mitigation/hp totals in comparison with warriors to be seen a viable tanks (and really that's as it has to be for fairness), whilst warrior aggro in comparison with a knight is generally percieved as being too inferior to be worth the additional hassle. This disparity simply must be addressed before we can go anywhere.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, it is a fact that must be aknowledged that Knights with their spellcasting are much closer to being valued in a stacking arguement than warriors at this time.<br />
<br />
I don't expect that we'll ever see a perfect resolution of this problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is indeed *exactly* what I had meant.<br />
<br />
Take the following hypothetical, let's say this is what happens now:<br />
<br />
Case 1: Mob is Inc, warrior needs 8s to gain firm aggro, then mob is debuffed and slowed.  Without root or a BoW mob may turn on other classes periodically.  Should a 'named' be present or a multi pull be inc tools such as ae taunt and tanking discs can be very useful or even borderling necessary.  However the burden on the poor aggro for the majority of the process is too much of a burden compared to....<br />
<br />
Mob is Inc, paladin stuns repeatedly, debuffed asap, no aggro problems.  However some pulls/named may require a second healer or other tactic.  Paladin spells and other abilities are of various utility.<br />
<br />
Compare that to:<br />
<br />
Case 2: Mob is Inc, warrior needs 2s to gain firm aggro against debuffs.  Mob turns on other classes rarely.  Everything else is the same.<br />
<br />
And <br />
<br />
Case 3: Mob is Inc, warrior has firm aggro with *zero* delay.<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS is why balacing them isn't as brain-dead easy as one would think.  Case 1 for the warrior is the current case and is largely unacceptable given the current state of warrior general utility.  However Case 3 is ALSO unacceptable since it doesn't achieve some sense of overall 'parity' but rather universal supremacy.  In this scenario there are NO other tanks... there are merely others that tank while warriors are dead/not around.<br />
<br />
Case 3 may claim to achieve XP group parity... but what it does as well is destroy the knight AT roll on raids.<br />
<br />
Case 2 is the fine line that has to be walked.  How and what aggro and/or utility do you add to warriors to bring them to perceived and actual OVERALL parity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and Specialists must be the best at their chosen specialty. <br />
<br />
This axiom is flawed.  It is assuming a *great* deal regarding the classes in question.  It could well be argued that warriors 'specialty' it to be the best at absorbing attacks and unparralled at such for moderately short duration.  Paladins' could be fast and copious aggro with excellent durability.<br />
<br />
The problem with warriors is NOT that they aren't the best at their specialty, the problem that this specialty is by definition NARROW.  So much so that their SPECIALIST strength in tanking is largely overshadowing the lack in their GENERALIST'S ability to TANK MOBS.<br />
<br />
TANKING is NOT a specialty.  Healing is NOT a specialty.  Damage is NOT a specialty.  These are ALL GENERAL categories, not specialties.<br />
<br />
WHO is the best for the healer role?  Dependent on the situation that answer is cleric, druid, or even shaman.<br />
WHO is the best DPS?  Depends on the setting.  It could be wizards, it could also be mages,  rogues, rangers, etc.<br />
CC, slowing, etc?  Again, dependent upon circumstances.<br />
<br />
(note that some of those roles are only *part time*, it is fairly common for druids to be a larger net asset to a party and a cleric, since in most cases cleric mana is largely used on NUKES instead of healing, etc.  tanking however is a full-time role and thus to a larger extent reduces the ability to otherwise contribute)<br />
<br />
<br />
WARRIOR'S ARE TANKS. THAT'S ALL THEY DO. In no case, EVER should anyone be a BETTER choice than a warrior to tank things. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is currently false and should remain so.  There are over a dozen classes, there are six class spots.  IF there was a class with 1/5th the HP of a rogue with a 5 defense skill cap would it be balanced if they did 2k dps?  After all they 'gave up everything' for it?  Of course not.  Was it balanced for clerics to have a 10k CH but druids having 1k heals and this being 'balanced' by great differences in utility?  Of course not.<br />
<br />
The LIKELY fix for the warrior dilemma would be the addition of UTILITY as well as some form of ability aggro that would CLOSE but NOT eliminate the speed and security of their aggro in relation to knights.  It is highly probable that this ability would NOT work while under a discipline.  This would place them on more even footing with knights for general tank roles while preserving the max aggro edge for knights especially in raid AT roles.<br />

You try very hard to make the point that Main Tank is a role, not a class and therefore Warriors shouldn't be the best at it.<br />

However you follow this with:<br />

You object to the Warriors having superiority in the role found in their Class Description (which can be read at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp), yet in the same post you insist on Knight superiority in the role of raid AT.<br />
<br />
So, let me get this right. Knights should be superior MTs to Warriors in a big piece of the current content and also have superiority in the raid AT role because roles are not classes.<br />

<br />
so basicly we can pull of moves like the monks do but its based off a bar rather than a timer, so we can save it up and use it more freely, it is used for &quot;power taunts&quot; &quot;super hits&quot;(critcal/crippling blow on demand) and some other crap they are kicking around for EQ2<br />
<br />
think of EQ1 as the new test sever for EQ2, they are gona try the stuff that might break the game on us first before implementing it elsewhere, the best beta testing is done on a open market as players will always try to break it/ exploit it<br />

anyway what i have heard from the fan fair is that they almost laughed at INT casters asking about future spells and did admit that melee was a concern, as well saying taunt isnt going as intended<br />
<br />
again this is mostly the rumor mill as SoE refuses to talk straight to us<br />
<br />
anyhow as for paladins, i do think their agro is a little game breaking, and SoE seems to think that as long as the number of competent 65 paladins is low its ok, as having hundreds of competent warriors with that much power WOULD break the game, but with all the items we now share with knights plus the hundreds of knights blessing and knight only weapons paladins are going to become alot more common in the high end, and mastering the class doesnt take much, so when the numbers catch up to warriors there will be hell to pay, and a narf will happen, honestly i think its SoE's cockup and instead of a class nerf they should beef up each class, put the monsters on a specail database that allows them to scale up their hp and dmg and tinker with it from there, as they are to lazy to go thru each mob and retune it, thats why they favor narfing and over compensation<br />
<br />
well shit, you guys know how it is, we can kick around the melee ball all day but it is usless without the dev team chatting with us, i wish they would reopen the everquest forums and finally open up comunication again(so we can know what abilitys are absolutly not allowed and which they might consider), i feel like a old man sitting on a stone fense playing cards with his buddys, bitching about the world :/ i just feel that SoE is in need of a better forum with their customers<br />

<br />
There is a RAID AT role that is separate from the RAID MT role.  There is NO GROUP AT ROLE (as generally practiced in EQ atm).  Hence in a GROUP setting all tank classes should fulfill the role with approximately the same effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Please, quoting the trite fluffy class descriptions at the EQ site is laughable when talking about the fine point of balacing classes.  There is no doubt warriors primary role is to tank, I have never disputed that.  But those 15 classes fit into far less than 15 roles in a group and it is rather apparent that 'master of X' doesn't mean best in one of those 6 slots in every possibly situation.  Quoting over generalized, over simplified, and out of date marketing descriptions of classes is no more valid than using the past imbalances in this discussion.  There are many mobs I can't stun and far fewer undead of significance than I had anticpated in this game.  Do I harp on those points?  No.<br />
<br />
Do I insist on the superiority of knight as raid AT?  Yes.<br />
Do I insist on the superiority of warrior as raid MT?  Yes.<br />
<br />
So, what exactly is the problem with that?<br />
<br />

Warriors and Knights should bring powers that roughly balance to both groups and raids.  In RAIDS warriors bring that primarily with MT durability, knights with AT speed.  They both should generally be less desirable when assuming the role of the other on a raid.  In GROUPS there is NO AT role and thus both must serve equally well in the GROUP MT ROLE when taken as an entirety.  The abilities of both classes should be such as to maintain the general interchangeability in the more general group role while not obliterating the distinction of the separate raid roles.  As the respective classes possess disctinct strengths there will be times when one may be 'better' than the other.  These strengths should not be overwhelming and the benefits derived from the application of those stengths should be equally rewarding.<br />
<br />
Removing the aggro advantage of knights entirely may 'fix' the imbalance for GROUP MT role, but it would destroy the RAID AT role of the knight.  Therefore this is not an acceptable means of resolving the current discrepency for the GROUP MT role.  It would appear likely that a lesser agro remedy possibly combined with other added utility may be a more reasonably approach.<br />
<br />
Further discussion beyond this point without the context of encounter specifics is futile.  In a dungeon full of trash with no boss the knight may be preferable.  In a dungeon containing a boss tankable soley with defensive the warrior may be irreplaceable.  This is the most simplest of dichotomies used to illustrate the point that balancing classes abilities to desireably fill roles is impossible outside the context of the environment in question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is it unbalancing for warriors to have the ability to get a small boost of agro near beginning of fights, but not unbalancing for knights to have it?<br />
<br />
I don't want to hear any statements about the differences between hybrids and warriors.  I want the actual ability/specialty.  Is it the natural hp bonus (from a small bit more hp per level and higher hp-&gt;sta ratio)?  Is it the 2.5% (blatantly stolen from Gimmel's post :D) less damage taken overall from higher mitigation/avoidance?  Is it /disc defensive/evasive?<br />
<br />
What is the main reason it's somehow &quot;unbalancing&quot; to give warriors higher initial agro?  Anyone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll keep it simple too. I welcome Knights to MT, AT, Offtank or just melee on raids or in groups. Every tank class should be able to shine at doing those jobs and have the opprotunity to do them.<br />
<br />
If Warriors get snap aggo on demand and ranged aggro preventing it from making raid content trivial can be done by disabling it when Defensive is engaged (and providing a non-abusive substitute in the meanwhile).<br />
<br />
Preventing Warriors from using it without using Defensive when add tanking in raids can not be done (off the top of my head).<br />
<br />
But, Warrior groupability should not be held hostage to a high level Paladin raid AT role. <br />
<br />
Inferior aggro ability affects many Warriors who are many levels. Some raid, some don't.<br />
<br />
It isn't just who MT's. (I don't care most of the time, I just object to being catagorically excluded).<br />
<br />
It isn't simply a matter of spending time /lfg (but trying to get that desperately needed Force of YKesha augment as a Warrior looking for a spot in DGuk pickup groups sucks).<br />
<br />
Part of it goes right to the heart of why we chose Warriors. That Class Description you pooh poohed? That's why. I don't expect to do it all the time or even most of the time, but I certainly want to fulfill that description better than most Knights.<br />

<br />
I Have to agree with this statement.  Added utiltity to warriors will not help their groupability.<br />
<br />
From what I have seen five things get you groups - healing, slowing, crowd control, tanking, and dps.  Those things have one caveat - you have to be able to perform the job alone (aside from dps).   In other words, groups do not want two healers anymore then they want two slowers or two tanks.  All the utility in the world means nothing unless it increases the group dps enough to improve efficiency.</div></div><hr />

There is a RAID AT role that is separate from the RAID MT role.  There is NO GROUP AT ROLE (as generally practiced in EQ atm).  Hence in a GROUP setting all tank classes should fulfill the role with approximately the same effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Do I insist on the superiority of knight as raid AT?  Yes.<br />
Do I insist on the superiority of warrior as raid MT?  Yes.<br />
<br />
So, what exactly is the problem with that?<br />

How in the World would giving warriors good aggro DESTROY the Off-Tanking ability of Paladins? <br />
<br />
Explain this point? <br />
<br />
Will it make the Paladin any LESS of an OFF-TANK? NO...<br />
<br />
Do you ACTUALLY ever raid?<br />
<br />
Do you KNOW what Warriors and Paladins do on raids?<br />
<br />
On a typical Elemental PUBLIC Raid, IF we are LUCKY we have 4 Warriors, and usually 6-12 paladins. <br />
<br />
So ALL of the OFF TANKING is done by PALADINS. <br />
<br />
ALL of the warriors do NOTHING During these fights except WAIT for their turn in the MT rotation to die. the next warrior sits patiently while the MT gets the glory waiting for him to die to step on his corpse and /disc defensive + AoE Taunt... <br />
<br />
The Paladins, all get to swing their mighty 2HS PALADIN only POP weapons that has sick insane damage while the warriors struggle with 3-4 expansion old aggro weapons...<br />
<br />
The Paladins Use their CURES and GH's and LoH's to support the fight, while the warriors add their lil dps and hope they dont eat too many ripostses...<br />
<br />
Of course this is only in TIER 4...<br />
<br />
All other places Paladins do OFF-Tanking AND CAN do the MT Role. <br />
<br />
It said on your Sig, that you were from Eci, then you should KNOW of the PUBLIC RAIDING SYSTEM there, and you should KNOW that all your arguments are very Disengenuous. <br />
<br />
Paladins Have MANY times over the role of a warrior on raids, AND they are the prefered MT for EXP Groups...<br />
<br />
What more do you want?<br />

<br />
<br />

haass, can i help you smack some sense into people, stop trying to protecting your fricking precius ranged agro, god damn people i really hate this bullshit about tanking raid mobs means its ok to fuck us in every other aspect, you dont get any xp from boss mobs, you dont go to a boss mob with the intent to AA ding, you go to XP groups, eeexxxx--pppeeeee say it with me now<br />

the xp group roles need to be set aside when you are talking about raid roles, as they are for loot, not xp<br />

there is 1 main tank, there is 1 off tank, out of a 36 man raid that is 2 spots and you can HONESTLY justify trying to keep my class in the shitter by saying 1 man out of 36 at a time(that happens maybe once a month) should fuck the rest of us over? that is just selfish, like i said HAVE DEFENSIVE just make us on par, but if i had it my damn way i would not be playing second fiddle to every alterboy and the necro's go getter. <br />

that class discription being tossed aside and treated like crap is what pissed me off the most in this thread, all you obsanant bastards dont under stand how important that is to ANY RPG game, a rogue doesnt go up and fight in full platemail, a cleric isnt a bad assed fighter, these are like the physics and laws for the game world, and just saying that its flowery bullshit because its suits you to say so REALLY pissed me off because you have NO idea what the point of a RPG is, you have to make sacrifices to be good at something, mine was a spell book, what the hell have you done to become a better tank? nothing, i dont owe you shit, least of all defensive, but as long as bumble heads like yourself keep spouting this river of perverbale shit, i am gona have to compremise, i just hope the wind changes so you can smell the flow of garbage stemming from your lie rotted teeth<br />

This statement FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF EQ is false.  There is ONE tanking class and 2 TANKING HYBRID'S!!  GOT IT?  A Hybrid class should NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS have even 80% of the tanking ability of the True Blood Tank.  The fact you can even come within 20%(let alone 10%) of our tanking ability is a sign of just how out of balance this game really is.  So what is the knights Role?  Simple, off tanking and Utility...back up heals, saving the casters with multiple mobs.. etc etc.  The Problem is that there is not enough game content geared towards making a utility class needed based solely on utility.  So What'd they do to help Knights find groups?  They bumped up your Tanking ability, so that you are nearly as good of a tank as warriors in XP groups.  WRONG ANSWER SONY!!   So now, you got a class in paladins that is 80% warrior at worst and 60% cleric(at 65) .... damn that's a 140% character folks.  SK's are the aggro kings and shold remain so.....but at teh high end their ability to Aggro lock a mob, and be 80% of a tank...along with their ability to FD, and all theri other spells also = something like 120% of a char.   In either case, they are NOT equally considered for XP groups........THEY ARE PREFERRED....nice fix there sony.  <br />
<br />
Now What they should have done  to help out Hybrids finding xp groups, is Increase BY AN AMAZING AMMOUNT game content in the everyday xp grind that made your utility spells and abilities MUCH more desired in a group.  Now you'd have groups choosing between a tank with uncontested Damage absorption abilites(not so now), or a tank from teh two hybrid classes that have some uses other than meatsheild.  OR, as another option, instead of taking A Tankd and 2 DPS classes...take a tank, one DPS and a utility becaue of all the new game content that SK's and/or Paly's can deal with like no other.  <br />
<br />
But...no... its far easier to just put out New Abilities, new Equipment that is usable(and desired) by Warriors and  Hybrids(but benefits Hybrids more because of stats that are wasted on warriors) .  And as a bonus for knights...they decided to NOT Weaken ANY of the knights abilites/spell casting ability in tradeoff for thier new tanking abilities. ........Now knights CAN get groups, so SOE, in their minds, have done their job.   <br />
<br />
Now the question becomes how to fix warriors(whom you broke while fixing knights) WITHOUT breaking the game.....I am totally afraid to know what they are gonna come up with on this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There is NOTHING wrong with giving warriors higher intial aggro.<br />
<br />
NOTHING AT ALL.<br />
<br />
Warrior having higher intial aggro would NOT threaten knights UNLESS that difference was was reduced to the point where aggro is virtually irrelevent.  The current magnitude of the difference should not remain, however I am logically contesting that SOME useable difference should remain.<br />
<br />
<br />
The raid AT role is in many ways just basic exping strategy writ in large letters. If you keep that advantage in it's current format then you keep the advantage in exp. Perhaps if snap aggro was redesigned with restrictions similar to /defensive it wouldn't have much of an impact on grouping. But as it stands atm it's an advantage that cannot be circumvented by any other skills or abilities given to warriors....the imbalance must be addressed in some fashion directly related to aggro. <br />
<br />
<br />
Good point, but I would present there is honestly a diffference in magnitude in the necessity of aggro required for those roles.  Take an XP case, a warrior needing 8s of melee aggro before slow is generally thought of as &quot;too long&quot;.  There IS a non-zero point where a warrior 'disadvantage' in aggro becomes largely irrelevent for XP cases.  Is that point 4s, 3s, 2s?  I don't know.  That's the tough point.<br />
<br />
Let's say atm a paladins's aggro is nearly infinite for the sake of a discussion and pick a number like 1,000,000.   Let's say a warrior's is 500.  Now, how much aggro and how fast is it really *useful*?  Is it 1,000?  Is it 2,000?  Is it 10,000?  That is a VERY important question since IF the useful aggro is 50,000 then changeing warriors to half of the paladin's figure of 1,000,000 places them well beyond the useful cap for aggro.  Thus instead of changeing the aggro advantage FROM HUGE to SMALL it changes it from HUGE TO ZERO.<br />
<br />
Now, let's take the raid case.  How much 'aggro time' is acceptable in relation to XP groups?  The answer is as little as possible because when 4 adds that quad 1k show cleric 1 is healing tank A, cleric 2 is healing tank B, etc.  Cross healing aggro is a HUGE concern.  Is this a concern in XP groups for typical pulls?  No, its not.<br />
<br />
<br />
If Warriors get snap aggo on demand and ranged aggro preventing it from making raid content trivial can be done by disabling it when Defensive is engaged (and providing a non-abusive substitute in the meanwhile).Preventing Warriors from using it without using Defensive when add tanking in raids can not be done (off the top of my head).  But, Warrior groupability should not be held hostage to a high level Paladin raid AT role. <br />
Inferior aggro ability affects many Warriors who are many levels. Some raid, some don't.  It isn't just who MT's. (I don't care most of the time, I just object to being catagorically excluded). <br />
<br />
<br />
EXACTLY, and I am in full agreement.<br />
<br />
<br />
I find it amusing that people who regularly say that utility doesn't get knights groups.... offer utility as the solution to warriors' problems getting groups. <br />
<br />
<br />
No... the prime abilities to fullfill a role should be balanced.  Where there is aditional utility it should be balanced with additional utility, not more pure power.<br />
<br />
Utility rarely, if ever gets groups.  But it is pointed out that knights can &quot;also do this and this and this&quot; even if they were slightly deficient in their prime role.  My point is that should NOT be deficient in their prime role and that warriors should have the ability to do &quot;that and that and that&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
How in the World would giving warriors good aggro DESTROY the Off-Tanking ability of Paladins? Will it make the Paladin any LESS of an OFF-TANK?

The Paladins, all get to swing their mighty 2HS PALADIN only POP weapons that has sick insane damage while the warriors struggle with 3-4 expansion old aggro weapons... <br />
<br />
I have raided and lead every notable encounter in this game from Nag/Vox (with the exceptions of Vulaak and Seru) up to and including the Elemental Gods.  Your shortage of one class does not by itself preserve the role for another class.  Without those 6-12 paladins the raid would continue and rangers, etc would AT.  Without those warriors the raid would be cancelled.  Let's say you totally equal effective aggro on tank classes could paladins still AT?  Yes.  Would they be the logical choice to do so based upon their strengths?  Nope.  The only reason for having them do so would be the waterboy syndrome.  Essentially that the important people (in your scenario the warriors awaiting to MT the boss) are too few in number/too  important to risk.<br />
<br />
THAT is what I call destroying a raid role.  Being able to do a half-dozen things worse than other classes could do in your absence is not a valid 'raid role'.  These things may help to some degree but shouldn't be the core.  MTing is a vitally important raid role.  ATing is a vitally important raid role.  I believe warriors should be *best* in theirs and knights *best* in theirs and not simply fillers for a warrior shortage.<br />
<br />
Itemization is poor and I have stated such on many occasions in regards to acceptably warrior weaponry.<br />
<br />
<br />
All other places Paladins do OFF-Tanking AND CAN do the MT Role.  <br />
<br />
And in all other places warriors can AT well since mobs hit for crap and the immediate debuffing called for in the tougher scenarious isn't needed and often isn't even bothered with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins Have MANY times over the role of a warrior on raids, AND they are the prefered MT for EXP Groups... <br />

Oh okay, I get it now, you're just clueless. <br />
<br />
Bold insults do not help weak logic.<br />
<br />
So what are the GENERAL ROLES?  Name them, come on, I flat out challenge you to name GENERAL ROLES in EQ that does not logically lead to Tanking being placed among them.  Don't rest of insults, don't rest on what has been said in the past, don't rest on VAGUE descritions that even IF they were implemented verbatim would NOT necessarily result in anywhere NEAR balanced classes.<br />
<br />
(Short case in point, make warriors twice as good at tanking.  Then make all mobs hit for 10 points of damage.  Fine, you are by FAR the best at tanking, but since tanking isn't relevent to balance NO ONE CARES.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Although I did not think it was necessary to illustrate this point, here goes:<br />
<br />
GENERAL ROLES:<br />
-tanking<br />
-healing<br />
-damage<br />
-buffing<br />
-debuffing<br />
-CC<br />
<br />
&quot;Utility&quot; IS NOT a role, but a means by which some contribution is made to one of the above.  You don't have 3 mobs inc and say &quot;omg UTILITY THEM&quot;.  No, you CC them, you debuff them, you tank them, you kill them, you heal your party.  That is IT.<br />
<br />
These are the base, GENERAL things you must do in EQ.<br />
<br />
For contrast the following are SPECIALIST ROLES:<br />
<br />
- Maximum critical sustain healing power of a single target<br />
- Maximum efficiency healing of a single target<br />
- Group healing speed<br />
- Group healing efficiency<br />
- Group healing power<br />
- Resurrection<br />
- Resist Debuffing<br />
- Slowing, speed critical<br />
- Slowing, general<br />
- Stat debuffing<br />
- HP regeneration<br />
- Mana regeneration<br />
- Haste<br />
- Spell foci items and spells<br />
- Tanking aggro<br />
- Tanking durability<br />
- Tanking aggro in a critical environment<br />
- Tanking durability in a critical environment<br />
- Stat buffs<br />
- Resist buffs<br />
- HP/mana buffs<br />
- Damage, melee orientation specific<br />
- Damage, melee, orientation non-specific<br />
- Damage, burst orientation and range non-specific<br />
- Damage, ranged, sustainable<br />
- Damage, ranged, burst<br />

For me: basically I don't raid anymore so the MT &quot;rock star&quot; avenue job is cut off.

I can't hit the undead for 5k a pop.  I can't wield a 2 handed sword and bash at the same time.  My dps with a sword and a shield is not very good.  I don't have equipment that is materially any different than any pallie/sk could create (hello LDON).  <br />
<br />
What I do have: a role to tank mobs every night in an exp/ldon setting.  Thats what I do.  Thats all I CAN do....thats what the warr class was originally designed to do (yes Virginia I mean the old role of the warr before all the raid focused army hoopla back in the day).  <br />
<br />
But....I don't even have the taunt/agro I need to do that job well.  And now you say I can't have that cause it will &quot;threaten the mutual roles of tanks as having a preference in the space time continum...blah blah blah crap&quot;.  Sorry...hog wash.</div></div><hr />

-tanking<br />
-healing<br />
-damage<br />
-buffing<br />
-debuffing<br />
-CC<br />
<br />
&quot;Utility&quot; IS NOT a role, but a means by which some contribution is made to one of the above. You don't have 3 mobs inc and say &quot;omg UTILITY THEM&quot;. No, you CC them, you debuff them, you tank them, you kill them, you heal your party. That is IT.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You have not listed rolls; you have listed types of power.<br />
<br />
All power that characters have in everquest come in one of the above forms, even utility.<br />
<br />
To be a specialist means to focus on one thing, in EQ's case one of the above powers, a specialist tank would be one that derived near all of their power from things that let them tank. <br />
<br />
<br />
EQ does not have the specialists in the sense that RL and other games do, all members of a class can use the same tools for killing mobs. For example: In games like D&amp;D a priest of the god of hate and a priest of the god of life would have drastically different powers, being separate specialist classes. In EQ they are one class and have exactly the same class powers (minus one set of spells that has not used for fighting but rather trade skills).<br />
<br />
Also the &quot;cause&quot; of something is largely irrelevant. &quot;Arcane&quot;,  &quot;divine&quot;, and &quot;physical&quot; sources of damage all kill a mob just fine.<br />
<br />
Before I ramble on too much more: Knights may be tanking classes, but then again so are Rangers, and none of them are specialist in tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm,<br />
<br />
I don't believe the knightly AT role is solely based around aggro however, part of it is that they have a number of tools at their disposal to limit the mobs effectiveness, stuns, roots to park out of the way, heals/taps to mitigate damage to a greater or lesser extent so that a dedicated healer isn't as required, kiting mobs (and taking no damage) if you're an SK....<br />
<br />
<br />
THERE SHOULD BE NO PREFERRED MT FOR EXP GROUPS<br />
<br />
Unfortunately so long as there are differences between tank classes value judgements will be made. As a warrior my entire purpose for being, as clearly presented in the booklet when i first got EQ (and long before I'd ever even heard of raiding) was a specialised path - focused solely around taking and (I was told at the time) dealing out damage in Melee combat. it was implicit in that arguement that I would be the best at that role and therefore must forgo some of the neat spells and other stuff that other classes could do.<br />
<br />
Conversely Knights were portrayed as warriors who sacrificed some of their martial prowess to study spellcasting that would help give a group an edge. Any knight player who tells me that at the time of creation they believed they would be as good as a warrior in the primary tank role is displaying a very selective memory.<br />
<br />
It's dumb that the way the game has played out the utility of knights isn't more valued, and warriors themselves could use a few toys both to spice the mechanics of tanking up and for when they aren't able to perform their main function, but i still think that warriors should be favoured with a slight advantage in the role they were designed totally around. Lord knows that spellbook of yours provides you some fun options outside the tanking arena. <br />
<br />
The concept of a courageous warrior not gifted with divine powers but by want of his training the most fearsome of fighters, the man who stands forth to protect his fellows with just the blades in his hands and his own skill and strength to aid him - thats what we signed on for. To be totally reliant on other peoples good will, and to be unable to compare favourably in that protective role is a tremendous gut punch to that concept.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There will always be min/maxers out there who demand the best of all class set ups but like they'd prefer a shaman for slows, like they'd most often prefer a cleric for heals, they'll have a tank of choice also. <br />
<br />
The difference and to my mind the best way to go forward is that the classes that the prefered class overshadow have other options which can provide them a niche in the group. <br />
<br />
Tanks when they can't tank need to be more viable in a secondary role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A genetic approach is just as valid:<br />
<br />
Cleric X Warrior -&gt; Paladin<br />
When an f1 hibrid contains substantially all of the posistive characteristics of its parent stock it often replaces them.<br />
<br />
Horse X Donkey -&gt; Mule<br />
When the resultant hybrid does not have superiority to its parents, they continue to persist in production and the hybrid is judged on its own merits.<br />
<br />
SoE wants the parents of Paladins to  continue to have a role in the game. It's breeding program was not intended to result in superior offspring.<br />
<br />
To preserve Warriors, the only sensible course is to reinforce their desireable characteristics - more HP's, AC, mitigation, and even do a little gene splicing now that we realize snap aggro and ranged aggro are needed for them to compete in the marketplace.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kether</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those who were interested in an intelligent discussion I believe I have exhausted my ability to exposit on this topic in a productive, non-repetitive, and civil manner.<br />
<br />
Some may agree with me in whole<br />
Some may agree with me in priciple, but differ in the fine margins that will determine whether or not the tank classes are truly 'balanced'.<br />
<br />
I have learned from these people and hopefully they have learned from me.<br />
<br />
There are those that are not happy with their class as it differs from their expectations when they started their character.  For members of ALL classes I have great sympathy for any disappointment they have in that regard.  The unfortunate reality of 15 classes shoved into 6 class spots mixed with the disillusioning reality of min/maxing every element of gameplay makes that an an evil that is difficult (if not fully impossible) to eliminate for one and all.<br />
<br />
Then there are those who fail to agree on general premises or ignore the logical consequences of their development.  To intractably hold to the &quot;tanking is a specialty&quot; and &quot;there is only one real tank&quot; stances without allowing the further disctinction of that tanking role needed to allow each of the classes to enjoy desirability in both XP and raid settings renders moot any argument.  IS sacrificing 'everything' (in this case spells) in order to gain the ONLY thing of importance in most people's eyes (both group and raid role of dominant tank in *every* application, measured in *every* way) really a sacrifice at all?<br />
<br />
Then... finally there is these EXTREMELY telling examples of all of the above:<br />
<br />
<br />
***************************************************<br />
<br />
ME:<br />
<br />
 THERE SHOULD BE NO PREFERRED MT FOR EXP GROUPS. <br />
<br />
<br />
Flair:<br />
<br />
Disagree....but I'm not going to use 500-600 words to explain why either. <br />
<br />
Flair disagrees with my quoted premise.  That is his right, and he is being perfectly fair to do so.  Since he and I are obviously wed to intractable and conflicting opinions we really can't resolve our differences by debate and must accept to disagree.  He believes warriors should better fill the group tank role in all circumstances.  I simply can't agree that some greater ability to bottom feed and duo sans healer is sufficient compensation when the benefits of such are minimal in comparison to grouping.  I believe all tank classes should be equally capable of filling the group tank role, each with its particular strengths.<br />
<br />
Valeris said:<br />
<br />
In an ideal world i agree with you, unfortunately so long as there are differences between tank classes value judgements will be made. As a warrior my entire purpose for being, as clearly presented in the booklet when i first got EQ (and long before I'd ever even heard of raiding) was a specialised path - focused solely around taking and (I was told at the time) dealing out damage in Melee combat. it was implicit in that arguement that I would be the best at that role and therefore must forgo some of the neat spells and other stuff that other classes could do. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is the unfortunate result of mashing too many classes into too few roles.  But almost no class is alone in facing that dilemma of RP expectations vs. game play balance reality.  Check out all the class descriptions.  In a vacuum they all seem fine, in a competitive environment all fall short of the lofty expectations.  I can &quot;smite&quot; undead, but a rogue, wizard, mage, or necromancer are generally more effective than I.  I am not &quot;the greatest force against undead&quot;.  I may &quot;use blessed spells and strength of arms to fight the evil and undead of Norrath&quot; but the fact is there is no &quot;evil&quot;.  I thought there would be evil akin to demons and devils, etc.  There aren't.  There are live and undead, and the importance of the former is magnitudes greater than the latter.  I had envisioned paladins as medium tanks, in every way inferior to warriors in that position but who had broad power to kick the evil and undead snot out of opponents.  I didn't expect to be as good of a tank as I am.  But I also didn't expect to be as damage irrelevent  as I am tossed into a world with no &quot;evil&quot; and no tangible need to fight undead.<br />
<br />
We have both been shorted.<br />
<br />
It isn't the world we had thought, it doesn't have the depth to support such true expressions of those descriptions.<br />
<br />
Given the above, I think it is better to focus on gameplay balance and enjoyability than adhering to some of the class descriptions in a world that can not support the true scope of all of the class descriptions.<br />
<br />
Others may disagree.<br />
<br />
<br />
My hope for the upcoming changes is that warriors maintain raid boss tanking dominance and knights raid add-tanking dominace and that BOTH classes enjoy equivalent group tanking ability.  The exact means by which this is accomplished is to be determined by SOE. <br />

<br />
I am at a complete loss in regards to how to respond to this in a non-insulting manner.  Reread maybe?<br />
<br />
PALADINS SHOULD NOT BE THE PREFERRED MT FOR EXP GROUPS.  THERE SHOULD BE NO PREFERRED MT FOR EXP GROUPS.  <br />
<br />
Can't really see how you can misread that.  You may think the specific changes I would support and/or not support would NOT lead to that case.  That is highly subjective.  But to state as you did is either a failure to read or slander.  As for those 5 mobs I would like you to list them and then see you defeat those you did not in a reliable fashion.  Not in a 'if everything goes right, we have X more healers&quot; etc world, but in an every day raid environment.  For YOUR force, not FoH.  Even better yet, do so with Knights since you see no reason for them to be inherently better as a raid AT.  So assemble your force, do the math, have just enough to win if thigns go properly with a warrior set to tank it defensively.  Then take the warriors out of the picture.  Let the knights tank it, when they die have the knights try to transition smoothly.  Do you think you are going to win?  Warriors are currently tanks for XP groups, so clearly you don't *need* knights for that.   I have NO objection to the currently accepted beliefs that warriors are 'unbalanced' in their xp group contribution atm.  In summary your response to my detailed response to those questions was consisted of three parts.  The first was ignorance/slander, the second a hyperbolic boast which you have not (nor likely ever will) demonstrated, and an exaggeration of the current imbalance to the point of absurdity.   Good rebuttal.<br />

<br />
Anyone that says a well equiped warrior cant compete with a knight needs to give their head a shake, lots of warriors i know can give me a good run for my money when it comes to agro. <br />
<br />
But honestly i'm sick of you all wanting knights nerfed, i cant speak for paly's but us sk's fought for over two years just to get the upgrades we finally got, during that whole time we didnt once ask for warriors to get nerfed, yet that is all you guys do, if anything we want paly's nerfed lol.<br />
<br />
As for thinking that when i made my sk  that i would be able to tank as good or even close to a warrior, i did think that i could after a while, at first who knows, that was long ago. But after 60 lvls of soloing, i KNEW that i could tank as good as any warrior, i dont have a warriors hp, but i make up for it with my spells.<br />
<br />
If you want them to nerf our Terror and voice spells, go for it, and while you are at it, ask them to totally get rid of them, they are totally useless spells, all i need for agro is my darkness spell, they can even take my tuant button for all i care. Some Sk's like to use fear, but IMO it isnt needed to get agro. But if you really want to get us nerfed, at least make sure you tell them to give us a pet equil to a Beastlords pet.<br />
<br />
Since i dont play a warrior anymore, i really have no sujestions as to what you need fixed, But again i say, having knights nurfed wont fix a single problem you guys have, cuz IMOwe arent the ones that take agro from you, its those that heal/slow that take your agro, maybe try getting their agro fixed instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Selective memory?  Hardly.  I played pen and paper games for years.  One thing I remember from AD&amp;D is that I never wanted to be a paladin because roleplaying one would suck - even though they were just as good as a fighter.  And I have played AD&amp;D from that old dusty book on my shelf (1978 edition Gary Cygax published) through the 2000 edition.  And when I chose paladin I fully expected to be as good as a warrior defensively but trail in the offensive side (at least trail in the numbers of usable weapons).<br />
<br />
Then again, in AD&amp;D you play a class for enjoyment - not because someone wants to group with you.  I miss the AD&amp;D days.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't an insult, it was an observation.  You really don't have any idea what you're talking about, just like 90% of Knights that visit this board.  My logic is fine, it's yours that's flawed, and it's flawed hard.<br />
<br />
When you can say with a straight face that a Hybrid should EVER be a BETTER choice than one of the parent class, you have lost all touch with reality.  If Paladins were replacing clerics in a group, you'd try the same doubletalk bullshit, but we all know it would be wrong.  I don't see why there's any discussion at all on this issue.  If you disagree with it, you're wrong, that's all there is to it.  It's not a debatable issue.<br />

Being equal is what I want.  I don't want people to pick X over Y and Z or whatever.  When a tank comes in to a zone and needs a group, you grab him, rather than &quot;Lets wait for a Z.&quot;  That's called balance.<br />
<br />
The problem right now is that there are 2 classes with fucktons of utility, and there is one class with no utility.  Then there is zero discernable difference between the tanking ability of the 3, and there we have a problem.  I don't want fuckin utility.  I made a warrior TO TANK STUFF.  That's what I exist to do.  Paladins and SK's made their characters to tank stuff a little worse than a warrior, but have other spells and abilities to make up the gap.  Right now there is no gap, and they still have the spells and other abilities,   That's not balance, and any attempt to justify that as balance is hogwash.</div></div><hr />

and it does say GOAL so dont give me that shit that its just a loosly based thing, why would they bother to print it on thousands of manuels on high glose paper with high Q ink?<br />

why would they waste web space for warriors to refer to if it ment nothing? hmmm<br />
<br />
check their live site, that was updated with luclin and says the same thing pretty much, those where qouted from the PoP book so its more up to date<br />
<br />
also they said at FF that they were going to up melee dmg balanced agensts classes(sounds like innate bonuses to me) so the warriors may just do as much as they get, sounds like they are working twards the discription after all eh? and they are looking into class balance so maybe this isnt all just posh warrior bullshit to defend their claim eh pallys? time to share the tanking crown again huh?</div></div><hr />

True. But the other shoe hasn't dropped in your statement.<br />

IF you nerf knights and make their aggro just as shaky and unreliable as a warrior's, suddenly you've evened the playing field a tad, and the warrior &quot;problems&quot; won't be as big a problem.<br />

It's really a very simple issue. People agree there is a problem. Many MANY people have come here to say &quot;Oh, I agree, warriors need some help&quot; or &quot;I agree Melee_Class_01 needs X.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus, there's a problem. It needs fixing.<br />
<br />
There are two, and only two ways to go about fixing the problem.<br />
<br />
Choice A - NERF.<br />
<br />
Choice B - IMPROVE.<br />
<br />
Now, in all our years of experience in playing Everquest, let's think back and consider ... what does Sony/Verant like to do MOST OFTEN when approaching a problem like class balance?<br />
<br />
They don't call it the nerfbat for nothing.</div></div><hr />

They read up on the game at websites like Allakhazam's and checked out the class descriptions, most of which were lifted straight from the manual.

Knights have their own list of things that are not so kosher for them.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
I for one would like to see Warrior's numerical hate production getting a little boost (so that Warriors are slightly better for XP groups) <br />
<br />
and then Knights role on raids expanded to the point that every other melee has with Furious/Weaponshield/Deftdance/etc so the knights can reliably tank something that can 1-round them for X seconds like every other melee class.<br />
<br />
Funny to see warriors devaluing defensive and then harping on how the knights devalue &quot;utility&quot;.  I guess that happens to be &quot;warrior logic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both have a point that the two abilities are not and should not be what makes the warrior or the knight tick.<br />
<br />
Tanking is what makes both knight and warrior tick period.<br />
<br />
While it is true (for some) that warriors chose their characters to be tanks,  it is also true of most knights.  2nd and 3rd edition D&amp;D Paladins/Blackguards have as many HP/AC and are indeed BETTER tanks in some situations than Fighters/Warriors can ever be.  (think Paladin and undead)<br />
<br />
Some nerfs are necessary...  but only when the game is truly broken.  Of course, some players wear blinders and may only see themselves and how uber they should be.  Those are the people planning to have knights (and every other class they are jealous of) nerfed in every possible way so that warriors are once again the only class to be.<br />
<br />
There have been many well-thought out ideas posted by both warriors and knight not only here but on the knight boards when it comes to balance.<br />

Tell you what, when they make defensive as beneficial in the majority of situations as Knight utility, we'll call it even.   Of couse I'll be laughing my ass off because then Knights will be whinning about the fact that they can't tank the majority of mobs any more and have to group a Warrior.<br />

Truly, I actually believe the warriors could use a boost for XP groups.  I would LOVE to see something on test that would aid the warrior's everyday XP group numerical hate generation.  I would LOVE to see the day when EB weapons are a nice luxury/safety net, but not a requirement.  I will stand by every warrior in this situation.<br />
<br />
Throw one of the numerous excellent ideas found on both this board and on the knight boards on test and lets see how it washes... If its broken, lets see it.  ANY testing of such a thing I would be VERY happy for the warriors as every one of you here that have such an issue should be on test making sure its worthwhile.<br />
<br />
<br />
For all my &quot;utility&quot; as a Shadowknight, I simply cannot find one thing or even a combination of &quot;utility&quot; things that come anywhere close to what /disc Defensive does when it comes to making the difference in a raid. When was the last time a SINGLE shadowknight was required for a raid...  let alone 2-3 warriors required, with any additional taken with open arms.<br />
<br />
Guilds take warriors with pitiful AA's, pitiful player experience, no flags, and pitiful equipment and deny Shadowknights with 200+ AAs, excellent pre-elemental equipment, and most of their flags.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Defensive.<br />
<br />
name ONE encounter centered and REQUIRING knight &quot;utility&quot; for raids.<br />
<br />
EVERY PoP Time encounter is LOADS easier with a Warrior tanking except for a tiny minority.  Indeed having a Knight with even 10k HP is risking insta-kill.  The encounters are tuned for /disc defensive period.<br />
<br />
Name an elemental/time encounter tuned to require shadowknight spells/disciplines. <br />
<br />
<br />
There is NO way I can purchase anything close to defensive with AA's, with items, with rclickies, or with anything else.  Much of my &quot;utility&quot; as a shadowknight is gainable by warriors using items.<br />
A great deal of it is simply not needed as warriors started better to begin with.<br />
<br />
I am NOT saying Shadowknights don't have their advantages...  I am NOT saying my spells are useless.  They are quite useful.<br />
(note please, I do not want defensive either)<br />
I AM saying Shadowknight and even Paladin &quot;utility&quot; is much overestimated in some situations...  much like Warrior /disc defensive is overestimated in XP groups.  I AM saying I want to truly be the second best raid tank in the game and tied for the best XP group tank in the game with paladins and warriors.<br />
<br />
(I am tired of not being able to hold the line long enough when the warriors fall and the damn time god is at 2%.  I am tired of having to let rangers/monks/bards/rogues/beastlords riposte/parry/stone tank because I am going to be 1-rounded for sure -even with a pile of time loots and full Hp AA's- against the likes of vallon in time before a heal cycle can land.  As the second best tank in the game, I want to be able to stand vallon up for a couple ticks and give it my best shot.  Is this really so different from your concerns?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Its all a matter of viewpoint.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take off the blinders for a moment and consider the following:<br />
<br />
Lets say warriors got better (truly) at innate aggro generation and knights scored a 9-second auto-parry or auto-shield block discipline.  Who would be hurt?<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />

So ours is a minority, but important role.  And without it, what exactly would you have us do?<br />
<br />
Without defensive as it stands there would be no particular reason not to replace half the Warriors in a guild with Knights and the other half with real DPS classes and consider yourself ahead of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yes, lets stop by the Warrior board and complain that as a HYBRID melee I get one-rounded by the toughest mobs in the game. I'll express support for some kind of fix to Warrior aggro - they won't notice that I'm proposing to take still another nibble out of the only role they have.<br />
<br />
I'm all in favor of a BIG Harm Touch, a Spear of Evil that does 1800 damage, giving SK's the highest level Necro Pet, etc. But, Knights should not have near Warrior survivability much less new defensive disciplines. The problem is that Knights do have a role in the game and it isn't to replace Warriors utterly.<br />
<br />
There's a better case to be made for making SK's damage dealing tanks than trying to make them Warriors who also cast spells IMO.<br />

The warrior generally won't use it for this though because they won't be able to use /disc defensive.   <br />
<br />
For EVERY other melee class in game that has it, it's placed there and used to AVOID tanking the mob, not to make it more efficient, it's an escape mechanism.   If what you're saying is you'd like an escape mechanism of short duration Brik, then my answer would be, you already have it, and that is Harmshield.  Paladins have their version as well in Divine Aura.</div></div><hr />

The fast aggro generating abilities of knights makes add management on shei really smooth. I wouldn't say they're REQUIRED to beat Shei, but I would say having the knights there for the addtanks really makes the encounter smooth and hassle free. One might even consider the fact that the encounter was designed to have knights in that add-tank slot.<br />

I'm just going to post my proposed &quot;Fix&quot; in the front so you can skip over the rest of the post .<br />
<br />
1. As stated multiple times there should be no aggro , or VERY minimal for all resisted spells . As for the immune mobs i could care either way ( face it even if you are immune to speed changes someone casting darkness on you might still piss you the hell off .) This would palce pallies back below SK's on the aggro chart and force both knight classes to use the approprite spells for thier lvls . ( Personaly this will not effect SK aggro but deplete the mana pool as it should )<br />
<br />
2. New warrior only taunt button. Raise the skill cap for taunt to 250 . My new proposition for the way this would work is that it will use a RNG with the range of 3 x Taunt and add it directly to hate . Then make the refresh on it 30 seconds . This would make groups/raids non trivial since it could be a hate value of 1 - 750 .<br />
<br />
3.( not decided on how to implement or at what lvl this should be given for effect . AA/Skill/Augment/Starting ability ) Give warriors 1/4 of mana for raw HP for items they are wearing .<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to the petty whining section of my post . So if you have been semi-intelligent about posts just skip it.<br />
<br />
<br />
WARRIOR'S ARE TANKS. THAT'S ALL THEY DO. In no case, EVER should anyone be a BETTER choice than a warrior to tank things.<br />
<br />
Yep that's completly true , warriors are the best tanks . No one ever doubted it for a min . That's why Knights can get aggro better , because they ARE NOT the best tanks .  Just like a enchater casting Tash/slow twice on a mob will out aggro a knight . It's a cascading effect of how the worst to tank can normaly generate more aggro then a class that CAN tank it better then them . I use tank loosely here because anyone can TANK a mob , it's the surviability thing that stops most people .<br />
<br />

Added abilities ( IE See invis , Enduring breath ect )<br />
Mana preservation<br />
Damage Foci<br />
Regent Foci<br />
Foci ECT.<br />
<br />
Not to down play the warriors but you don't even need half that in gear , actually the only thing you need that is not on that list is EB weapons. Yes the can be expensive but you try buying your 65th lvl spells as well as all that armor and weapons that have all that . Not easy is it ? <br />
<br />
BTW that is probably Furors damn problem with the Pallies/SK's that are tanking time gods, but of course the time gear that was tanked by the warrior and dropped that uber FT20/Foci this/HP that/Mana this is able to tank decently as a warrior substitute . I most certainly agree that the knight's in question if evaluated on your 100% characted scale would indeed be more then 100% . But they don't get that untill time anyways.<br />
<br />
And i will said it again in case you actually took my ranting seriously about the quotes from the various threads and kept reading even thought i told you to skip it since i'm really not trying to turn this into a pissing contest .<br />

Bullshit.  A competant knight will hold aggro over anyone.  Wizards, Necros, debuffers...the whole fuckin nine yards.  That's why it's broken.  If you have a knight who is intent on holding aggro, you will not get it, no matter what the fuck you do about it.  By your logic, they should be the worst tanks in the game, which they're not, which is why it's broken.<br />
<br />

<br />
Paladins are not 'nearly as good as clerics' in the healing department.  Our heals are neither as large, nor as efficient as Cleric spells.  Significantly less efficient.  Verant envisions us as 'emergency healers'.  When things get really tough, we can pour out mana to do some decent healing.  This is a powerful ability, but we are nowhere near the priest classes in the ability to provide sustained healing like an experience group needs to function.<br />
<br />
Paladins are good substitute HP buffers.  I know that Paladins can buff more total HP than Clerics, but remember only one of those buffs will be used if a Cleric is around.  The biggest upshot of this is that when in a group with no Cleric, a Paladin can buff himself up to nearly within 300 HP of what could be done with a cleric there.  The Paladin could also buff up a Warrior or SK if they were in the group.  Other classes would prefer the Druid's PO9 to the full suite of Paladin buffs, although they would take the Paladin's inferior symbol to go along with it.<br />
<br />
While a Paladin can replace a Warrior in many situations now, they cannot replace a Cleric or any other 'real' healer.  They do make it much easier for a group to work with a non-Cleric healer though.<br />
<br />
None of this is to say that Warriors don't need help, or that Paladins aren't getting more than their share of experience groups these days.  It just seems that every single Paladin ability is under attack lately.  It isn't reasonable to expect a nerf to every Paladin ability and an increase to Warrior aggro generation.  I know that the majority of folks aren't actively pushing for Paladin nerfs, but the crescendo seems to be building.<br />

SoE gets it my friend. A melee general overhaul is in the works. I will be sooooooo pleased when classes are adjusted.<br />
<br />
SoE already understands that the state of Warrior aggro control is embarassing. They already know the Warrior/Knight HP gap is meaningless in experiance grouping. They know aggroing with trivial spells is lame. I believe their only problem is how to preserve aggro from CHoS, GBoS, GSoT, Strike of YKesha, and Force of YKesha.<br />
<br />
The propaganda that the Warriors with Spellbooks (Knights) should have vastly superior aggro control AND for all practical purposes equivilant survivability in experiance groups AND numerous useful spells isn't going to sell here and I'm hopeful will not sell with SoE.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. I'm glad to see Knights MT in groups and in raids. But Warriors need to be brought up to standard in aggro control.<br />

any mob that CHs, or has a bad ass AoE(like the one shaman epic mob that can wipe a raid in 3 shots) requires a stun or a very strong offensive spell to stop the casting, knights come in right there</div></div><hr />

<br />
At lower levels, I've been in groups with paladins as the main healer. Most recently, was in the gnoll caves in Surefall Glade, with my level 52 warrior. The paladin was using Ethereal Cleansing mostly, tossing in his own stuns and using his actual heals for downtime.<br />
<br />
It was pretty mana intensive on him, obviously. But it worked just fine.</div></div><hr />

Wow after reading all these threads from the outhouse ( well when it moved to there ) this one and one from my home board ( yes another damn knight , sk if at all you care ) . I'm just going to post my proposed &quot;Fix&quot; in the front so you can skip over the rest of the post .<br />
<br />
1. As stated multiple times there should be no aggro , or VERY minimal for all resisted spells . As for the immune mobs i could care either way ( face it even if you are immune to speed changes someone casting darkness on you might still piss you the hell off .) This would palce pallies back below SK's on the aggro chart and force both knight classes to use the approprite spells for thier lvls . ( Personaly this will not effect SK aggro but deplete the mana pool as it should )<br />
<br />
2. New warrior only taunt button. Raise the skill cap for taunt to 250 . My new proposition for the way this would work is that it will use a RNG with the range of 3 x Taunt and add it directly to hate . Then make the refresh on it 30 seconds . This would make groups/raids non trivial since it could be a hate value of 1 - 750 .<br />
<br />
3.( not decided on how to implement or at what lvl this should be given for effect . AA/Skill/Augment/Starting ability ) Give warriors 1/4 of mana for raw HP for items they are wearing .<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to the petty whining section of my post . So if you have been semi-intelligent about posts just skip it.<br />
<br />
<br />
WARRIOR'S ARE TANKS. THAT'S ALL THEY DO. In no case, EVER should anyone be a BETTER choice than a warrior to tank things.<br />
<br />
Yep that's completly true , warriors are the best tanks . No one ever doubted it for a min . That's why Knights can get aggro better , because they ARE NOT the best tanks .  Just like a enchater casting Tash/slow twice on a mob will out aggro a knight . It's a cascading effect of how the worst to tank can normaly generate more aggro then a class that CAN tank it better then them . I use tank loosely here because anyone can TANK a mob , it's the surviability thing that stops most people .<br />
<br />
The LIKELY fix for the warrior dilemma would be the addition of UTILITY<br />
<br />
Yep , that was a nice little saying . My turn<br />

Not to down play the warriors but you don't even need half that in gear , actually the only thing you need that is not on that list is EB weapons. Yes the can be expensive but you try buying your 65th lvl spells as well as all that armor and weapons that have all that . Not easy is it ? <br />
<br />
BTW that is probably Furors damn problem with the Pallies/SK's that are tanking time gods, but of course the time gear that was tanked by the warrior and dropped that uber FT20/Foci this/HP that/Mana this is able to tank decently as a warrior substitute . I most certainly agree that the knight's in question if evaluated on your 100% characted scale would indeed be more then 100% . But they don't get that untill time anyways.<br />

LEVEL 52: THE DISCIPLINE OF EVASIVE <br />
<br />
i get hit less, but i also miss more, seems like its counter productive doesnt it? so basicly this is just to slow down a raid so that the CH can get off, this is also another one for raids, 6 to 15 min refresh depending on level, not a good idea in LDoN when you need to do alot of dmg, and missing doesnt do that<br />

<br />
LEVEL 55: THE DISCIPLINE OF DEFENSIVE <br />
<br />
WOOOHOOO our class crutch!! so i do half dmg, and i get hit for half, again this is counter productive and is more made so that the MT can live thru a big melee round so patch heals can save his ass,  30-60 min refresh (mines freaky diky like that :D) this is mostly raid only, unless you are doing assassin missions, which dont really require it unless your tank is the lowest level<br />
<br />
LEVEL 56: THE DISCIPLINE OF FURIOUS <br />
<br />
i reposite everything, and then i gota wait 30-55 min to reuse, again this is for raids and duels, the real nice thing about this one is big ass raid mobs that have proc's cant proc their AoE life tap or AoE fear/DD if they cant hit me, still, not for XP groups<br />
<br />
LEVEL 57: THE DISCIPLINE OF PRECISION <br />

im not to sure on this because i dont use it alot but i think i hit more often but i hit for less dmg, i hear it has a long reuse time so not all that great for Xping, so i largly ignore this<br />
<br />
LEVEL 58: THE DISCIPLINE OF FELL STRIKE <br />
<br />
now this is the shit, the only one i like, reuse time of 6 min(not great for a group but it shaves off LDoN time) i can go from hitting for 98-175 with my marshal staff to 385-404 i know it sounds like a load of shit but it has happened and it feels excellent :D.<br />
<br />
this is good for off tanking in a raid to, or being DPS in a raid <br />
<br />
LEVEL 59: THE DISCIPLINE OF FORTITUDE <br />
<br />
basicaly a upgrade of resistant<br />
<br />
LEVEL 60: THE DISCIPLINE OF AGGRESSIVE <br />

hit more often, for more dmg(not really noticable) but you also take alot(really noticable) more dmg, shit for xp groups, ok for raids, but fellstrike is alot better<br />
<br />
<br />
so i discplines are kinda shit, and most of them just make us get hurt more or less and make us hurt others more or less, i dont really recall any other class with disciplines taking a penalty for using them, i know holy forage doesnt make you take more dmg or anything<br />
<br />
now for our AA goodies, you get almost all of the same we do with a few exceptions, and why the FU_K should i have to have 100 or 200 AA's to match a knight with none? if you say.... well because you have to do something to get agro, i say fu_k you with a big spintering object, because what the hell have you really done to get where you are? you waited around for 2 expantions? that all? so it was given to you and you didnt have to give up jack crap huh? oh wait did i say given? it was more like a father getting his child candy because he started screaming and crying in the store, and well if it works for those of you that took that route why cant i with out being co_ked blocked by 50 people saying i should take it in the ass and grin?<br />
<br />
again this was another one of those posts that started out nice to get our attention but then he let his true stars show<br />
<br />
&quot;not my fault you dont use them&quot; screw you alter boy, or better yet let the father/priest of hate do it. that little line about not using them has earned you my anger and made me shut off to any points you may make in the future, GJ</div></div><hr />

Just a voice to counter some of the piling on of Paladin's healing abilities.<br />
<br />
Paladins are not 'nearly as good as clerics' in the healing department.  Our heals are neither as large, nor as efficient as Cleric spells.  Significantly less efficient.  Verant envisions us as 'emergency healers'.  When things get really tough, we can pour out mana to do some decent healing.  This is a powerful ability, but we are nowhere near the priest classes in the ability to provide sustained healing like an experience group needs to function.<br />
<br />
Paladins are good substitute HP buffers.  I know that Paladins can buff more total HP than Clerics, but remember only one of those buffs will be used if a Cleric is around.  The biggest upshot of this is that when in a group with no Cleric, a Paladin can buff himself up to nearly within 300 HP of what could be done with a cleric there.  The Paladin could also buff up a Warrior or SK if they were in the group.  Other classes would prefer the Druid's PO9 to the full suite of Paladin buffs, although they would take the Paladin's inferior symbol to go along with it.<br />
<br />
While a Paladin can replace a Warrior in many situations now, they cannot replace a Cleric or any other 'real' healer.  They do make it much easier for a group to work with a non-Cleric healer though.<br />
<br />
None of this is to say that Warriors don't need help, or that Paladins aren't getting more than their share of experience groups these days.  It just seems that every single Paladin ability is under attack lately.  It isn't reasonable to expect a nerf to every Paladin ability and an increase to Warrior aggro generation.  I know that the majority of folks aren't actively pushing for Paladin nerfs, but the crescendo seems to be building.<br />

here is more of the down play crap, those buffs you dont like all that much allow you to match a warrior, and that also mean that when the cleric ISNT around you can still maintain those stats, so that means you can go into a group with a druid/shaman healer and do just fine, IMHO that plays a big part in your group ability, and in LDoN mobs use dispell now and then, what am i to do if my virtue gets eaten and im with a shaman? nothing, then we die, or we have to have med breaks because im out 1500-2000 hp and im harder to heal</div></div><hr />

Mostly I agree with you, except for the above statement.<br />

They also seem to forget that if a warrior cannot get groups because we can't maintain reasonable aggro, he can't get the god damn AAs they love to throw in our faces. I don't have AE Taunt, hell, I don't have a single AA anywhere near that range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want a &quot;...comment on what i would to see done to warrior/knights.&quot; Here you go -<br />
<br />
1. It is intuitively obvious that spells that are resisted because they are too low a level should not cause aggro. But, SoE cleverly introduced some weapons with Planar Stun, etc. that may have been intended to make aggro weapons more readily available to Warriors. Any change in this (and it should be changed) should be accompanied by changes in those weapon procs (unless of course SoE just doesn't care about Warriors).<br />
<br />
Aggro in the face of Immunity is debatable. The designers should have a consistant ruling on this. It would be nice if it prevented abuse.<br />
<br />
2. A Taunt button with a random chance for success and a refresh timer of 30 seconds is not very good idea. If it is an additional ability, it begs the question of why it would not be better to have a comprehensive fix to the Taunt button instead - it is very inelegant. If it is a substitute for the current Warrior Taunt button, it is both horribly underpowered and leaves the group at great risk when it fails.<br />
<br />
In either event Warrior Taunt would not in any way allow for slowing on incoming, competative stability, and the ability to regain aggro from a distance should the mob go after a caster.<br />

With Knights having practical (enough to survive and not be a burden to the healer) equivalence to Warrior survivability in groups, there is NO justification for Warriors not having equivalent aggro abilities. This enhanced taunt capability could be disabled when Defensive and Evasive are in force preventing raids form becoming trivial. If your survivability and aggro abilities do not make group content trivial neither would enhanced Warrior aggro abilities. You ideas for Warrior Taunt make NO sense.<br />
<br />
3. More of a commodity that does not limit effectiveness in an environment means absolutely nothing. It would make more sense to reduce HP's on armor for those classes able to use the mana - but this would be a nerf and I'm not in favor of nerfs.<br />

My first 2 &quot;fixes&quot; would not work without the other , andthere are also other considerations that i took into account but did not display on the post .<br />
<br />
If the correct ( meaning the newest lvl of spell ) of stun/snare is used there is a problem with knights aggro to a degree . They cannot keep up with it while maintaining the other useful spells the would use in combat , for sk's that is buffs and for pallies it's heals . The problem with this so called aggro lock is the ability of the knights to use a low level spell that IS going to be resisted and is going to created more aggro because of being resisted . Of course the low level spell's mana cost it barley noticable giving the knights practicly unending aggro. <br />
<br />
Case in point a 65 sk uses Clinging darkness for aggro , it will ressit giving them more aggro . Mana cost  20 , easily recoved . <br />
Now make those spells obsolete and have the knight use the spell more appropiate for the lvl , Festering Darkness , mana 175<br />
<br />
It would add up really quicky in fact , just think 10 mobs , 200 mana vs. 1750 mana . Knights would have a hard time keeping up with constant aggro , and that includes no healing or any other type of utility to be constantly used . <br />
<br />
<br />
2. The taunt wasn't a random chance for success , it was a givin mount of hate and always a sucess but  a value between 1- 750 , add in you melee damage plus weapon procs there should be some trouble but not as much with holding aggro .  <br />
<br />
With Knights having practical (enough to survive and not be a burden to the healer) equivalence to Warrior survivability in groups, there is NO justification for Warriors not having equivalent aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
This i seem unfitting , not due to the nature of me being a knight ( and yes my opioins will be bias because i am one )<br />
the fact that knights are practical ( haveing enough surviability to not be a burden to the healer ) but then you turn around to say that there is no justification why warrior aggro shouldn't = knights .  as i said in my rant the classes that cannot survive the tanking ability do have the ebst aggro in the game . If you don'r belive me go tell a wizard to pull with SoS , tell a necro to pull with kiss of saryn . They will hold aggro over a knight easily if they wanted to . hell even a rogue can pull aggro off a knight . <br />
Yes a knight would have less trouble pulling a mob off a caster then a warrior , but if you think about my &quot;Fix&quot; they are going to burn a hole in thier mana pool and that is how i see it as it should be .<br />
<br />
I'm definatly all for warriors getting a better hold on aggro since i do belive that instead of 0 there should be some . The knights aggro lock is mostly from design flaws ( aka resist = uber aggro ) and really of no fault except SoE . <br />
However go find your self a SK ( would say pally but i honestly don't know a whole lot about them ) and get them to use thier highest lvl spells vs. the lower lvl ones that will resist and create aggro and not a single dent in thier mana pool) and tell me the outcome after a couple hours in a xp group .  I guarentee they are going to have mana problems with tanking for that long , and the group is probably going to laugh at em since they say they can't tank without mana . ( BTW i'm not talking about a decked out sk , just basicly a avg 65 SK in a non uber guild )</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can decide to forego aggro weapons if you wish and use spells. OR use aggro weapons and have your spells freed up for other purposes.<br />
<br />
Since Tank = survivability + aggro control it works out rather nice.<br />

Again: what does &quot;choice&quot; tank mean? <br />

Are you saying that if an equivalently leveled, AA'd and equipped pallie and warr are in an exp/ldon group that it should be a toss up over who is going to tank for that group?<br />

I think based on what I'm hearing here is that a great number of Pallies expect to tank mobs OVER a warrior all other things being equal in an exp/ldon group. <br />
<br />
Again: if it is a &quot;toss up&quot; then what does the warrior do if they aren't tanking in an exp/ldon group?  DPS?  Slow mobs with a will sapper?

<br />
The rathe council can also be done without knights...  you could replace every knight in the raid with warriors and do fine...  Now try the battle without warriors...<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights are generally used when warriors are dead...  and its this role that would be fine with me...  only that is at least as difficult to do as warriors trying to garner aggro right now...  Knights need to get FAR luckier to mitigate so they aren't 1-rounded before the heal cycle lands in time than a warrior needs to be to get their taunt to work right off the bat.<br />
<br />
I am looking for a way to best find a solution.<br />
<br />
Knights currently have as big (or bigger depending on who you ask) of a valid complaint with their raid tanking role as warriors and their XP group challenges.<br />
<br />
Fix both issues at the same time and less of each group really has any ability to whine.<br />
<br />
<br />
For your information, I dont need an &quot;escape&quot; spell....  shadowknights have many many spells for escape.<br />
(it shouldnt be hard to figure out what they are from lucy...)<br />
<br />
I need to be able to stand for 10 seconds against a &quot;tuned for defensive&quot; mob so a heal cycle can start.<br />
<br />
Harmshield makes you invulnerable, but also prevents beneficial spells from affecting you, instantly de-aggros you, and is basically delaying the inevitable when used on raid mobs...  when the harmshield runs out, the Shadowknight will be summoned and killed unless a healer lands a perfectly timed heal. (after harmshield wears and before the mob summons you to die.)  Harmshield has other uses...  but my point is that you would be less than educated to use harmshield as an &quot;escape&quot; tool.  Never mind that we are talking about being 1-rounded, so if the time uber mob is already aggroed on me, I am already dead.<br />
Thanks tuning for defensive!<br />

Bards wear plate armor, why aren't they MT's? And why limit it to melee? Bump up a Clerics mitigation and DPS and I'll bet they can MT perfectly fine. Why only plate wearers? How about Rangers or Shaman?<br />

SoE does not explicitly use the term MT, that is a player convention. I you read the Class Descriptions, there is exactly one class that is described in terms that we would recognize as what we mean when we say Main Tank.<br />

So no, Knights have 0 valid complaints about their MTing role on raids. Knight have valid complaints when SoE does not deliver on their class description and they can't get groups.<br />

<br />
Let me ask you a couple questions because this seems to me to be kind of the heart of the matter.<br />
<br />
First, if knights had a role as you laid out (auto riposte disc) which was designed for encounters where defensive is required, what is to prevent them from using it on encounters where defensive isn't quite required?  As I'm sure you're aware, there's a hell of a lot more mobs where defensive isn't required than those where it is.    Doesn't this simply place knights into the position where *unless* it's a defensive required mob, the knight then becomes the *supreme* tank due to the &quot;aggro headstart and maintenance&quot;?   How is that all of a sudden more &quot;fair&quot;?<br />
<br />
Next series of questions is regarding knight to knight balance.   I contend that without ever tanking a boss, Paladins have a very useful role on raids.    Shadowknights on the other hand don't have nearly as useful of a role.    How would you balance the needs of two completely differently designed knight classes along with those of warriors on raids like this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not &quot;Balance&quot;<br />
<br />
That makes warriors 100% Obsolete.<br />
<br />
So now, Knights should be able to be better XP tanks, and Also be able to tank any mob in the game? Ok... <br />
<br />
Lets look at a few things here.... <br />

So Knights should be able to do what a warrior cannot?<br />
Even WITH DEFENSIVE a 10k tank WILL get  killed in 10 seconds if he has no heals. Sorry thats just the way it is. When you swith MT's the next Tank does not actually start tanking until he has heals, or he will just be as dead as the MT. these mobs can put out upwards of 20K damage in one ROUND... <br />

<br />
So Knight have no other use in a raid except for tanking?<br />
I'll tell you what. As a warrior I am 100% willing to give you EVERY ADDED USE there is for me on a raid. You can do it, take it, its yours... Guess what you will find out you have EVEN fewer uses than you do now. Get of your 'woo is me, pity me because I am not MT horse' It wont fly here. Warriors have no use on a raid if they dont tank. NONE, ZIP, NADDA... oh yeah dps... Even when not MT, a warrior dares not use an offenivedic, because you never know when the clerics will decide to take a dump and kill off the first three warriors, and you get stuck MTing a mob with no defensive.<br />

<br />
<br />
So you want to be MT, and then maybe we can get a group once in a while we can get an exp group?<br />
<br />
Knights already have as valid of a role in raids as warriors. They CAN and DO effectively off-tank mobs. There is no difference off-tanking adds with a warrior as with a knight. IN some instances it is prefered, or even needed. if say the mob needs tanked for 20 minutes and you need to NOT kill it, a knight can tank WITHOUT attacking, Warriors are just about completely incapable of doing such. Knights also add their special skills to make whole raids better. buffs, taps, heals, etc... warriors can, um beg and bind wounds the clerics?<br />
<br />
In a raid situation, Knights already are encroaching on warrior abilities and roles. While warriors can NEVER even try to do the same on raids as Knights. <br />
<br />
If anything Knight Raid level tanking needs to be reduced.<br />
<br />
As to exp groups. Any exp group that is not using a knight instead of a warrior as their tank, well just isnt anywhere near as effective as one that is. Warriors have little to no use in an exp group other than dps, and our dps is poor.<br />
<br />
Lets look at something here...<br />
<br />
Healers as a comparison..<br />
<br />
Clerics have Complete heal (or somewhat complete heal as the case may be) This does 7500 healing base for 400 mana.<br />
<br />
Druids and Shaman- Who are ALSO considered &quot;HEALING CLASSES&quot;<br />
<br />
Druids have their 'CH' which does 2900 for 400 mana.<br />
Shaman have their 'CH' which does 1900 for 400 mana.<br />
<br />
So from this analogy...<br />
<br />
Tanks<br />
<br />
Warriors are the Main Tank, its our job description.<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadow Knights are also 'TANK' classes.<br />
<br />
Well, they should be about HALF as effective as a warrior to be &quot;BALANCED&quot; <br />
<br />
The way it is now, warriors are barely half as effective as Knights in an exp group situation. And the ONLY THING we have over them on raids is Defensive. Which lasts 3 min every 9. so 2/3 of the time knights are actually better on raids than a warrior...<br />
<br />
BALANCE THE TANKS, LIKE THEY BALANCED THE HEALERS...<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to respond to this.<br />
<br />
Paladins role on raids is much more defensively oriented than SKs role. SKs can do considerable DPS when they are prepared for it with the proper spell selection and available HT. Damage is ALWAYS usefull. WHEN NEEDED, healing is VERY usefull. <br />
<br />
When fighting blazzax, a paladin is probably going to be alot more usefull than a SK. When fighting Reparm, the reverse is likely true.</div></div><hr />

Druid &gt; cleric for exp. DS, regen, mana regen for my casters are so much better than the extra hp a cleric can heal, and the extra few hundred hp.<br />
<br />
Good Shaman &gt; cleric or druid for exp.  Rare to find the best shaman, but the ones that own make other healers look shitty in comparison.  Slow + multiple dots + tank at full hp + full mana &gt; cleric/druid<br />
<br />
<br />
To other concerns<br />
<br />
Its a good thing Knights have mobs we can tank... WE ARE TANKS.  On raids we brells, group heal on the few mobs that require it, spot heal every now and then, cure when a healers rc3 dies... and do dismal dps compared to any other class. <br />
<br />
Without being able to actually tank, we would be near meaningless on raids (you would need effectively 1 paladin per raid, with the remainder best served as a cleric/druid/bard)<br />
<br />
Warriors complain because they arent &quot;balanced&quot; at the experience group level to where they want to be... Knights arent balanced on raids to the point we want to be either.<br />
<br />
Asking for better aggro generation, and the desire to be the best tank always anywhere, just doubles the number of classes who lack real roles in some part of the game.<br />
<br />
There are 3 tank cvlasses, and for the mpost part, they each have specific roles as to what they are used for.  We do not &quot;tank better&quot; than warriors.  <br />
<br />
I group with, raid with, and talk to a good number of warriors who have 0 problems doing their job.  Perhaps they &quot;suck as warriors&quot; because they can keep aggro decently, as suggested in a different post.</div></div><hr />

I've said it multiple times now, so Now I'll say it again since you have not read it.<br />
<br />
THERE IS NOT 3 TANKING CLASSES.  There is ONE tanking class and TWO tank Hybrids.  Simple as that, WE ARE NOT TALKING ROCKET FUCKING SCIENCE here.  That very fact &gt;&gt;HYBRID&lt;&lt;(no this is NOT an opinion...just cause you are a plate class DON'T mean you are a tanking class) alone says that you should be mediocre at BOTH of your disciplines(tanking, and spell casting).<br />
<br />
You want balance?  You want smething to do?  It shoudlnt' be in tanking except when needed to save casters.  This all started because of one major factor people tend to over look.......the Developers SHOULD have introduced more content to make Paly/knights desired because of their utility...make a utility class NEEDED for xp groups.  This could have been done by introducing LDON type stuff into he everyday game...not necesarily the EXACT stuff....but make the world more interactive so that the spells you get are a BOON......Instead they chose the Lazy route....the easy route and just upgraded your tanking abilites to be almost on par with warriors....this coupled with your allready suppiorer(sp?) aggro abilites have effectively benched warriors.<br />
<br />
Sure many warriors (including myself) dont' have a trouble with aggro when we are allowed to build it a little.....But Casters dont want that.....it's natural to want to be more efficient and get more for less.....and quite frankly with the way its balanced now, Knights are the choice for XP groups, will ALWAYS be chosen above warriors for xp groups...because the slower can slow upon INC message....the Nukers can lower the boom instantly....and all casters have mroe worries of going oom than getting hit....they can't do that with a warrior. And 6 or 7 seconds PER mob(as everyone taps thier foot while we build a modicum of aggro) adds up in missed xp/aaxp when a grind session lasts hours. <br />

<br />
Not completely true, from what I've read.  There are situations where you have multiple mobs to off tank while the main boss is being dealt with and many times a Paladin is one of or is your best choice.  Also having multiple Paladins for any situation where you're going to be taking AE damage is very useful.  So I would say that it's very situational for Paladins.  Sometimes having one would do.  Sometimes a metric buttload of them would also be very good.  It all depends on what you're trying to accomplish.<br />
<br />
Warrior stacking is much more two dimensional though.  Once you have enough Warriors standing around to deal with backing up the MT should he bite it, you're really better off filling Warrior slots with more healers, higher DPS dealers, or multi-functional tanks like Paladins.<br />
<br />
And Clerics are extremely valuable on raids, are they not?  Even more so than Warriors.  Using your logic it seems that because Clerics have such an important role in raiding, then they should have very little attraction for a group, because of course all the other priests need to be compensated for their lower raid value, right?  Wrong.  That's not how it works.  Never has, never will.  The whole arguement is merely a red herring attempt by Paladins to distract the focus from the real issue.  Imbalance in the experience game, for which they are currently reaping the lion's share of the benefit.  It is in their own best interests to throw out any arguement that might possibly allow them to retain their unreasonable experience group tanking advantage.  Therefore their motives are under serious question, particularly throwing around off on a tangent arguements like raid tanking.<br />
<br />
Your sheer fucking stupidity makes me cry<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to, reluctantly, agree with you on that one.  Trying to claim that Paladins and Shadow Knights aren't tanking classes and shouldn't be viable in that role is, well, stupid.</div></div><hr />

For some. In mine, at the level I play at, with the warriors i play with, they have NO severe disadvantage whatsoever.  Taunt could be tweaked, but nearly every post ive seen by warriors would be so much more than a small tweak. <br />

That may have been a part of the original Vision (tm), but with itemisation, spell increases and skill tweaking, it's safe to say that the knights are classes unto themselves.<br />
<br />
Partha's question, however, is still valid when slightly rephrased:<br />
<br />
Why do you think that a Hybrid (knights may be their own classes, but there's no denying that they're part caster and part tank) should ever be better at a job than a pure version of that class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I probably helped reinforce this kind of thinking by pointing out that without any charter to be MT's, Knights are surely not entitled to be as good in this role's fundamental abilities as Warriors, I need to clear the air.<br />
<br />
Knights are tanks. The Class Descriptions may not provide de jure support for this this role, but their long-standing de facto roles are group MT, offtank, and utility melee. However, they are tanks and casters.<br />
<br />
The Warrior Class Description attributes to Warriors those characteristics which we have come to call a Main Tank and in fact Warriors have a  long-standing superiority in this role.<br />
<br />
Knights share the tanking abilities of Warriors. Since they are also casters they clearly should not exceed Warriors as Tanks in any fundamental Tanking ability. They should be able to MT effectively and even have superiority in rare circumstances.<br />
<br />
Tank = survivability + aggro control<br />
Knight = survivability + aggro control + other spells and abilities<br />
<br />
Any objective examination will indicate that Knights have a substantial aggro control advantage, which in the case of Paladins is exacerbated by functionally equivilent survivability that is particularly evident in the most heavily played environment in the game (LDoN Normal) at this time.<br />
<br />
Knights have such a wide assortment of abilities, it is not acceptable for them to have greater skill in any of the very few defining abilities of a pure class who's abilities they share and to co-opt that class's role.<br />
<br />
We are not comparing apples and oranges, we're all Tanks. But we are comparing apples and fruit baskets. (Gah, now me stomache is rumbling). :(<br />

It all depends on what PoP boss you are talking about. Reparm? You want as many tanks (which in my guild means warriors) as possible. When fighting Blazzak you ideally want 1 paladin for every group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In most cases, we perform quite well with 3-4 paladin on raids, and double that number  warriors.  For a few fights I would rather have more paladin, but eh, when you dont need group healing or an extra body, you could go either way honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's push the point a bit. What percent of PoP boss encounters do not involve either an AE or sufficient adds where incidental damage to many members of the raid becomes a concern? How often do you actually &quot;not need group healing or an extra body&quot;?<br />
<br />
Seems pretty clear to me that ratio is pretty high. On average, paladins are AT LEAST as useful as warriors on a raid. MTing isn't the only thing that needs to be done.<br />
<br />
If you're trying to argue that on average you'd rather have 10 warriors and 3 paladins as much as the reverse ratio, I think you're kidding yourself.<br />
<br />
And obviously we don't even need to talk about farming (you know for various but necessary tradeskills, flags, keys, etc), soloing, or exp grouping (and consider here that your guild requires warrior recruits to have some 82 AA at least, but none for paladin recruits, according to your guild webpage).<br />
<br />
By the way, your comment that you normally have twice as many warriors on a raid as paladins is curious, given that your guild roster has exactly the same number of each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats an out of date  roster I believe (were in the process of setting up a better site), we have 5 active paladin and 13 active warriors.<br />
<br />
Webpage requirements are off (see above, and theres a link to the forums where recruitmjent threads are located), but the minimum for paladin is 93... and the chance of me taking someone with under 120ish is slim to none unless my entire squad decides to quit on me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wont give away our strats much, but the odds of me spot healing on most pop fights that arent completely ae intensive (blazaxx is a good exmple of this), group heals really arent needed, if you can mgb cr/paragon/ect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm so tired of this argument being trotted out like it's some big thing.<br />
<br />
A similarly equipped SK with about as many AA's as I have did 49.64 DPS on a Bertox raid, I clocked in at 63.27.  That's 13.63 more DPS I did, not counting spell damage.  Another SK clocked in at 42.06 DPS.  A pally showed at 102.19 but hey that's undead so we'll let that slide, right?  Because only 40% of LDON dungeons are undead, not to mention Grummus, Bertox, Carpirin Ring.<br />
<br />
On a Mith marr raid we've got a few knights showing around 60 DPS, again comparable to what the warriors clocked.<br />
<br />
So shut up.  Quit whining about your DPS and your utility.  At least you *have* your utility.  You have your &quot;pathetic&quot; heals that you &quot;only&quot; throw on your healers &quot;now and again&quot;, your harmshield, your nice group mana regen and heals, oh and you want to tank too?  Go piss up a rope.</div></div><hr />

Warriors complain because they arent &quot;balanced&quot; at the experience group level to where they want to be... Knights arent balanced on raids to the point we want to be either. <br />
Let me be perfectly clear. No Tank class is entitled to significant superority in either of the 2 characteristics that define a Tank at the experaince group level to the point that it receives greater opportunity to play the game than another Tank class.<br />
<br />
Tank = survivability + aggro control<br />
<br />
Your class reaps the full benefits of raid activities - the opprotunity to participate, experiance, and loot. Your class has a raid role even if you do not MT as often as Warriors.<br />
<br />
Without parity in Experiance group Tanking abilities, Warriors get to participate less, get less experiance, and less loot. We do not have a group role when we are in /tells trying to find a group.<br />
<br />
Experiance group Tanking abilities are not something that should be deficient because 2 members of the Warrior class get to do something at a raid that you are envious about. They are fundamental abilities that are the birthright of ALL Tanks.<br />
<br />
Many if not most Paladins understand this even if you don't.<br />
<br />
Find some other Wheaties to moisten please. We need not debate your long discredited ideas.<br />

And Warriors, read the sign - &quot;Do not feed the....&quot;<br />

HOW is it stupid that since we ARE PURE tanks and NOT HYBRIDS...H.Y&gt;B&gt;R&gt;I&gt;D&gt;S,  that we should be THE tanking class....we get no spells, no Harm touch or Lay on Hands....I was not saying that they shoudln'tbe able to tank.....but saying that they shouldn't be able to tank NEARLY as well as we do.  Besides AI am Right...they are NOT tanks...they are a TANK HYBRID.  That is a fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
I stand by my statement that while they should be able to tank when needed....they are HYBRIDS....the dev's fucked up when they took teh easy way out by increasing thier ability to tank rather than creating game content to make them NEEDED for their other abilities... THAT is what was stupid.  SK's and Paly's, while getting SOME Necro and Cleric spells, shoudl have had their own line of abilities spells that was specific to those classes and content coudl have been introduced to make those abilities/spells Needed.  In a sence they could have created a TRUE &quot;Utility&quot; spot in a group......then groups would have a choice between a tank, a DPS Class, slower, healer etc etc AND a utility class... OR Replaceing the Tank with a SK or Paly if they so desired and had the mana for it....adding an extra DPS slot instead of having 1 tank 1 utility.<br />
<br />
The original premise behind a HYBRID is a char that is a combination of 2 or more classes ....... NOt 75% onf one and 75% of another...that is unbalancing.  And THat is what knights have right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
VoT-ToT innate ability to warrior, stackable with SK buff if possible. It should be innate, not part of item like Raex BP. ToT would have range obviously and would be useful at the start of the fight, while VoT would provide increased aggro over time.<br />
<br />
utility - master bodyguard : take shielding a step further, and when you're in a group, using a shield, you automatically shield everyone in the group or a specific target whenever they get hit, without the need to activate or remain close. Constantly using a shield for this skill would reduce our dps considerably, but would help us gain utility in relation with tanking. At best we could do it with any weapon combo except the shield would only provide better dmg reduction on the person getting hit.<br />
<br />
This way, within raid, it would be good to have a warrior in enchanter group during clearing or other class that might get aggro momentarily. The same would be true within xp group.</div></div><hr />

Warriors right now are &quot;pure tanks&quot; and it got you nothing.  If you want to cling to that idea, you are going to cling to all of the same problems you have now.<br />
<br />
So tell me Deurgeran, how much more HP and mitigation do you need before you think Warriors are fixed?  I stand by my answer: there isn't any amount of HP and mitigation that will fix Warriors.<br />
<br />
Lose the lables.  The idea of Hybrids as being two classes stuck together was a bad one that lead up to this crazy system we have now.  Classes should be defined in their entirety in of themselves.  If an SK is defined to tank then by goddess they should tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they HAVEN'T said anything about expanding our abilities, they haven't even hinted to it.....only a post on teh SK board has talked about it......as it stands now we got tanking...and that's all.  So I'd sorta like to be the hands down best at it.....and with the aggro advantages the kights have(as well as the utility and being almost on par wih us on tanking) that is NOT the way it is.  So MY GRIPE is how it is now.....like I said I will welcome the day they expand our usefullness.  But untill that day, the differnce between warrios tanking and SK's/Paly's should be VERY noticeable. ...... They have nearly teh same tanking ability as we do but we have very little of the aggro ability THEY do.....I am NOT sayign nerf Knights....but we need some improvement.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna have to agree with Aeka on this.  There's 3 tank classes.  Despite the fact that knights have spellbooks that give them added utility they have to be roughly equivalent at xp group tanking at least for them to be balanced outside of raids.  Their added utitlity does make them more powerful overall but very few groups are going to take a paladin as primary healer or an SK as DPS.<br />
<br />
They need to bump up our aggro control to match knights for XP group content and possibly exclude Raid content from those aggro changes.  That will bring our tanking ability into rough parity.  Then they need to increase warrior utility so we have something to offer other than just tanking.<br />
<br />
I've been in several groups where paladins serve as backup tank/healer/primary res.  This works especially well if we have a druid as primary healer.  I've never seen a group choose a second warrior for any reason other than &quot;it's a friend&quot; or &quot;we have 5 and NOBODY else is LFG so might as well get the warrior&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's nice to think that since we're the most specialized tank that we should be &quot;hands down the best at it&quot; but it's not gonna happen so we should be pushing for either more DPS or more utility in addition to some initial aggro control.  More HP/mitigation will not be enough to do anything for us unless it's such a massive jump that we can tank stuff unslowed as efficiently as a knight does it slowed.  Without an initial aggro boost, I'd estimate warriors would need about a 30% boost to both HP and mitigation for us to be equivalently efficient at xp group tanking.  That would totally destroy the challenge for all raid content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The real problem is twofold. Since Knights aren't Warriors a different role needed to be found for them. But unfortunately, (and this is Real Inportant) *** even with all of their utility there is no group spot for Knights other than MT ***.<br />
<br />
After 4 years even SoE has figured this out and strengthened Knight's so they can effectively MT in groups.<br />
<br />
So what utility are you proposing?<br />
<br />
I have a few to suggest -<br />
War Paint 100AC 1500HP 40% Haste self buff right click effect vendor sold.<br />
<br />
Deadly Insult 0 Sec Stun 300 Hate 100 range inate ability<br />
<br />
Combat Medic Increases bandaging HP's to 400.<br />
<br />
There, that ought to be just enough utility and just the right kind to insure Warriors meet their Class Description better than any other class. Perhaps to be balancing Knights should be given a new skill - Defensive should be perfect. Just need to disable their spellcasting for 90 minutes if they use it.<br />

<br />
The self-haste and bandaging improvements would help Warriors contribute to non-optimal group configurations much better than they do now.<br />
<br />
The Deadly Insult would be a big help for aggro generation.  You would have to be careful to set the right reuse time, and give the stun portion a chance of getting resisted that increased with the mob's level.   But allow it to cause the aggro whether or not the stun lands.  This would give Warriors some chance at interrupting spell casts as well as the aggro.<br />
<br />
That would go a long way toward bringing Warriors to where they need to be in experience groups, and if implemented carefully could be accomplished without expanding the Warrior's raid capabilities significantly.<br />

<br />
At first glance what I suggest seems pretty radical, but believe me it isn't.<br />
<br />
Warriors are horribly dependant on certain specific classes to be present in their groups to have a meaningful survivability advantage over Paladins. War Paint could overide Virtue, Brells, Focus, and Haste buffs. The exact AC, HP, and Haste designed to match them. It merely insures that whatever the group makeup warriors have decent buffs. Paladins not only can insure that they at least have a minimum set of buffs, but can buff other members of their group. This ability to buff others is primarily useful in groups not using a Cleric as a healer, but it is a nice advantage.<br />
<br />
Deadly Insult is intended to give Warriors snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro. Yes, it could have a 30 second timer. Paladins would still have a better aggro lock, caster interrupt, etc. abilities. But groups could chose either the better Paladin utility, or a heavier tank without basic aggo control being an issue.<br />
<br />
Combat Medic is there just to show that underdeveloped and neglected abilities could have some group utility. It wouldn't change a fight, a raid, or make Warriors more powerful. But it could reduce downtime.<br />
<br />
The point is that added utility could make Warriors more groupable without &quot;breaking the game&quot;. It is one thing to have a class have weaknesses and dependancies. It's another to keep it stunted while the classes around it grow.<br />

Right now, we're a bit better at taking damage, and we suck at dealing it....<br />

<br />
You wouldn't want that to stack with other similar buffs, assuming that the goal is to help Warriors be viable in situations without the perfect compliment of buffs.  I would also suggest dropping those numbers a bit so that a Warrior would have incentive to use other classes buffs when they are available.  It's one thing to allow Warriors a decent 'minimum set of buffs' but another thing to make that minimum better than all but the best configuration of possible buffs.  <br />
<br />
Reading it again it seems more radical than the first time I skimmed through it.  But it is still a very good place to start a discussion of the topic!  <br />
