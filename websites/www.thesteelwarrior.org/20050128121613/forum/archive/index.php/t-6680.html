<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I think I have the best possible weapon combos I can get but I just thought I would ask if anyone can think of something better. For raids I DW and use CHSD (mainhand) and CHoS (offhand) both auged with Anger 2. For normal group I use GoT auged with Force of Ykesha cause my normal group we do mostly Hard LDONs and things like GOD trials. Places where DWing can be deadly from riposte and Engrages. I do ok with normal group. Chanter starting to pull agro sometimes cause he has more mana now so he is starting to nuke along with everything else he does. My normal group knows well how to manager agro so an improvement in agro would be nice but not as needed. Raids I am having more and more trouble keeping agro. I swear I think SOE changed something recently cause I did not have this trouble before.<br />
<br />
Anyway I normally am MA for my guild. I am not in a pure raiding guild but I can buff up to 9645 hp now so I do well but I had trouble in HOHB last night. Is there any agro weapon out there that you can think of that would an improvement to what I already have that can be gotten with a SINGLE group. I say that cause as I said I am not in a pure raiding guild. Loot is completely randomed among everyone that can use it with the minor exception of things with like FT on it that are ALL/ALL only casters roll and things that are really high agro weapons only Warriors would roll on even if a pally or something could use it (except for my hammer I got every piece of my current armor in single group or bought with money gotten from my normal group). Getting a raid drop is not very easy in my guild and not something I count on. We are about to start hitting RZ and I am trying very hard to convince guild leader that the BOW should not be randomed among warriors but given to certain people. So I am trying to think of a way to increase my agro on my own.<br />
<br />
So far the only thing I can think of would be change the CHoS for a BOC if I could buy one (fat chance only have 100K) and maybe change Anger 2 augs to Anger 3 augs (I just hate to do that cause these weapons are so not worth Anger 3 and need to be upgraded). Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like I said it is still randomed loot so would have to roll for it. We are trying to get to EP right now. I lost like 10 rolls for Vindis BP before I won it including once to a Shaman. I got the BP and a week later I was finally able to buy my Ornate BP so the loot did me little help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a great BP for a shaman...better the shaman gets it than a warrior IMHO (since we have ornate and LDoN as options now)</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they will notice that the freaking MA should have better weapons then a Droga weapon for EP.<br />

Also, think about killing Eindride(? pulled the name out of my ass) in BoT towers for the Great Blade of Storms, heard it is just as good for aggro as the BoC</div></div><hr />
