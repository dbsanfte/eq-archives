<br />
First off, Grats the Champ BP, champ gear was my first real no drop armor and the bp is of course the best of the lot...it should last you for some time (till you get a vindi)<br />
<br />
BW caps at 200 post 50 aye?  I have been at 185 for some time and its getting rather annoying (like my languishing bash skill at 200).  I heard at 200 BW does up to 70 percent, making the AA worth it to get to 100....anyhow sorry to hijack, just seemed a close enough thread to ask the question.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah you need 201 skill to bind wounds to 70%, but I don't think you can actually hit 201 skill until around level 56 or 57.<br />
<br />
That said grats on champs BW, but bind wounds is still faster healing and you can use it on other people and you can set up macros ingame to BW youself multiple times in a row for easier healing up.  When I used to solo back at 60th pre PoP I had a macro that was 5 lines of &quot;/pause 1150 , /doability 3&quot; (or something like that).  After a fight I could just click that button and I would BW 5x in a row automatically.  I found it much easier than clicking on the heal BP every 15 seconds or whatever the cast time is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eastest way to get it up is to get an Embalmers Skinning Knife then take a trip out to Greater Faydark. Now run up to the top of the Nexus Spires and jump off. (Make sure that you are not encumbered at the time so that you do not 10k yourself.) Keep doing this over and over until your hit points are nice and low, then start bandaginging yourself.<br />
<br />
While I like to use the Spires in GFay, any place that you can jump off of to damage yourself in decent amounts without 10King will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or take some nice refreshing lava baths in Lavastorm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khiloor</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lavastorm is a good idea cuz there's actually gypsy vendors that sell bandages there.<br />
<br />
It took me a LONG time to go from 185-192... and stayed at 192 until i dinged 57.  Then i payed my trainer for the last skillups from 192-201.  Cost me a few more plat (probably like 100pp), but it took less time. With BW3 AA skill i can BW to 100%.<br />
<br />
I have Champs bp as well as 210 BW and I use them both, it's situational.  Here's some things i have learnt using them both.<br />
  <br />
1.  I can actually BW myself up quicker than with Champ BP because of the slow cast time on the BP. <br />
<br />
2. I duo and trio with a shammy and monk combo most of the time.  My BW to 100% on the shammy he can Canni forever if he wants.  Downtime consists of shammy Canni and me BP healing myself, and me using my bandages on the monk (he can BW to 70%) while the shammy gets his mana back.<br />
<br />
3.  You can BW yourself while invis. BP is a cast spell so it drops invis.  This has helped me in tight situations.<br />
<br />
4.  I BP heal all the time after a rez because it's just easier.<br />
<br />
5.  Large Soiled Bag is easily obtained and can hold 200 bandages with almost no weight. 200 bandages x 85 pts a bandage = 17000 hps of healing.  I rarely have gone under 80 bandages at any time.<br />
<br />
Some things to think about before abandoning BW.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kodi</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well done on the BP.  Cracking the 200 BW skill is a Biatch but well worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha I used the lavastorm method to get bind wound up... since I had so many HP, it took a long time to burn low enough!<br />
Well, eventually a newbie came along and saw me bathing lava.. for a whole minute or something. Then he thought that lava isnt as deadly since I can bath in it so long !<br />
So he took a dive himself, and burninated within seconds to death! omg the lolz I had!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my BW was already up to 210 skill from plat farming guards, i got the BP because it heals for more for less money, in less time, nad i think i can bindwound myself and then clicky bp, gota try that out :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klomck</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BW seems to get hps up faster than the bp, LOOOOONG cast time on it. <br />
get the embalmer's skinning knife, off-hand it, go farm somthing you need ( i did mine in pre-re-vamp droga ) and BW when you get low with your nifty free bandaids. use the bp to get above 50, and above 70 after you hit 201.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer the tinkered device to the skinning knife. I never remember to get new bandages, and then don't have any when I need them, but by then it's often too late to try to proc some more conveniently. The tinkered device is pretty cheap, runs off type 1 batteries, and has a potential reservoir of jillions of bandages.</div></div><hr />
