<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksargo</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in a mid-levelish (average around 20-40) guild and I am looking for some good spots for us to raid. I was thinking of having a raid for the 31-40ish and a raid for the 20-30ish. We have about 40 people in the guild. Post some good mid-level raid spots here :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kaesora comes to mind, and I would guess it would be a blast.  Could do it with just 1 group really but if you wanna raid it its ok.  I am not sure if deep in permafrost is ok or too low, I will take the shot and say deep in perma would be nice for those levels to hunt ice giants.  A lot of parts of City of Mist, not all, but quite a bit.  Kedge, and the Hole.  Ok, I am out of ideas.  <br />
<br />
As far as Kedge and the Hole, be carefull there are certain points of no return for a group that low and the raid might fail.  Good practice tho indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you mean by &quot;good&quot; in your raid definition.<br />
<br />
The main reason people raid (and play this game at all) is for character progression.  There are 2 ways which characters progress in EQ.  The first is levels and AAs which you gain in XP groups not raids, and the 2nd is for gear (and in PoP flags) which is the goal of raids.<br />
<br />
Courtesy of mudflation there is very little (if anything at all) that you could 'raid' for with 30ish level 20-40s that an upgrade couldnt be bought relatively cheaply from the bazaar.  Because something difficult for that number of mid level characters would be trivial to a high level group or a high level soloer in some cases loot valueable to characters of this level would just be farmed by higher level characters so there isn't really any raid content focused for players in the mid levels.<br />
<br />
If by 'good' you are looking to enjoy working on team work and doing something a bit different by getting your whole guild together then I'd suggest looking for a dungeon targetted at XP for those a few levels higher than you are.  <br />
<br />
The Tower of Frozen Shadow could be a good spot because much of it is keyed and a fair amount of loot is no drop its unlikely the loot dropping mobs will be cleared by farmers, also clearing each floor looking for keys makes it more of a quest completion raid than a loot raid.<br />
<br />
If you have a decent number of 40 somethings another fun place to try could be doing a fire giant raid in Nagafen's lair or even an efreet lord raid.  These were the end game when the level limit was 50 so in a way they are designed as raid level encounters for level 40-50 players.<br />
<br />
I realise that you are probably planning this as a fun event and its not all about phat lewts, but it can be a limiting factor to your excitment when the peak of your lower guk raid is disposing of the Froglok king and the reward is the once mighty and now 200pp piece of bazaar junk Mithril Two Hander, or you crawl your way there and find some level 60 paladin sneaked in ahead of you and solo'd your raid target.<br />
<br />
edit: fixed up some bad spelling and grammar.  Left plenty in there though</div></div><hr />

I cannot believe I forgot that!! and Naggy's Lair!!!  Yes indeed very very very fun places!  Indeeed if you're planning it for fun look up those 2 places too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wiggling your weay into the back of Paw with mid-high 30s group is one of the most fun things you can do in EQ.  I'd dare say the ability to do this with appropriately powered folks (read that not hyper twinked) is becoming a lost art...the geometry of the zone and the mixture of mob types makes it a fun challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Hollowshade Wars also come to mind. Read up on these, because there's a LOT of decent no-drop items worth getting.</div></div><hr />
