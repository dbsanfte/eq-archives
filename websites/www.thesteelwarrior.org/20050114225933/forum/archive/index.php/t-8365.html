The Tak BP is nice, when OoW comes out there should be some new LDoN pieces.  Might find a better Shoulder then?</div></div><hr />

I'd seriously consider surveying your guildmates/guildmate's alts and seeing if they need any help with their gear/quests.<br />
Short of that, level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ssuruss</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe upgrade the fingers, steel ring of earthen resillance(sp?) would be beter then the valor. Ear symbol of the Veteran and  Tear of the Rainmaker would be slight upgrades. I personally would get a LDoN bracer and then get an ornate BP and then destroy the ornate bracer...or maybe get a crystalized acid bracer if you have the plat/resources for that.<br />
<br />
It depends on how much plat you have to play with and/or what resources are avaliable. Your gear is not hurting one bit. I'd worry more about getting to 65 ASAP then grab those AAs then I would I about gear.</div></div><hr />

Thanks all for the advice. I got two Steel Rings of earthen Resiliance. And have been doing as many North Ro LDoN's as i can to get that BP/Bracer's combo. I passed on getting the Tear and Symbol ear pieces only because what i have now has better stats all around other than HP on em. <br />
<br />
Picked up a BoC, and am now wondering what to offhand with it?<br />
<br />
I mean do i use my SoTB or my CHoS in my offhand? I usually switch out the SoTB for my CHoS when fighting caster mobs. I notice a slight increase in stuns when i do this, and keep the caster off balance a little more often than not. <br />
<br />
Well as always any info is good info.</div></div><hr />
