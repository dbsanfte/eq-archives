<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Defector</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simple question - <br />
<br />
I saw Sword of the Bloodsworn in bazaar for the first time today (for 75k) and was wondering if it would be a good upgrade for my offhand.  Currently i use Blade of Strategy in primary and Blade of tactics in secondary.  Would Sword of the Bloodsworn be a good replacement for Blade of tactics?  I'd lose alot of dex and attck without Blade of Tactics, and the upgrade would at least cost 50-75k.  I'm thinking yea it would help aggro alot, but not 50-75k worth of aggro and i should save my money for ornate armor or something.  Also i should mention that i just applied to a guild who can kill AoW.... so BoC may not be too far off (if i get in).<br />
<br />
Basicly, i'd just like more info on how well Sword of the Bloodsworn holds aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used the epic 2hander and that was better agro than the GSoT.<br />
<br />
I would dump the blue epic for something, anything really - I have never used the sword you want adice on though. The blue epic is useless - frankly it would be more use to have a SBoZ in that slot till you get something cool like a BoC</div></div><hr />

Have you LOOKED at that thing lately?  Hubcap on a stick.  <br />
<br />
Dual wielding stun weapons &gt; greatstaff of thunder, in aggro, and in fashion.<br />
<br />
As to the original question, you figure out where that thing drops, and i'll camp it and tell ya :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If epics are better than GSoT then why does everyone i know prefer the GSOT over thier epics?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The GSoT is a common drop off a rare spawn in BoT - go camp SPad long enough and you'll get one. Not like getting your guild to PoA, Chardok, Fear, Hate, buying 2 scales and running around Norrath like i had for my epic.</div></div><hr />

With avatar from my primal its like a proc fest. 2 weapons with nice ratio and 179dd and stun is more effective then the GSoT in my opinion. If i want to use a 2hander  I break out the old Gaudrelak Sword of the Sky which you may want to look into from Lord Vyemm in NToV, its 179dd and a 1 foot knockback unresistable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because aggro is  hard to really estimate very well, and some people really want to use their epic, even though it sucks, because they spent half their EQ career trying to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Defector</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whoa guys! who said anything about GSoT?!?!?! lol<br />
<br />
I'm no fool - i know deul wield procing weps hold better aggro than two handers<br />
<br />
I wanna know about The Sword of the Bloodsworn (its a 1hs)<br />
heres a link to it http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62188<br />
<br />
It procs a 75 DD and stun</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a sexy statement that will get people interested in what you're saying quick. It may even convince a few people to try that combo out for themselves.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope, however, that they'll continue to read and understand what you're saying when you say:<br />
<br />
&quot; With avatar from my primal its like a proc fest.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a big difference between Greatblade of Storms and Copper Hammer of Striking ... and using them both while swapping in Primal for Avatar.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
And another thing ...<br />
<br />
While everyone continues to HATE on the Blue Blade ... ask yourself this ...<br />
<br />
Why does avatar help with the procs?<br />
<br />
Could it be the 100 dex?<br />
<br />
Why does avatar help so much with DPS when it procs?<br />
<br />
Could it be th ATK boost?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the dual 14/24's are all that great. They do lack DPS in today's post 60 world.<br />
<br />
BUT ... I find it humorous that so many people will swear by things like Vengance gear ... and continue to swap in primal weapons for the avatar proc this far into the game ... and yet, miss the OBVIOUS benefit of the blue blade ... the increased DEX and the ATK boost.<br />
<br />
Luckily, I'm a monk. And I hold no illusions about weapon ratios. And I hold no illusions about DPS. It's what I do.<br />
<br />
And ATK gear pre-VT is hard to come by. Keep that in mind next time you're dissing your Blue lightsaber.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cough Ferine Avatar from a SCR3 shaman cough. Hehe...why eat a sandwich when you can have steak? <br />
<br />
The real issue with the blue blade is that it sucks for warriors.  Look at your monk epic.  41 haste, 40 atk, few AC.  Warrior epic has no haste, just 40 atk, and some dex.  Whoop de do.  The attack rating isn't going to help any warrior hold aggro, period.  It's a nice little small  (emphasis on small) dps boost, but what does it really do to help you hold aggro?  Well, some may say the dex helps, but in this day and age of +75 dex from Focus alone, I doubt few people are far enough from the cap that another 40 is really gonna make a substantial difference in their proc rate.<br />
<br />
The epic was really never implemented very well.  Every other pure melee got 41 haste on theirs, and a decent weapon that could last them until NToV and beyond.  We get fuckin 14/24, with a meager proc on ONE and a dex boost on the other.  The simple fact that every other melee had AT LEAST 5% haste on us for the longest time already puts us behind, and as a kick in the teeth, we get Dex on our weapon.<br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn and Copper Hammer of striking are now going to beat out the Warrior epics...from simple 3 man camps.  They're gonna beat the epics in DPS, and they're going to beat them in aggro.  The epic is a poorly implemented relic.  It has no place in the game today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">people hate the blue blade because its a pain in the arse to get for the reward. It needs 41 haste on it like Haas said - or some other decent effect.<br />
<br />
To the guy banging on about the 40atk - take into consideration that you have to equip the thing to get the effect so you end up with a fairly average ratio trade off. Plus atk freaks are usually people tryng to do dps with 2handers. If you have your blue epic in your off hand for tanking then you should rethink - its got no proc and crap ratio. If you have your blue epic equipped in your off hand for dps and atk then your wrong again as you may as well go pay 5K and get a reaver which will out damage your epics.<br />
<br />
As i said before - i have tanked many mobs with both 2handed epic and with GSoT - and the GSoT is crap compared to the HATE PROC of the GSoT, sure the GSoT has a better ratio - but I found the mobs stuck to me better with the epic proc rather than the GSoT proc and dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My warrior doesn't have his epic, nor will he ever. I have possesed every piece but the 2 blades. I could have gotten both at one time or another, but I have always let them go to people who wanted epics. No way in hell I would go through the trouble for such a big downgrade. I have tanked with other warriors weilding 1h epics and 2h epics and rarely have I ever have a problem keeping agro over them using GSoT. Sure a single proc of +hate might be more raw agro, but it has been my experience that the GSoT has a considerably higher proc rate than both the 1h and 2h versions of the epic. Also, the GSoT FAR outshines the epic for DPS so it is much less proc dependent.<br />
<br />
That being said, I recently got a Copper hammer of striking. I have paired it with a shortblade of lightning and I can say I have been VERY impressed. After buying the first one I found in the baz, I made my way to droga to see how hard the camp was. 57 war, 65 wiz, 65 bard broke and held the camp with ease. The King popped and also dropped with ease. Dropped another hammer. (BTW - he weilds it if he has it.) I would imagine any 60+ war with decent gear and a healer could do this camp. Killing would be slow, but you could do it pretty easy. Get a druid or shaman healing and they can dot/nuke to speed up the game.<br />
<br />
I haven't found where Sword of the Bloodsworn drops in droga, but I will in time. I would imagine that Bloodsworn+Copper hammer will be exceptional for agro. Probably just under 2xSoD agrowise - similar ratios, similar procs and more importantly, at least the hammer is WAY better looking than an SoD. Plus about 10X cheaper.<br />
<br />
Go camp yourself a Copper hammer, then find out where the Bloodsworn drops and camp that. Should hold you over for some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Balthizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Im 65 now and love the current setup I have. As far as the epics I never started or intended to start since there were already better weapons popping up. The warrior epic is very outdated and basically a neat status item . Grats to all the warriors that busted there arse to get it I applaud your patience and effort of getting your epic you truly deserve a hand. Even without having avatar on me they still proc alot I was stating its like a mad proc fest when I do have avatar. Different people find what aggro weapon works for them. I was just stating how impressed I have been and how happy I am to have the Greatblade of Storms and the Copper Hammer of Striking. The GBoS is a weapon I think warriors should strive to get if your guild can do BoT tower bosses, its a great weapon. As for the copper hammer of striking its a great weapon also camp it and try it out if you dont like it sale it for 30-50k. Im not saying there isnt a combo better than this I know there is but was stating if you have the means to get these 2 weapons im sure you wouldnt be disappointed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah. The shamans I hang out with either don't have the spell yet, or are SUPER-stingy with it.<br />
<br />
I've had avatar up once in my entire life.<br />
<br />
In Seb.<br />
<br />
Boo Yaa!<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I picked up a GBoS recently and I am very impressed with it.  I'm using it mainhand over my SoD.<br />
<br />
To answer the question, yea I think the sword of the bloodsworn would be a nice upgrade for the blue epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mazzarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You can easily camp the Sword of the Bloodsworn and avoid the 50k price tag.<br />
<br />
It is dropped off Earth Sear Gartolk (or something like that, it starts with a G), who can be found in the area above the king room.  He has a PH at the base of he deck that looks out over the king room entrance (not the one at the end, the one at the very beginning).  You can camp it with 1 group no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You could see it from another point.<br />
<br />
Blue Epic in offhand. 14/24 55 DEX 40 ATK<br />
<br />
Ok how much of your damage you deal with Offhand? 30 % ?<br />
Ok how much of your damage you loose between a 12/19 and a 14/24 ? 20 % ?<br />
<br />
That means you loose 20 % of 30 % of your damage cause of the stats. That would be around 6 % Damage.<br />
<br />
40 ATK will raise youre Damage by around 4 to 5 % so you loose over all 1 to 2 %.<br />
The 55 DEX will bring your Mainhand to a better stream of procs and a better stream to aggro. Offhand procs are not the real deal for aggro ( maybe for holding aggro not for gaining aggro ). <br />
<br />
So with the blue you will loose a bit damage but gain a better chance for faster ( more ) procs and therefore mabye a bit faster aggro.<br />
<br />
When you wanna make damage go and grab a sword out of NtoV ( TSBB or Gaudralek... )<br />
<br />
Sometimes the blue blade is better than the red one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very strange.  Over last 4-5 months GSOT proc has been much more reliable in exp groups for me than 2 handed epic by far (or windblade or Marshall staff...I screw around alot with combos).  It procs much more frequently and I still can avergae about 90-100dps (considerably better than what I get dual wielding).  I only swap to CHSD/red epic/FB4 shield when defensive.  /shrug to each their own.<br />
<br />
I agree with you that 2 handed epic has nice agro IF it procs but unless they jacked up proc rate it really isn't all that reliable.  <br />
<br />
I am curious though over a 1 handed weapon with planar strike; that would be hella agro and would easily render GSOT obsolete.</div></div><hr />
