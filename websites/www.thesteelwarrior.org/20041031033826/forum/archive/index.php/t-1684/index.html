<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Allpain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a level 65 Warrior and do alot of the tanking for my guild on raids.  I have in excess of 310 AA points so there isn't anything more I can do to improve my agro generation or defensive ability in this area.<br />
<br />
Keeping in mind the ability of a guild to mash &quot;Mob X&quot; depends upon the overall strength of the guild and not just their Main Tank, what Standard do other MTs use to determine if &quot;X&quot; piece of loot is significant enough to warrent you looting it?<br />
<br />
Background:  My Str, Dex, Sta, Agi are all maxed at 305 in raid situations.  Therefore, mainly I am concerned with AC, HPs, Resists, and special buff type enhancements.<br />
<br />
Would you say a 10 AC upgrade and a 50 HP upgrade along with some resist improvements would warrent looting a piece of loot?  Is that too much or not enough of an upgrade?<br />
<br />
I realize it is hard to make cut 'N dry guidelines, but it would be interesting to hear people's thoughts on this subject.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">best to go to alakhazams, look at each slot, and see what items you can reasonably obtain in next few months. i mainly go for items that are gonna last me a while. if its a minor upgrade, hold off, i waited forever to replace a thurgadin bp with vindi(-2ac, +10hp, +resists).<br />
<br />
i replaced a shissar ring with crimson bull, 12ac and 20hp upgrade, but im not likely to see better for long time. high ac is hard to find in a ring too, 30ac ring of destruction owns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do you have a Magelo profile that you can link here?  That will help you get more specific answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well you have to balance two things.<br />
<br />
1) The strength of the guilds main tank affects the guild on nearly a 1:1 ratio, while the strength of any other single member of a guild affects that guild on a 1:60 ratio (or however many are in your guild).  Put in different terms, double the strength of your MT and you can nearly double the strength of your guild as a whole.  Double the strength of any other single person, and you increase the strength of the guild by 2-3%.<br />
<br />
2) You cant just give everything to a MT because its an upgrade. It hurts your guilds morale to do so.  So you have to balance whats best for the guild logistically with whats best for the guild's morale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Allpain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Attached is the link to my equip. just as an FYI javascript:view_profile(361565);<br />
<br />
I am most interested however in hearing what you think justifies the MT looting an item over another in guild.  We use a DKP system, but just because I have the points to buy something doesn't always mean it is best for the guild if I loot it. . .same old same old of weighing the good of the many over the good of the one.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for your input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My rule has always been: Don't upgrade many slots with dinky small upgrades, but instead set your sights on something big and make it last. This is the same for people who buy things with plat in the Baz, or people who buy things with DKP. I feel good whenever I purchase or loot something that is a long-term upgrade.<br />
<br />
I think Ludor was right, just check what targets your guild is able to do within the next 3 months and go by that. Immediate tiny upgrades are not as satisfying to me, nor is it better for my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would agree that you should go for the biggest upgrades your guild is capable of. No point in getting a 5ac 10hp upgrade on your boots when you can get a 20ac 100hp upgrade on your helm. One thing that helps a lot if to do an upgrade search at Allahkazam's (might be a premium option, but its cheap to buy and worth it). Just enter all of your gear and have it search for upgrades with what ever criteria you think is important. I use AC x5, HP x2, STA x5 and select my upgrades that way. Look where your items fall and what your guild is currently capable of as well as what you expect to be capable of in 2-3 months.<br />
<br />
Once you have a list of upgrades, order them by the relative increase in stats per slot so you get the most bang for your DKP buck each time you take an item. Be sure to make a plan and stick to it. All too often I have seen people loot a minor upgrade on day, then get what now amounts to another minor upgrade a couple of weeks later because they where impatient. They could have save themselves DKP and given an upgrade to a guildie had they waited for the bigger upgrade to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gobbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The first thing I do is look at the 'modifiers' list for HP in magelo.  It lists the HP in each slot from highest to lowest.  Then I go and do an advanced item search at eqmaps for each of my lowest hp slots - you don't need a membership to do this.  You can check the boxes next to the items your interested in and hit 'compare' to get all the stats in table form.  Anything that you don't know where drops, copy the name and paste it into an Allahkazam's item search to get where/what drops it.  <br />
<br />
The second thing I consider is how long this upgrade will last.  The ideal situation is that I will only start replacing DKP-bought items after every other slot has DKP bought items in it.  It has been pretty easy for me, up untill now, to do this - my guild is at the stage where we have done everything in luclin and are starting towards the ele planes.  Its hard to decide whether to get the low-hp or low-ac raex slot items (which are big upgrades) in VT, or hoard points till we start getting ele armor.  It doesn't help that we have been getting shit drops on belt/back/face/earring in VT.  Not to mention the lack of bloodfrenzy.<br />
<br />
On whether or not I take loot - if you are picky enough to only get upgrades that you won't re-upgrade for a long time, then take everything you want.  Like someone said earlier, the tanks' gear is the most effective upgrade for the guild overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Decking the MT in minor upgrades does help the physical side of your raid, but you have to remember there are what, 40+ other people who's thoughts a gm / loot handler has to take into consideration for things. <br />
<br />
That said as the others have suggested, run magelo and check your modifiers by hp. Work on the lowest slots first, keep ac in mind when you make said choices as well. Since you are basically your guilds raid MT talk it over with your officers, leadership. Talk it over with the rest of your warriors, and guildmates. Most loot problems come about from lack of communication, and there are times when a slight guild advancement may not be worth the personal anguish it can cause. <br />
<br />
Something to think about. If you want my opinion you don't seem like a loot whorish type at all, or you wouldn't have come here to ask. Your helm / neck jump out over all other slots currently, i'd work on them first if possible. Good luck to you and your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">General rule I use on upgrading is that I won't loot something that I will replace when we advance to the next tier.  My guild is in VT currently and every item I am after from VT won't be replaced until we get to the plane of time.  The slots I'm not upgrading in VT are the ones I plan on upgrading in the elementals (basically all visible armor slots).</div></div><hr />
