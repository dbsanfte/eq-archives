<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gonaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to purchase 2 Marble Spheres of Ire and augment both your primary and secondary 1-handers with anger3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.  The Anger II and Anger III augs are not lore, so you can have as many as you want for your different weapons.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that an Anger III in your primary hand is the same total hate over time as an Anger II in your primary hand and another Anger II in your offhand (although the latter does provide more frequent procs).  So if you have one good weapon and one crappy weapon, you're probably better off putting Anger III in the good one and nothing in the crappy one rather than Anger II in both.<br />
<br />
And if it's your first aggro aug, you may want to make it a 510-point Yak augment.  It's better hate than Anger II, does damage, and costs the same.<br />

Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wha? why not just anger 3 both weapons? why would you just put anger 3 on one assuming both are good weapons? Your post is confusing me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khalim_EoT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He never assumed both are good weapons. He suggested to put Anger3 in the good weapon and nothing in the other weapon, IF it is a crappy weap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry for the confusion; it wasn't a direct response to the original post.  More of a tangent.<br />
<br />
A lot of people don't have many LDoN points, and so to &quot;save points&quot; they put an Anger II aug in their CHoS, and another Anger II in their SotB.  Then, when they get a CHSD/GBoS, they bag the SotB, and there go 510 hard-earned AP.<br />
<br />
You get the same total hate over time, and nearly as many procs, putting an Anger III into the CHoS.  Then, when you get a CHSD/GBoS, you don't lose any AP when you bag the SotB.<br />
<br />
Of course, since most warriors who raid even occasionally will eventually have both a CHSD and a GBoS, what I'd *actually* recommend is putting the 510-point Yak aug into the CHoS.  You get about 3 DPS extra, it's got better aggro than Anger II, and when you end up replacing both the SotB and the CHoS, you're still only out 510 AP.<br />
<br />
At least, that's the path I'm probably going to take, if I decide my aggro needs the improvement.  That, or putting the Yak aug into my GSoT.<br />
<br />
(he said, being himself a non-raiding warrior at the moment)<br />

Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok that makes sense now, thanks :)<br />
<br />
Seeing as how I don't raid too often I'll probably just anger 3 my GSoT and use that if agro is ever a problem.</div></div><hr />
