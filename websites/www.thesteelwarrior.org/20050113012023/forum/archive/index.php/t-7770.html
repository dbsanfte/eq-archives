Thanks DA LUMMP</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for trial 2 .. its not Gazek Anymore start looking around.<br />
For a Maroley (if i remember well).<br />
<br />
Or just download a map of KT. If that doesnt help, your helpless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menia</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Give the Pendant to the Expedition-giver, then talk to the human at the zone-in, say, he'll see that you handed in the item and you can ask him about &quot;Progression update&quot; (I'm playing on a localized server, but I think it's progression update in english, anyway, you got to respond to something in brackets ;))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LUMMP</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Menia that is exactly correct info. We finally just risked him eating them and gave him one. Having the maps(as I do) doesnt help one whit with this. Nowhere in either npc's text does it ask for proof or an item or anything. I did numerous searches on several boards and could find no info on this. <br />
<br />
Basically if you don't have the info from an outside source you have to just hand him the item and pray 1) its what you were supposed to do 2) its not what you were supposed to do, but Sony didnt have thier HUTA and npc gives it back 3) NPC eats it and you get to do whole even over again in 18hours.<br />
<br />
But at least now there is a thread with the neccessary information <br />
<br />
Thanks DA LUMMP</div></div><hr />

I was told that Stonewall is useless when tanking DD reciently,<br />
Is that true when you killed him ?..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LUMMP</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes if you use Stonewall/Defensive/Evasive DD will eat your healers. Start Furiuos and they burn offensive discs. Good crowd control and couple healers seems to be key to this encounter, at least it was for us.<br />

<br />
Yah, but that would require reading what the NPC says, in-game!</div></div><hr />

He swore there was nothing about what to do with the pendant in any of Gazek's speech. Remember if your not the one getting the trial you dont see any of this lovely information.<br />

Yes, if you happen to miss the text you are pretty much screwed as far as I know.<br />
<br />
It only gets worse too.  After you complete the 3 trials you go through some more text with the guy near zoneline, and he sends you off to do a bunch of things.  <br />
<br />
Not only is that text rather unclear and poorly phrased, there's also no way to look at it a second time unless you happen to remember the trigger phrases (and I'm not even sure it works then).</div></div><hr />

Each time of them I used my defense and DD hadn't eaten my healers. I think if you up furious first, your healer should be safe.</div></div><hr />
