Melee balance -- they are working on it, they know the warrior/knight issue is there and big, they know taunt doesn't work as it should.  Other then that, they weren't willing to discuss it.  What else do you want to know?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furor</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They'll just end up nerfing Knights. As it is right now, Knights are so far out of wack that it is BEYOND RIDICULOUS. It'll probably take us demolishing their Time level raids strictly depending on Knights for aggro and tanking for them to finally do it, though, but I'm sure something is coming. I warned them in Beta, I warned them pre-Beta, I been bitching about this for nearly as long as I can remember now, and all they did was make the problems worse. Now we have 10k+ hp Knights with retarded utility running around with constant 10% mitigation bonuses and infinite mana laying waste to the land.<br />
<br />
I've also been busy taking pictures. Everytime some jackoff tells me Knights don't tank on Raids, I'm gonna link a picture of one of my Knights tanking a Plane of Time boss or some LDoN uber. <br />
<br />
Frankly, the stupidity needs to end. I feel like a fucking piece of shit on raids, especially LDoN raids where my aggro is goddamn near worthless and mobs hop from player to player mem blurring themselves non stop and assraping the civilians. Some of these raids scream USE KNIGHTS TO TANK DUMBASS... and we do. It's just fucking frustrating being sidelined with 11k hps and 2300 ac because I have zero aggro control and initial heals generally result in a fucking catastrophe if I'm not lucky on proc rolls.<br />
<br />
They HAVE to initiate a Knight penalty to gear. They need to start taking massive hits on gear they can wear from Time and other places to even step inside the realm of balance. Unfortunately, Sony doesn't use water to put out a fire, they use gasoline. Word on the street is that a new round of Plane of Time item upgrades are coming in to help 'pure melee' out due to the tremendous disparity of pure melee versus hybrid utility out of identical gear. Sadly, putting ATK bonuses on ITEMS that HYBRIDS CAN USE DOESN'T JUST MAKE PURE MELEE STRONGER, IT MAKES HYBRIDS STRONGER TOO.<br />
<br />
........ <br />
<br />
And the worst part, they wouldn't even throw us a goddamn bone by making the Darkblade of the Warlord a 2hander with a respectable ratio and effect. You reap what you sew, and I assure you, a barrage of shit is incoming.<br />
<br />
I feel a vein 'bout to give way........</div></div><hr />

Allow me to explain why.  Just above you, the guy you are responding to, has 11k HP and 2300 AC.  Now, he has plenty of tanking ability.  He has plenty of DPS, I'm sure.  And he says that his problem isn't his ability to tank nor his DPS, it's holding freaking aggro.<br />
<br />
Now, if they jacked his HP up to 14k and gave him 2800 AC, do you think the problem would suddenly go away?  Why? Why on god's green earth do you freaking think that suddenly the fact that he can't hold aggro early would cease to be a problem?  Do you think he won't need to be healed any more?  Do you think heals will produce less aggro?  Do you think boss mobs will gobble up his Clerics less frequently?  What the f*ck do you think would happen?  It would be exactly the same as currently, except the Clerics could delay on the first round of heals by a couple of seconds.  But if he is producing shit for aggro, then nothing changes.<br />

As it is however, anything a warrior can tank outside a 3-min discipline, a knight can probably tank too given comparable or slightly higher gear.  90% of bosses that require your higher eshelon of MTs, should be completely untankable by even your top knights in slightly superior gear.

<br />
Um thats a problem too, <br />
With current spells that have come out via Guard of Vie etc, Knights with less gear then the uber tank are now starting to easily take his job, Simply because of the added mitigation and availability for never ending heals from fellow knight's , cleric's drood's etc.<br />
<br />
Defensive isnt our main point anymore.  Ask the people who know, Defensive has been weeded out to the benefit of Knight's. I dont know if you have listened to Furor, but um knights cant defensive and yet there tanking time god's. <br />
<br />
Prolly more effeciently then warrior's. Now what will most people answer? Well thats only one plane, And not everyone will get there? Thats a load of shit for a answer so dont even post it. <br />
<br />
The warrior class is being so erroded that its no longer funny,<br />
Hell I watched a knigh start tanking named in VT when our MA droped once a while back, JUST BECAUSE he could do it as efficently. <br />
<br />
So two high end zones = knights as MA, Xp groups = Knights as MA. Do you really need anymore justification that shit is really screwed up?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Im pretty sure if the big man Furor wanted to go back through PoP for shits and giggles he could get paladins to MT every god encounter wihtout a problem, But thats just speculation.<br />

The gap between tanking ability and dPS between the knight classes and war class should be larger is what I am saying.  I personally do not feel that wars are/should be instant aggro but once they have it for it to be locked.  <br />
<br />
You gimps that are upset that a paladin or sk can outaggro you are just not bieng realistic about your class.  The imbalance between hybrids and pure melee is that the pure melee don't exceel enough in thier area to make the difference noticable or even preferable over thier hybrid counter part.<br />
<br />
Wars a) should be best tank period, mitigation, ac, hp etc.  b) be a master of all arms and as such have a decent DPS and c) be able to lock aggro at a point.  Not a long point but not instant. AKA a min or so.<br />
<br />
As I said before:<br />
<br />
<br />
they are tanks and they can cast, who cares if they have instant aggro your problem is the tanking ability and dps ain't large enough.<br />

Letme change the your, to the Warrior's class problem is the tanking ability and dps isn't large enough from the hybrids.</div></div><hr />

The two primary things raised by me and another warrior during the dev forums were taunt and itemization of plate armor.  Both those things need to be fucking addressed immediately.  Even WITH a gap in AC/HP (which there isn't at present) knights will STILL ultimately take less damage in group scenarios since both have heals that mitigate the damage taken.<br />
<br />
After the bogus goddamn pat-on-the-head statements during the dev forums, I've actually side-lined Vigdis and have asked that my chanter be my main in the guild.  I was hopeful they'd fix melee at some point, but its just too painful to hang around and watch the SK tank all of my mobs.  At least my friends know that its not that I'm a shitty warrior, its that warriors are shitty.  That doesn't exactly make up for it.</div></div><hr />

It's Knights that need to be nerfed.  Frankly, even if all the aggro gimmicks that range from reasonable to not people are asking are in the game, you'd still be far inferior to a Knight unless it's something drastic like taunt was changed to enraging blow.  So why bother?  Warrior with your new improved superior taunt is still inferior to a Knight anyway.  Nothing will be changed.  <br />
<br />
And I don't know why people continue to believe aggro in LDoN is broken.  It is very obvious that whoever designed LDoN made sure mob would just bypass whatever aggro abilities a warrior have.  You don't get stuff like that on accident.  It's obviously designed from the get go to punish warriors.  I use Vanazir over BoW in LDoN groups because it's pointless to try to get aggro anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild uses Knights to tank in Time also.  One of our paladins has around 10400 hps and 2200+ AC.  I should add that he ALSO does cures, stuns, heals, etc WHILE TANKING.<br />
<br />
I've also gone to using DPS weapons in LDoN, I use a OGB now, it doesn't taunt at all, but it's better DPS.  No point in using HG/BoC or Norge'tal, etc cause they can't hold solid aggro anyhow.  I just let the rangers and BST tank.<br />

FF sucked from what I've heard other than lots of drinking... which I would imagine is a lot more fun when not surrounded by a bunch of EQ loosers...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me reiterate, the tanking ability of a war should be superior to the hybrids not marginally.  Overall through mitigation hp and ac should they tank better then any hybrid.  Pardon me for not saying the f-word and not saying how overpowered the pals and sks are.  <br />
<br />
Get the hot poker out of your arse and think one second.<br />

If the gap between tanking ability and DPS was larger between the pal/sks and wars do you think wars would be  the raid tanks over pal/sks?</div></div><hr />

Lets see, knights CAN tank.  Even if we were ahead by by a lot more, the only time we would be used is if you are low on clerics.  Yeah, you could use a warrior and have an easier time healing, even a lot easier.  But the fact is, the knights CAN tank and are at a point that no matter if we have significantly higher tanking ability they would still tank because aggro control is so much better, and they don't have problems tanking as is.  Thats what you don't seem to get through your thick skull.  Give us a lot more tanking ability, they will still tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're outright telling you that improving mitigation, AC, and HP wouldn't improve the situation unless it was to such a huge degree that literally mobs had a hard time killing us while they gobbled Knights up like candy.  For raids we already have defensive, which makes us a significantly better tank than a Knight, when it comes to taking damage.  Yet Knights are still tanking raid level mobs.  Why is that?  Because of aggro, of course.<br />
<br />
And the party line is improve Warrior aggro generation, not nerf Knights.   If you're going to get with the program, at least get with the right program.</div></div><hr />

sounds like he's asking for war aggro to be improved.... /rolls eyes.<br />
<br />
seeing as how the main rant forum is crying for paladin nerfs, I believe you glatius.  War aggro does need improved like I said before your post.  <br />
<br />
the way I see it pal/sks should tank about 75% as well as a war can.  aggro?  who cares as long as the war can lock it in, within a reasonable amount of time.  <br />
<br />
The way I see it raids pal/sks should be the innitial aggro until the war surpasses them and locks it in (which should take a minute tops).  But that's just my own thoughts on it all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors are only raid tanks because they have /defensive and a few mobs have a high enough dps to require its use. Not because of hps, not because of AC, and defiantly not because of DPS.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, being invincible does you no good if something is not attempting to damage you.<br />
<br />
What the warrior class lacks, that is an element of its job, tanking in case you have forgotten, is aggro generation, period. Nope it doesn’t let us solo better or make wizards cry from leet dps numbers, but it's at the heart of the problem and what needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
I am getting peaved at people trying to throw out these insane out ideas, be them warriors so desperate for something that they want anything and everything that they can possibly think of. or the trolling kahnigits, who are trying to bait people and cause confusion.</div></div><hr />

EB Taunt might do it, but let's face it, sony would never do it.  This is really shitty news.  Hell, I already feel worthless in LDoN whenever a knight is around because let's face it we all want to win the missions and knight aggro lock just gives you that much better of a chance of winning.   What a joke our class has become.<br />

And if the rumor is true about pure melee armor being upgraded in PoT then grats to the 2% of the pure melee population that are actually in PoT!  Now you can absorb more ae damage while the knight aggro locks the mobs!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally remove their channeling ability; viola, no more being a tank AND a caster; pick one or the other during combat.<br />
<br />
Other possible, but more involved fixes:<br />
<br />
-Remove all Hp AND mana armor; one or the other; possibly make existing items select HP if pure melee class (or bard), OR mana if a hybrid class.  No item, except perhaps pal/SK only ones, should have both.<br />
<br />
-Remove all aggro from totally resisted/immune spells.<br />
<br />
-Dramatically increase casting time on all aggro generating or heal/cure spells for hybrids only (kinda similar to lifetap procs for sk vs. necro, 25 vs. 75 iirc).<br />
<br />
Pretty big nerfs IMHO, but not totally unreasonable...<br />

 Paladins weren't designed originally to be aggro generators. Give that up, and a paladin will be what it SHOULD be: The premier MITIGATING tank. And STILL desireable as an MT in XP groups, WITHOUT having a lock on the job of MT in xp groups.</div></div><hr />

For example it could be Rangers instead.<br />
<br />
Gear needs to be looked at for sure, but aggro generation abilities need to be looked at.  If it's meant to be hard, then it should be hard for everyone.  It almost feels like in LDoN mobs have an AI of something like:<br />
<br />
If warrior decrease aggro by 50%<br />
If Knight do nothing<br />
If anyone else increase aggro by 50%<br />
<br />
Maybe Knights are subject to whatever anti-aggro abilties they put in LDoN, but if so it's not enough.  At the current scale, it needs to look something like warrior -50% aggro, Knights -70% aggro, and potentially rogue, monks, and rangers actually need an aggro decrease as well.</div></div><hr />

Most encounters are tuned around warrior aggro which by definition means it's fine.  If an encounter is hard to hold aggro for warrior, it is intended to be that way.  Increasing warrior aggro would just mean they'd have to put in bigger anti-aggro abilities to compensate.  The problem is that Knight aggro is too good and their tanking abilities are too close.  If Rangers suddenly have 20000 HP overnight, it doesn't mean Warriors or Knights can no longer tank, just there would be no reason to.  Same issue with warrior aggro.  It's not that we don't have enough, but there's no reason to count on it when you can have a Knight.</div></div><hr />

Anything short of giving warriors aggro at will is not going to be enough to remove the Knight's stranglehold on aggro generation.  Why have 90% aggro lock when you can have 100%?  Okay, maybe 99% is enough, but do you honestly think you're going to get that?  Warriors will never get aggro lock.  That's just not how this game is designed.  So Knights with their aggro lock will always be better than us no matter what improvements we get.</div></div><hr />

It may not allow everyone to unload as rapidly as with a Knight, but it would give the Warrior much faster reaction times when things go wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.  <br />
<br />
Ever tanked Emmerick Skyfury in the Agnarr encounter?  He slows, roots, and snares.   I couldn't hold aggro on him to save my life.  Everytime someone cured me I'd beat on him a few seconds and immediately get slowed, rooted, snared, and even silenced (No procs). <br />
<br />
We had a pally tank him.  The pally has nearly 1k less hp than I do and yet he never lost aggro once, and wound up needing FAR LESS HEALING than I as a warrior with &quot;superior&quot; tanking skills did simply because the healers had to heal me *and* the people who got caught in the AE due to my UTTER inability to hold aggro.  Once AE taunt was down, it was all over for me on that mob.  A knight had to tank it.<br />
<br />
You gimps that are upset that a paladin or sk can outaggro you are just not bieng realistic about your class.<br />
<br />
Any Tom Dick or Harry who bought an ebayed knight *can* out-aggro a warrior. That's not the point.  The point is that right now, the combination of aggro lock and an ability to tank as well as a warrior is knocking us out of balance.  I grouped with my monk alt in POV the other day, with two different tanks.  The paladin would stun on inc with some long ass stun.  The shaman would *immediately* slow.  The paladin would cast another stun and the mob would be stuck to her like glue.  For the entire fight.  I never had to feign once.<br />
<br />
A warrior took over.  The shaman could no longer slow on inc, I had to flop a few times during the fight to shuck aggro, and the mob pingponged several times.  It wasn't the fault of the warrior.  He was using a SoD and a CHS.<br />
<br />
The knight was level 59, with 5k buffed.  The warrior was 62, with 6.5k buffed.  Yet the group ran much easier with the knight's aggro lock.<br />
<br />
Now you tell me, how increased DPS, HP, and better tankability would have bettered this situation.  The point is, you can be an awesome tank but it doesnt matter if you can't keep the mob hitting on you and not your groupmates.</div></div><hr />

You simply don't rely on taunt working on a red mob to save your raid.<br />
<br />
Why do people complain about not being able hold aggro on a mob with trivial anti-aggro abilities like Emmerik Skyfury and expect SoE to take you seriously?  There is not a single PoP encounter I can think of except Cazic in Time where a warrior would not be sufficient.  Show me an encounter in PoP where you can honestly say 'can't do this with a warrior' and maybe SoE will care about warriors crying wolf on lack of aggro.  The problem is that Knights are too good, not that we're not good enough.  If you don't even know what's the problem, how can you expect it to be fixed?<br />
<br />
You can make a mob never ever leave a warrior if you push taunt on it once, and there are still legitmate reasons to want a Knight over a Warrior (especially for xp groups).  And you want to ask for this kind of power?  If you think warriors can be brought in line with Knights without nerfing Knights, then you do not understand just how much better they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah but there is the problem how to nerf them when they are so good.<br />
<br />
1.  Cut their tanking abilities ( welcome to Kunark ) <br />
2.  Cut their aggro abilities ( sounds good )<br />
<br />
But<br />
<br />
The warrior are often working with the same instruments for aggro as the Pallis.<br />
<br />
Stuns.<br />
<br />
Nearly all stuns we use for aggro at higher levels have no real success on the mobs like the low level palli spells.<br />
<br />
So a fix ala &quot; A spell casted on a mob wich is unable to affect the mob will bring only 5 % aggro &quot; would also kill lots of aggro abilities the warrior have now.<br />
<br />
It isnt so easy to fix the crap they made in the last years, and they knew it. And the new result will also be crap ... and they knew it.</div></div><hr />

This is the argument wizards would have when mages could keep a solid DPS in a group and nuke almost as high.  Some classes are meant more for the raid encounters then the group encounters.

How do you wanna do that?<br />
<br />
nerf knights ?<br />
<br />
Hm when you wanna nerf knights in Hp youll have to nerf all other classes except of warriors in HP.<br />
When you wanna nerf knights tank abilities you have to do a deep look at some other class tank abilities ( and you should know the result of the monk tank nerf ).<br />
<br />
increase warrior.<br />
<br />
Bleh when you increase warrior youll have to overview all the bossmobs in the game ..........<br />
<br />
Now I have 9300 hp buffed with around 1890  AC I will loose aggro the same way when I have 12 k hp with 2300 AC or a better defense or something else.<br />
<br />
Maybe it would cost less to heal me but ... CH is 7500  so in lots of surroundings ( except of raids and hard hitters ) the ch could go for full amount, but it would not help the shaman or chanter to survive cause of aggro lost of the tank.<br />
<br />
As furor said 11 k hp and 2300 ac and in Ldon  he let Ranger/Beastlord/... tank and dishes only damage and that shows the problem the best.</div></div><hr />

Aggro Dot. New taunt formula. Increasing the effect and range of shield. <br />
We need something that will make caster say &quot;Hey this pal tank almost as well as warriors, but warriors rocks because XXXX&quot;<br />
So, A little tweaking in aggro, and something else. something related to tanking, and only tanking as we are supposed to be &quot;specialists&quot;.<br />
<br />
For monks and rogues... I could see some &quot;Burst run&quot; ability for monks, allowing them to run faster than selo for 12 seconds, usable every 5 or 10 mins... and some &quot;Ripping stab&quot; ability for rogues, allowing to score once every 10 minutes, a always-hit backstab that always crit and hit for a lot. <br />
<br />
But we'll see nothing like that for now... SOE need to parse on their own test server the time melee focus on ALL/ALL gear.<br />

<br />
     A lot of you are saying that to solve the aggro issue knights need to be nerfed.  Have you taken into consideration that nerfing knights will do nothing to solve the issue that warriors have a difficult time keeping aggro?  True it will balance the classes aggro-wise, but all it will serve to do is turn us all into horrid tanks who can't keep aggro to save our lives.  The best course of action is to find some way for warriors to keep aggro through use of skills and weapons, which is the soul of what a warrior is.  He relies on himself physically, and the weapons that he wields to perform his function.  If this means that new abilities need to be implemented that give warriors multiple ways to grab aggro aside from taunt and procs, then so be it.<br />
<br />
     I didn't start my SK with the thought in mind that some day I would be the greatest tank alive.  Hell, when I started I didn't even know what was going to be expected of me at high levels.  I can only use what was given to me by the developers to perform the function that is expected of me.  By nerfing knights you will only serve to make US obsolete, and maybe that will make you happy.  The aggro issue does not exist in the knight's ability to hold aggro more efficiently, it exists in the fact that warriors at their present state CAN'T hold aggro, through no fault of their own.  Thus by nerfing knights, yes, once again warriors will be the best tank in the game.  However, warriors STILL will not be able to hold aggro, it will just be that NONE of us will be able to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
     I'm sure you're going to pick apart every single thing that I said, and that's fine.  Feel free to use all the quotes you want and tell me that I'm stupid and that I don't know what I'm talking about, I've seen how forums like this operate.  But just remember that in RL we're all human, and that we aren't perfect.  Those who are so quick to point the finger at the other man should first look to their own imperfections.  That is all, let me know what you think, and try to be civil about it.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly don't see us getting anything like knight aggro lock, nor do I see knights getting nerfed.  I'd say the 3 main areas that need work are aggro, itemization, and utility.<br />
<br />
1) Aggro.  Two parts to this, aggro at a distance and aggro lock.<br />
<br />
1a) Using stuns or darkness/terror gives a smart knight the ability to lock aggro from long range.  All that a warrior has for long range aggro is a bow, which can be extremely useful but has far more limitations and effect than a spell.  My idea would be a new Taunt at range skill, introduced at level 45, capped at 200.  Call it 'Infuriate' or 'Your Mom' or whatever.  Give it a 200 max range, 50 min range, 30 second refresh, adds +hate equal to your skill.  The +hate hit is small enough to not be unbalancing and the 50 minimum range keeps it from screwing up raid tanking.<br />
<br />
1b) Aggro lock.  This may not have been originally intended but right now it has become the signature feature of the knights.  Considering that any nerf to this would also devastate the pre-BoC warriors, while only having a minor effect on high level knights, I don't see this changing.<br />
<br />
2) Itemization.  This has been an issue since Velious and only gets worse.  The mudflation of WMBS, Windblade, GoT, and the Droga weapons, while boring, does at least give mid-50s and higher warriors a decent weapon selection and there is a fair amount of acceptable stuff available to lower levels (Frosty, Lammy, etc).  Armor on the other hand is totally screwed up.  Huge amounts of mana and brain stats on almost every piece of all/all and archetype armor does wonders for hybrids and squat for pure melees.  Solution #1 - more pure melee only accessories (earrings and stuff) and more class specific pieces.  Solution #2 - let pure melees get some use out of brain stats and mana.  If there was some kind of conversion of mana into ac and/or hp that would at least mean that hybrids did not gain substantially more benefit from the same gear.<br />
<br />
3) Utility.  Right now, our utility consists of /shield.  The range on that needs to be increased.  Also, if we don't get some kind of mana converter, allowing pure casters to siphon our currently useless mana pool might be an idea.  Even perhaps (/shudder) another AA, 3 steps, which boosts the mana pool of every caster in the group by 10/25/50% of our mana pool.  I'm sure there are other options to give us something else to make warriors more attractive to groups.<br />
<br />
4) Other stuff - Raise the piercing cap.  Unhook the disciplines.  That spell gem idea for disciplines that someone posted would be good.  Fix Furious Bash.  Actually, making shields into weapons might not be a bad idea.  Have them function as shields as well as Secondary-only weapons with a 60 delay (or whatever the Bash delay is) and an attack value = to their AC.  If something like the Stormrider Carapace became a 54/60 1hb with an auto bash, I could see using it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just some ideas and yeah, it should probably have been in the War Room.</div></div><hr />

As long as two out of three classes have Aggro-Lock, Ranged Aggro, Insta-Aggro..  <br />
<br />
It will remain unbalanced...<br />
<br />
This has been hashed over hundreds of times.  <br />
<br />
Personally I feel that the instant aggro/lock ability of the Knights has harmed the game immeasurably. The game no longer has any challenges with all the 'easy improvements' Knight Aggro lock being one that affects me more than most. What it does, is allow people to get exp, and levels and AA's who in all honestly should never make it past level 20... BECAUSE of aggro lock... People have no clue how to manage aggro.. THIS is IMO, a BAD thing.<br />
<br />
Will SOE remove aggro lock? highly doubtful.<br />
<br />
ergo, the only soloution is to give warriors equivalent aggro capabilities as knights....<br />
<br />
Thats not what I wish, but it is the only soloution i see as viable.</div></div><hr />

Can you give me a solid reason why you'd go smack a Paladin who cast a stun on you which has absolutely no possibility of landing?  Or why you'd go smack an SK who'd just tried snare you even though the Wizard crit hit for several K of damage?<br />
<br />
And taunt is not merely using defamatory language.   It's the games way of dealing with the Warrior trying to throw himself between the mob and the casters.  It's the game's way of dealing with the Warrior throwing sand in the mob's face, attempting to kick him in the nads, and telling him that his mother was fun last night....<br />
<br />
It is the game equivalent of turning away from your opponent, dropping your trousers and beating on the cheeks of your ass (as some ancient tribes would do when facing the romans and wanting to express their contempt of them).  It's the equivalent of telling the mob we already got a holy grail so go away before we taunt you a second time.<br />
<br />
There is NO reason for it not to work at range except that SoE hasn't yet designed it to work that way.  And there is NO reason it can't work as well as the alternative methods, except SoE has deemed that it shouldn't.  Which can certainly change.</div></div><hr />

the fact is they need to give warriors something to get snap aggro,  taunt and praying for a proc is beyond stupid ... they need to make your taunt to where if it fails your at the top of the list... but if it succeeds you gain the top spot and 250 pts or 400 or something... and put a 75 or 100 ft range on it...  that might fix the problem...</div></div><hr />

Nerfing Knight aggro doesn't mean you can hold aggro better over BST or RNGs.  In most of my LDoN groups it's rangers and BST that are tanking the most, because I rarely group w/ knights.<br />

How do the rangers out aggro you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and last night it was pretty funny in Tier1.  We had 2 SKs and I couldn't get aggro for JACK!  I taunted for 2 whole fights w/o getting aggro at all in Rock.  Then I finally got to tank one, after I got *8* EB procs in that fight.</div></div><hr />

You are completely mising the point I think people are trying to say.  You could give us a 2k HP boost, give us a 10% more mitigation boost, blah blah blah....and guilds will still use paladins to tank over us.  Why?  Cause they do it RIGHT NOW AND GET AGGRO LOCK!<br />

<br />
Personally I feel that the instant aggro/lock ability of the Knights has harmed the game immeasurably. The game no longer has any challenges with all the 'easy improvements' Knight Aggro lock being one that affects me more than most. What it does, is allow people to get exp, and levels and AA's who in all honestly should never make it past level 20... BECAUSE of aggro lock... People have no clue how to manage aggro.. THIS is IMO, a BAD thing.<br />
<br />
...Are you going to start telling me stories about back in the day when you had to run 50 miles up hill in the snow, carrying your whole group on your back to get from North Qeynos to Highhold?  And that you remember a day when items were cheaper, lowbies respected the high levels, and GM's were helpful?  You sound like my old man talking about back in the 1950's.  Everquest is how it is now, and you'll just have to deal with it.  And remember, as always, if you don't like how the game runs, noone is forcing you to play it.  Have a good day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vorth</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Shadow Knight, I work with the warriors in my guild.  They tank at all raids unless they aren't there.  I have the warriors every once in a while hit their taunt key to get that highest agrro +1 occasionally.  I stand further back and cast my agro spells to build my agro up,  I am always #2 or #1 on the agro list.  By standing at max melee distance I can build my agro above the warrior and he will maintain holding agro, as long as I don't go to far over what the warrior has.  Warrior taunts and back on top he goes. <br />
<br />
Very quickly doing this I can build the agro up on the warrior so he has lots of agro.  Our wizards have no problem nuking to their desire and not drawing agro.  <br />
<br />
Once your warriors/sks  get in the habit of doing this it's second nature.  Find the Shadow Knight in your guild that knows the most about their agro, and I don't mean the one who knows only how to build agro till they take it.  Talk to them try it out,  I'll bet you'll find it works great.  The warrior who is the better tank holds agro,  the SK keeps the agro on the warrior, and you get the agro ability of the SK and the tanking of the warrior.</div></div><hr />

You say nerfing knight aggro will make everyone a &quot;horrid tank&quot;.  Better it only be the warriors at this point, eh?<br />
<br />
I say it will not create horrid tanks, but better players, better groups, and an understanding of how to manage aggro.  No more sloppy slow on inc and sit down.  No more snaring at 99 percent so you don't &quot;forget&quot;.  No more nuke unloading just to beat your burst DPS parse record.<br />
<br />
Here it is in a nutshell.  <br />
<br />
There is Aggro and Mitigation (AC/HP etc) which need to be inversely proportional.  If you can lock aggro you should pay for it in mitigation.  Cmon folks the game should have some friggen sense of difficulty.  Knights can aggro lock all day long if they want as long as they suck down a proportionate amount of healing mana.  The tank and the group should have to work together to roll through an XP camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is DPS and Utility which need to also be inversely proportional.  The more utility you have the less pure DPS.  Sound like a reasonable idea?  It seems like common sense to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now Knights enjoy both the aggro lock and the mitigation due to ...<br />
<br />
1) lazy ass ONE SIZE FITS ALL &lt;Classes&gt; armors from high end to LDoN<br />
<br />
2) No penalty to defense in the act of casting (stop and cast a damn spell and you should be a &quot;cake&quot; target losing all defensive innate skills - dodge, parry, riposte, whatever). Never have understood how you can cast and dodge while engaged in melee.  Remove channeling if the ATK button is depressed for all classes.  I don't know if you remember, but this was originally part of the game in that weapon delay was added to casting time or something similar (hell I don't know exactly how it worked) but people cried about their low dps and in trying to boost that they took out the realism of casting while engaged in melee - broke something new trying to fix something else lol<br />
<br />
3) Utility, Aggro Lock AND 252 Defense.  Dunno how that is possible.<br />
<br />
4) the 50 other reasons listed on 400 threads from buffs reducing the percentage difference in ac/hp between war/knight, the Vie line of spells, the defensive mods, etc etc etc etc<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't want a boring game with aggro lock for all while groups sit with no challenge and rake in the xp.  I want there to be no advantage for a group choosing a knight over a warrior or vice versa.<br />
<br />
I want:<br />
<br />
-Lower knight aggro or lower knight mitigation<br />
-Raise war DPS via one of  a million ideas e.g. Furor's melee dots<br />
<br />
I don't want:<br />
-Knights nerfed into Kunark; however, to achieve the balance of mitigation/aggro lock with the current state of knight a War would have to be buffed so incredibly high in mitigation to make every encounter in the game absolutely trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The aggro issue does not exist in the knight's ability to hold aggro more efficiently, it exists in the fact that warriors at their present state CAN'T hold aggro, through no fault of their own. Thus by nerfing knights, yes, once again warriors will be the best tank in the game. However, warriors STILL will not be able to hold aggro, it will just be that NONE of us will be able to hold aggro. <br />
<br />
 Ya know, I thought for a minute before replying to this. I was gonna be the smartass you challenged everyone to be (and that you eventually became yourself), but I'll give you your answer.<br />
<br />
 You DID know that Warriors CAN and DO get that aggro hold later in combat, right? Otherwise, there'd never be a Wizard who used IC in combat, never a Shaman who Turgur'd, never......but you see where this is going, I hope.<br />
<br />
 However, there is a difference between HOLDING and LOCKING aggro. Locking aggro, as has been shown by the whole experience of PoP, is unbalancing. Holding it, as groups had to do in every expansion beforehand, was not.<br />
<br />
 The biggest culprit in lock aggro is the Paladin stun. Retune that down to where you can HOLD aggro with it without being able to LOCK aggro - and you have a balanced situation again. I've never had a problem getting groups at the same rate as an SK - we both get screwed by the 'Paladin Lock'. However, giving lock aggro to Warriors is much more game breaking than bringing Paladins back down to earth, and OUT of the aggro generation game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try to understand something, This is The Steel Warrior, We dont give a crap what you believe is  fair. Boo hoo Kunark was dark times for you.. Boo hoo That was what 5 expansions ago? <br />
<br />
If nerfing is needed, I say drop knight mitigation below monk's, Increase paladin / SK dps , start adding immune tags to PoP mobs and make sure that there is no aggro generation off  spells flagged immune for. <br />
<br />
Am I being harsh? Why yes, yes I am. Hybrids cry about kunark dark day's then REFUSE to acknowledge that warriors since end of velious till LDoN 5 expansion's have had dark day's. <br />
<br />
Now im sorry this has turned into a bit of a rant / flame. But seeing I_am_wanna_be_ubah_pal_99 spawn and talk about how they all suck without aggro generation, Then hear about them beat MYTH's that held true back in the kunark era . <br />

If you increase warrior DPS a very likely outcome is that you end up with Knights tanking and all warriors discing aggressive.  <br />
<br />
As for those who say Warriors use stuns, that problem is easy to bypass.  They can just code each stun spell differently, adding negative aggro as needed ala planar stun.  In fact I'm not sure why they have yet to apply negative aggro mods to stuns yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WARRIORS ARE BROKEN. KNIGHTS ARE OK<br />
<br />
1 - GEAR :<br />
The fact than warrior should rely on superior gear, when today everyknight can use the SAME gear a warrior can use, better than the warrior because there is mana and int/wis on every luclin and ldon armor.<br />
 and a warrior should use the ac and hp on the armor a lot better. But he's not. 100 hp on a warrior is 100hp on a paladin, maybe... 3 hp more with ND bonus ? same thing for AC. there is no &quot;warrior use armor better than a pally&quot; as Absor stated. That is why velious, ornate and elemental armors are balanced : more ac/hp on warrior bp, mana/wis/int on knight one but less ac.<br />
if we are supposed to use gear better than knight, it should be noticeable. currently, it is not.<br />
<br />
2 - AGGRO :<br />
Aggro for knight is wonderful, and it always had. I have no problem with this, I have a problem with warrior aggro generation. We must rely on short range ability that take time and luck to work. Time and luck. no luck and you will not proc for 16 hits in a row and not aggro. we also have no way to BUILD aggro fast. we use always the same tools as ever, but the increased dps of and the almost-always-required Slow other classes use now are a thread to our limited aggro generation, especially for those with no EB neither offensive AAs.<br />
No more bandaid. No more ability that work only 60% of the time. no more taunt/kick/disarm mash. Why many warriors are using a &quot;attack off, /beg, /attack on&quot; macro even without proof it works ? Do you imagine yourself as an overlord, tanking Rallos zek, then suddently stopping your asault and beg the god of war &quot;Can I have aggro plz ??&quot;. OUR aggro generation is lame.<br />
<br />
3 - ABILITIES :<br />
I have seen in 2 years of playing the erosion of warriors abilities... Criticals : everyone do those. Berserker frenzy is a joke, its just here to tell the cleric &quot;your heal is late&quot;. disciplines are limited by the defensive/evasive timer we must keep, and most of them are useless. Disarm is used as an attempt to aggro, it doesnt and never affected the ennemy attack. Taunt... our main ability is luck based. Even us cannot truly see if its succesful immediatly.<br />
Soo, where are our tanking related ability ? the only gimmick we have is /shield, and shield is too limited to be truely useful. It is not a lifesaver against real thread, generally its only useful in xp group te help the slower feeling secured (but he is not). If we really had an edge in tanking. We'll have something more. I remember when the main advantage of warriors was gear. When you saw a warrior in Velious you knew he had better gear and more hp/ac than a knight. today everything is different, even some bosses are easier to tank with a knight (all the bosses you cant stay in front of them, grieg for exemple).<br />
<br />
Today THERE IS NO WARRIOR EDGE ON ANYTHING. I will have more hp than a pally in my guild because the leaders will choose to give me the gear first when we'll raid target X, but the 2nd time we'll kill this X, when we'll equip the knights, I will know those knight are more useful than me except on stuff that require defensive. <br />
But I'll still play for my friends and guild, taking pleasure to loose aggro and kill fast-slowing chanters, tanking 26373 spiders in velketor at the same time with my earthshaker, and bitch at my guildmates who steal aggro from me because I need to tank every mob solo for 10 seconds to have a decent aggro over every other class.</div></div><hr />

It means you boost the low parts and cut down the high parts.  If one class is OVERPOWERED, then they need a fuckin nerf, period.  Bringing everyone else up to their level is not an acceptable solution when you're running a massive game like EQ is.<br />
<br />
What the fuck would have happened if everyone else in the game were brought up to the level that Necros with their insane dagger speed buffed pets were at 5 years ago?  The majority of the people playing EQ today weren't even around to see the fuckin chaos that caused.  One necro could solo things that entire groups couldn't do before Kunark.  That kind of shit needs a nerf.  And when one class is completely phased out of THE ROLE THEY ARE DESIGNED FOR by fuckin HYRBIDS of their class being overpowered, THEN THEY NEED TO NERF THE HYBRIDS.  Any other solution is unacceptable and bad for the game.<br />
<br />
And don't give me that bullshit about being a warrior and only looking out for my interests.  I've played goddamned near every class 50+, I look out for the interest of the GAME, not of my own characters.  It's time other people learned to do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jice Virago</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am an SK and I have played the game all the way from beta to time.  I agree there is an imbalance here, but you also have some misconceptions about knights in relation to warriors and in relation to each other:<br />
<br />
1) If a Warrior and a Knight have the exact same gear, the warrior is going to mitigate better due to skill caps.<br />
<br />
2) Warriors fall between SKs and Paladins in terms of DPS, assuming the mob is not undead and caster unfriendly AEs are not in effect.  My opinion is Warriors should have a boost to DPS so they are not less effective when tanking.<br />
<br />
3) At the high end of the game, mobs stun far to much for an SK or sometimes even a Paladin to have any chance of getting off a self healing spell.<br />
<br />
4) A Paladins stuns are practical to use in a raid situation, an SKs agro spells are junk except for DoTs, which cannot be safely used when mez concerns are evident.  Neither can be used in the face of mana depletion AEs like Terris, Saryn, and Quarm posess.<br />
<br />
5) Warrior to Knight balance starts to break down around level 50 or so, when a warrior starts becoming dependant on gear to hold agro.  It gets worse at 55 when defensive enters the picture.  The entire game is built around defensive tank + CH rotation after a certain point, and there is not much that can be done to fix it.<br />
<br />
6) Knights (especially SKs) were the single worst classes in the game all through Kunark, Velious, and Luclin.  Warriors were the best mele class in the game up until the end of Luclin, which is when the all/all itemization retardation reached fever pitch.  In POP, there are still mobs at every level of the game that flat out require a warrior (or several) to tank.  The gap seems larger than it is because the utility of knights marginilizes old content more directly than the raw superiority of a warrior.<br />
<br />
How to Fix things from a Knights perspective:<br />
<br />
1) Nerf stun taunt very slightly or make stuns break mez so Paladins have to be more selective in using them in a raid environment.  Reduce snare agro slightly across the board and make the higher level snares generate the most agro so that an SK doesnt simple have to chain Clinging Darkness to lock agro, but actually require some more variety.<br />
<br />
2) Either put the offhand bonus to damage back for dual weilders or put warriors on the monk damage tables so they are more stackable at raids.<br />
<br />
3) Increase taunt on kick and have it generate stun like agro wether it lands or not.<br />
<br />
4) Introduce an AA for warriors to let them taunt at range.<br />
<br />
5) Return Defensive to its original state (ie mele output of defensive warrior not reduced).<br />
<br />
6) Add Fearless to the warrior AA list as a POP Class AA.<br />
<br />
Nerfs to knights should be slight if at all.  The things that need to be adressed directly are the warriors ability to control their agro and their raid stackability.  Knights are certainly at the peak of power we have ever been, but we are no where near the top of the class chain.  Beastlords, Wizards, Enchanters, and especially Bards are all vastly more powerful than a Knight could ever hope to be, and all far more useful to a raid.  There is no mob in the game that cannot be killed without knights being present.  Raids do not happen without Warriors and Clerics., and in many POP raids you would be foolish to try them without bards.  And if you really want to get technical, a bard with the same level of gear could chain sing mez and tank as well as any knight and I don't see any screams of Bard nerfage here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors does not need a boost. It's Knights that need to be nerfed. <br />
<br />
It is very obvious that whoever designed LDoN made sure mob would just bypass whatever aggro abilities a warrior have. You don't get stuff like that on accident. It's obviously designed from the get go to punish warriors <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Totally remove their channeling ability; viola, no more being a tank AND a caster <br />
<br />
You guys have been hit in the head way to many times!!!<br />
<br />
And when one class is completely phased out of THE ROLE THEY ARE DESIGNED FOR by fuckin HYRBIDS of their class being overpowered, THEN THEY NEED TO NERF THE HYBRIDS <br />
<br />
If you played an sk like you claim you would know we are not overpowered, especially in the 50's.  Knights don't come into their own fully till 65.  The warriors I know must be damn good because they never have a problem on a raid with agro.  You can't have your cake and eat it to.  You guys want to tank raids the let the knights be good xp tanks.  If you don't want to be the top raid tanks then give me the job and I won't whine like a FUCKING SISSY ASS.<br />
<br />
It's okay for hybrids to be stong, just not that warriors aren't the strongest. deal with it, they are tanks and they can cast, who cares if they have instant aggro your problem is the tanking ability and dps ain't large enough. <br />
<br />
The problem is your agro and dps why not fix that instead of fucking up 2 other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Mitigation is almost exactly the same for Hybrid's / Warrior's. Stop beating the kunark myth. its a dead horse.<br />
<br />
2. I dont want to be a DPS class. I want to be THE master of defense.<br />
<br />
3.  Thats great IN TIME. However how does that fix Paladin's and Knights tanking END GAME GODS IN TIME?<br />
<br />
4. My 56 level SK can pull aggro off a 60 warrior with those useless aggro spells you claim arent worth shit.<br />
<br />
5. Im sorry reality check , Defensive got weeded out in the end game, So while this was a general good opinion, Defensive dosent mean shit after tier 4<br />
<br />
6. Knights where the single worse class till after Kunark. They came into their own in Velious, Bloomed during Luclin and took over as MA at PoP. So no. You had it bad for a expansion. Warriors have been on the decline since Velious.  Stop beating that pathetic piece of shit whine button. <br />
You had a bad expansion, Im sorry warriors have had 4 expansions as being the worst like knights in Kunark.<br />
<br />
Get over it. Stop beating the we sucked at Kunark drum. You have no right to anymore,  Get off the crutch, Get outta my spot in my XP group and delete now and reroll a warrior, Then lvl to 65 and see how hard it is compared to how hard &quot;Kunark&quot; Was. <br />
<br />
Fixing things<br />
<br />
1. I agree, Nerf Paladin stuns, Leave SK hate spells alone, thats what they were designed to do. add Hate for the SK.  SK's dont need anymore aggro generation, If they got off their ass and dusted off their spells they could lock aggro worse then Paladin's. SK's WERE DESIGNED that way. Paladins are using EXPLOIT's.<br />
To help fix the aggro lock. nerf knight mitigation to 75% of what a warrior's is. Yes that would put you on average with a monk . Deal with it.<br />
<br />
2. Dont increase warrior DPS. Were not a DPS class. The damage bonus is  a good idea for rogues and monks so put it in, It'd help us a bit but not that much. <br />
<br />
3. This is a decent idea, Furious Kick would be a nice idea, However we dont need stun aggro lock kick's, Sorry I dont claim to be a paladin bastard child. <br />
<br />
4. Area Taunt friend.. Area taunt.. <br />
<br />
5. Again Not a DPS class, and defensive isnt the end all be all knights make it out to be. Evasive is actully much better.<br />
<br />
6. Not a knight,  Dont want to be a knight, and I damn well dont want knight AA's<br />
<br />
We dont care about bard's or any other class, When and if bard's become prefered tanks over Warriors &gt; Hybrid's &gt; Bard's <br />
I'll be the first one to start screaming Nerf on them just like you will.  I dont want to be vastly overpowering. But Knight classes are. <br />
I want aggro to look like this Shadowknight &gt; Warrior &gt; Paladin <br />
SK's were designed to be a aggro generating class, Thats why you have spells that add hate, I dont want that taken away.<br />
<br />
I however want Mitigation to change, So that  Knights are more on a Cleric/Monk table.  I want taunt to work but not be insanely over powering. I cant honeslt see why SK's are happy that as masters of aggro they have paladins pimp slaping them on their turf. <br />
<br />
Hell I cant be happy about Hybrid off shot's pimp slapping me on my turf, Tanking \ Mitigation. Those are my specialties. No bastard class should be able to match me in it.  I dont want to match a SK in Aggro but I want to kick the shit outta a paladin on aggro generation.<br />
<br />
Thats m 2 copper and im sticking to it<br />
<br />
Your's in war<br />

<br />
I'm going to start small for the fucking idiots.<br />
<br />
Simple question:<br />
<br />
Should a Knight be able to tank this mob with zero problems? Should a Knight be able to tank all of the mobs in this phase and prior phases with no problems?<br />
<br />
http://fohguild.org/news/KT1SGX8.jpg<br />
<br />
The Knight in question is Xate, he also tanks CT and Innoruuk for FoH. He'll be tanking Saryrn and TT on our next Time run.<br />
<br />
Answer the question please shithead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me that when the Knights come over here shrilly insisting that a nerf should be out of the question, the call for nerfs by Warriors just increases.  I'm going to guess that is a knee jerk reaction to seeing someone obviously be more interested in protecting the status quo, which favors them, than in correcting the game so that everyone can enjoy it.<br />
<br />
This seems to be human nature, and that's too bad.<br />
<br />
I've gone over my reasons why I personally am against a Knight nerf on a number of occassions.  And obviously not everyone agrees with me.  In fact the numbers of people calling for a nerf seem to have increased.  I would hazard the guess that is as much a result of frustration to having no solution implemented as much as losing patience in the constant justifications for superiority coming from the Knights.<br />
<br />
If you're a Knight, I'm going to give you some advice, take or leave it, I don't really care.  Don't come here trying to explain to us as though we are two year old children how everything is right in the world right now and that we, the Warriors, are obviously inept, unintelligent, or just lying sons of a bitches who are out to screw others for our own gain.  For the most part it just isn't true and only makes the situation worse for no good purpose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a shadow knight - and I don't really agree that we need to be nerfed, but I do think that things need to change around.<br />
<br />
Warriors taunt is painful to bear in PoP experience groups. The best warriors know to say: &quot;I do better if I'm behind the mob and you're tanking.&quot;<br />
<br />
We use a low level fast casting spell of our choice (clinging darkness or fear) and aggro is ours. We do nothing for the rest of the pull, unless someone is heavily dotting - in which case, we have to *gasp* cast again around 40%. Paladins are much worse. Start at PoInnovations. Pally stuns mob, mitigates/avoids X damage. Now, go to PoTime... go to the new LDoN content... Pally stuns mob, mitigates/avoids how much? X times Y... and, yes, Y is a big ass factor.<br />
<br />
Now, they've nerfed us plenty in the past - even when noone was bitching about our aggro skills. Disease Cloud... Shadow Vortex... and what did they do in response? Give us *pure aggro spells*. Guess what: the fucking blow. Nobody ever uses them for any reason at all.<br />
<br />
Do warriors have pure aggro abilities that they can use over and over again at will to build up aggro? No. Why not? Probably because then both paladins and knights would be completely fucking useless. Solutions: have one useless class instead of two.<br />
<br />
Well, how about this. Fix the goddamn &quot;resisted spell = massive aggro.&quot; It's the other way around, geniuses. If I nuke a mob for 10k, that should be more aggro than if it fucking resists the nuke. This concept helps sknights build aggro easy where we're literally hoping for resists (fear always will resist. waa waa.)... that's just a small start... but please explain the sense behind how a lower level spell (Clinging Darkness) gets resisted a lot, seems to generate MORE aggro than its higher level version (Engulfing, Festering, Dooming Darkness).. derrr..<br />
<br />
Perhaps give warriors some ability (nothing that COSTS POINTS) that makes them taunt reasonably well. Who the fuck knows what's reasonably, as, as I said before, as soon as they can even taunt 50% as well as a knight - knights and sknights become completely useless in most situations.<br />
<br />
Yeah, shits all out of whack... and hey, sknights have been crapped on since day one and were pretty much one of the least desired classes through luclin, but now we're living it up. Sucks to be the other guy, right?<br />
<br />
I'm trying to understand what solution will &quot;help&quot; warriors while not making pallies and sknights useless again... reminds me of kunark through luclin.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad you know how to almost get aggro. Almost. I should have my Shadowknights and Paladins put on a clinic for people on how to utilize ALL their abilities. This is why we're going to CRUSH Time level raids real soon in LDoN. We are learning that the KEY is Hybrid Tanks that have a brain. Your pure aggro spell is useless huh? Hahahah.. This kind of shit really gives you perspective on your own guildmates, that much I'll tell you... I've seen my Knights do INSANE things with their 'useless pure aggro spells.' <br />
<br />
But yea, you're all about aggro as an SK huh? Take that away and you are nothing huh? Your auras don't mean shit do they? Neither do Feign, Taps, DoTs? Ever pulled as an SK? There are some raids that I ONLY use SKs to pull.<br />
<br />
Basically, just because you have ZERO clue how to play your class and utilize your myriad utilities doesn't mean you bring nothing to the table besides AGGRO - it just means you're clueless. You're like this big bear with sharp claws and you're telling me you don't know how to kill the wittle bunny wabbit. Oaf.</div></div><hr />

Wow, I was actually defending the idea that knights get nerfed. Wonder how you respond when someone says &quot;Happy Birthday, Son.&quot; Interesting way to spin... rhetoric is fun!<br />
<br />
Yes, I know the use of our pure aggro spells and how great they are with building up aggro on mezzed mobs, but, uh, last I checked our lower level always resisted fear or, if not going to be mezzed, our lowest level dot generate WAY FUCKING MORE AGGRO. In a &quot;standing there with some fuckwad warrior without aggro weapons&quot; experience group, yeah, those aggro spells are useless. In most situations up to and including some time events, the aggro spells are useless. Oooh, you found some trick for one of your pawns at two or three jerkaround events? Welcome to 1% of the fucking game, which seems to validate every change that is &quot;necessary&quot; in your &quot;i quit, no i don't, yes I do, no I don't&quot; viewpoint of the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
But yea, you're all about aggro as an SK huh? Take that away and you are nothing huh? Your auras don't mean shit do they? Neither do Feign, Taps, DoTs? Ever pulled as an SK? There are some raids that I ONLY use SKs to pull.[/B]<br />
<br />
<br />
I never stated that's all we were about, and I was for the most part referring to experience groups and every fucking encounter (most all of them) where that shit doesn't matter. Yeah, stick us in a group with casters or real damage class so that we can aura or ft10 them. Sorry, last I checked our melee and all our dots stacked chain nuking with harm touch adds up to like, uh, a handful of wizard crits. <br />
<br />
But hey, look on the bright side, there are some raids Furor only uses SKs to pull: be on standby.<br />

<br />
Jesus christ you sound like a fucking cornucopia of pure goodness just opened from the Virgin Mary's womb and shot out flaming Shadow Knights to save the universe while the warriors sit on the sidelines.<br />
<br />
I know the power, I wield the power. The power makes me pretty fucking happy. But if they nerf us, we wouldn't have the fucking sharp claws to kill the wittle wabbit anymore, now would we? <br />
<br />
I never said we bring nothing to the table, but I do believe it to be situational enough that if you suddenly removed SKnights from the game, even you would not be able to come up with a colorful proclamation as to how the fucking world is a sadder place.<br />
<br />
Funny, one of the things missing from this thread is exactly how knights should be nerfed: I had thought all along it was a fucking aggro issue, from, like, the 10,000 posts that say it is.</div></div><hr />

I have banked my Blade of carnage/Great Blade of storms combo of 1hs because my Great staff of Four winds out agros them.<br />
This doesnt need to be parsed or examined, simply put the people I play with on a regular basis pointed out I hold agro &quot;better&quot; when using the 2hander. the proc on that weapon is only 75 dd so it isnt a proc thing. Agro these days is all about DPS. Knights outdamage us AND have agro generating spells they can cast ( Healing / stun etc ). The simplest fix IMHO is to increase the warrior DPS to the TOP of the list.  All the other melee classes have something to balance this, be it backstabbing damage, Feign death, spell casting ability or the damage of using a bow.<br />
Simply put, Warriors IMHO should be the best at using the weapons they have trained in, and make the damage they do with these said weapons the way they hold agro. <br />
The other fix is to stop making the Plate/all and the weapon /all equipment. More Warrior only and class only stuff.<br />
No more Paladins running around with Blade of Carnages please.<br />

Give us *pure aggro spells*. Guess what: the fucking blow. Nobody ever uses them for any reason at all. Speak for yourself please, they worked perfectly well for me.  You just have to treat it like a BoC and actually use it more than once or twice in a fight and expect it to hold agro for you.  They aren't shit by themselves.  They're just shit compared to Fear and Clinging Darkness if the only purpose you can find for being a SK is to lock agro.<br />
<br />
Here's something to think about.  You call those pure agro spells shit.  Well almost the exact same thing is on the warrior agro weapons (slightly more agro tho, about 100).  Except they have to wait on random procs while SKs can use it on demand.  So it's shit for you, but absolutely fine for warriors to have it as a random proc?  You could probably take away /disc defensive and give warriors that same agro ability in those pure agro spells on demand with a 1-2 minute reuse and they'd be perfectly happy with that setup.  Ecstatic even, for probably more reasons than one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shinja Mayoke</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some fairly simple ways to fix warriors which would not require the nerfing of 2 classes who have had it pretty rough up until very late...<br />
<br />
Give warriors the block skill for starters.  Then, during defensive DISC, do not reduce their melee damage done.<br />
<br />
Post 60 give them fighting stances, which allow them to choose whether to increase melee damage and take slightly more per hit similar to aggressive, or to take slighty less damage and inflict slightly less, similar to defensive now, but not as extreme.<br />
<br />
This would allow for the extra warriors along on raids or groups to choose a dps or tanking role and stick to it or switch as needed.  Viola, utility.<br />
<br />
Snap aggro: I dont think its a bad idea for warriors to have some form of snap aggro, much akin to stuns from paladins, but it does need some sort of timer associated with it.  Sorta like aoe taunt on a smaller scale and you get it earlier.<br />
<br />
At this stage in the game anyone calling for nerfs on knights really should be forced to play one as they were for the first 3 years of EQ.<br />
<br />
Who is this Furor person anyhow, we all know the real one quit just like he said he would.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the silliest arguments I've seen in these threads is the Paladin &quot;We've always been able to generate snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
Well you haven't always been able to actually tank though.<br />
<br />
There are two important thing in tanking - to be able to survive the mob beating on you and to make the mob focus his attacks on you so you can protect the other members of your party (whoa, just like the Warrior Class Description!!).<br />
<br />
Only one class is supposed to be unmatched in these abilities and y'all are matching that class in one and totally and in every way exceeding it in the other.<br />
<br />
If anyone at all can tell me why a class should fulfill the Warrior Class Description better than Warrors should I'd be deeply beholden.<br />
<br />
Oh thanks for whispering the answer Oedipus! &quot; 'cause that class description says Main Tank all over it and Knights should get to MT too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, so you should be Warriors with spells? Sounds like a pretty scweeeet deal to me.<br />
<br />
Now I'll admit that SoE may not have made the utilty offtank role clearly needed in groups, but that does not justify your dominating the MT slot.<br />
<br />
Should you get to MT too? I think so, but first I think Warriors need to be made competative in the only group role they have.<br />
<br />
Are Knights to blame? Nope, SoE is. Therefor I don't support capping Knights at 5k HP's 1000AC, or even making them rely on weapon procs and the Taunt button for aggo.<br />
<br />
A much better solution is to make Warriors equally as good at making himself the focus of the mob's attack.<br />
<br />
What's that Oedipus? &quot;Then Warriors will be the prefered MT and it'll be Kunnark all over again!&quot;<br />
<br />
First, I think that's a gross exageration. Secondly you are admitting that 3 or 4 spells provide superior aggro control to weapon procs and the Taunt button which you yourselves can use for aggro control. If those methods are deficient for you, aren't they deficient for Warriors?<br />
<br />
&quot;Raids will be trivial.&quot; Seriously, you're grasping at straws. When you use these tools it doesn't trivialize the game, but when we do it does? &quot;Well you have better survivability.&quot; So, if surviving the fight isn't an issue these tools trivialize the game?<br />
<br />
The best shot Knights have at retaining their golden age is if SoE does not do a good faith examination of the impact of snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro. There's a good chance that's exactly what will happen, but please don't try to justify the disparity here. We all know it's BS.<br />

*shrug* Fine, take away agro from stuns.  I've said it a ton of times: as long as Knights have more skills to activate than Warriors, Knights will control monsters better.

Ok, first off, Chova ... I don't think you've even posted 3 times on the SKnight boards. I though you werea paladin in dyed black armor, m'self... you are a grade-B &quot;fell off the conveyor belt&quot; malfunctioning unit. Your argument is complete shit, and destroys any hope for extracting useful info from people, as they're all safety-guarding the electric sockets...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this strange idea that SKs always had better agro generation? Each class generates hate differently. The casting profiles of each class is different (reset times, consumption of mana, etc.). The end result is the same: when asked to tank it is done.<br />
<br />
It was later on they had the hate enhancing buff. A SK would have to say for sure but do they really need to agro buf themselves for exp groups?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck you, too. SKs have had easily the best aggro for a long, long time, aside from the brief periods of time when they altered how spells worked and nullified it. Clinging Darkness (the cornerstone aggro spell) is a fucking low level spell. It's essentially what we use nowadays to maintain the aggro. It wasn't until disease cloud got counter nerfed because shamans were getting face-fucked hard, and then shadow vortex lost all of its power (And stackability) that we were in the dark as to what to do for aggro (before anyone thought that casting a retarded low level spell might be the answer)... and they gave us the hate spells. Complete shit hate spells.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fear uh, &quot;benefit&quot;, y'know, the one where we're able to cast a GUARANTEED RESIST spell on mobs. And we all know how getting a 5k nuke resisted is somehow more aggro than landing a 5k nuke. Fix this shit. Paladins... their shit is way, way, nicer, however. They stun the mob, avoiding damage, etc. Hooray, winner.<br />
<br />
I know the jackholeishness of saying our pure hate nonmez breaking spells suck in a warrior forum. What the fuck do warriors do on a mezzed mob? Sorry, yeah, I'm what barely elemental and the warriors I tend to group with stand there for a few seconds (i guess hitting taunt) and then chase the mob off to wherever the chanter is sitting. This sucks. Fix this shit. Does that mean getting rid of the spammable aggro spells and fixing our low level aggro-sploits? yeah, fine! Does that mean we're where we were uh, during the early luclin era, ie, undesirable for EXP groups. Yes.<br />
<br />
But wait... Oh noz! What *will* happen to all the poor pallies and sknights in EXP situations when warriors suddenly taunt well enough that the crowd control doesn't look for pallies and sknights to tank?!?!?! What a tricky situation. Fix one class and break two, or keep one gimped while maintaining two. The answer is: they'll be the utility melee classes. One providing offensive perks to the raid, and the other defensive. How fucking horrible. boo hoo. <br />
<br />
The problem with this, is that these sweeping changes will require the fucking up of 3 classes experience, ldon group abilities. <br />
<br />
warriors will still not be able to find ldon groups because the perks given by pallies (undead, heals, self shit, stun miti) and sknights (attack, mana) will still be there?? OK, if you could choose, would you choose: FT10 &amp; big attack buff for the group, or, not dying because dickhead SK can't get aggro? Hmmm lets see. Hard choice. <br />
<br />
And how is this nerf going to work, exactly? What is the compromise, again? Not let us taunt, cast around 20 of our spells, or beg? Cause that's what it'd take to nullify our taunt abilities. Gee. 20 spells that generate fat taunt. Wonder if they think we're supposed to taunt.<br />
<br />
Still waiting to hear the &quot;balancing act&quot; that will render all three in a nice happy family. All these shadowknights and pallys acting like assholes here are obviously doing it because of the years of yore when they'd be passed up for hours when LFG, and warriors were the prize.<br />
<br />
To address some of the concepts in this thread, I want to know: <br />
<br />
how does removing the powerful aggro of the knights (which, again, has really nothing even to do with the goddamn aggro spells, what irony) change the fact that warrior aggro is embarrassing? It doesn't.<br />
<br />
So yeah, go off on tangents about what &quot;the issue is&quot; and cite the highest of high level encounters excluding warriors and how knights easily sustain 200ish DPS while jacking up other melees in the group with added ATK and/or feeding casters in the group ft10 per SKnight makes them the bestest class ever, even without the aggro... but there'r still a ton of posts here that, essentially,  come down to&quot; i can't tank a mob because heal aggro will kill my healers, slow aggro kill the slowers, etc. Pray for rolls, etc.&quot; ... that solution has really nothing to do with &quot;changing knights&quot;... its just that as long as the knight is able to tank the fucking mobs with all that other good stuff who needs the warriors?<br />
<br />
Sure, they'll nerf us to make warriors look less broken. But it's going to have to be one fucking whopper of a nerf to even out the field in the aggro realm. The answer lies in a careful tweaking of warrior abilities to gain aggro &amp; added benefits for warrior tanking, and who knows, maybe a gross WAR ONLY itemization increase.  Evening out the desirability of sks pals and wars, and allowing wars to reclaim the raid-monger position in ldon, simply doesn't require changing a fucking thing with sks or pals.</div></div><hr />

 To turn your question around, NOT nerfing Knights makes Warriors more valuable because?<br />
<br />
 And yes, aggro lock is trivializing content. I hear a constant refrain from Paladins that giving Warriors aggro lock will be unbalancing. I also hear from them that without that aggro lock, Paladins will be unwanted in groups - EVEN though Warriors can and do get groups without that lock. Are you seriously trying to infer that Paladins, without that ONE element of the game, are as unbalanced as they were in Kunark? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
 Please. They've upgraded your class miles from the days of Sarnaks. Grow some legs and stand on them as a class, or be sad forever when at some point SOE refuses to hold your collective hands any longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to take a moment to point out to all the shadowknights that we still have our unholy harm touch.<br />
<br />
and for you paladins don't forget you still have brells<br />
<br />
Hug these abilities and hold on to them tightly, we had our moment in the sun when we complained long enough SOE made us decent when we find ourselves back at the bottom, remember these glory days as you get &quot;Brells plz&quot; and OMG I GOT KILLSHOT WITH HUGE HARM TOUCH.<br />
<br />
As for some of you &quot;higher&quot; tier warriors, I would really think those of you who have been playing since the Original times that you would be a little bit less tunnel vision about your class and moreso about the entire picture, but in your hearts many of you are powergamers, and thus need to be the best and defensive just isn't enough. So I appreciate how much you consider affecting the play of everyone else as long as you can help yourselves.<br />
<br />
All I got, i'm tired may not make sense but I don't care, farewell.<br />
<br />
P.S. oh yeah I forgot, Warriors need a better means of gaining aggro in my opinion.<br />

Anyways i dont want knights nerfed. They actually contribute on raids now, as opposed to what they did in the Kunark, SoV and low end SoL era. Our Knights make a great addition to our team, and frankly we need them the way they are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not in favor of nerfing anyone. I am in favor of providing Warriors with snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro. I believe at that point it is possible for groups to decide on which fully able tank class to add to their group based on best fit.<br />
<br />
Frankly I'd like to see all 3 classes be equally concidered as MT's and groups to want them as offtanks as well. For this to happen, I believe Warriors and Shadow Knights will need a little work.<br />
<br />
Frankly, for SK's I'd like to see HT returned to it's previous glory, Spears as damaging as Druid nukes, and an upgraded pet at 65.<br />
<br />
But I will tell you there are plenty of Warriors that are painfully aware of their currently unacceptable aggro abilities. When two out of the three tanking classes don't have this problem and one works like crazy and still has the RNG deny him it isn't freaking right.<br />
<br />
This is a game and it's suposed to be fun. Nerfs aren't fun and neither is playing a class with a glaring weakness in its core abilities.<br />

FD pulling certainly isn't useful, neither are your taps, especially not the one that gives mana to your entire group.  And forget snare, we just let mobs run, especially in LDoN cause it's so much easier and safer that way.  As for pallys, who uses group heals?  I mean seriously, when raid mobs ae, it's so better to use druids or shammys for their single target heals.  The cleric skill arbitration doesn't just scream great for working with pallys.  Stunning mobs to stop spells like CH or gate has no point.  Rooting adds, pff, who would want to do that.  Fast single target heals are useless too of course.  Yep, you'd both be down to just HT and brells :rolleyes: <br />

/sarcasm off<br />

Seriously, people like you make me think that you don't know a damn thing about playing your class.  Knights have great utility, and are very useful, even when not tanks.  If you really think it's useless, don't bother posting again, all it does is makes us laugh at how sad it is.</div></div><hr />

I thought most of the initial SK aggro came from the counters on your darkness line (which many SK's I group with use to PULL or use on the INC of my own pull), backed up with a debuff or two or some other curse/counter spell?<br />

I believe that's the point, and it seems to have shot right over your head.  There should be a penalty to drawing aggro, and right now there is no such penalty in place, allowing the situation we have right now.<br />

Give us 30khp and 5000 ac...people still won't use us to tank because we can't get and hold aggro.  Fuckin read the thread before you spew this nonsense out, you're not coming up with anything revolutionary that we haven't thought of here.<br />

You can get aggro you dipshit, we use a Warrior for every freakin boss mob in time, aggro is not a issue with those fights at all.Maybe Warriors have a problem getting instant aggro using them as a TM, so you want to be a TM?<br />

You MT with your Taunt button, weapon, and a bow for a month and your comments might carry a little more weight.<br />

I can see where you're coming from though. If I could buy my aggro from vendors instead or working like a maniac to establish and hold it, I'd concider it pretty trivial too.<br />
<br />
I'm saying if 2 out of 3 tank classes have snap aggro on demand, ranged aggro, and survivability then the class having only survivability operates under a severe handicap especially if they have no compensating skills.<br />

Some of you have no idea of what you're asking for, especially Furor. Obviously a lot of have choosen to forget or have neglected any education in history. Do you think the citizens of 1930's Germany knew what they were asking for when they elected Hitler as their leader?<br />
A lot of you are demanding equality! They way you are demanding it is strangely reminiscent of headlines I read in newspapers today - let's bring all the classes down to our level! It's not fair that this person has a better job than I do - I DEMAND to have the same things that person has, even though I didn't work for them!<br />
Wasn't Communism built on this idea? Make everybody equal. That worked out well, didn't it? What did the people want to do under this system? Leave! They left in droves to be in a system that allowed them to work to take advantage and reward their abilities.<br />
Now, you're demanding to make the classes equal by bringing down everybody to your level. I'm sure once you've had the Knights brought down, you'll start yelling that Bards are just too powerful and need to be brought down to a level equal with Warriors! Then necros. Then Druids. Soon the game will be nothing but a boring wasteland.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the devs understand that the dynamic in EQ has it's parallels in the real world and what would happen if they listened to incredulous rants.<br />

To be quite honest I expect to get a BoW in the not too distant future. Although this issue will largely be an unpleasant memory, it is an issue now.<br />
<br />
It gets to be painful to shoot an arrow at an incoming mob, attack, taunt it after you've hit it a couple of times, then have to jump over the mass of the raid while using mouse look to figure out where the heck the mob has gone. I take each death when I MT as confirmation that compared to even my 52 Paladin I suck. It's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Yes, we (me especially) should give it a rest - SoE will do (or more likely not do) anything it chooses.<br />
<br />
I'm guilded with some great Paladins and Shadow Knights - the last thing I would want to happen is SoE to nerf their classes. When I compare Warriors and Knights I'm trying to show that at level 65 to have difficulty performing your basic function is wrong.<br />

Terror line doesn't seem to give aggro at a distance, which is why allot of sks ellect to use fear (another low level spell that gets resisted by high level mobs).<br />
<br />

And about that thing where someone thought that you have a trade off between 'utility' and dps... take a look at the pure casters.<br />
<br />
And what exactly does 'utility' mean anyway? For Paladins its pretty clear, it means healing/curing (so why not just say that).<br />
<br />
For sks its... well it's dps from spells (just like our necromancer parent class). So we're supposed to trade off dps for... uh... dps ???<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
If you want to nerf sks as tanks, then we'll need another role. Perhaps becomming more like a beastlord (i.e. stronger pet, better selection fof necromancer line/type spells).<br />

Some people seem to want us to be warriors with less mitigation/hps and less dps... compensated for by spells allot of which can be obtained from gear (see invis, EB, levitation etc).</div></div><hr />

I have more of an understanding of this game and its mechanics than you could ever hope to accumulate in your next four miserable lifetimes. I'm one of the few, FEW, players to actually show the developers how their own game mechanics work time and time again - and I'm telling you now, you Nazi spewing neanderthal, to shut the fuck up. The only thing you've managed to do is compare me, yet again, to Hitler, not once, but 5 times in a thread. Get the fuck out of this forum and grow some balls, or at the very least, some form of understanding of what you're talking about in regards to Knights versus Warriors balance.<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadowknights have grown far too big for their britches and it's time for Paul Bunyen to pull out his big ass axe and cut you fuckers down to the saplings you deserve to become. How dare you think you should be able to tank within even the same ballpark as me. I AM your fucking Daddy when it comes to tanking, and as your daddy I'm telling you, you and the rest of the Knights need a good, long, spanking with the nerf bat. The stupidity of people like AbSORE and other derelicts in the SOE lineup should land them a job working at McDonalds in the near future. Other people from other companies DO watch the happenings of Everquest - to learn from the mistakes being made, over and over and over again by the same crowd of plucky developers. It's a good thing, (1) it guarantees they'll never find a job past janitor in a real MMORG company when they are fired from SOE and (2) Guarantees we'll never see such a mudflated, class blurring annhilation that we've seen in comparing Knights in Everquest to their DADDY the Warrior.<br />
