Hmmm... I think I can manage a tidbit drop or two about what's up for Warriors in the next patch... ;) <br />
<br />
Heroic Strike's damage is increasing. <br />
<br />
The Execute bug -- when all rage is consumed upon a miss/dodge/parry/etc. -- is being fixed. <br />
<br />
Thunder Clap's damage will be Physical rather than Nature-based. The damage itself is increasing, and the duration will increase with each new rank. <br />
<br />
That's not everything... but does that help? ;)<br />
late addition (middle of the page):<br />

Overpower should indeed be usable when a special attack is dodged after the next patch. :) <br />

Can't begin to balance the talent routes till you have the foundations working correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sure hope that they fix the hs miss rate and of course add rage on dodge/block/parry too.</div></div><hr />

I mash it quite a bit when I'm doing AE taunting. It's useful like that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroic Strike change could be interesting - depends how big a change it is though, if the new one is less than 160 it's pretty much meaningless. <br />
<br />
Overpower is not going to have much of an impact for arms spec unless you are pvp'ing rogues,  on a 6 second timer, with mobs dodging maybe 2% of all attacks at best, the increased damage from overpowers off mortal strikes is going to be vanishingly small.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps bliz could show shield disc some love. Maybe double its durration. That would give it a better agro/rage cost ratio.</div></div><hr />
