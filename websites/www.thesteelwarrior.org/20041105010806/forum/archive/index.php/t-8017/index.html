<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naragak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Retired for 7 months or so and am back now.  All my Dropable stuff got sold LoL so am rebuilding.  Take a look at my Planned upgrade and give any suggestions on what I already have planned.  Not gonna worry about haste 'cause I will buy GoD soon so can handle that.   Am mainly looking to get Fierce in most slots but am unsure about some slots.  There is so much new stuff in game :).  I am mainly working on intermediate gear, any advise is much appreciated.<br />

A lot depends on how much plat you have right now. I think you could use a serious AC boost and the cultural is the fastest way to get there if you can buy it. <br />
If you can't buy it yet, hmmm. Your AC is so low that if you think you have a group of folks who would grind LDoNs with you for three evenings out of charity, you could get the MM 150 stuff in several slots. Obviously the 150-point armor is not exactly phat lewt, but it would boost your AC a good deal in some slots (Chest!). If you did that fast you'd be in a much better position to hunt in places that would get you better stuff.</div></div><hr />
