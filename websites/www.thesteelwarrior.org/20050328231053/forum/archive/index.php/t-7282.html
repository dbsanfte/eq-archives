<br />
That said watch the emotes he does so you can avoid needlessly wasting mana or people on him.  Don't melee when he's AE rampaging, don't cast spells when he's spell immune, etc.  Sometimes you get like AE rampage + spell immune at the same time and you simply have to just accept you're not going to do anything to him until at least one of the effects wear off.<br />
<br />
He tells you what the total # people you can bring is if you go over it.  Pets count toward this limit too.</div></div><hr />

from the script or the HP of BB?<br />
<br />
I have noticed when he has 90%hp, a emot income and the flu becomes more and more crazy. However, till 76%, no more emote shown :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way you can tell an effect is off is when he stops doing certain things.  For example if spells land on him then obviously the spell immune effect has worn off.  It's also easy to verify when his stoneskin (AC) effect has worn off.  The triggers are based on his health I've never seen 3 effects on him at the same time so you can use that to gauge how long each effect lasts.  The Flurry and AE rampage one are a bit harder to verfy.  It's better to be safe than sorry when you get AE rampage especially if you're at VT level gear unless he's about to die because he can kill your melees in no time flat when he's AE rampaging (actually it's probably only 6-8 guys but given the limitation on raid size it might as well be AE).</div></div><hr />
