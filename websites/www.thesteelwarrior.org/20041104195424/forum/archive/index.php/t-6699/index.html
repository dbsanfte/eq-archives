<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vexixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1st time posting here, you guys seem like  your pretty good with items and quests and stuff. I just started playing my war again after 2 yr break. Im re-gearing him up, just got him some new gear from alot of questing in the past week. I saw someone posted this Loyalist Shield of Honor to get(AC:50 STR+15 WIS+15 HP+75 SLOT: Back Secondary) Now to me that seems like a really good item for my warrior atm  =). I looked around for quest info, but just keep getting newbie information about the zone and mobs(ppl around level 42 or so). I was wondering if anyone has done it, and if so, what kind of group does it take. How much help would I need? How long is the quest and finally is it hard =). Thanks if you guys can help me out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;How long is the quest and finally is it hard&quot;<br />
<br />
The quest is long. As with all Luclin quests, it's a timesink. I wouldn't call it HARD per se, but the length of time it takes to get some of these mobs you need, can make it hard.<br />
<br />
The final mob, the named vampyre in the castle, is one annoyingly rare spawn. Also you need vamp bane to hit him (though vamp bane is pretty easy to get. There's a stake for rogues and warriors. A 2hander for paladins. And 1hbs that are stupid easy to get for everyone else). Casters can burn him down pretty toasty. The hardest part is getting him to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Microxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is the guide I am using http://www.rpgexpert.com/466.html<br />
<br />
The last ash drop is droppable, and can be found in the bazaar some times. But there is 2 ashes with the same name that are lore, and are different if you cast identify on them. One is worthless, so be carefull. Like I read on an Alla's post...try to buy the wrong one cheap and keep it in your bank. That way if you see one for 20k+, you won't be able to buy it because it is lore. (the wrong one that is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The quest is pretty easy overall.  Most of it I duoed with a ranger.  Some of it I could even have solo'd.  A decent group should have no issues with it.  A few notes: I personally meleed the chest in katta to move it out of the room.  In fact I moved it all the way to the long path near the building.  That way I avoided the guards that supposably aggro when you do the turn in.  As for the final vamp.  I had a guildie druid that checked it every now and then, eventually he found it up.  Not sure how long it takes.  I hadn't even started the quest until he told me it was up =p.  Definately if you are going to buy it in the bazaar, get the other lore ones first.  Getting screwed on that could hurt, and the cheap ones are easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quetazl Coatl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did it as an Iksar with dubious faction (while in human illusion form). I camped a bard outside the castle to check track (while see invis song was  playing) to keep an eye on the vampire. You can single group him, so long as you have someone with a bane to keep aggor and enough healers. We jumped the gun before the guy I gave the bane weapons to (was holding them on my bard, as the merchants wouldn't  sell to my Iksar) made it to the castle so he proceeded to kill 2 of us. <br />
<br />
As for the chest, we spawned and fought it in the room. It dies fast, and we didnt have any aggro issues. The fight with the shades in the other building was tricky as I had some KoS people helping me, so it was time for a 10dose human potion pass-a-thon.  So of those NPCs in that shade building see invis, so let you KoS people know.<br />
<br />
As for handing in the note to the guard outside katta. Just wait for the right guard to spawn (they respawn every 15 minutes, we had to wait 30 minutes before he showed up), then run to GF zone in to catch the VahShir vampire, unless you want to wait for him to walk across the zone.<br />
<br />
Good luck, its a fun quest for a good item. I wouldn't put any faith in the rumors of killing the named cycle to get the vampires to spawn, as it didn't seem to work for us and a few others I know of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I killed Valdanov twice in one afternoon.  I just kept killing tower over and over.  Valdanov popped after each fourth cycle with the lesser named.  I haven't done it enough to say its always after the fourth, but it happened twice for me.<br />
<br />
He was cake with a 65 War, 65 Shaman, 65 Druid and 65 Enc.  Fought him on the hill behind the castle.  Run up the hill so you can see him.  Levi over, agro and he comes off after you.  Bane and dot him down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The shield/cloak is a very nice item and well worth the effort you have to put into it.  It's really not that hard, although you will need to bring some friends as the zones you'll need help killing stuff in are pretty much unpopulated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so long as you have someone with a bane to keep aggor <br />
<br />
I kept aggro on him fine using non bane weapons.  In fact, it was this guy who proved for me months and months ago that it's potential damage not actually damage that causes aggro.  Originally tanked him with just an unauged GSot4W fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt;bangs head on computer desk&gt;<br />
<br />
The one time I didn't check the message boards.<br />
<br />
But there is 2 ashes with the same name that are lore, and are different if you cast identify on them.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity does anyone recall what it says if you have the right or wrong ashes after casting identify?<br />
<br />
Not looking forward to checking to see if I've been scamorized by the clan of the waistdown fist.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can also just kite Valdanov around with a druid.  No tanking necessary</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He doesn't have massive regen or summon? Cause if he's kiteable then everything just got a whole lot easier for me :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Valdanov has a lot of hitpoints and regens fairly well, but you can kite him around with a druid or bard and still take him down.  He does not summon.  The problem is, he gates, and when he does, he gates back to full health.  It's best and easiest just to take a group to him and engage him where he pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Crathsor, <br />
<br />
You can have a friendly mage cast identify on the ashes now. If they're the wrong ones, you'll see that you have Heratius Grolden's ashes. This would be good to know before you turn in all the other stuff and lose it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mady</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16"></div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well I was scamorized by the gnomes.  Bought the wrong one.  Bright side is at least with this in hand if another goes up for sale I won't be able to buy it.  Due to it being Lore an all.  Wish I had more time on my hands so I can do the camp.  Hate having to depend on the bazaar for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As somebody who is also working on this quest, my heart goes out to ya, Crathsor.<br />
<br />
Last night I got a group together to go camp Heratius Grolden. When we got to Tenebrous there was a 65 necro already set up in the castle who was farming coterie drops to sell in the bazaar. He said he farms the castle 3 nights a week for ~4 hours at a time and claimed that he had never heard of or seen Heratius Grolden. <br />
<br />
Bleah. That ac30 back-equippable shield from Velketor's is looking better and better ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Balkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">this is the only quest ive done after level 45, and its fun! Ive done it 3.8 times for friends. And dosnt take much of a big guild to do.<br />
<br />
!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bjarki_bearskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This is an easy quest if you are level 65.  A group (or less) can do every mob.  I ended up duoing Kerzaw Clawtore.  I soloed the mob in the chest and the Autarkic Lord fight. The difficulty, obviously, is the rareness of Zevfeer.<br />
<br />
I was talking about it once in group and how hard the last mob was to find up, and a guildie said, &quot;I have the ashes&quot;.  So, I dodged that thanks to the generosity of a very good person.<br />
<br />
I will say the Autarkic Lord Sfarosh fight was hard.  I was not completely buffed.  I was at 8K hps, had my ornate gaunts' haste, and used Truncheon of Doom to slow him.  Even so, I went down to 7% health.  I used every discipline I could think of, even Healing Will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hey, Bjarki,<br />
<br />
Grats on the shield!<br />
<br />
BUT -- since you never sat through the Heratius camp and never had to fight Valdanov, I'd say you have no idea if the quest is easy or not. It was easy for you, Amigo. (And YES, I'm jealous!!!!)<br />
<br />
/whine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bjarki_bearskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Lol, well my guildie said they did it with one group.  I took him at his word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jamylah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I got my shield last weekend and I love it. I thought the quest was lots of fun and actually got my fiance to ask if there were other quests we could do to get me upgrades. I got lucky because I managed to get the ashes for 8k from a paladin who had been soloing there. Needless to say, the fights weren't that difficult (although I didn't have to do Valdanov so I can't say on that one) My fiance (65 shaman), his boxed enchanter (also 65), and I were able to take out Kerzar with no problem. Another friend (60 ranger) came along for the fights after that. We did it with no problems, including the Autarkic Lord and his minions.  The story line is fun, the upgrade is sweet, and I couldn't be happier that I did the quest!<br />
<br />
EDIT: On all the fights it was huge overkill, was just more fun having my friends along especially when they started debating how screwed up their classes were vs. other classes. It was very funny needless to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Very true, Jamylah -- the story line for that quest is well done. Actually gives you a reason to go do the stuff you're doing.<br />
<br />
Bjarki, thanks for taking my comment in a good-humored spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I actually went LD right when Autarkic Lord Sfarosh popped and my mage friend that was with me easily took down all 4 shades in about 60 seconds while I was relogging. Got back in and 4 corpses nicely piled ready for me to loot :D I was able to solo every other part. As for the chest, just kill the guard in the room before you spawn the shade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Myself and another warrior in my guild have been camping that bastige Heratius for almost the whole week during the day.  Granted we pass out at some point and have to go to sleep and might have missed him.  Is there ANY viable information on when/how this guy pops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have a lvl 35 druid bound on the hill behind the castle where I can see what's up on the balcony. Necro's are usually camping the castle and inevitably spawn Grolden. They can easily kill Grolden for his drops, but they can't solo Valdanov. In the past month I've watched Valdanov despawn three times because there weren't any guildies/friends on who could help me. I now just check to see if a necro is camping the castle and ask them if they mind sending me a tell if Grolden spawns. They usually agree to /tell me if he pops. I'm still waiting...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Everything in this quest is soloable.  and apart from 1 thing, all of it is soloable by a warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
Valdnov is a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
His regen is NIL, BUT his aggro range is very very short, and the instant you go out of it, he regen at a crazy rate, I had him at under 10%, went just past his range and he leaped to 80%.<br />
<br />
Runing about oh, 30 minutes of time, that I had to repeat.<br />
<br />
Best way to do it, is to leave a charachter in the center of where you kite him, who has aggro, that will allow you to go past it without him regening up to full.<br />
<br />
He isn't a hugely rare spawn to be honest, he spawns about 3 times a day on average.<br />
<br />
I had to repeat this quest 3 times before I finally got the shield, not because of the ashes, but because of messing up a turn in, and having to redo parts leading up to it.  <br />
<br />
Watch very carefulyl when doing the quest, which you should do anyways, since its an amazing quest, very fun, and worth the time.<br />
<br />
Clawtore - Very annoying if you can't track, but sit in front of castle, adn you will see him eventually, most of the time.</div></div><hr />

Ya it's 250 trivial but u don't care cause u don't lose the quest components<br />
on a fail, just the flask of water and the large clay brick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Actually trivial at 306, but with a pottery skill of 60 it only took me about 40 combines to get a successful one :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">One reason you might have trouble seeing the named vampyre is because he is invis. I wasted a decent amount of time on my 51 druid before realizing that without seeinvis, I couldnt see him on the balcony or on track.<br />
<br />
Also, the easiest way to tell the difference between the 2 sets of ashes is this: The fake ashes are not stackable. The real ones, though still lore, have a little &quot;1&quot; in the bottom right corner, as if they were stackable. I ended up halting my camping efforts after a total of 25-30 clearings of the tower over several weeks. The next day, just out of boredom, I sat in PoK /oocing that i wanted to buy the ashes. Not 5 minutes later, cong me on buying both the fake and the real from someone for 10k =D<br />
<br />
Good luck on your camp, although I've gotta say, it's probably quicker to farm plat and stand in the bazaar waiting for someone else to sell them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I wasted a decent amount of time on my 51 druid before realizing that without seeinvis, I couldnt see him on the balcony or on track.<br />
<br />
Even if the mob is invis it WILL show up on track. I can verify this with a 62 druid I bot occasionally. Guano harvester in solb is invis, my warrior ran right by him several times, but my druid was able to track right to him. Same with all of the coterie in the castle. They all showed on track, even though the building appeared empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hmm I might be mistaken, it's been a while since i've played my tracker. I do know the only time i saw him on track with my druid was when he had acumen on though hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only time he'll show (I'm assuming you mean Val) is when Heratius pops and someone takes him out, otherwise H will just show on track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I would dearly love to see Heratius on track. <br />
<br />
I'm more and more convinced that all of you got together and made him up, just to make my life miserable.<br />
<br />
Though I do have some of his ashes I bought for 50pp in the bazaar, and man am I glad I did. There are several folks in the Stromm Bazaar who are providing lots of opportunities for fools and their money to part company. One guy is selling Heratius ashes for 30kpp. Imagine if you bought those thinking that they were The Ashes? *shudder*<br />
<br />
My 50pp ashes have saved me from my impatience on a nearly daily basis for about 6 weeks now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">If you put 30k in the trade window and they try to sell you fake ashes, when you hit Trade does it cancel the trade and you get your money back?<br />
<br />
Does the same thing happen with vendors? If you try to buy a lore item you don't lose your money?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">What happens, Payn, is you get the message that the item you want to buy is Lore and that you already have one in inventory.<br />

I read over the quest and saw the 255 trivial, so decided to work on Pottery.  Kill some time.  Made the figurine on 1st attempt.  Have a pottery skill of 0.  Still have a skill of 0.</div></div><hr />

And the answer is...(A).  A few weeks back I made the figurine with a skill of 165 in pottery and it took me 8 tries.</div></div><hr />
