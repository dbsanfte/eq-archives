<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Based on all the data, anecdotal evidence and ranting I have read, I only see one way to truly fix the difference between pure classes and hybrids.<br />
<br />
Give that spells will always be given to hybrids and that will continue to improve them and that pure classes don't get anything and that itemization looks like it will continue to be broken, I offer the following solution:<br />
<br />
Next uber expansion:<br />
<br />
Pure classes now can proceed from level 65 to 75.<br />
Hybrids now can proceed from level 65 to 70 <br />
<br />
Create good bonuses in hps and some AAs that only exist for level 71 to 75.<br />
<br />
This doesn't fix warriors and other pure classes in the early game.  However, clerics, monks, rogues et. al. should be pleased by being able to level beyond the classes that supposedly had to give something up to be a hybrid (which we now know is over 90% a fallacy if not 100%).<br />
<br />
Innate bonuses to warrior AC, roguish ATK, cleric heling efficiency, etc. should also be granted.<br />
<br />
Hybrids can still be uber with getting very nice gear, new spells, and their current utility.  However, pure classes will be allowed to be the best at what they do.  Warriors will once again be the first choice for tanking something (in 95% of the cases I hope) because that is all warriors really do.  Other pure classes will excel at what they do as well.<br />
<br />
This doesn't nerf hybrids, it only gives an advantage in the pure area that the pure classes chose to be good at.<br />
<br />
Opinions?  I know this is all too little too late if it were to happen, but I think it is reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">but again, this only works if the warrior is in the last 5 levels of the game, its not enough</div></div><hr />

<br />
All warriors if played long enough and with some skill end up being the last possible level you can be.  This won't fix the problem that exists for lower level warriors, but it changes the desirability to level your warrior and continue playing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heck, they could let melees go to 70 now.  Don't know that'd do much good, but maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A simple way to fix the pure melee and hybrids is to combine them together at lvl 60 or 65 in the next expansion. So rogues and rangers become one class, beastlords and monks become one class, and  warriors get to pick if they want pal or sk spell set, while pal/sk get war skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see the merit of that ... but frankly if I wanted to play an SK I'd be playing my SK.  If they were to force me to change my class, I would expect my choice of any, with equivalent gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't want to be combined.  I want to tank.  I didn't want to be a hybrid when I made my character and I don't want to be now either.</div></div><hr />
