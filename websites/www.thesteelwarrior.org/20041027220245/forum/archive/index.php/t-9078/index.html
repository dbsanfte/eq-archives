<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sylexis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive gotten the confirmed change on the script for the TZ and VZ 20 minute timer, but everyone seems to be wiping there now, has any guild seen beyond this point since the script change to confirm if any further changes were made?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been beaten on povar since the change, but by guilds who are already deep into elemenatals, no new guilds have done it. No other changes to the script that I'm aware of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sylexis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ty Ty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild made an attempt at it shortly after the script change.  We beat VZ despite it surprising us and wiping half the raid, and then beat fake Rallos.  Unfortunately, we didn't beat real Rallos, but the adds all spawned the same etc...  So I'd say no further script changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can you be more specific on the changes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barangi~E'ci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We tried the RZ script two days ago, before yesterdays patch. If it was infact changes made to the script or it being bugged instead, we're not sure, but it wasn't behaving as it usually did.<br />
<br />
Pulling and killing the triggers happend as usual.<br />
<br />
TZ came to camp and we got him tanked and all was well. Then around the corner, from the oposite direction of where TZ arrived from, VZ appeared, bringing with him 6-8 Dekorin Brawlers, Dekorin Warriors and Hendin Shadow Masters. This we weren't prepared for the first time, so that wiped us. We returned and tried again, this time getting TZ and then with a little delay, about 20 secs, VZ but he was alone this time, no Ogre adds. Focused on TZ first and off-tanked VZ. Both died and we set up for pulling fake RZ.<br />
<br />
Fake RZ pulled to camp and everything is proceeding nicely, the usual adds that come running during fake RZ fight start arriving. Then at around 65% 10 or so Dekorin Brawlers, Dekorin Warriors, Shadow Masters and the those splitting Ogre mobs arrive and beats the crap out of the raid. Wiped at 52%, never got to fight real RZ.<br />
<br />
Like I said earlier, we don't know if this was intentional changes made to the script to counter the higher levels or if it's just some bug they managed to sneak in.<br />
<br />
From a personal point of view, I liked having to fight both TZ and VZ at the same time, brought a little extra twist to script, but the random pile of other adds that just suddenly turn up stinks. They just all arrive in a big pile so it's very hard for the enchanters to get them messed in time before they've already eaten up a few healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TagmwarMR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We tried the Event last night (after the patch).<br />
<br />
Triggered TZ, we where ready for VZ to arrive with friends. We managed to get the add's away and got VZ tanked. Then RZ warped on top of me tanking TZ, and wiped us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sylexis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">RZ warped on to you in the middle of tanking TZ?????????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kill the Decorin named.<br />
<br />
1)  TZ agrgos (as usual)<br />
2)  VZ aggros as well from the other direction and brings all of his guards with him.  You have a fight that looks like this:<br />
<br />
-I had a picture here, but I had to take it down.  Sorry ya'll.<br />
<br />
My guild has beaten this script twice since its change, but we're also Time flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well to be fair, since the event was first seen it pointed at a split raid, which re-unites inside the chamber after offing the 2 sons. Having 2 trigger mobs at opposite ends of a hall that have to be killed in a certain time limit shows that.<br />
<br />
We always did it that way, splitting our group into ~30 on each side and killing the brothers, even on our first kill ever. It's definately not too hard with levle 70 and some of the other things available now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I heard that this is a bug and not an intentional change, but who knows when they will get it fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's bugged because the encounter is definitely incosistant.  Here's basically a rundown of our past several attempts on this script.<br />
<br />
1)  Killed the Decorins, and both Tallon and Vallon aggro'd.  Clerics stayed on the TZ tank and spot healers picked up on Vallon.  The usual two splits off Vallon occured and that was it.  No ogre guardians.  We got swarmed by about 12-15 adds during the fake Rallos Zek right near the end, but the script ended with a win.<br />
<br />
2)  Killed the Decorins, and both Tallon and Vallon aggro'd, which we were expecting to happen again.  Unlike the first time, we got swarmed by about 6 adds along with Vallon agroing, as depicted in the picture above.  We defeated Tallon and Vallon and were wiped out by the remaining adds.  Somehow, we prevailed and were 20 seconds from engaging Rallos Zek (Fake) before the timer ran out and he became untargetable again.<br />
<br />
3)  Killed the Decorins, and both Tallon and Vallon aggro'd.  Unlike the second time, there were NO adds with Vallon.  Just Tallon and Vallon, easy peezy shit.  We cleared the map room as well as some adds outside.  Set up for Rallos Zek (fake).  Pulled Rallos Zek and a whopping ONE add came right near the end.  Script ended with a win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">pre-target with eye of zomm and set enchanter mez targets (the guards of vz, gindan flayers, are not supposed to spawn with him) - once those are all setup, have a monk get bestow da and pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tamov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you won't have time to pretarget post change. they all rush raid with VZ upon spawning when you are killing TZ... at least that's what i thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Any new ideas on if this a bug or &quot;working as intended&quot;?<br />
<br />
Our guild has been thinking about going back to catch up some flags on RZ but we're a little confused as to which event we need to plan on doing.<br />
<br />
On a side note, if it is a real change, its pretty freaking cheesey to go back and change content from 3 expansions ago (4 if you count Ykesha) like this... I mean did they upgrade AoW, Emp and VT when they bumped the level cap from 60 to 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wulfran, I believe those mobs were, in fact, raised in level to keep them yellow/red to 65, where previously most of them were said to be level 63-65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sylexis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I heard rumor that all PoP bosses gained 5 levels when OOW came out to keep them &quot;balanced&quot; I cant confirm this because they seem to be hitting for the same and going down just as fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
P4 bosses in Time con yellow, yet Pyronis still cons red.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I mean did they upgrade AoW, Emp and VT when they bumped the level cap from 60 to 65? <br />
<br />
lol, as far as I can tell, they NERFED AoW even before PoP cause he was too powerful.  Apparently he flurried a whole shitstorm more than he does now.  Emp got easier cause you could slow him further (40% vs 25% disease slow).  I think with PoP, you could mez more mobs in VT.  Don't quote me on that one.  The Zuns, Plis, and Eoms are the only unmezzable now.  The Quas and other ones are mezzable, but I think only the Quas originally were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well my guild could never break the grip of others on Ssra and VT pre-POP so I can't say for sure, that was just speculation. <br />
I think with PoP, you could mez more mobs in VT. When we got there, everyone was 65 and the names in VT all conned yellow, and on occasion we did see mezz messages on mobs like Mini-Aten and I think TVK.<br />
<br />
As for other wierd stuff in the past few days, the PoWater minis all seemed like they did before (except they all are dropping leather and silk instead of plate molds). Ditto for Air. The Earth Rings seem buggered: <br />
- Mud Ring, we only had to kill 1 Sludge Lurker to pop the Filith Gorgers, and Monstrous popped the babies that the Sludge Lurkers usually do (yay a bug that worked to shorten event time for once!)<br />
- Rock ring, was bugged and wouldn't respawn after the 4 guys went walking back to the pyramid<br />
- Dust Ring, when the Perfected spawned, he didn't summon his regular adds, but instead popped 3 new Truimverate of Soil (fun fight and prolly easier than dealing with the other adds)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whatever they did to the Mud ring, it's 10x faster.  I like it.  :P<br />
<br />
I haven't seen that about the rock ring yet.<br />
<br />
The dust ring - The way the Perfected Warder of Earth spawns adds depends on how many Dust Warders are up to start the script.  If you have one trigger mob, he spawns the 3x red cons, which spawn AT the abandoned fort.  If you're raid is smart, simply have someone waiting to tag them and kite them as you're fighting the Perfected Warder.    If there are two Dusty Warders, then you get swarmed by the blue cons, which IMHO makes the script MUCH harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">lol, as far as I can tell, they NERFED AoW even before PoP cause he was too powerful.

<br />
AoW was indeed nerfed at one point along the line: His sustained DPS was designed with pre-nerf modrods in mind. Fights have an entirely different tone to them when the cleric can horf down 2 full modrods between cheals, grab a Torpor, and continue ad infinitum. When the mod rods were nerfed mid Luclin, AoW dps was cranked down, and Ssra and VT mobs had their HP slashed. This was directly caused by the change of fight model away from the endurance fests of Luclin, into the burnination of PoP: Infinite mana clerics and fight-opening Manaburns(suddenly projected to break 20k+ damage pre-crit) had to go. There's no place for them in a land populated by Manaetic Behemoths and General Reparms.<br />
<br />
We were one of the last guilds on Brell to kill the pre-nerf AoW, and I remember the fight going for about 12 minutes and six warriors. Defensive wearing off was effectively a Death Touch, with 3-4 DPSers going down between each warrior. It was spectacularly bloody, as he could get anywhere between four and fifteen attacks per cheal on a 1 second rotation. ... Most enjoyable fight I've ever been in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The nerf Eriatha is talking about was the Luclin rebalancing to account for the modrod nerf.  Many mobs had their hit points reduced and/or their melee output reduced.  I don't recall exact numbers but didn't Emp Ssra go from max hit 1300 to max hit 1000?  AOW started flurrying less and lost a lot of hit points. etc.<br />
<br />
No question that the POP disease slow effectively nerfed a lot of old content.  Lord Vyemm for example went from being incredibly hard (for his era) to being not much harder than the rest of NTOV.<br />
<br />
You can see how the mob levels were adjusted at each cap increase, though.  Most Velious bosses were upgraded to level 67-70 to keep them yellow/red in POP era.  Now for OoW, it appears that most POP bosses were upgraded to keep them red to 70.  Do lesser POP mobs like TZ, MB, Auliffe still con yellow/red at 70?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">storms minis are dark blue at 66, but they conned white before at 65, so they didnt change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Aerin Dar is yellow to L68.  So he hasn't changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bollixbraker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Did rallos zek a week ago and the two fake zeks both spawned at the same time.  <br />
<br />
Heard a rumour that it was being changed back again, anyone tried it within the last week can confirm if it is back the way it was originally?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>lilogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I remember we were in ToV when PoP came out.  All mobs were bumped up 2 or 3 lvls to compensate.  I kinda expected the same for major encounters in PoP with OoW out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">bollix: there hasnt been a patch since this broke(or has there been 1, and it didnt fix it?)  but i did see a post no the soe boards with the Dev saying he was trying to fix it, or had found a fix...<br />
<br />
will have to wait and see with tomorrows patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Berdoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Script changes:  TZ spawns in South hall, VZ spawns in North hall as soon as the triggers are dead.  Easiest way to win is to split the raid and kill all the mobs in both halls.  Keep half the raid on TZ side as primarily range attack / nukers.  VZ is a melee meltdown with his 2 splits.  Once they both dead, combine the raid in south hall and kill respawns, clear trash in front of fake RZ and then kill fake RZ (He causes adds to run in and assist during fight, just mez and TL when fake RZ depops).<br />
<br />
Real RZTW has not changed, Pull him to a corner and tank him with raid and Max melee range, train groups train adds North away from the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>TagmwarMR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Fixed with Oct 13th Patch.  VZ and TZ will not assist each other.</div></div><hr />
