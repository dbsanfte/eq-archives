<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>skjalnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just to start off and give some spin to my opinions: I'm warrior thru-and-thru, I've never wanted to play a knight, don't have one as an alt, and I'll likely never roll one because I want to focus on melee and weapons and armor and battle tactics. That's it. Keep that finger-wiggling, book-reading, sparkly-making mumbo jumbo to yourself... I'm busy sharpening my blades.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, this is a two-part observation/view, much of it said before -- bear with me. :) I just wanted to get my opinions out, first by looking at straight fighting ability of the tanks. Then at the &quot;extra options&quot; making each tanking subclass unique.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Straight fighting ability. <br />
<br />
Taking the hits. Being a tank. I think that the issue isn't whether or not warriors should be any better at it than the knights. Right now, the tanking ability of the 3 tank classes is pretty similar, as the various comparisons/parses/etc have shown. I think that is a good thing. <br />
<br />
I don’t want to see the warrior as the base of the archetype with inherent advantage in tanking and the other 2 sub-classes playing second fiddle. I want to see three subclasses, each more-or-less equals. Looking only at raw &quot;tankability&quot;, there should be no clear favorite, or at the very least the differences should be minimal.<br />
<br />
Why shouldn't there be a clear winner in tanking ability? To lessen the need for preferential choice, be it for a raid or XP group or whatever. So that the paladin doesn’t win out over the warrior, the warrior win out over the shadowknight, etc etc, when talking only about fighting/tanking ability. This helps all three classes, IMO, since all 3 are viable choices in most situations.<br />
<br />
All three classes have the same goal -- take hits, keep others from taking them. The ability to do this should be similar. The methods used to accomplish it are what should be different. At most, the goal should be situational superiority for each class, not overall superiority for one (or two) in all situations. And, no, I don’t think superiority in XP groups vs. raids counts.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Specialization<br />
<br />
Just about every discussion brings up the &quot;warrior&quot; versus &quot;warrior + options&quot; problem. Generally speaking, shadowknights have an offensive options package. Paladins have a defensive options package. What warriors need is their own option package, something that sets them apart and gives them an edge in different situations. I don’t want to see the tank classes nerfed to parity. Bring warrior's options in line with the knights.<br />
<br />
I want to see options given to warriors that have similar usefulness, and not just item-based band-aids that can be grafted into previous item-based band-aids. Real subclass-defining stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Start of an idea along those lines:<br />
From the class description: &quot;Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics.&quot; Combat is not just hacking at a target and hitting taunt occasionally to keep a single target's attention. Combat is the entire battle situation. Give warriors a &quot;combat management&quot;-based option package.<br />
<br />
No, warrior's can’t generate snap aggro: but why not allow warriors, who by class definition work at mastering of combat tactics, to direct where aggro in combat goes? Allow warriors a skill to assume hate generated by others, rather than just trumping whatever exists with a taunt. Warriors wouldn’t be generating new aggro the way a shadowknight or paladin (or heck even a resisted slow from a shaman) would. They'd just be directing what's already there, created by others in the group. Combat management.<br />
<br />
There are aspects to combat other than just active actions directed towards a foe. A taunt, a cast stun, a proc off a weapon -- all are aggressive actions. That's only one side of the equation isn’t it? Why not a feint? Draw the opponent into a bad situation through guile. Combat management. An example of this could be a duration-based skill (call it &quot;dupe&quot; or something) that makes the warrior have near-death aggro for some amount of time, regardless of real health? Or some other form of temporary aggro outside the normal hate list…<br />
<br />
I’m sure other examples fit into this, but I’ll keep this only slightly too long.<br />
<br />
The bottom line, I want to have options that make me the &quot;master of armed combat and defense&quot;. Not at the expense of others, but because warriors would make use of the tactical prowess we supposedly spent all that time working on. Accomplishing it as effectively as the other tanks, but through different subclass-defining means.<br />
<br />
And not with a nerf bat.<br />

<br />
The difficulty is of course that it'd take a LOT of utility attacks etc to balance for 56 levels of spell useage and it depends how closely our concept of our characters is tied to being the hardiest tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh and what's your name mean skjalnir ? /chuckle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>skjalnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey, if ya gotta flame... :)<br />
<br />
But, just to follow up a bit -- I never said that this idea would be an easy fix, or even remotely possible... <br />
<br />
Just my feelings on the matter that 3 tank classes on relatively equal footing with balanced uniqueness would be a heck of a lot more desirable than how things stand today. <br />
<br />
Call it food for thought or fodder for the hogs or whatever. Rather than following the &quot;nerf them, give more snap aggro to us&quot; threads,  I felt like adding my 2 copper to the pot. Can't hurt to babble (too much)<br />
<br />
And as for the name: I take crap from it every day since noone knows how the heck to pronounce it...<br />
<br />
Full char name is Skjalnir Nordson, something properly nordic for a barbarian warrior. Sort of like Thor's hammer, Mjollnir, but much more interesting in a bar brawl or whatever trouble I can get myself into...<br />
