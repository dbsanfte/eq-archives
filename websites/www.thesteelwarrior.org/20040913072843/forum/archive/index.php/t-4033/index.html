<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aesus Iceheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, I posted in the equipment section asking for advise on how to twink a newb warrior, but before I go ahead and invest a lot of time and PP in a warrior I want to double check that it is a wise move doing so.<br />
<br />
I posted on shadowknight.org and now wanted to post here. Which would be a better choice? Shadow Knight or Warrior? (I wont make a paladin because they cant be Iksar which is all I play).<br />
<br />
I made 2 test server characters and /testbuffed them to 25 and put on all the gear it gave me (which most was the same for both the SK and the warrior). The stats were this:<br />
<br />
Warrior                Shadow Knight<br />
HP: 900               HP: 915<br />
AC: 642               AC: 658<br />
ATK: 584             ATK: 575<br />
<br />
STR: 132             STR: 129<br />
STA: 120             STA: 146<br />
AGI: 103             AGI: 93<br />
<br />
MR: 57                MR: 55<br />
<br />
I distributed starting stats the same for each iksar, 10 to strength 15 to stamina. They are almost dead even in all important stats at equal level and with very similar equipment. Then the SK had all his spells aswell. Now I know things like avoidance and mitigation are all behind the scenes, is the warrior noticebly higher then the SK in these things making him the better tank even though the visible stats make them seem even?<br />
<br />
Also.. on raids later in the game, namely 55+, only warriors tank really. Does that mean that SKs are pretty much just for laughs and warriors are the serious tanks that you get a good end result with (since your useful on raids and SK is good for nothing there? (guessing at that statement btw))?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you have a constant group ( with your guild perhaps ) or do you plan to solo/ get pickup groups on the way up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your sk will have similar hp to a warrior (within 600hp or so difference at the end with same gear on), but will be more versatile, hold agro better and get groups much easier. This will only get more pronounced as you hit the higher levels.<br />
<br />
Warriors are broken atm, so much so that even in raids knights are used to tank when defensive isn't required more and more. Now's not a good time to make one if you're all alone in EQ, much as that sucks.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you have a regular group who will hang out with you all the way to 65 and beyond, being a warrior can be very rewarding and fun experience; I would by all means recommend it provided you don't depend on pickup groups for exp. If you do, you're better off with the sk.</div></div><hr />
