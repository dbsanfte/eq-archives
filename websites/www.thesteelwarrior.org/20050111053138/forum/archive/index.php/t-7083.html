How can a class cannot be broken when a baz/pre-ele/LDoN warrior can out tank a time+ geared knight with about 10k+hp and whatever amount of AC they have.<br />

<br />
If all you could do was tank, then yes, I'd say you were broken.  But the fact is, that spell book brings a lot of utility.  In addition to utility spells, Knights have superior agro and solid snap agro.  Knights do not tank as well as warriors, but, except for the 3 minutes of Defensive, they are close.  <br />
<br />
By the way, a fully LDoN geared tank is gonna be close to that 10k+ hp knight you mentioned...(at least in terms of hp)<br />
<br />
For the record, I am in favor of giving knights a boost to account for, what sound like, reasonable complaints in GoD (I'm not there yet, so I can't say for certain what it's like.)  However, I see no problem with knights pre-GoD.<br />
<br />
Also, even if the GoD complaints I've heard about knights is accurate, I still wouldn't say the class is broken in general.  What I've heard is, in a couple trials they can't tank the last mob.  So...knights end up not adding a tremendous amount to the grp on that last mob...not &quot;broken&quot;...just not the best game design IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the duration of a three minute discipline, not 100% of the time.  Now, answer me this first, how can a class not be broken when a baz/pre-ele/LDoN Paladin can out heal a time+ geared Warrior?  Or a baz/pre-ele/LDoN Shadow Knight can out feign death a time+ geared Warrior?  Oh, you mean that there are class differences that no amount of gear will allow members of another class to equal?  But why shouldn't Warriors with enough gear be able to do everything a Knight can do who is lesser geared?  Now, once you've realized and understood that Knights have a lot of things that no amount of gear will ever allow a Warrior to duplicate, then you'll understand why Knights aren't broken when Warriors have a few things that no amount of gear will allow a Knight to duplicate.<br />
<br />
See how easy that was?</div></div><hr />

When the content made warriors noneffictive did we ask for an overhaul of all content that was causing a problem (PoP etc.) NO, we asked for and got tools that would help us keep agro like the incite line and allow us to bring more to group and raids unlocked timers.<br />

It was an oversight to not give warriors an agro tool just like it was one not to give knights a tanking tool that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry but that's bullshit.  Knights tank just fine everywhere but in a few zones in GoD against a few mobs.  And those encounters are being fixed.  So Knights will then be able to tank effectively everywhere.  Does that mean they'll be a good choice against raid calibre boss mobs?  No, because that's the Warrior raid niche.  But they can and will tank effectively for single group content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mehtinks that most of the time knights forget the pure beneficial and utility usage of the spell book when comparing themselves to warriors whose utility ( up until recently ) is near zero.<br />
<br />
Warriors gave up a lot of group friendly attributes ovr the years due to the hybridization of EQ and people's thoughts of the newer term &quot;kills per minute&quot;.<br />
<br />
warriors bring this number down ( for the most part )<br />
knights bring the number up; plus add to group dynamics in ways us warriors can't.<br />
<br />
so, in closing...when comparing knights versus warriors....one has to look at the big picture. tanking for a group equates to a lot more than just being hit..and fo 95% of EQ knights can get hit the same as well as we can ( minus defensive/evasive ) ... which in turn evasive/defensive is no match for 56 levels of spells ( 65-9 when knights can first cast. )<br />
<br />
it's all in whoever is looking at the spectrum. it goes either way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think he avoided the question at all.  If knight tanking = warrior tanking, the classes are extremely out of balance because warriors have nothing else they can offer and knights have spells.<br />
<br />
Knights are a hybrid class, they are NOT a pure tanking class.  The only pure tanking class in the game is warriors.  This isn't to say that I (or a lot of other warriors) am against changes for knights, but don't for one second think I support making knights = warriors when it comes to pure tanking.  If you don't understand making the classes equal in tanking ability would be extremely unbalancing either you don't know the abilities of knights and warriors.<br />
<br />
By the way, warriors don't want better assist roles.  (I'm not even sure where you got that one from  :confused: )</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes the mobs are being fixed, now warriors will have a cakewalk and knights will have the fun challenging encounters. I don’t want to see hard content “dumbed down” to let knights tank there.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
Shikarii, they do get some advantages but nothing that compensates for them being left out of an expansion, many only look at content for time level players when talking about content but the inequity in tanking is through out all of GoD though to see it you must use similarly geared knights and warriors of a level that the content was designed for.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
I don't think he avoided the question at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
He most certainly did, when asked if it is fair for a bazaar warrior to out tank a time geared knight he responded it was “For the duration of a three minute discipline, not 100% of the time.” He did not say if it was fair he said instead that it only lasted 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If knight tanking = warrior tanking, the classes are extremely out of balance because warriors have nothing else they can offer and knights have spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
I must agree with you on this, that is why I have never ever suggested they be on equal footing for tanking. I did say above that they have the same job that you apparently decided it to mean that I thought they deserve a full defensive.<br />
<br />
I have sudgested in the past that knights get a 20% mitigation dis that reduces all agro gained while it is up by 50% and lasts 3 min. That would perserve game and class balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
By the way, warriors don't want better assist roles. (I'm not even sure where you got that one from <br />
<br />
<br />
You don’t know where that came from? Read my fucking lips. I want better “assist” rolls during raids! Everyone that has complained at being the second or farther down the tank line or about the boredom of playing a warrior it can be assumed would want more utility. <br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now to answer the question that was asked but missed:<br />
<br />
Now, answer me this first, how can a class not be broken when a baz/pre-ele/LDoN Paladin can out heal a time+ geared Warrior? Or a baz/pre-ele/LDoN Shadow Knight can out feign death a time+ geared Warrior?<br />
<br />
Warriors do not have primary or secondary role of healer, warriors, paladins and SK’s all have a primary role of TANK, paladins have assist healer as a secondary role and SK’s have taps, FD pulling and snare as secondary roles.<br />
<br />
So yes it is ok for a knight to be better at their secondary role than a class that does not have that secondary role.<br />
<br />
Just remember TANKING is still there primary role, the other things they can do are nice but don’t really help getting the mob dead nearly as much as defensive if at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion, it's a hard question to answer for two reasons; 1) that knights and warriors have a different opinion of what kind of tanking ability each should have (which is fine) and 2) that a lot of people come at the discussion with a different understanding of the abilities and level of effectiveness of those abilities.  Most of the problems come from 2.  I'd like to see some parsing, analyzation, and agreement from prominent warriors and knights on things like mitigation and DPS, so that the discussion can be approached from common ground.  It's hard to have a good discussion when, for example, one warrior says the mitigation gap is 5% and a knight says 15%, or one warrior says SKs do more DPS and one SK says warriors do.<br />

<br />
<br />
If you want to be a utility class, go play a knight.<br />
<br />
If SoE starts adding &quot;utility&quot; to the pure tank class (warriors), then they'll have to further dilute our tanking abilities or raise the tanking abilities of knights to compensate.  Personally, I don't want to go down that road.  I play a warrior so I can tank things.  Sometimes I'm MA, sometimes I'm not even in the rotation.  That's fine, that's the choice I made when I chose my class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arikash</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with all of you that knights should NOT be able to tank as well as warriors, there should be some sort of gap between knights and warriors, but right now IMO that gap is a little large between the plate tanking classes, and the chain/leather classes.<br />
<br />
Glatius, you did totally avoid the question.  I was talking about knight tanking vs. warrior tanking, not warrior utility vs. knight utility.  Most of the things knights can do can be cured by clicky items (potions, clicky root/snare silks, etc.).<br />
<br />
I never said you wanted better assist roles, and I'll totally agree with you that being tank_08 on raids sucks.  <br />
<br />
There are some warrior vs. knight DPS parses somewhere, I'll see if I can find them.<br />
<br />
I agree that the warriors primary role should be tanking, but in the single group encounters, knights cannot tank the final bosses in them.  if these were two or three group encounters, I don't think there would be a problem, but in a SINGLE group enviroment, knights should be viable tanks also.  <br />
<br />
Most of the things in our spellbook can be done better by other classes IE DoTs, FD, snares, and our taps aren't really game breaking at all.  Rangers have better attack buffs, and snares, monks have FD, and a FD hotkey, it can't fizzle, or get interupted.<br />
<br />
I also think that defensive should not be taken out of the game, and &quot;fixing&quot; the content so a knight can tank it is a bad idea, and no SK is happy about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.  You don't get to treat it this way.  If you can slice off Knight tanking alone and compare it to Warrior tanking, then you've ignored half of the equation and of course the Knight comes up short, well duh!  It would be like my ignoring the tanking aspect of Warriors completely and screaming that Knights completely rule in the utility aspect.  But I don't do that.  What I do point out however is that Knights get utility combined with tanking.  Warriors get tanking with little or no utility.  Knights don't get to ignore their utility and bitch about how they don't equal Warriors in tanking, because the fact they have utility is exactly the reason they don't and never will equal a Warrior in tanking.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm so freaking tired of seeing this arguement over and over again.  Because it's totally lame.  Hey, did you know that Wizards do better DPS than Warriors?  That being the case, shouldn't we completely disregard Warrior DPS in the comparison between Knights and Warriors?  That's exactly what you're trying to claim.  Because class X or Y can do something you do better than you, therefore the fact you can do it counts for nothing.  No, you're wrong.  Again it doesn't work that way.  You have the abilities.  Sometimes they're not very useful.  Sometimes they're extremely useful.  You get to decide when you do and don't use them.  A Warrior doesn't have that choice, because he doesn't get those abilities.  Therefore there will always be some advantage in tanking to the Warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What can a SK or pally bring to a single group encounter in GoD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, i have a question. How is it fair that a level 62 SK can solo in tactics where a timed level warrior can not? How is it fair that a Pali can solo in PoD all day and a time level warrior might be able to squeek out 2 or 3 before he has to run for the zone. <br />
How is it fair that if a warrior pulls and gets a ton of adds that he can't FD? How is it fair that when the warrior does pull a ton of adds and can't FD that he has to ask for a rezz? How is it fair that when there are multiple mobs in camp I have to wait 30 seconds and then hope taunt works to get each mob aggrod on me? There are a lot of situations being a hybrid is great, i have died to many times while watching my sk buddy lying on the ground laughing at me or asking me to let him get aggro so he can tank the last part since he can heal. Why do i not get a HP/AC or an aggro buff? <br />
I know why...It's not in my job description. <br />
I am in favor of some things being reworked for knights but not the I want to be as equal of a tank as a warrior and keep all my other spells to boot. Just ebay the char already and roll a warrior if being the boss mob tank is what you want. <br />
<br />
In your scenario with the pre time warrior and the time level knight at 10K. At the end of the fight who do you think would live longer? If time level warriors are saying that it's tough for them and they have 11-12K I would venture to say that even with defensive a pre-time warrior would lose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After the changes to the content, what he should be bringing is sufficient tanking to get the job done and some utility.  If after the changes are finalized you can legitimately claim that Knights can't tank one group content in GoD, then you'll have a leg to stand on for more changes of either content or class.  But until then, you're trying to get changes for something that is supposed to be a moot point once SoE finalizes the content changes.</div></div><hr />
