Frog thinks that GOOD Warriors will be in steady demand in WoW!<br />

thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very true, a well played warrior at this point in the development is simply a sight to behold. They truely are the best at what they do. <br />
<br />
I'd like ot note that thats just from a min/max standpoint and the fact that warriors have talents, which many classes still lack. I read a dev post where his said something along the lines that people will really need to get out of there EQ mindsets. The warrior is awesome because he has so many tools at his disposal to do his main functions, damage (and they can dish a quite a bit) and tanking (no question at this point, no other class has the agro and defesive capabilities of the warrior).<br />
<br />
Warrior, rogue, preist, and mage, the four &quot;pure&quot; classes have all been given talents and other classes still have yet to be fully fleshed out. I expect when those 4 are adequately balanced, then the main brunt of the balancing for the rest of the classes will happen. Something that will happen soon, druid and shaman are getting talents tenatively set for the next big patch.<br />
<br />
With only warriors, and paladins for the alliance, able to wear the heaviest armor, I expect that the tank slot will more often than not be open in many groups and good warriors will be in great demand.</div></div><hr />

And imo for leveling a fury/arms spec goes further than defensive, group or solo.  You have to get out of the eq mindset, in this game a good offence is the best defense.</div></div><hr />

Pff.  Highly subjective.<br />
<br />
In OB, I had nearly the same gear I have right at the moment, and I screwed around with specs alot.  This time I went 5 parry and 5 defense and my survivability vs mobs has increased dramatically.  I'm talking about going from barely winning a fight to being able to chain kill mobs one after the other because my natural regen is enough to keep me full in the mere seconds between mobs.<br />
<br />
I have absolutely no complaints about going defensive.  Get back to me when people are having problems keeping you alive vs elites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalidor1997</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pure offensive works best only against lower level mobs....against higher level ones than yourself the increased threat of the defensive tank is massive.  Let the other 4 members of your group go offensive in their talents.  Your job is to hold the aggro as best as you can and absorb damage.  Look at it this way....if a mage has to hold back because you can't generate enough threat, thats a loss of the total groups dps.  Sure you might do 20% more damage but that little amount won't cover what 2 mages and rogue could do unleashed.<br />
<br />
I like the fact that every other warrior wants to go offensive.  I'd rather stick to sword and plank, require massively less healing, and still control 4-5 mobs with ease.  Makes me more desirable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly I played a warrior in open beta and spec defensively all the way.  In retail I am going all offensive until the late levels.  I currently solo almost every quest at level 25 and have no problems killing 26 and even 27 mobs.  Also the offense is the best defensive was in regard to solo not group...<br />
<br />
Secondly, dont bring taunt into this conversation while its still broke.  I played an SK to upper eschelons of PoP, I know how taunt works.  I also know my role.  I also said I was going to respec at high levels and if they fix taunt before I get 50 then Ill respec then for the defensive taunt skills only.<br />
<br />
The statement was about leveling and specing - not equipment.  I will use a shield and 1hand - IF its in the right scenario; the same goes for any other configuration.  Specing on the other hand I am going offensive and I have no problems and I certainly dont have any complaints from group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found taunt works like this.  You use it, mob's on you, and then whoever previously had more aggro than you (which is why you use it) does another action, and now the mob's on him.  Since rage primarily is generated by being hit, now you're stuck with taunt down and no rage to do anything either.<br />
<br />
Besides, I think WoW's aggro is actually based on DPS (though this might be because missed hits don't generate rage), so lose 10% DPS in defensive mode, spend talents points to get +15% which comes out to be .9 X 1.15 = 1.035.  Battle stance seems more idiot proof than taunt.  At the very least I can Hamstring so that while my group members are running around in circles causing most of my hits to miss (lag doesn't hlep either) other people can get a few more hits in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that they should remove the taunt skill, and rename Sunder Armor to Taunt and this problem would be solved.<br />
<br />
And the people saying &quot;OFFENSIVE RULES!&quot; Primarily strike me as Battle Net tards who think everyone's job is damage.  That's never been the job of the warrior, and I highly doubt it's going to be your job in this game too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one time I did have aggro, I dropped like 10 Sunder Armors on the mob.  I had excess rage and it's already max debuffed but it seems pointless to drop a rend or a heroic strike, and you have no real good damage moves in protective mode anyway so might as well throw some more Sunder Armors for extra aggro.</div></div><hr />

Are you on a PvE server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree but sunder armor isnt a spec now is it?  Secondly I dont know if your battle net comment was directed at me, if it was I guess you just chose to ignore the fact that I played eq into potime but whatever.  And one more time this isnt about roles its about specing.  A warrior role will always be defensive - no argument there, but imo opinion at this point (lvl 27) and in this game a good offence is the best defense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to disagree as well.  I love my defensive skills on my level 26 warrior.  I just picked up the stun that attaches to revenge, and with 3 talent points into it I have a 40% chance to fire off a 3 second stun on a successful revenge.  I had started to spend some points into arms to get the imrpoved rend and eventually the dot on a critical strike, but I am having a blast firing off my stun with my shield and eventually the extra abilites that I can get to imrpove shield bash I'm gonna probably respec soon so I can go almost full defensive spec.<br />
<br />
I don't solo, I almost always have a full group.</div></div><hr />

Dude, you registered in June.  You have 5 posts.  None of them even remotely hint that you even played EQ, let alone got into time.  Ignored?  Hardly.  I can't be expected to anticipate the stories everyone makes up and assumes I know.<br />

<br />
And I completely disagree.  If you're gonna solo your entire life, then maybe, but if you're going to do instanced content and do elite quests at your level, then what the fuck is another 3% damage on your rend gonna do, or -1 rage cost on Heroic strike?  Oh yeah..fuck all of anything.  5% parry however, is a real number, with a real effect, one that is clearly visible when you tank something.  If you wanna be a halfassed rogue, be my guest.  I didn't make a warrior to be one of those tho.</div></div><hr />

OMGZ you totally caught me in my lies.  ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS IMPRESS YOU.  Why dont you like me Haass?  Why?  I like yuo!!  Why did you have to pwn me like that?  <br />
<br />
How does one become the Bullshit stopper liek yuo?  If only my post count was 3,735 I would know all that is eq, warriors, and life.  I bet a post count like that could get you laid.  Only have five =/  Maybe Ill go post on every board like you and when I dont have anything left to say Ill  call them a b.net tard - perhaps then Ill be uber as thou<br />
<br />
I guess I was wrong about everything becuase &quot;Apr 2003&quot; said so.  You know all!  <br />
<br />
You win the prize for the biggest post-count-penis - I just want to be you<br />
<br />
HAASS FOR MAYOR 2008 - THIS BULLSHIT HAS GOT TO STOP!<br />
<br />
