Heh, don't chase the mob, it will eventually come back to you when the overnuker is dead.</div></div><hr />

Actually it will kill the healer next since he will try him best to save the over nuker and with out a healer you die too. So run I say, run to the zone as soon as you can :p</div></div><hr />

If your slowers and healers aren't on a horse right behind you (in /shield range) and your nukers aren't OCCAISONALLY Jolting, then they need to learn how to play their class.</div></div><hr />

Are you hitting taunt? I hear. I tap it like a mad man usually. I always answer, NO. What's a taunt button? They always come back with silence or, Well I was just asking. Like, do I ask if your even watching what the hell is going on. Look, I can nuke for 1500 right off the bat, I am so tough. Bet you cant do that :p na na na bo bo. Hey!!!

I can't beleive 25% are mashing, either.<br />

If you combine 2 and 3, which are pretty similar, it's almost 70% doing it right though.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's as clear cut as the poll implies. Sometimes you can be a good boy and make sure you're sticking to your fundamental strats; other times you gotta mash.  I use this method to Taunt, after the mob gets about half dead, I usually don't have to Taunt anymore. It's only really dicey if you're not pulling (higher level you get, the rarer this happens, pretty much once you pass pov/s you're not gonna be pulling anymore) and the slow gets resisted. With a good supply of arrows, I can get the mob off the puller before it's in camp and with a little luck and well timed Taunt and /shield, the slower will take minimal damage.<br />
<br />
IMO if anyone but the slower takes damage initially or the healers, they deserve to be pounded on.Originally posted by Dator <br />

Oh the /stand is for those mobs that proc a FD on ya Tsk tsk. FD-proccing mobs are very rare, only ocean giants in PoS that comes to mind. Disarm and Bash I could see possibly on one key, but Taunt definitely needs its own button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not clear to me that mashing taunt is all that bad, considering the percentages involved. With a 50% chance on average for taunt to have a chance to work (given Brutul's results), I can't see that mashing taunt is necessarily the make or break for a good warrior. With a 4 taunt success= fail pattern in some cases documented, you could argue that you should mash your taunt as fast as possible to get all that out of the way.<br />
<br />
I don't actually believe that, but I do think that &quot;mash=bad&quot; is too simplistic. And often in groups I end up doing what amounts to mashing, simply because I'm continually skittering along the edge of lost aggro. Normally, I'm very careful to read melee spam and reserve taunts for high aggro debuffs and the like. I'm just not sure it really makes much of a difference.</div></div><hr />

I don't play games when I lead raids/groups.  You pull aggro off me, i'm not gonna pull it back off you.  They'll learn or they won't group with you again.  Either way, you're a winner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just very few DPS classes come with a concussion spell, and as a wizard I dont need it in exp groups. It's fairly easy to time a big nuke so it drops the mob to flee mode, and if it crits it drops the mob from 25% to corpse.</div></div><hr />

In XP groups, I taunt whenever i loose aggro, unless I am constantly loosing aggro to the same melee on every mob every 5 seconds. Usually it is paladins or monks or rangers. Some monks like to use 17 delay weapons in both hands just so they can brag about how they can out-taunt a warrior. &quot;dont wanna use the 2 hander? Fine, FD&quot;. some rangers do the same. fine, chain jolt. many paladins chain-stun, usually on purpose, to the same end. &quot;I guess he wants to MT&quot;. about 1k other threads on this MB are dedicated to all that crap. <br />
<br />
SKs are our friends. I have good luck with SKs most of the time.. if they want to MT we talk about it first, instead of haveing a taunt/proc/chain-stun contest on 3 or 4 mobs. If im MT they cast voices on me and make some effort to not gain aggro after the initial pull (sk-ED + war taunt = war is pretty far ahead of nukers pretty quick on aggro) and if their AC and HPS totally owns mine, out comes the GSoT and im standing behind the rogue, tyvm now pull =) <br />
<br />
Raids; everytime i loose aggro, unless its to a paly. i watch every &quot;..._01 begins to cast a spell&quot; message and usually know who is casting what and when. if slow is inc, i see it land, i wait to see if mob turns... if its resisted, i dont get the message... (they should change that) but i've saved taunt for mr. shammy. <br />
<br />
/e waves goodbye to pally_01<br />
/t pally_01 ooo, that looks like it hurt =/ <br />
<br />
hitting taunt every time it refeshes makes no sense, except for someone &lt;lvl 39 trying to make skill-ups. if warrior already has aggro, hitting taunt does absolutely nothing except grey the button out for 6 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sherm</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends for me ,, using a GSoT in BoT or HoH if the Shammy doesn't get a resist and I taunt as I hear the slow fall the agro's all mine for the rest of the fight . LDoN tho is another animal all together . I use the Copper Hammer and the Bloodsworn because the GSoT isnt enough snap agro. There's usually more resists on the slows and I wind up taunting  a lot more , even after the slow I can lose agro pretty easy and I try to save my taunts for when they turn . Just my 2cp worth</div></div><hr />

Well, nothing happens except the warrior goes to the top of the hate list.  Remember that the hate list and aggro are two different things.  aggro = hate + hate bonus    All taunting does is put your hate higher than any one elses.  Without taunting they might actually have more hate but less hate bonus (distance, initial aggro, etc).  Same reason you mash taunt on boss mobs.  But in exp situations you'd rather just jump to the top of the hate list as necessary since if you lose aggro, noone dies (as long as taunt is readily available and not greyed out from mashing it).</div></div><hr />

Well, that's all fair and good.  Except, I guess, that when the dead groupmembers are sitting at their bind point and thinking what they'll be thinking is get a knight.<br />

When I'm forced to go pick-up group, I try to educate my group members via tells.  People get huffy in public settings which groupchat really is.  In direct tells they are much more likely to know I mean business and am really trying to help them out not embarass them.   <br />
<br />
I pluck an arrow into the incoming mob and save my first taunt for after tash/slow lands.  But if the shit hits the fan, I mash until I have agro back.  Unhappily, sometimes that's just the way it goes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i usually mash taunt, why? because in all the exp groups i've had since i hit 65, unless there are several mobs or i'm tanking something really big and mean, no one's ever died in the 6 seconds it takes for taunt to refresh unless they are doing something really foolish. i hardly ever pull in exp groups anymore, when a mob is inc, i have the puller run past me and once the mob is in range i taunt, kick (hoping for a stun) and start attacking. using my hot keys, 3 for taunt, 4 to kick and &quot;A&quot; to attack, i can do all 3 in order in less than 1 second. then i mash it again once it pops which is usually followed by another kick, or a bash if i can get my shield out fast enough for a ghetto bash, because i know some one is casting something, and again after that followed by another bash. usually after 2 taunts the mob is on me for the rest of the fight, unless there is a problem slowing, then i adjust how often i taunt until it is slowed. after the first 10-20 seconds i pretty much mash it out of habbit from never being twinked and having crappy weapons until lvl 60, and if some one really wants the agro that bad, they can wait the max 6 seconds for my taunt to refresh. i usually only have problems in the first few seconds when a chanter is slowing, which i think is from the relative short cast time of tash which is usually followed by slow, and the fact that tash agros more than malo. the last time i had agro problems with another melee was with a ranger that was pulling AND using the emp ssra 2hs.<br />
all in all, i think weapons do alot more than taunting anyway. i use to get shakey agro when i used CHSD and primal, but after i picked up a GBoS and offhanded the CHSD, still using the method i mentioned above, i close to never lose agro, unless, like i said, there's a problem slowing the mob.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, for pickup groups when you're forced to deal with the criminal element in EQ (IE : teenagers), I guess that's one method for dealing with them civily.  <br />
<br />
I haven't done a pickup group in like 3 years now.  I only do guild groups....so ya, the main objective in any group like that is to embarass the hell out of them and make them sit at their bind point as much as possible.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belwolf</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep i LOVE when it turns without ever hitting the fool who cost me agro lol. timing taunts can be tricky with the fail rate but i rarely have problems since i have two good procing weapons and believe tat 70-80% of the time i'll either get a successful taunt or proc, prived i have a dex buff ofcourse lol.<br />
<br />
i HATE when people tell me either &quot; i have a level blah blah warrior&quot; or &quot; i KNOW my class&quot;. i had a probelm with a shaman the other night KNOWING his class even afterter two tells and finanlly saying it in group&quot; wait on slows&quot;. then ofcourse after i said i don't ride taunt they got the idea i never use it. my warrior has 200 AT but i don't normally drink irl but WANTED a stiff drink BADLY after that. /sigh</div></div><hr />

Up until LDoN, I was a Smasher, hitting taunt at 10 punches a second. This worked quite well for me. But in LDoN, it has not. In fact, it seems worse, as if the game can tell you are bashing your taunt key non stop and ignores your taunt.<br />

It was frustrating to learn how to Kick at the right time when I hit 55, and now, 51 months after I started my warrior, I am finding it frustrating to time my taunts! But it's working out so far. My last 3 dungeon runs, no one died because I couldn't get aggro, they died because they were being dumb YAY!</div></div><hr />

Yes, but for all you mashers out there....you totally lose the kick-ass 180 exorcist roundabout effect of successfully taunting the second a mob turns for someone else. :p  <br />

Oh yeah, we dont got sparkleys we got disco mobs, RAR!<br />

I spammed untill level 20ish, then a friend of mine who was quite the badass warrior educated me.  Now I group with a ranger and shaman mainly, the ranger has archery and is pretty much out of the aggro equation, he is damn good, hits hard and doesnt get hit, pulls like a champ, but still likes to snare things just to see if I am paying attention.  The shaman malos on inc, I hold for the refresh time of his spell; he slows, if I procced it stays, if I didnt, it may or may not go to him.  He notices, the ranger notices and the cleric notices.  The mob looks at him and does the 360 aggro spin, you are the man.  Well timed taunts give you MAX number of taunts per second during not having aggro.  If the timed taunt fails, I have 6 seconds till next one.  My absofreeking awesome shaman (he is, damn fine shaman), is only in danger for 6 seconds as opposed to a possible 12, if slowed he can tank it, if a resist he is sheilded.  Having Taunt on demand in exp situations has saved many a chanter and wizard that I have grouped with.  Come on folks, is all we do, do it the best we can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope stopped mashing long ago. But when I was a level 10 n00b i mashed that thing till my fingers hurt. Now I normally stand between the puller and mob. hit attack when the mob is out a few steps, get insta-aggro from landing first hit, taunt. then just use dps/proc aggro from then on. Never have cheal aggro, and if i lose aggro 1 taunt and the mob is mine again. Works wonders. I find that mashing makes your taunt not up when you really need it, and that fuggers your group.<br />
Example: last night in BoT group. Was a ranger pulling. Everytime he pulled a caster mob it would stop a ways out and just nuke the ranger. The ranger would start shooting those arrows, and he was damn well equipped, lots of aa etc. He had the mob down to around 88% before it stopped casting. I would stand there between him and the mob waiting and once it started coming, 1 bash, sometimes a proc from my GSoT, and 1 taunt, and the mob was mine. And that ranger just ate him alive.</div></div><hr />
