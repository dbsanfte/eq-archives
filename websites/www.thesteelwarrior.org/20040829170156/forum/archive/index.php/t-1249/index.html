<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dall18or</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday Friday the 13th I graduated High school, it wasa beautiful day in vermont raining frm when I woke up to now when I write this post the next day. I got my diploma something I never though would happen, most likely due to EQ. Well Congradulations to everyone who has graduated any form of school. <br />
<br />
The actual days of high school themselves went by so slowly. It is the time in my life passing that is hard to get over. It was gone like summer in Vermont. <br />
<br />
I think of all the people I did not like and the people I did not know. And its sad that I couldnt like some peoplea little more, or get to know some people a little more. But the door to my past is closed. I gotta go into the future. But thats how it is every day for us all. We go foward. The man who walks backward is the man who gets no where in life. <br />
<br />
Love and happiness to everyone. *hugs*<br />

I'm gonna be a Senior next year. My Junior year FLEW by and I'm hoping this summer lasts and next year is one to remember.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congratuations =)  I recently graduated college myself.<br />
<br />
First thing I would do though, make sure to keep in contact with your real friends from high school.  You know who they are.  I regret not keeping in touch with the people who I was friends with in high school.<br />
<br />
Second, do something memorable before you head to college or into the work force, militiary, etc.  You're only 18 for so long, enjoy it while you can.  Just don't be a dumb ass =)<br />
<br />
Enjoy your youth while you can.  Before you know it, its going to run you bye.  I'm still a little freaked out that I won't be going to classes next fall, but will hopefully instead be teaching them.  Growing up can be fun, so enjoy the time as you do it. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hear ya Badaan, man I just got done w/my junior year.  It was gone in like 2 seconds.

No real bills, no kids or anything man to tell ya'll the truth growing up kinda has me freaked lol.  Oh well maybe I'll never do it.  But hey grats on graduation and I wish ya luck in everything to come. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm graduating this year myself, have two exams to write this week and then i'm done. Have had lots of problems through high school, some due to EQ, others something altogether different, but hey shit happens right? <br />
<br />
Like you, i never thought this day was going to come, and now that it's here, I'm overjoyed but at the same time  i almost wish it wasn't. I hated highschool with a passion, and now it's like i almost don't want to leave. Kinda strange when you look at things.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's 4:15am, my head's starting to hurt from all this thinking and i've got an exam to write in 5 hours. Wish me luck :D <br />
