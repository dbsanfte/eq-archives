A walkthrough would be ideal, but anything helps.  Anyone got any good info?  THanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you.  Yeah I've found some stuff on fear and on CT in general, like around 300k HP....  what's his DPS like?  Thanks for the infor on his spells and that he's slowable, that helps.   I know he DTs, what is a touch fear?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fight is fairly straight forward.  Make sure you have jboots or sow in your first slot.  CT's aoe snare will overwrite it, but his Aoe dispell will take it off shortly after.  His fear is easily resistable.  I think I had 219mr buffed but didn't have a bard.  His knockback is what sucks though.  Make sure your tank keeps his back to the wall.  We pulled him to the bunker and killed him there.<br />
<br />
His dps sucks.. I've got a log from a few weeks ago..  Let me see if I can find it.<br />
<br />
Aah.. here it is..<br />
<br />
I didn't MA, but was SA and got attacked when the MA was thrown oor<br />
