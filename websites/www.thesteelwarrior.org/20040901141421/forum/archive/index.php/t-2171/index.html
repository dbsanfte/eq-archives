<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Odd question I suppose, but valid after clicking alot of Magelos here and on other boards: How many of you people 'pad' your Magelos with items that you don't use?<br />
<br />
For instance, everything on my character during real fighting is displayed in my Magelo. I check some people's and they have Bloodfrenzy and Hategiver, but one is bagged and they have a high-HP shield instead, so that their hp's are higher. Yes, I understand about Furious Bash and mob ripostes, but there are other examples as well. Say a high HP range item equipped, but they have an Elemental Bow bagged that has 5 less hitpoints. Someone with a BoW, which you KNOW they use all the time, but instead they stack in the BoC + high HP shield again, just for the HP numbers.<br />
<br />
I am not accusing people, but I do find it hard to believe someone would bag the BoW and actually use a BoC + shield in any situation. Has anyone else noticed anythign like this? Yes, you can always switch out the EP bow for pulling and switch in the range item, but how many folks take the trouble of doing that for 5 hps, every fight. Some things just don't seem likely.<br />
<br />
I check Magelos to get ideas on perhaps the next upgrade I could get, and if a higher-end warrior would use it. That is basically why I ask I suppose. I do expect flames, it always happens, but I just hope some of my fellow warriors will shed some light on the subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sad to say, the weapons in my Magelo are what I actually use. I put a snowchipper in my little toon just for variety. I got hooked up on brellium armor by a fellow guildie blacksmith, but I know I need weapon upgrades. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i luv my ghetto profile :D.<br />
( actually the only thing off in my profile is the charm, i only have the 5AC one, not the 25AC one )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll be happy when Magelo fixes the Intricate Wooden Figurines. It makes everyone's profile look padded, well except those that actually have that many flags heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Most do it for eqrankings i'd wager, personally I could care less. I keep mine up to date so I can get a relative idea on upgrades and their impact on my characters, tho i'd like if they'd allow stages for the wooden figurine. Throws it off too much :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't added my wooden figurine either. I only have 2 flags so I figure it would look like I padded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No I don't add things I don't have UNLESS I'm planning on getting it VERY soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just dont add thing's I don't have ... thats what the alternative profiles are for.<br />
<br />
As for the high hitpoint 1hd'er + high AC and HP shield thing I'd say EQ Rankings is a big incentive for players to list themselves like that, but considering they probably do use that combination when raid tanking which is when stats are most important it may not be representative of how they are normally equiped, but it does reflect their gear when performing their core competency - Tanking big stuff.<br />
<br />
and yeah, theres a place in magelo to record flags so would be great if they could use this to fix that charm.<br />
<br />
Food and drink is another way people can buff up their stats, to me I don't see food and drink as being part of your gear, to me they are more like buffs but then other people may treat this differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mine is as I usally XP. Not much point in tracking my gear someplace handy if its not accurate. I am 1 step  (Kedge Robe) from RB for my rogue, but wont update Magelo until I get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dumptimax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Look for the authentic magelo profile symbol on peoples profiles, its the only way to know they are authentic, and setup in a manner as to which the person was just using their gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only thing that annoys me has already been stated...that goddamned charm everyone who beat a fuckin PoJ trial has in the magelo giving them ~190 hp and 40 modded AC.<br />
<br />
Mine isn't really padded, per se.  I just have the gear I use to tank shit with in there.  If you caught me running around on CT, you'd probably go &quot;Wtf, champs BP?  Dude is wearing freaking banded&quot;  Ya, that's because i have my fungi on around 80% of the time, and you're gonna have to pry it outta my cold dead hands.  I still swap BP's for big fights where the regen isn't gonna matter, but since the majority of my time is spent XP'ing these days, 25 from replenishment, 15 from the Fungi, and 10 standing regen is a big deal when you're fighting trash that hits you maybe once every few seconds tops.  I don't really consider that padding tho...i've just got a lot of gear that's being used for a lot of different situations...this is the best combo of that gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm not putting the charm in my magelo until I get at least half of the flags done. When the charm becomes as much right as it is wrong, I figure it'd be okay to add it. Still short a flag or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'll be happy when Magelo fixes the Intricate Wooden Figurines. It makes everyone's profile look padded, well except those that actually have that many flags heh.<br />
<br />
That's what it is. I kept looking at my shaman's profile and couldnt figure out why his hps and AC were off. Doh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I swap crap around a lot. My Magelo is my general MT set up. But I use 2H just as much really. Or swap in Primal, or rune 1HB, or any variety of things. Since I use all those different set ups pretty regularly, I'm gonna put my best looking one in Magelo=P Gonna grab a Charm of Defense at some point. It'll only get used like half the time or less since I hafta shoot arrows, but that's what's gonna go on my profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You think Id want to cheat in the crap I wear not even.<br />
<br />
Edit: after looking at that again it looks wrong. What I mean is look at the crap in there if I didnt wear it I wouldnt list it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">80% of the time on raids I actually do have Bloodfrenzy + shield equipped.<br />
<br />
Only time I really swap it out is 1) BF + BoC for the first 60-90 seconds of aggro on a boss that I tank first, or 2) 2hs for DPS when Im not in the tank line up.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, I have BF+ shield equipped and am tank mezzing or off-taunting adds or shielding healers/debuffers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have the platinium sword figurine as a charm, AND the pop charm... I use the intricated one (40hp on it with my flags), but the 20hp one is on magelo :p.<br />
<br />
Oh, And my magelo is almost a false one. Sometimes I don't equip my anizok maximising device and I admit I don't always have dwarven beer on me :eek:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah this is a bit OT, but why the heck does like everyone in raiding guilds have Shainai's Nightie/Shade Silk Robe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">that's just your profile :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My profile is my non-MT exp profile as I'm a good 2k hps behind our MT's.  I have DW listed as an alt profile which I use when I RT or Mezz Tank adds.<br />
<br />
Our MT does use his BF + Aegis to tank on occasion and has his BoW bagged.  So, guess it depends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That charm thing with magelo is really dumb.  They need to fix that.  I only have the 10AC one, so I don't even list mine.  I really don't bother making my profile public anymore, too lazy and I really don't care.  My guildies, and anyone visiting our guild website, can see it.  (its a requirement for the officers to see it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Magelo states what you'll usually see me with. I have a higher hp 2hander in my bag, I don't use it to pad.<br />
<br />
At least the charm for me is ~almost~ accurate! 9/10 flags :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't list my charm, either.  Whoop de do... a whole 2 flags.  Otherwise, my profile is pretty accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I use magelo premium service so as long as I update evefry once in awhile the items lited in magelo directly match what I am using. (although I had the woodin charm in my chram slot to have something there I have no flags so it was statless but magelo listed it at max stats so I took it out :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yep, Warriors often arrange their Magelo's for bragging rights. If every Warrior did so for maximum HP's you would have a way to compare them - a standard if you will.<br />
<br />
In some guilds a Warrior's opprotunity to MT is often based on max HP (and AAExp and aggro weapons) with people arguing that an extra 100 HP's might just mean the MT survives a melee round.<br />
<br />
But the truth is a lot more complicated than that. For any given mob you might have to get a particular resist to 500. So, comparing HP's without taking into account resists is pretty silly.<br />
<br />
A mob might stun heavily so Stalwart Endurance is suddenly a must have.<br />
<br />
And trumping everything in the end is ability and experiance with the mob you are facing.<br />
<br />
Still, maximum HP's is one way to do a quick and dirty ranking of  Warriors. While people believe a Warrior with 10000HP &gt; than one with a mere 9900, we'll keep answering questions about our max HP's as if it were the Holy Grail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Mine lags.  My actual equipment is better than my Magelo for about 2 weeks or so before I add info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have a feeling that one of these days Magelo will disable my account for all the Alternate profiles I make. I delete a few every now and then just to clean it up, but I think I have 5 now, and at most I had 9 on Donnel's profile.<br />
<br />
It really is the way to go for tracking what equipment changes will do for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't have my charm in Intricate Wooden Figurine because that would pad my hp.  All the items I have listed in there are what I wear.  My guild keeps a very up-to-date listing of our warriors and their AAs, AA abilities, unbuffed and raid buffed hp and ac.  So it's important that I don't inflate my hp :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Apocaly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My magelo is 100% homegrown genuine gear I use everyday.  I will swap weapons around depending on my duties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My magelo is my tanking set up, the only time I use the SoD is for exp grind because 576 dmg crit procs are the own.  Im only missing the flag for time so my charm is 10 hps and a few odd AC higher.  When I finally get my damn BoW (RZ is a stingy bastard), it is what I will be using full time so I'll put it on as such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I've noticed this a lot and there are things I am ok with and things that are just cheesy.<br />
<br />
Mine has one semi innacuracy, which is the stat food I use and that is merely because I accidentally ate them all :\<br />
<br />
You see a lot of the shield business though and I've seen some other sketchy things such as padding out AC/ATK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I wonder how many people know that they can adjust the % of their charms total stats in their profiles?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I use auto update so my magelo shows what i had on when logged last, not that anyone care since i'm level 31 but :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I've been guilty of screwing around with my megalo a little.  For example, on my old warrior, I show a shield, which I did use a fair amount, but the warmaster axe or primal was equipped more.  And on my test server profile, I have the wrath's edge equipped in megalo, even though when I'm tanking I usually offhand an SoD.  I do use the wrath's edge or GSoT on raids where I'm not MT (almost all of them).<br />
<br />
That charm is just too far off though.  Which is why my profile shows the charm of the emerald warrior.  I actually use the IWF, but the EW charm is closer to my actual stats (3 flags).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Bump to let people know the charms are now fixed. There is a percentage field in the update charactor area where you can manually scale it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Tricsun-Drinal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">You can now determine the amount that the charm gives in magelo.  Check the update character link on the character you want to change, there's a new field Charm bonus.  There's 10 total flags that get you AAs/charm upgrades (i think) so just put in what percent of the flags you have done.  I've got mine at 50% since i've got 5 charm flags, and my HPs are only 6 off now.</div></div><hr />
