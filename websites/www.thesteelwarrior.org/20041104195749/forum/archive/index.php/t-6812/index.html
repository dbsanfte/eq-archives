<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jaboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello folks,<br />
<br />
  I am about to buy my first 40hp aug and can't decide what armor to put it on.  I would think I wanna put it on the armor I am least expecting to upgrade.  My warrior just needs MM, Bert and RD from being Solro-zone enabled and then just RZ to go to Elementals.  Dunno what would easily be upgraded once I can get into those zones.  What order would yall put these in from [least likely to upgrade to very likely to upgrade]?  Here's my magelo and links to the 5 armor the 40hp aug can be put in :<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would probably put it on the chestplate first.  Chances are, you'll be more likely to upgrade the helmet (with Raex) before you upgrade the BP, unless you're farming Luclin content a lot and planning to claim a Seru/VT bp.  Rathe/Time BPs are probably much further down the road than a Raex's helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You will definitely upgrade the hat before your bp unless you're farmin Seru or Aten.  If you're thinkin that kizrak's bp is going to last you until time, which it very well may, it's a good place to put that augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would aug in this order:<br />
<br />
1.  BP<br />
2.  Legs<br />
3.  Helm<br />
<br />
Only reason i would aug helm last out of these three is that its droppable. You can wait to invest any points in that one until you see if an upgrade is coming your way in a timely fashion. If an upgrade seems imminent you might be able to hold off and aug the upgrade, then sell the HoRZ without losing the 1150 points. <br />
<br />
Also, just my opinion, but i would not spend the 1150 pts. on 40hp for the arms or boots. Seems very likely you can get better before spending the points on those 2 slots.<br />
<br />
A lot of this depends on how much LDoN you do also. If you do a ton of LDoN, then maybe it doesn't matter so much what order you aug in. <br />
<br />
p.s. Contrary to my advice to you, I happened to 40hp aug my HoRZ first because it was the only piece of armor i had that i felt was worth augging with 40hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am also going to go with the above poster<br />
BP<br />
Legs<br />
Helm<br />
<br />
I wouldn't aug the boots.   <br />
I wouldn't do the arms either as the ldon ones are better then the ornate IMO.  Same AC, same stamina, some charisma and better resist ( http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=44302 )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only do the BP and legs.  Helm, arm, boot, and bracer molds are relatively common once you hit the EP.  Legs you will only see from the elemental gods and BP not until Time.  Save up the points and get the 40hp augs once you've gotten something a little more permanent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">bp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>renasu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm confused.  Is this the 40hp aug from ldon merchant?  I thought these could only go into ldon bought armor with type 2 slot?  No?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No.  There are Type 7 and 8 40hp augments that can go in BP, Legs, Boots, Arms, and Helm slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well having Ornate BP, going to  Seru/AHR is a marginal upgrade.<br />
Put the 40hp on the BP.<br />
<br />
DO NOT WASTE 40HP on the legs (yet).<br />
<br />
Go to Barindu &amp; Do the VXED Trials (with a tracker)<br />
Check for &quot;Chavoor the Trickster&quot; (he's on the right side)<br />
Take 2 healers with you (Drood/Cleric prefered)<br />
Kill him to get : ac40 hp110 legs &amp; ac13 hp105 earring.<br />
Augment these legs with  40hp<br />
<br />
Augment with 10ac your mask.<br />
<br />
For the rest ....<br />
Keep saving up points of augmenting EP gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would think:<br />
<br />
BP<br />
Greaves<br />
Helmet<br />
Boots<br />
<br />
and I am still debating myself on whether to actually buy a 40HP aug for those arms. Basically I have the same gear as you and for me now the arms are one of my worst pieces and just seems like a waste to put one on the ornate arms. I am trying to find a upgrade myself before putting a 40HP aug in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you're still trying to break into the EPs, you're a long ways off from getting elemental plate legs are the only source will be Fennin Ro.  Should be quite safe to aug your current legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Breastplate first since that is probably the last thing you will upgrade in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd augment your BP and leggings and helm, in that order. But first, I'd augment your mask and back with 10ac, and possibly your shoulders as well. 5ac augment your belt and neck. For the points, ac augments DEFINITELY win out over hp augments, and the 10ac augments win out over hp ones regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with most everyone here.<br />
<br />
1) Aug the BP.  You probably won't see a better one in a while.<br />
<br />
2) Aug the greaves.  See #1.<br />
<br />
3) Aug the Helm.  This helm is very close to an EP one AC wise.  About 60 less HPs I think though.  Still would be one of the last items I would look to upgrade.<br />
<br />
4) Boots and Arms.  Up to you.  If you are an LDoN whore like me, throw 40 hp augs on these.  Can't hurt.<br />
<br />
Also, don't overlook placing the 10 ac augs on neck, waist, shoulder, back, and face items.<br />
<br />
10ac augs and 40 hp augs are the augs most tanks go for.  I'm more of an HP warrior atm, but I am realizing the value of added AC.  My 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">DOZAN IS TEH WIN! I taught him everything he knows. True story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd advise against augmenting the pants. As was mentioned, you can easily farm 110hp greaves in Vxed with a solid group (~15 minute respawn), which would be a much better choice for the augment.  40hp on the BP, then AC augments for non-visible slots. Maybe horde some DKP for a BoWar and save points to slap anger3 on that when the time comes. Unless you do hundreds of LDoNs and have the points to toss around, in which case, sure - recklessly augment the hell out of everything!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The plate helm was highly contested with my previous guild just due to the numbers - clerics / sk / pal / other warriors.  If you're a dkp guild, it might be awhile til you see a Raex helm depending on what you have saved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you don't do VT or Seru, BP first for sure. Next upgrade to your BP is from Rathe. Which is a very rare drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Even if they do VT/Seru the upgrade is marginal.<br />
And points/attribution/reward would be better spend elsewhere.<br />
<br />
1) BP<br />
2) Change &amp; Augment legs<br />
3) Add 10ac to your good 10ac able items.<br />
4) Save up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually I think the Burnished Antique Greaves are only a marginal upgrade.. 40 ac 110 hp versus 45 ac 90hp with a clickie stamina buff you can cast on others.  Better stats and saves  on Burnished but not that huge.  5 raw ac on the ornate are worth the 20hp on the Burnished in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Personally I auged my Kizrik greaves and hope to get a Seru or AHR bp.  I didnt aug my Helmet of Rallos Zek, which worked out great because I got a Raex shortly thereafter.</div></div><hr />
