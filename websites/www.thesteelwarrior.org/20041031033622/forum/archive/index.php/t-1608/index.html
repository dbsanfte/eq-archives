<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all you Blade of Carnage users. I have had my BoC for about a year and a half now, and I am certain Sony has nerfed the proc rate on it. Not that it was ever fabulous as a proc weapon to begin with, but i used to be able to rely on it to proc *at least* once a fight. Lately ( as in within the last month or two ) i have noticed the proc rate to have all but disappeared on it.<br />
Anyone else notice this change or I am just seeing things?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't used my BoC-wielding warrior in a few months but I kinda doubt they would stealth-nerf something like this...can't see any reason to anyway.  Would have to parse it to tell for sure.  Of course you would need an old parse to compare it to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Noticed a big dropoff in offhand proc rates for all weapons after a patch a month or so ago.  Pretty sure they &quot;fixed&quot; a &quot;bug&quot; that was making offhand weapons proc &quot;too much&quot;.  My guess is that either the primary hand proc rate or the highest modified proc rate (i.e. bloodfrenzy, etc.) was being used for all weapons. <br />
<br />
Note, that is ONLY A GUESS, and is based on purely empirical observation...  I noticed that an offhand primal warsword was now procing once every few mobs, instead of several times per fight, but I don't have old logs saved to go back and parse to &quot;quantify&quot; the (presumed) change.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i seem to be getting the same proc rate i always have with my BoC ... and well, the thing likes to proc for me ...<br />
<br />
Maybe you guys just got broken BoCs.  Though, sometimes ill have a bad streak, but that happens no matter what weapon you have.<br />
<br />
maybe you just had a bad day for RNG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The thing is, I have gone from 2-5 procs on average a fight to 0-1. This is extremely consistent using BoT tower mobs as a basis for the proc rate.<br />
<br />
The sword *used* to proc fairly consistently for me as well. This has just been in the last month or maybe 2 months max. I know of the &quot;bad luck&quot; you are talking about. But that is usually just a mob or two, then you will see it proc 10 times. I literally do not see it proc like that at all anymore. I have gone entire Burrower Parasite melees ( it is a long fight as he has a buttload of HP's ) without a single proc.<br />
<br />
is there a *magic* number for dexterity stats that weapons will proc more at? I am wondering if some minor equipment adjustments lately to increase Hit points over dexterity could actually be the reason I have noticed this difference. Dex loss was minimal, like around 10-12 overall. Could 12 dex really make that much of a difference? If so I might forgoe the extra HP i gained in the gear change to return to the proc rate I used to have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">did you accidentally turn off your spell messages, like, all of em. that would cause you to not see procs anymore.<br />
<br />
seems to me your just having bad luck bro, i went out and tested it after i read your post, and well, on Coldain Wolfmasterguys in GD (im farmin faction atm, damn dain head) i proced at least once a fight, sometimes as many as 5 times, and well, they drop in like 45 seconds or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My BoC procs like 4-5 times a fight in BoT with minimal dex buffs.  Usually doesn't proc until I have aggro though :p <br />
<br />
I find that my GSoT generates a lot more aggro for some reason...<br />

<br />
On the flipside, primal and my other weaps procing like doomsday =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't have one myself, but was grouped with a BoC-wielding warrior in HoH the other day.  Procced for him at least 2-3 times a fight in his primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Starting to wonder if it could just be what I am fighting. We did the PoI Dragon last night in a guild raid and I was MT for the raid. Along the way following the Gnome we killed hundreds of Mechs and I was procing fine on those.<br />
I think it is just what I am fighting, I spend alot of time in BoT fighting in the Courtyard and in the Towers. Mobs there might have more of a resistance check versus procs. I know BoC is unresistable, but there may be something in the game that procs check against before going off. I dunno, maybe in the end it has just been bad luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's just streaky RNG. I have nights where the thing procs like mad and others where it barely does at all. All comes down to the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What kind of mobs you're fighting has nothing to do with how often you proc.  ^^ $50 says Kellaen is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>RacketWarborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Call me crazy or dumb, but my Bloodfrenzy seems to be procing an obscenely noticable ammount less. Wheras before I'd get 2-4 procs per average exp mob, now I feel slightly lucky to get 2, with an average of 1 proc per mob. *IF* they did do a nerf to proc rates on the best few warrior aggro mobs pre-BoW I think they are moving even further from fixing melee classes and warrior aggro in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;Seems to&quot;. &quot;Feels like.&quot; Come on people, this has been brought up before, by people just seeing their weapons having bad proc streaks, and not providing any solid evidence, which in this case would be simple parsing.</div></div><hr />

they nerfed jboots speed too <br />
