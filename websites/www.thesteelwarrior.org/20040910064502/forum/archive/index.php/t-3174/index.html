<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this would make up for the lack of spells, proper agro and make soloing sort of possible. yes we would have kick ass DPS, but it would still not make us any better then any of the other class.<br />
<br />
It would be the Ultimate Class Defining move for warriors.<br />
<br />
Code it so you get partial benifits in group and full when solo or in raid. <br />
Soloing with a BoW and Sews would still not make you able to solo anywhere near as good as casters or other melee, but would make soloing possible.<br />
<br />
Grouping, partial DW 2hander DMG, this would keep warriors from dominating in the DPS and taking spots from other melee class. it would give us some extra dps but not enough to dump other classes.<br />
<br />
Raiding, full DW 2hander DMG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">uh I think that would put us above all other non-caster DPS classes..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah but if let say we get 1/2 dmg from a 2hander in the secondary slot while grouped. we would do more dmg then other melee classes, but they would still have spells that benifited the group and would still be needed.<br />
<br />
tweak it just right so the dmg we do duel wielding 2handers equals the benifites that Hybrids get with spells.<br />
<br />
soloing we still wouldnt be able to solo half of what hybrids can even with full DW dmg of 2hand weapons, but we could at least solo half way decently.<br />
<br />
and on raids it would give us the agro we need, and unless a guild went and got 30 warriors all duel wielding bow/sews it wouldnt screw the ballance up that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why don't they just fix duel wield instead?  Maybe by inceasing the damage modifier on the primary weapon, or adding one for the offhand weapon, or by increasing the damage ratio of one hand weapons in general?<br />
<br />
It seems to me that if duel wield isn't working as it should, and I tend to agree that it isn't, it makes more sense to fix it rather than allowing something which doesn't make a lot of sense, duel wielding weapons not intended to be duel wielded to begin it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd love to see a 2hander + shield combo, especially if they actually implement the shield blocking/mitigation they've been huffing and puffing about for the last 4+ months.<br />
<br />
It was a part of an old text based game I used to play way back, Gemstone III.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i mentioned that aakla prob right before we moved here from EZ Board and I still believe to this day it should be a valid choice for warriors only :D <br />
<br />
i still say at least be able to wield a 2 hander + shield should be an option. now...<br />
<br />
and to Dovan; I first used that combo ( and to this day too ) with my barbaran in Diablo2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I remember this same thread from a few weeks ago but it never hurts to keep ideas fresh in everyone's mind.  Personally though I DW 2 handers is a great idea....but it will never happen.  2 hander and sheild sounds a bit more reasonable of an option however, especially &quot;historically accurate&quot;.  If that doesn't pan out how about increasing AC bonus on 2 handers to match the AC on sheilds...even bump up the damage bonus just as a little extra perk for the big dumb lunks aka warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't want to dual weild two handers. Two handed weapons require two hands. <br />
<br />
If they want to up DW dps, I'm fine with that, though it's hard to see warriors really need much of a dps boost, especially at the high end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd rather see a big bonus if you use a 1 handed weapon in primary and a shield in secondary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it has never made sense to me that Knights should out damage a Warrior who duel wields.  We duel wield these days just to generate aggro, more than anything.  It seems like a double whammy that we also drop our DPS to do it.  Duel wield should be doing at least a similar amount of damage to 2hand weapons.  After all, one of the reasons Knights weren't allowed duel wield to begin with was as an advantage to Warriors in the DPS department to counter balance their spells.  Duel wield is no longer that counter balance.   So being restricted from using duel wield is a benefit to Knights, not a disadvantage, as originally intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Assuming they don't re-scale damage bonus there will be no one class in EQ that can out-damage a warrior d-wielding 2-handers over the course of a fight. Come on, BoW + Vanazir's... Really now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">didn' they some kind of weird monk damage nerf after pop was relesed. something about their barefist being 21/19  at 65 or somesuch. and it was way to powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I could see 2hander plus a shield.  I think DW dps just needs to be boosted.  What would be the point of 1handers at all if you can have 2 2h?  Increase duel wield dps to close to 2handers, and make shields usable with 2handers.  So the dps between the two choices is the same, but if you DW you can get duel procing weapons, or go 2h and get a shield (preferably with block on it).  Seems good to me, both choices equal but different.  I'd probably make it so that offhand could not be riposted (can be parried / blocked / dodged still, just not riposted).  So while you would get more ripostes with duel wield due to the speed of the primary hand over the speed of a 2hander, it wouldn't be so large that duel wield would suffer too much.<br />
<br />
edit: at minimum, I'd like 2h bash, though I doubt SOE would even go that far heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Would the changes to DW you are proposing apply to ONLY warriors?  If not it would significantly increase the dps of monks, rogues, rangers, and bards . . . . none of which really need a dps increase 'cept mabye bards but they have so many other options for adding dps.<br />
<br />
I think out all of those posted, the idea of unrepostable offhand is the best, this would solve the issue of DW having such a significant penalty in high end PoP for those warriors unfortunate enough not to get their hands on a BoW.  I also LOVE the idea of a 2hander + shield, but limited to warriors only, otherwise it would do nothing about leveling the playing field between warriors and knights.  I've played on several MUDs where only warriors were allowed the ability to wield a two handed weapon with a shield strapped to their offhand arm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Although an interesting idea, they would need to adjust all 2H weapons to make it sane.<br />
<br />
I think a better idea would just make Warriors (and Monk?!) have different DB calculations.  Keep DB calculations the same level for all Hybrids but depending on what hand you place it in on a Warrior you get an altered (hopefully better than Hybrid) DB number.  It could be as stupifily simple as a +5 DB on the primary hand, +3 on the secondary.<br />
<br />
BTW this would also play into the shield problem.  The 1H weapon DB in a &quot;1H + Shield&quot; configuration would be different than a the Dual Wield configuration.</div></div><hr />

given the agro you would get from that a wizard with ele pants destroys you in dps :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dual wielding is functionally harder, thus it should have more advantages, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Adding the ability for a warrior to off-hand equip a 2 hander woulden't be a bad thing,  allow 1 1 hander and 1 2 hander,  so you could have BoW and EoE off-hand or hammer from quarm mainhand and BoW off-hand,  woulden't overbalance TOO much,  and would generate enough aggro to help warriors imo</div></div><hr />
