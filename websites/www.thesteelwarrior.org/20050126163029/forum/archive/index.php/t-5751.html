<br />
I did notice that it's not a 2.0/65 stun, so until we hear more, I'm guessing it would be a similar situation as the CHoS in terms of the &quot;Immune&quot; - not that agro would suffer, but you wouldn't get the 2.0 seconds of stun, which is the attractive part of the weapon.<br />
<br />
Not too sure how quickly I'd spend plat on this to switch out my SoBS, but it certainly seems on par with it in terms of agro potential.  It might find a home in my bag if I happened across it though, depending on the graphic :)<br />
<br />
One more quick note - it seems to have a -100 resist on Lucy, compared to the SoBS 0 resist.</div></div><hr />

Edit: does &quot;look&quot; kinda wierd tho for my tastes.</div></div><hr />

The real bonus this weapon has over a SotB is the +END as well as the -100 resist check on the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...warrior-related stats are lower on it compared to the SotB (as shown below):<br />

Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM<br />
Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY<br />
Skill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 19<br />
DMG: 12 Dmg Bonus: 13<br />
DEX: +4 STA: +8 AGI: +4 HP: +55 MANA: +45<br />
SV DISEASE: +5 SV COLD: +5<br />
Recommended level of 56.<br />
Effect: Planar Strike (Combat)<br />
WT: 2.5 Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD BRD ROG<br />
Race: ALL<br />
Slot 1, Type 4<br />
<br />
If STA isn't maxed yet, SotB can give you an extra 50 or so HP's, plus a 75 DD proc as opposed to 30 DD, and the proc can stun up to level 65, which the RSHS does not. The 2-second stun is nice, though, but it wouldn't make any difference against unstunnable mobs, or against mobs over level 55; the stun aggro is probably the same as for the SotB. The END is nice, but as I've yet to run out of END where another 40 would make a difference, it's not that important to me.<br />
<br />
It has a lower level rec, so I tend to think (and agree that) it's designed for lower level characters, kind of the pre-Droga taunt weapon, if you will. I might buy it if I didn't own the SotB and it was markedly cheaper than the Droga weapon, but I wouldn't &quot;upgrade&quot; to it from an SotB, not as a warrior.</div></div><hr />
