<br />
<br />
<br />
One test had offhand proc every 77seconds without ambdex and 47 seonds (average) with.<br />
<br />
Antoerh guys says that 1H and 2H weapons proc at the same rate.<br />
<br />
Another say that Proc are only checked on hits or swings or something, but of course proc rate is not dependant upon haste.<br />
<br />
We all know that main hand swings 66percnet and offhand 33percent.<br />
<br />
Its accepcted that most weapons proc one time every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am wondering when you duel weild a 1H weapon does it proc less because you are swinging (and thus hitting less), as compared to a 2Hder or as compare to a the same 1H, but with say a shield in offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2h handers have a bonus so they proc more often.<br />
<br />
And no, mainhand does not necessarily swing 66% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand that because of rng everything in this game is on a bell curve. But long term average is supposedly 66percnet in main hand swing and 33percent in off hand.<br />
<br />
No one seems to have a clear answer here. <br />
<br />
I use SBoD(no proc) and SotB(proc).<br />
<br />
If I put SotB in main hand and SBoD in offhand do I proc 66percent of what a CHoSmain and SoTBoff combo does, or not... <br />
<br />
In other words the mean time to proc on the Chosmain and SoTBoff is 20 seconds, whereas with my setup SBoDoff and SoTBmain my mean time to proc is 30seconds<br />
<br />
Is that true or not.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt a shield or no weapon in the offhand would affect proc rates in the primary hand. you won't be swinging any less with your primary hand if you wield an offhander. heavy parsing might be worth it, but to me, it sounds like one of the countless theories in EQ that almost makes sense but isn't true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">keep in mind, with 285 dex, some of the parses had main had proc raid at about 2.75 a minute, whereas dex didnt affect off hand.  point 8.<br />
<br />
One thing to consider though as you continue to want to keep your cool looking SBoD.  You shouldnt care about mean time to proc to hold agro.  You should care about getting enough agro so that the lord jesus christ almighty couldnt get agro off you if he decided to drop a wiz nuke.<br />
<br />
Translation.  Who cares if its 20 seconds mean time vs 30 seconds mean time to proc, getting as much agro as you can is your ROLE as a warrior.  Then its your ROLE to take the damage and let the healer heal you.  If you are giving up 10 percent agro to get 10 percent more DPS, you are forgetting that role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...  <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't remember seeing any parses that show dex doesn't affect off-hand procs.  When I'm fighting it certainly seems like I proc both my hands a lot more when my dex is buffed than without.  <br />
<br />
Am I imagining that?  Can someone point out a good parse showing dex's affect on off-hand procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can get a idea here:<br />

<br />
But he did not use duel wield from what I can see. Clearly one handers proc at the same rate as two handers though.... <br />
<br />
Well this guy, also not comparine duel wield to single wield did come up with 77seconds mean time to proc in offhand without abidextarity and 47 seconds mean time to proc in offhand with abidextarity.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2813&amp;highlight=offhand+proc<br />
<br />
<br />
Given the &quot;most weapons proc 2 times a minute&quot; we would expect a mean time to proc of 20 seconds (is that right lol) on a two handers or a one hander alone. If the offhand is like 47 seconds at best then clearly offhand does not proc as much as main hand .....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything in this game is a trade off, I'd like to have a weapon that does the best dps and has the best agro and looks the best, well thats not happening so I would like to know how much I lose by going with the DPS and Looks of the SBoD in offhand, are my procs cut in 1/2 or are they cut by 1/3?..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you want people to do your searches for you.  Sheesh, first post in the library.<br />
<br />
And please, stop talking about how your weapon looks.  Im sure looking fly for the ladies is important to you, but if you cant hold agro and get your group killed, your corpse is only going to look appealing to the necromancer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I read that, as you can see one of the links I have in the post above is from that post. And I read the others links as well.<br />
<br />
And YOUR conclusion from reading that data as to the effect on total procs when haveing a non procing offhand vs. a procing offhand is.......? (and why)........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand youre concerned about looks and all Sam, but the SBoD is not doing you any good if youre actually concerned about holding agro and proc rates. Its almost hyprocrital in a way. You want the best agro you can get so your wizzies do the dps but youre reluctance to go with a better agro weapon based purely on looks will get you no where. Just forget about the SBoD and get another weapon with a proc on it, you will be much better off. Besides if you are controlling all the toons in your group just who exactly are you trying to impress with a SBoD.<br />
<br />
Personally the SBoD is unique but the graphic is just gawdy. In other words I thinks its kind of ugly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I'm missing something here... but why not do some LDoN adventures, get your 1150 points and spend it on a proc for that 'cool looking' SBoD?  Now, you have a proc, heck go with Anger3 or the Ykesha proc and you now have your straight melee dps plus aggro or dmg increasing proc.<br />
<br />
Will it now be better than a CHoS?  Sure.  But, if you augment that CHoS with another aggro or DPS proc, then it becomes better again, but you lose the 'cool' factor.<br />
<br />
Then again, if ya want some more DPS, I believe there is a sword for 1150 points or something like that, which is a 14/19 or thereabouts, with three slots.  If I remember right, you can make it a 16/19 AND add a proc, plus a single stat item.  Dunno if it looks cool or not, but it would edge out the SBoD in the other departments.<br />
<br />
If he wants his warrior to do DPS, then let him go for it.  It's not as if he's complaining that warriors should be more like rogues, he just wants a warrior that emulates a rogue.  Me, I want warriors to be the king of tanking (that'd have to include keeping aggro) so I'm going the double proc route on my CHoS and SotB.  That's the beauty of this game, you have some (limited) variance within each character class...  Heck, my cleric got critical strikes on spells before completing critical heals!!  Why?  Cuz I really miss my wizzie  ;)<br />
<br />
As for procs, sorry, I have no data nor would I give my impression of how often stuff procs (would be meaningless w/o numbers to back it up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have not jumped into LDoN because the warrior is still level 62. Right now I am PLing him on Forboding Guardians (level 65 mobs in PoN with fast repop time) - none of my toons are in a group, warrior gets mob to 70 percent, wizards nuke it down, warrior gets all the exp (about 2.5 percent of a level per kill) - once warrior is 65 with aoe taunt then he's ready for prime time. <br />
<br />
Well sure I will move up there is a BoC for sale (159K high but not really impossible for me) on my server, and as you say the LDoN weapons.... <br />
<br />
Also that knockback on the CHoS and to a lesser extent on the GSoT is really a pain to deal with..... <br />
<br />
Well I have to look at my toons lol..... plus this is a pvp server image is important also.... I do happen to be one of the better smack talkers on the server<br />
<br />
Enemy01 I have allowed yur deeds to go unpunished long enough! Make me yur master or PAY ME WITH PAIN!<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
I sure hope da NOOTZ don't force me to smack dem along side da head with my SPILT BLADE OF DESTRUCTION!<br />
<br />
Ya, that SPLIT BLADE OF DESTRUCTION sure gotta hurt but not as much as MANABURN X 4 LOLOLOL......<br />
<br />

I gots a 100 of them lol..... I love this game heh....</div></div><hr />
