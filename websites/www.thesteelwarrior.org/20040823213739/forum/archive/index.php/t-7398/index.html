<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Romul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks,<br />
<br />
I wanted to give you all an update on what we are planning for the coming weeks as we work on some persistent in-game issues. We know that many of you are concerned with the current state of the game and we feel confident that the changes we have planned will help to alleviate many of your concerns. <br />
<br />
First on our plate, and number one on your list of concerns, is collision in EverQuest. We are working hard to fix the current problems with collision and have many fixes currently on Test. We will most likely be pushing these collision fixes to the Live servers tomorrow, June 3rd at 3AM PDT. Many of the current issues appear to be resolved with this latest push and our programmers are still working hard to track down and fix any remaining issues. For those of you on Test, thanks very much for your help in getting these issues to Grumbak.<br />
<br />
We are also scheduling out many other fixes, with the first round going to the Test server this week, and subsequent rounds as the changes are made. Currently planned to hit Test this week are the following proposed changes;<br />
<br />
- Add a quest to allow the exchange of Gates of Discord spells.<br />
- Correct an issue with the berserker epic quest that left some berserkers unable to complete the quest.<br />
- Improve the Eagle Eye spell series.<br />
- Increase the spawn rate of the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.<br />
- Change berserker snare to have a set duration.<br />
- Correct the pathing in Txevu.<br />
<br />
Please remember that this is only the first round of planned changes and there are many more to come. As more changes are rolled out to the Test server, I will post them. Please feel free to discuss these changes on the EQ forums at eqforums.station.sony.com.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of your feedback this past week. You have shown, once again, what a strong community EQ has, thank you for being an active part of it!<br />

They need to stop &quot;pushing&quot; results to a fuckin date and fix it THEN get it to Live. And what about thanks to the Live players cuz it seems like we are the second phase of &quot;Test&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">- Improve the Eagle Eye spell series.<br />
<br />
Man, what a relief! I was worried that rangers weren't getting pinholed into the archery roll enough! <br />
 :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
- Increase the spawn rate of the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.<br />
<br />
Ok this most people will be huzzah about.  SEoC drops are spotty at best. I've heard of 2 dropping in an hour and then none dropping for 5 weeks.</div></div><hr />

----------------------&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
Collision fixes collide with servers!&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
Collision&lt;br&gt;<br />
----------------------&lt;br&gt;<br />
- When you are summoned by NPCs or players smaller than you, the collision system will now scan a limited area near the destination to find a place to put you so that you will not be stuck in the terrain.&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
- A problem related to collision data being out of sync on the client and server has been corrected and should solve the problems many of you have been seeing with NPCs being pushed into walls.&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
- The sunken NPC and character problem has been much improved. You will still find the occasional NPC at a spawn point that is sunk or elevated slightly, but the NPC should move normally once engaged.&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
Cabilis Quests&lt;br&gt;<br />
----------------------&lt;br&gt;<br />
- The Battle plans from Dalnir should be a little easier to obtain.&lt;br&gt;<br />
- The loyal follower in Dreadlands should no longer be a merchant with an empty inventory.&lt;br&gt;<br />
- The traitor necromancers seek should be a little easier to find.&lt;br&gt;<br />
- Wyzith's belongings should now combine correctly.&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
