<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been reading a lot of posts here and there and also suggestions and comments and rants from a lot of folks.<br />
<br />
my 2cp is this.<br />
<br />
Agro should not be the main issue here.  It’s our ability to tank.  Granted agro is a part of our ability to tank and we do lack in our ability to keep agro, but that is something the players can control.  What our issues are is the lack of our ability to tank above what the knights can.  From my observance, I do have to admit that in most cases, the casual players I see and meet the knights do not have as much hp/ac as the warriors do, just for the fact that most casual knights do not put as much emphasis on hp/ac as others do.  The problem occurs on higher end as item stats get blurred.  This is something we cannot control.  <br />
<br />
So what can the devs do about this?  <br />
Either nerf the knights’ mitigation table, or increase our mitigation ability.<br />
<br />
Either way something’s going to have to break.  Either the knights are going to howl in anger from their nerf, or some encounters will get trivialized.<br />
<br />
One fix is to re-itemize and redo armors so the warriors have their own armor line.  This solution is really not as hard as one may think.  I am not sure if someone already suggested this but, one of the ideas I was thinking about was an NPC, which will convert your armors mana to hp.  There would be considerations on whether to make the armor no drop or not, as well as the ratio of the mana to hp conversion as well consider other classes like Necros and Shamans who may want more hp then mana and end up increasing their class abilities higher then what they are currently now.  Perhaps make warriors the only ones who are able to do this?  Dunno…  <br />
<br />
Another solution to this is to change our mitigation table and at the same time change the mid to higher end encounters to reflect this change in mitigation.  This causes problems on normal exp situations where on normal tanking situations knights are still preferred to warriors because they are able to tank normal stuff.<br />
<br />
Agro does need to be increased but personally it should not be our main concern.  It is ability to tank that needs the fix.<br />
<br />

[edit] looks like landrain had the same idea on the brainstorm post.</div></div><hr />
