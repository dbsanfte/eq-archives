<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Assassinate (the best of them all find the boss kick his ass)<br />
2) Massacre (fun too, and can be a challenge at hard lvls)<br />
3) Rescue (same as assassinate exept u cant skip content)<br />
4) Collect (LAME 100% LUCK BASED retarded)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finding the boss or the captive can be fun, but it is entirely too aggravating if you get down a wrong tunnel.  The only mission I've lost so far was an assassinate mission in Miraguls.  There were two very long paths to choose from, both of which appeared to angle downstairs to a basement.  Having finished one with no luck we hauled ass back to the other one...a few minutes after our loss we figured out he was in the goddamn roundabout stairwell (which if you've done Miragul's you are probably well familiar with and generally avoid in preferance of the straightaway).  *laugh* That'll teach us!<br />
<br />
I go for massacre.  So far as I can tell all the other missions are about massacring as well, they just also involve a luck element that I'd prefer to avoid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is the boss doesnt spawn untill you have killed a certian percentage of the mobs (i think 60%) , so even if you have a good tracker , its very easy to pick the wrong path , leaving you very little time to go back and clear the correct path.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a tracker.  We even had the little &quot;you hear blahblahblah&quot; messages.  But because we knew both paths went downstairs we actually thought the mob was BELOW us.  So when tracker-boy exclaims that the mob is now behind us our first thought was to get downstairs to the end of the dungeon....not that the mob was hidden toward the beginning of the dungeon in a roundabout.  After a few retrieve/kill missions we pretty much were auto-trained to avoid the roundabouts. Lookin' back it is kind of funny, except for the fact that it fucked our ranking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vigdis, I know exactly which mission, wasn't it like a named Ice golem? We failed that mission with by 10 seconds because the cleric kept healing me after I told her to throw down all nukes because he could barely hurt me as my ego alone was enough AC to stop his weak attacks. And my +10 to good looks and utter sexiness due to being a woodelf warrior also kicked in. And ASIDE from all that, I still had that fortitude disc ready if by some off chance the boss started hurting me. But the cleric didn't nuke... so we = lost. I was very disappointed, as I'd rather die to reach a gaol than to live and know that I failed.</div></div><hr />

We've been able to finish &quot;hard&quot; slaughters with 50-55 minutes remaining. The others are still slower than that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Folian</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">collection sucks, especially when you have to collect 28-30 items and you get down to having the last DOZEN mobs not droping any...  and all you need it 1.</div></div><hr />

3. Rescue<br />
4. Collect items, super sucks<br />

Fail one hard Adventure collecting 23 items, killed over 35 mobs got 5/23 items in 45 mins. then time out when we killed over 70 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new maps from EQ Toolbox have the boss mob and rescue targets marked on the map. I can't guarantee that they are always right, but they have worked for me. If so, then making a wrong turn should never be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been using the eq-toolbox maps and what I been doing on Kill the Boss, or Rescue missions is to not totally belive the maps as I still think each dungeon has a couple of possible locations chosen at random. But they do let you see the best possibilities, usually a large dead end room or set of rooms. So then you clear all the main halls leading to each of those sections until you kill enough to spawn the mob. Now its easy to follow the in game prompts and run back or wherever till you find the right location, then just finish clearing that room.<br />
<br />
On another night I did a Kill the boss in Rujarkian hills and the cleric said that on some missions the boss is spawned by killing another named mob in the dungeon. Well it was the first time I had heard that and I was skeptical but as we headed deeper we saw an oddly named mob on track, and wouldnt you know as soon as we killed it we got the boss spawn message. Maybe coincidence but maybe for some you do need to kill a certain mob first to spawn the one you need.</div></div><hr />

damn LDoN sounds fun.  <br />
<br />
Yep, it's a blast.  Best expansion to date. <br />
<br />
The xp is a little less than pop, but I don't notice the difference because I'm having so much fun.  (and getting loot is nice too...not to mention those points:))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night we did an Assassinate in MM. Well, we slaughter the place and Boss pops with 48 minutes left. Tracker says &quot;Hey 2 named up&quot; so we decide to gack em before boss, then clean house with the extra 30 minutes after winning. We gack the east named, got 25 minutes left so I say &quot; hey lets get Boss before 2nd named incase we wipe to a bad pull cause then we are screwed.<br />
<br />
So, we pac half the boss room, I pull arrow the boss single and we get to work. Slow resists so I disc to save mana, my wife lands a CH on me at about 30%. The boss turns to my wife and triples her 900 each, I slam AE Taunt but the second rund was already in process... We wipe with SIXTEEN frickin' minutes left.<br />
<br />
We all run back and zone in with 10 minutres left, she HoV's then Divine Rez's herself and we fully buff. We pac again and engage with 4 minutes left, when the boss goes down we had ONE minute on the clock left! Man, I don't care how easy or hard something is, but beating the wipe and the clock with 1 minute left was just frickin' fun. We had a blast and will remember that recovery for a long long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was on an assasinate mission last night and we had 2 partial wipes along the way.  At that point we almost stopped because some of the grp wanted to end it and start a new mission, but we decided to push on instead.  We finally got close to the boss with about 6 minutes to go...pacified past one mob, killed the 2 near the boss, then attacked him with 3 minutes left.  We killed him with under a minute to go.  It was a blast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did an assassinate in Mistmoore last night with me botting my cleric, a rog botting a shaman, and another rogue and a chanter to round out the group.  Went like clockwork, found the boss and pulled her.  She was a wuss, but at 40% health she got pushed up on a wall, summoned me under the world and I warped to the zone-in.  By the time I figured out what happened the chanter was tanking and her health is dropping like a rock.  She goes down, and one of the rogues start tanking.  I get one CH off on her.  Mob is jumping all over the place and I was throwing fast heals but rog 1 died.  The shaman starts tanking and I'm healing her, but rog 2 gets aggro while I'm healing and escapes at 5% health.  Shaman gets aggro and I drop one heal on the rogue and go back to the shaman.  Rog backstabs a couple times and finished off the boss.  Talk about an exciting fight. <br />
<br />
That is why Assassinate is the best one.  You just don't get into situations like that while searching for 29 elf toenails.</div></div><hr />
