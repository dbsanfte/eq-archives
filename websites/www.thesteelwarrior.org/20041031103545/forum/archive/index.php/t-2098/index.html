Since I have got this weapon and I use it mainhand with a Frostbringer offhand my aggro generation has been insane.  I had to switch to my non proccing 2HS in BoT cause I was stealing aggro from a lvl 65 warrior using a BoC.  I thought maybe I was having a good night but I get into PoS last night and I am stealing aggro again from an epic'd warrior.  Does anyone else have this weapon and does it work as good for you?  I haven't ever been able to hold aggro as good as I can now and the proc on it isn't much of anything.  I am gonna keep testing it against various aggro situations but if it keeps holding aggro like it has been this would a pretty easily attainable weapon for alot of warriors, but I don't know how rare it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have the Infestation.  I too have trouble keeping aggro off of me even with other epic'd warriors.  It procs an insane amount even without a dex buff for me.  I keep it in my bag as a good quick aggro weapon and for sentimental value.  :D</div></div><hr />
