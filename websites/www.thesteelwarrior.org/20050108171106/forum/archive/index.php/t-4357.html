We're doing their job for them! That's not how it's supposed to work. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the best they have to offer for tapping this massive resource is that social clown Absor? That guy couldn't keep a kid happy in a candy store. It's like his job is just to piss people off.<br />
<br />
How hard would it be to go from forum to forum and simply ask, &quot;So what did you guys do tonight?&quot; Little things like that could go SO far. Instead we get an attitude. It doesn't even matter what kind of image they intend to come across with... it's what we see and feel that matters. That's where they've gone wrong.<br />
<br />
Clearly SoE doesn't give a damn... but I hope anyone who might read this and be in the business of working with people remembers to apply what they see now as &quot;what NOT to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't think they deserve our input anymore. Make 'em beg for it, and our cash.<br />

Don't shoot the messenger.  Absor job is just to rely information to the players that is all.  It is not his fault that classes are not balance, or a spell got nerfed, or whatever. <br />

Wont be to hard since they do have differant teams working on each aspect of the game.   They are developing the game as they see fit and that will never change.</div></div><hr />
