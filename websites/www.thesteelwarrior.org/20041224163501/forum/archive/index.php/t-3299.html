 Effect: Shield of the Arcane<br />
1: Increase Max Hitpoints by 298 (L61) to 300 (L62)<br />
2: Increase AC by 34 (L61) to 36 (L65)<br />
6: Increase Magic Resist by 30<br />

Charges: Unlimited <br />
 <br />
I figure that cause of the effect (300HP and 36AC) plus the stats on the BP this was the best way to spend my money, rather then upgraded a number of item just a little bit, I am sure this item will last a long long time.<br />
<br />
I have (with virtue and SoV and the effect on this BP) 5085HP and 1290AC now at level 55 heh...   Not bad for unguilded.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you like questions then whats the best agument for the BP? I kinda like the guy thats asked &quot;what should I agument my two SoD's with?&quot; heh....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, Kizrak &gt; Vindi.  What about vindi makes it better?<br />
Kizrak  Vindi<br />
63 ac   45 ac<br />
15 sta  15 sta<br />
115hp  100hp<br />
<br />
For saves, Vindi has 15 cr, 15 fr, and 5 mr over Kizrak.  Effect wise, Kizrak is good when you don't have a shaman, vindi's is nice, but not that nice.  2 regen and 10 atk aren't that great.  If you need atk so bad, get a kizrak bracer, though it won't do much until you get quite a few atk items.  So, where does Vindi become better than Kizrak?  It's lesser hps?  Worse ac?  While saves are useful, the amount isn't big enough to justify the less ac and hps.<br />
<br />
Secondly.  I'm glad you're happy Sam, but we really don't need to know each time you upgrade.  Even Ninja isn't looking so bad anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, I wanna hear the logic behind this one too.<br />
<br />
Can't say I can remember the last time someone said &quot;Damn, If I had just gotten rid of this AC and HP and got 2 extra regen we wouldda won.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I just came from from FF and had like five million new threads.  Four million five hundred and ninety-nine seemed to be yours.  I'm glad you are upgrading.  I honestly don't need to hear about it every time. <br />
<br />
Please, for the love of the crying baby jesus, make ONE goddamn thread and post ALL of your continual upgrades on that ONE thread.  ESPECIALLy when all its doing is keeping us apprised of your shit and isn't actually asking a question or talking about anything.  You'll notice the rest of us don't go around making new threads every time we get a new item.  <br />
<br />
Seriously, the over-posting of upgrades is becoming harassing.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

Vigdis's suggestion is smart though, Sam! Might wanna go with that if you're just gonna play Show and Tell. I'd just as soon say you should get a blog for EQ cos that's all you're doing here.</div></div><hr />

18 ac and 15 hp is going to do a HELL OF A LOT MORE than those miniscule resists you're losing over Vindi.<br />
<br />
You do realize that in PoP and LDoN (and Luclin), the AC cap isn't 1250 anymore right? It's got nothing to do with &quot;being into that sort of thing&quot;, that's like saying, &quot;Yeah you *could* use a Blade of War over a TSBS, if you're into that sort of thing.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Heh so its worth spending upwards of 60,000 plat just to gain an extra 18AC and 15HP?  No thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya maybe one thread on upgrades is good idea, doubt I be upgrading much for awhile, sides I do lots of small upgrades but this item I kinda consider a big step for a warrior. Sides now the thread is interesting someone found out what the effect does, and others are arguing about this BP vs some vindi or something. <br />
<br />
For sure this is the first &quot;big ticket&quot; item you should get just because of the effect, 300 HP is a lot and it stacks with the most common buff you are likely to get, virtue. And its not a rune that gets beat of fast it a buff like virtue that adds HP. <br />
<br />
Also people are suppose to post &quot;That BP is nothing I have a .... &quot; and then some other guy &quot;I have a ... &quot; and we can argu over which is better, or find a better item to shoot for.<br />
<br />
Don't worry any thread which is not interesting falls off the first page fast enough. When the SZ board was cooking bout 10 months ago I post something and its gone within hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togr</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All depends on which BP you were using originally, if you had something like a statue/vindi the cash might have been better spent on a Helmet of Rallos Zek with some left over to upgrade another slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually Sam, with all due respect this forum is for equipment questions, not for penis measuring.  Do a search or browse the forums if you're looking for debates on item vs. item as there are many.<br />
In fact I believe Wandor just posted a top 10 BP thread a few days ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Kizrak BP does has its benefits.  Of course the AC and HP is higher, albeit not by a gigantic margin, but the effect is incredibly useful.<br />
<br />
Don't you guys get dispelled constantly while fighting in LDoN?  I do all the freaking time and its annoying.  Mobs tend to dispell either slots 1 and 2 or slots 2 and 3.  Most of the time, one of the buffs is my clicky.  Other times, this is my Focus, or my Haste, or even my Virtue.  So, at least midway through Mistmoore fights or whatever I'm just wearing Virtue and a Stamina as any real HP buff.  I have a Tri-Plated Golden Hackle Hammer that I got off Dain that I use, but the effect from the Kizrak BP is substantially more.  <br />
<br />
So yeah, I'd find the Kizrak BP to be an extremely solid piece of equipment to shoot for.  The guy may have his own manaburn crew, cleric, and enchanter, but I doubt he'd be able to kill Vindi on his own.  Derakor is still a badass.  :p<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, penis measuring?  I can do that too.  Check the gem I now have in my range slot, wuwu~<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Other times, this is my Focus, or my Haste, or even my Virtue. <br />
<br />
I don't hunt in LDoN, but thought I'd offer up a suggestion, because I had similar problems since i'm always MT and I'm always pulling.   I used to have grim aura first slot from the goblin earring, always, and i'd encounter the same problem, slot 1 and 2, slot 1 and 3, or 2 and 3 dispell, and I'd always lose one buff.  My advice is to pick up a 2nd clicky.  These days if you're 65, getting a goblin earring and a 8th ring is trivial, and they really help a TON for cutting down on dispells.  Now I maybe lose a buff 1 in 10 dispells, made my life much easier.<br />
<br />
The 2nd thing I did to cut down on that crap is that since I also play my shaman I try to toss something a little less essential in slot 3...like KEI if you can swing the buff slots to keep it, Shammy PR/DR (since it doesn't seem to do much anyway) or my third choice is Stamina, since my shammy has a Wolf Caller's BP and it's real easy to rebuff if I lose it.  Talk to your shammies and ask them to do Tribunal, Boar then Focus instead of the other way around so that Focus ends up farther down the list, and hence less likely to be dispell fodder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For dispells, I agree with Haass.  It's not hard to get some clickies to protect yourself.  Personally, I use 9th ring, aura of battle, PoM DR flower.  Easier to get items are 8th ring, gobby skull earring, and jboots (outdoor only though =\).  Can hit Dracoliche in Fear for a shield with right click aura of battle, which isn't too hard.  If you don't mind targetting yourself, Bracer of the Hidden is insta click, but targetable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No offense but kizrak's for the clicky is just plain stupid. As main tank in any group or on a raid where you may be called to tank at any given second it's not reasonable to stand still for 12 seconds while you wait for your crappy ass junk buff to get into place. On Sont? Oh yeah 12 seconds. You'l lose every buff except for your BP click because the fight will be over by the time you get your buff off. No. That won't cut it.<br />
<br />
As for me <br />
1st = Goblin ear <br />
2nd = 8th ring<br />
3rd = Cloak of Thorns<br />
4th = Eyepatch of Plunder<br />
<br />
With this combo I've tanked Sont and not lost one real buff, sure I've had all 4 debuffed, but it's not that hard to get all 4 right back up in about 3 seconds. So while you're spending 12 seconds being usless every time you're debuffed, I'll be busy kicking ass without any notice able downtime.</div></div><hr />

The point is that sometimes you don't have a shaman or you don't have shaman buffs, and rather than screw around asking them, you can take matters into your own hands and rebuff yourself.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about clickies so you don't get put in that situation to begin with, but that's completely different from with Eriatha was talking about.  Try to keep up here.</div></div><hr />
