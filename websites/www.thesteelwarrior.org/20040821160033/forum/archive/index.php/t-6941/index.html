<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately, I have found myself wondering more and more, &quot;What the hell are they thinking?&quot; when it comes to this game.  Today I thought it through a bit more, and came to a conclusion - SoE is planning for EQ to fail, and they have shifted their resources and financial stake to EQ2.<br />
<br />
I've seen the arguement many times now that EQ1 is the golden goose, and that SoE would never let it die.  But I think the goose has a terminal disease, known as mudflation, and that SoE has recognized this, concluded that the game can't be effectively expanded much more than it already has been, and will not be able to compete with the new generation of games like WoW, CoH, Vanguard, etc..  <br />
<br />
Why do I think SoE has decided this?  Because its the only conclusion that fits their otherwise inane behavior.  Consider their recent moves:<br />
<br />
1. Since the last full sized expansion, PoP, we have had LoY, aimed at new and casual players, LDoN, aimed at casual players, and GoD, which masquerades as a full sized expansion, but has less content and depth than any previous expansion, including LoY and LDoN.  The focus is on retaining casual players, enticing new ones, and fooling the hardcore into hanging on just a bit longer.<br />
<br />
2. The continuing moves to make the low end of the game easy and quick.  New characters arrive with weapons equipped and almost a dotted line to follow from their starting point to 10th level.  Paludal caverns insures they will quickly reach 25th, by which point they have started to form the social attachments that should keep them hooked into the game for a good long while to come.  And even if that fails, LDoN will provide them with the kind of arcade style experience that this game has steadily devolved into.<br />
<br />
3. The total evisceration of the CS program.  Outsourcing to India, removal of server GMs, and a complete lack of any way to contact a living human about any CS matter in less than geologic time.  Somewhere the calculus has been made that the percentage of disgruntled customers this loses &lt; the money spent on retaining them by treating them like human beings.  Long run, I think this will hurt their bottom line more than they expect, as it alienates their long term customers who can remember when EQ CS actually existed.<br />
<br />
4. The New Graphics Engine.  Right now its a buggy pita, but their aim is for it to ultimately consume less resources and require less CS.  Here again they have miscalculated, as the monkeys left behind when they moved the real coders over to EQ2 have repeatedly made things worse, not better.  If postings on boards like this are to be believed, a significant number of players have quit or gone into semi-retirement over these problems, having the outlandish expectation of basic playability from a five year old game.<br />
<br />
5. Class balance pandering, and the lack of any coherent approach to it.  The recent round of melee balancing was, I think, the last gasp attempt at actually fixing these issues.  Fortunately for Warriors, their first pass at it did a lot to fix us.  Unfortunately, the monks and rogues mostly lost out, as the dps improvements they should have gotten were largely lost in the now-defunct &quot;openings&quot; system.  Endurance, in the end, is most significant in that we now get to rot augments for it that drop in GoD because of how utterly useless it is to have more of it.<br />
<br />
Speaking of pandering, the current dev team reaction to the Paladin and Shadowknight complaints about becoming eunuchs in GoD is very instructive.  Their proposal to &quot;fix&quot; the problem by having trials adjust to the classes entering them indicates two things - one, they didn't think any of this through beforehand, and two, they have no fucking idea how to actually fix the problem they have created.  The people who might have a chance at coming up with a real fix are in the same place as the real coders - EQ2<br />
<br />
6. GoD.  I know I mentioned this in 1, but it really deserves its own paragraph.  GoD is the personification of the big SoE lie, namely that EQ1 will just keep on keepin on.  This one is close to home for me, my guild got its first Quarm kill less than a month before GoD opened.  At first we figured that our timing couldn't have been better, since we had just finished the old content when the new content arrived.  But it quickly became clear that GoD was not about more content.  What its really about is making you jump through more hoops toward the illusion of more content.  Just check the mobs you see as you move through Natimbi and Qinimi, the first two zones of the expansion.  Because you will be seeing them ad-infinitum as you move further in.  <br />
<br />
Right now we are working on finishing the Ikkinz raids in Kod`Taz.  No one knows why we are doing this, other than that it appears to be what we should be doing to progress.  The loot tables here are extremely shallow, and we are seeing quite a few rots already.  The stuff that doesnt rot is comparable to 4th and 5th tier Time, but difficulty is much higher.  And as the weeks go by, we keep seeing changes to these raids to make them even more difficult.  Add to this the fact that these raids tend to run 3 hours +, and the fun factor is at a all time low.  <br />
<br />
The overall effect on our guild is increasing attrition as people leave the game altogether, or migrate to the &quot;most uber&quot; tier of guilds that are currently having a more elite brand of un-fun one zone further into the rat maze.  We are gradually being pushed in the direction of recruiting under-flagged folks from lower tier guilds, which will shortly result in us going back to killing elemental gods and minis for loot and flags for these folks.  This isn't progression anymore, this is a treadmill with a painting of a carrot hung in front of it.<br />
<br />
Well, its late, and I've rambled a bit.  But my point is this - the fat lady is warmed up and ready.  And if you think otherwise, you are only buying into SoE's feeble attempts to occlude the obvious - they are cutting us loose.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's quite true. EQ1 is the proverbial old man laying wheezing on his deathbead.<br />
<br />
They just can't squeeze much more life out of it. The game feels... stretched to its extremes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only proof I need of the above statements is listening to all my friends that still play recant stories of how they can't physically move their characters out of dungeons like Guk anymore with the new collision problems that went in 2 or 3 patches ago and STILL aren't fixed.<br />
<br />
Even when EQ was new, it was a really stable game.  It had it's bugs, sure, but you could PLAY it.  Now it really doesn't even seem possible from what I've heard lately.</div></div><hr />

It just makes me wonder what some of these hardcore players are going to do with themselves when EQ1 folds, im talking about the ones that live and breath this game, log 40+ hours a week, and it will fold, nothing is infinate. <br />
<br />
Maybe have a life?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think i'll just let myself fade away with the game...</div></div><hr />

<br />
consider the bazaar. on veeshan in the months before dx9 it was almost always maxed to its 600 count limit after about 11pm pacific. ever since the patch the numbers in the bazaar at 11 has typically hung around 450. conclusion ... one quarter of trading mules have left the game.<br />
<br />
why? i will venture a guess that one quarter of mule accounts CANNOT play anymore.<br />
the official term for this is progress. ive seen at least a few insist that if we cannot stand progress then get out of the system. a quarter of the bazaar crowd clearly took that advice. but why do we call the destruction of a graphics interface progress? why would sony want to trash a quarter of its customer base for secondary accounts in one stroke?<br />
<br />
theories are &quot;these brilliant profit thinking minds know something we dont about why its easier to make a profit when you lose a quarter of your secondary accounts&quot; <br />
<br />
.. and the other theory is &quot;incompetence&quot;.<br />
<br />
i go for the second theory because ive watched microsoft for 24 years now. when they were a young company they wrote some of the most stable software ive ever seen. the original operating systems for both the pc's and the apples were immaculate. (ok ok microsoft didnt write pc dos but they wrote some of the other basic packages). as the company grew they developed windows which started out as an abomination of a software package. and what is microsoft up to now? a company of tens of thousands cannot develop a browser that can keep up with freeware browsers or a search engine that can keep up with freeware.<br />
<br />
which brings us to eq...<br />
<br />
it started as verant and a band of ingenious software developers and marketers who made a state of the art groundbreaking game that ran awesomely on a 128MB 400MHz machine. they have turned it into a game that (turning off all new graphics features as well as all spell effects and reducing to minimum permissable texture quality and exping in the old-world zones) that runs absolutely horribly on a 533 with 640 MB and a much better graphics card. what the heck happened?<br />
<br />
old brilliant software writers gone. replaced by the clueless.<br />
<br />
here is another thing ive learned from my experience as an engineer and programmer.<br />
<br />
software writers as well as hardware designers are both like artists. for every virtuoso one there are dozens of the mediocre. and for every several dozen virtuoso ones there is only one who has &quot;the mark of greatness&quot;.<br />
<br />
but businessmen dont understand that. they fall under the misconception that software writers are a commodity and that  they are all the same. or at least the same to within a factor of 2 or 3.<br />
<br />
question: how many AVERAGE mathematicians would it take to work out in all its glory the theory of relativity? answer: all of them in the world would not have done it. but it only took ONE genious. software is a lot like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I haven't played in over a month.  The tanking issues pushed me into semi retirement.  I'm not going to log so I can just fall through the world.  What's the issue with tanking now?? some mobs cornerable, some not.  I don't want to have to relearn the game because some developer can't code correctly.  It's hard enough to get a raid of 50 people to follow instructions, (i play with a casual guild) now we have to deal with a billion bug work arounds??? no thanks.<br />
<br />
I think alot of folks are like me, not playing but haven't canceled.  So as far as the coin counters at Sony know nothing is wrong.  Once a few more of us start canceling off accounts you'll either see them make a &quot;REAL&quot; effort to fix existing problems or put alot more focus into EQ2 in hopes of transfering their player base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are a number of clear problems in EQ.<br />
<br />
1. Way too many transportation systems. Boats might be cute, but they've been a regular source of aggravation. Does SoE really see itself still providing boats as a counter to FFXI airships? We've got boats, Wizard Spires, Druid Rings, Nexus Scions, PoP single destination clickable ports, Potions, and Wayfarer Magnus. Enough already.<br />
<br />
2. A storyline like is was written by Robert Jordan with advanced dementia. Kill Inny on PoHate, kill Inny in PoTime, whoops it was all a dream. And oh ya, there was this undiscovered continent, moon, planet, plane, .....<br />
<br />
3. Static zones incapable of change that get totally abandoned as players progress.<br />
<br />
Still 30 years ago I was playing Star Trek, Adventure, Hacker, etc. and the first graphic rpg's. Shooting 3D wire frame tanks was just about state-of-the-art. A lot of us dreamed about a game like EQ. Verant/SoE deserves a lot of credit. There are faults, but not as many as we imagine when we get exasperated with or tired of the game.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I'm pretty jealous of the youngsters that play EQ. Thirty years from now such games will be a lot better. Hopefully there will be enough money in it for someone again for a brief four year period to get it mostly right.<br />
<br />

<br />
No, Verant deserves a lot of credit.<br />
<br />
SoE doesn't deserve shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think alot of folks are like me, not playing but haven't canceled.

<br />
Here, everyone in this situation, listen up.<br />
<br />
I used to do the same thing when I took breaks from EQ.  I kept my accounts active and just didn't play.  There's 2 problems with this.  First is that you're still being charged for a game that you're not playing.  Save yourself 13 bucks (or in my case, 26) and just cancel the accounts.  It's not like you can't restart them at ANY time.  I never had any issues with my toons being deleted or coming back naked or anything like that, so don't be concerned with that.  If you're out of the game for a week and not missing it, hit that cancel button, save yourself some cash.<br />
<br />
Second is the point that Merc touched on...Cancel it so that SoE knows that there's something wrong.  They're happy as fuck as long as their subscription numbers keep going up.  Well, make a fucking dent in them if you're unhappy.  TRUST ME YOU LOSE NOTHING.  Even if everyone just cancels their account for one month, it's going to be immediately apparant to them that something is up. This means they're either going to have to fix things, or the only logical conclusion is that they're going to lose even more accounts as more people cancel in order to play other games with their friends who left.<br />
<br />
There's a subscription chart linked on FOHguild.org that says that EQ has lost 20k accounts since GoD opened.  I'll bet the number of people who just haven't played since then is MUCH higher.  Cancel it, and drop them down another 80k.  Let them know that you don't approve of their bullshit.  Sitting on an active account, and not using it, is about the most retarded thing you could possibly do as a customer who's unhappy with the service he's recieving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just to add to what Haass said, you can actually cancel your account for 3 months and your toon should be there at the end of the 3rd month if you re-active the account, not because I say it hehe, because it's stated that's the period they keep the accounts &quot;alive&quot;. Even then, I had friends get their accounts back after 4 months because they moved to another country and had to stop playing for a long time.<br />
I even do that on vacations, just cancel the account for 2 months or so, then come back, Im not paying them and my account looks like Canceled, which, like Haass said, it adds up to those canceled accounts (even when I plan on returning haha, but it still is another number).<br />
<br />
Just to add something, I always cancel my account  right after buying any subscription... I guess it became an habit, I never liked automatic recharging... I rather say when I want it to be renewed hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, I know someone who left EQ before PoP was out, recently when they had the 5th anniversary re-activation of accounts, I tried to log his in.  It worked, all his characters were there, his main was naked (because he let his corpse rot, the reason he quit).  Anyway, yah if you're disgruntled and don't feel it's worth your money, cancel.  Nothing will happen to your stuff.  Me personally, I'm having enough fun to stick around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&lt;&lt;There's a subscription chart linked on FOHguild.org that says that EQ has lost 20k accounts since GoD opened.

<br />
its very hard to quit an addiction isnt it? but putting an account dorment puts it in serious jeapardy of it eventually being cancelled. because people learn that .. wow! there is life beyond eq! yes i do believe that if 20k account have been cancelled then another 60k are lying dorment. and if so within a year 60k will be cancelled.<br />
<br />
sony could have milked eq for years given its current player base even if new players chose the new games. but they are actively driving away customers by replacing solid code with junk code.<br />
<br />
and tonight i had a sudden and horrifying realization. my eq days are numbered. and here is why.<br />
<br />
you see tonight i finally gave in and replace my ati graphics card with a very dx9 compatible geforce fx5200. this card is highly recommended by many. its got 2-3 times to power of my previous card and more importantly it has a better reputation for dx9 compatibility. its even recommended by sony. after taking the customary 1 1/2 hours and 10 reboots to get the thing running i logged onto eq. this is what i found.<br />
<br />
frame lag was identical at 4-10 frames per second depending on location. but dsl lag has gone pathological. with my old setup the connection itself gave me no problems and ld's were very rare (maybe one per 200 hours online). but now my computer freezes up for several seconds at a time and then coughs and weezes as the connection tries to restore itself (lag bar thing). all the other typical graphics problems which i wont go into because they are too numerous to name and you all know them are the same as they were.<br />
<br />
my memory does not cache out. or to put it another way my hard disk doesnt flicker as i move around. so its not a memory limitation. so what is it? what would i have to replace to make it work like it used to?<br />
<br />
suppose i spend 2000 dollars on a state of the art computer just to play a GAME. i have zero confidence any of my problems will go away. and this is the crux of the problem. im throwing money down a hole on this game. no upgrades EVER make an improvement. now i know some people have great performance. im happy for them. but they have to understand they are in some regards lucky because a lot of us have no idea what has to be done to make a game work.<br />
<br />
i will NOT go to eq2 because its designed by sony (duh). reputation means something to me and they have a reputation for shoddy work. verant did great work. sony destroyed a lot of what was created.<br />
<br />
so you ask why i havent quit already. because im an eq addict. ok? you understand? its what you call a vice or a dysfunction. and ive told myself for four years that when the time comes that i leave eq i will never play an internet game again.<br />
<br />
how many of you remember a couple years ago when every server showed (on the server select screen) how many people were playing at that time on that server? then they mysteriously deleted that information.<br />
<br />
the reason is clear now. if sony ever were to start losing its playerbase it would be a very bad marketing decision to give any visibility of that fact to the playing public.<br />
<br />
someone prove me wrong here but i do believe the account attrition began long before GoD. come to think of it so did the sickness of the graphic interface. ykesha has always been attrocious on my computer. but about account attrition:<br />
<br />
how many people do you see leveling up in oasis these days? how many times does lake of ill omen have zero people in it? i used to see 120 people there with NO lag. and west commons? south karana used to have close to a hundred people in it. west freeport had 30 or more. crushbone was teaming with new accounts. so was gfay. and qeynos. dreadlands would have 40. overthere had 30. solA solB both had another 20 or more. are you going to tell me that all 1000 NEW players who used to frequent these zones have ALL gone to paludil caverns? most of the people in paludil arent even first time players. the NEW player population is close to zero and has been for quite some time.<br />
<br />
to be continued ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">most of us play more than one character. but for those who have never soloed a caster let me fill you in on the special grief we soloers face.<br />
<br />
my warrior can still hack and slash in a raid or in a PoP group or a ldon. the lag is more a nuisance for him than a leveling impediment though i did die at least once tonight due to something called &quot;healer lag&quot;. but who the heck cares on a raid?<br />
<br />
but my druid is another matter. he has been in semi retirement since GoD came out. he is painful to play. it hurts to play my druid because he is sick. and he is sick with what i now believe is a terminal disease.<br />
<br />
my druid was my baby. he could do anything solo. he learned to kite 20 mobs around with a charmed pet. a quarter the mobs casters. he died once per 50 hours doing this. he loved to solo in weird places like kedge where his goal was to solo every single mob in there at least once. only one he hasnt soloed yet is phinney.  but phinney was only a matter of time. he and my girlfriend's druid used to make sport of killing semi-named mobs with 30k hp that couldnt be snared or rooted and which summoned. who's that one that drops the bracelet of sense in umbral? yeah that one weve done. druids. to me druids were fun. they were the most mobile of creatures. but they required delicate fingers on the keyboard. they were an artform. they made the game a GAME. they made it a personal challenge.<br />
<br />
well my druid cant do that anymore. sony broke him. they screwed the interface so badly he does not know where the mobs are anymore. and he stops for no reason while sony gets around to refreshing the position coordinates. and he gets walked over by mobs that pop and poof and warp.<br />
<br />
and wizards are screwed too. and necros. and mages and enchanters. and most of all bards. bards cannot solo if they cannot precisely control their location and precisely know the mobs' locations. bard soloing is an artform too. and sony blew it with them. well sony in the last 2 years has shown contempt for soloers so i doubt they feel any remorse over that.<br />
<br />
i split this into 2 posts in case it wouldnt let such a long one go through. im livid here. and im discouraged. half my game is gone. my warrior i still can play. my druid is barely playable. he has a hard time using up his manna anymore because the frame lag slows down his casting so badly. his snare wont cast till the mob is half the official spell range .. so he gets hit. this in a zone devoid of any other players besides himself.<br />
<br />
i love my warrior. but that is no excuse for sony to trash my other characters.<br />
<br />
and you just KNOW someone is going to follow up my post and tell me to get with the program and understand about progress. eq doesnt need &quot;progress&quot;. it hasnt had significant new players in 2 years. the ones who are playing it have been playing for ages. many of their computers are obsolete. by increasing system requirements they will NOT attract new customers. the new customers have been largely gone for years. the only choices they have are to keep the old customers or to lose them too. and forcing them to replace their computers is NOT going to impress the majority of them. (oh boy i get to spend 2k on a new machine and this will allow me to see smoother models than before!).<br />
<br />
and when its all over and i finally quit ....<br />
<br />
ill be a better person for it.<br />

because it never was healthy for me.</div></div><hr />

You can build a computer that can run those new graphics relatively cheap. You can upgrade one to do so even cheaper.<br />
<br />
The thing is though, most of the people who've played EQ for 5+ years *are* hardcore gamers. They have the gaming rigs. They keep their computers in tip top shape because it's their hobby.<br />

This isn't progression anymore, this is a treadmill with a painting of a carrot hung in front of it. <br />
<br />
Very interesting observation.  I think you are spot on with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LUMMP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Have to agree. This game is on its way out. But Sony wants it this way. Come on whats the alternative, to believe that they have thier heads so far up thier azzes that they cant see whats happening?<br />
<br />
They dont care if it fails, they are simply trying to keep it together with as few resources as possible till they can get EQ2 on the market.  This is their race at the moment. They MUST get EQ2 to market before Worlds Of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
EQ2 will be to market before WoW, it will happen, they will make it happen. All thier recources are being poured into making it happen. Thier failure however, is they dont realize that in doing so they are pissing people off so bad that its not just Everquest that they will drive people away from but Sony titles in general.<br />
<br />
Look at the abortion that is SWG in the mad rush to get it to market that piece of sheot wasnt even ready for beta much less public release. In the mad rush to beat WoW to market they will repeat this fiasco and they will be DONE.<br />
<br />
To be honest they are done with me already. Sure they are still getting my 28bucks a month. Hey Im addicted to the people I play with more than the game itself and I still get &quot;some&quot; enjoyment out of the game and my guild.<br />
<br />
But if they think im playing EQ2 then they are sadly mistaken. Blizzard in thier typical fashion will continue to push back thier release date further and further and allow EQ2 to beat them to market. They dont care. They realize where Sony has screwed up. <br />
<br />
When WoW finally comes out it will still be buggy and will still need work. But you can bet your azzes that Blizzard wont repeat the abortion that is SWG or that will be EQ2. <br />
<br />
So I will continue to play EQ, for now anyway. I still like my friends in the game enough to put up with the BS. Figure I got another year or so, I predict  Warcraft will be out around first or second quarter of 05. In the meantime  just call me<br />

I swore I wouldn't, but I went ahead and played SWG for about six months.  And for about 2 months of that I was bored and felt like there was little point in playing.  The concept isn't a bad one, but the implementation is really horrid.  Basically you only get experience from killing mobs or experience and cash if you take missions.  There are a few items that drop, here and there, but very few.  And most are only useful to tradeskillers.  Most of the rewards for things like quests are worthless pieces of shit that you would never use because you bought better gear off a tradeskiller.  Everything wears out eventually and you're constantly having to either replace your gear or find someone to repair it.  And if you replace it you're lining the pockets of the tradeskillers.  Basically, if you're not a tradeskiller, there are extremely limited rewards in SWG and very little to work towards beyond a certain point.  And to top it off, it's buggy to all hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">how many of you remember a couple years ago when every server showed (on the server select screen) how many people were playing at that time on that server? then they mysteriously deleted that information<br />
<br />
That was shortly before Dark Ages of Camelot came out, about 2 months previous or so if I'm not mistaken.<br />
<br />
For myself, I'm still playing EQ and having fun, but my time is winding down as well.  I'm really excited about WoW, and hopefully it lives up to its promise.  I'm even going to take a look at EQ2 as well though :p</div></div><hr />

i will NOT go to eq2 because its designed by sony (duh). reputation means something to me and they have a reputation for shoddy work. verant did great work. sony destroyed a lot of what was created.<br />
<br />
 ....<br />
<br />
This is a good point, and Haass made it too.  Verant was responsible for &quot;The Vision&quot;.  Verant, despite their faults as well, basically created the magic that has all but trickled away under the ownership of Sony.<br />
<br />
I don't know that I trust a company like Sony to make a decent game.  SWG was a huge flop...EQ in their hands has turned into a zerg-fest, treadmill.  They should stick with making electronics and leave the games to the real artists.<br />
<br />
I'm going to log in sometime this week and try and hit one of my guild's raids.  If it doesn't turn me around I'll cancel the account and just renew in 2 or 3 months if I'm still feeling as though I may want to play.<br />
<br />
I drug my warrior up from bronze armor and velium weapons....quested almost all my crafted, and achieved my epics shortly after PoP was released.  I'm now elemental flagged and feel more than capable of performing my role well in most casual group settings.  All of us who played warriors in EQ can probably say without much arguement that we played the hardest class in what is maybe the most difficult video game ever created.  That to me is pretty cool.<br />
<br />
EQ was the first real MMORPG, I just hope it goes out with some style and not kicking and screaming.</div></div><hr />

/cough UO...... :D<br />
<br />
but yeah, EQ was a fun game; but i see it's last days it will be spit upon and more than likely tossed to the curb.<br />
<br />
it's grace and grandeur are gone. EQ will last another year or so and prob into EQ2's release but it's never going to retain that feeling of entering a wonderous world to roleplay and explore ever again. <br />
<br />
those days are over :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm not sure that EQ is dead, yet.  UO is still going strong isn't it?  I think that the number of people playing EQ will slowly over a long period of time dwindle.  But there will probably always be someone interested in playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Games die over time, the playerbase shrinks in all games.  It's inevitable.  For those that continue playing, it's always a cycle of recruiting, reflagging, regearing, endlessly, and I'm sure anyone who knows what I'm talking about has felt it a million times.<br />
<br />
GoD isn't too horrendous...Uqua is a huge pain in the ass, but the rest of it is pretty decent.  Granted it feels horrible because we can't progress until Uqua is 100% fixed, but at least there is/was some challenge in the expansion for awhile.  I think alot of the high end people got soft because of potime.  Having our safehaven once every 6 days was nice.  We were guranteed a succesful raid, and we were guranteed loot, and then we had time to dick off the rest of the week.  Now we gotta work for stuff, and some people just didn't want to go through it all anymore.  People move on, it happens.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, getting to Barxt 4-5 times now and having him just stand there laughing at us midway through the fight, with nothing we can do to get him engageable is retarded, and having an initial lockout of 6 days..well..man that was lame.  But it's good to at least see that the dev's are working on it hard, and more importantly, working with the people that have been stuck waiting on it to get feedback so it'll work right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">this will sound like bad news but its reason for hope:<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;You can build a computer that can run those new graphics relatively cheap. You can upgrade one to do so even cheaper.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
ah if only it were true. refer to my previous comment about upgrading to a NVIDIA card only to see new problems added to my old ones. so i truck on over to eq's tech support page to check out what others are saying. its truly amazing....<br />
<br />
many of the people with the worst problems are the same ones with top of the line systems. 2.4GHz 2GB type machines built specifically for eq with every bell and whistle money could buy that ran with tremendous grace just before the dx9 patch and now have framerates worse than mine or crash constantly or cant be played at all. and curiously some with much older machines who dont notice any performance changes at all.<br />
<br />
many complain of seeing characters falling through the world constantly (both player and npc) but ive yet to witness even one instance of this. this indicates that the players in many situations are not (serverside) falling thru but only clientside. though i dont see that issue on my machine i sure see npcs bounce up into the sky alot in some zones. in maidens eye they bounce all over the place but in most zones they never do. in ldon my framerate is high enough that i dont particularly notice anything annoying but in pok pot and maiden the framerate is horrible (2-5 /sec) even when few people are in the zone. some zones like everfrost produce a huge chat - lag problem with everyone and other zones dont. if we could pick the best performing attributes of each zone and combine them into one special zone that one zone would have stellar performance. this all adds up in my mind to an indication that my computer has the POTENTIAL to perform quite well.<br />
<br />
in seeing these hundreds of posts by people detailing their problems to tech support im noticing something. im noticing the techs are bewildered. they are asking constantly for dbg and dxdiag files and so on. they also are admitting that they dont know when many of these issues will be fixed but are obviously immersed in them.<br />
<br />
it will take time. i can tell this because ive seen the enormous diversity of problems.<br />
<br />
so why am i encouraged? because im finally getting a glimmer of hope that sony never intended to make my machine obsolete just to make newer machines run even better. it really MIGHT have been incompetent coding and executive release decision after all. maybe they actually intend to fix it.<br />
<br />
with that in mind im suspending further tinkering with my system. at least im not crashing going ld getting stuck falling through the world or in any other way being locked out of the treadmill we call eq. i can at least play. and lol! my bazaar lag isnt any worse than it ever was even if i still limp thru pot at 3 frames per second.<br />
<br />
my last effort at tinkering with drivers caused me to lose my cd rom drive. i got it back tonight by first disabling it in bios and then reenabling it again. (sigh ... i shouldnt HAVE to be an expert at these things). so now i consider it their problem. at least lag is manageable in ldon and bot if i turn off spell effects.<br />
<br />
for those with worse problems than i have i might recommend this. stop spending long nights struggling with computer mainatance and optimization. give up the game for the time being and check on it once (and only once) after each patch. take a vacation. get some sunshine. maybe in a few months it will be playable again. but im persuaded the problem is not our computers. not by and large. give them time to fix it and expect the time required to be large.sony is permantly losing an enormous revenue stream over this blunder. they know if they dont fix it they will lose a huge amount more. they are working on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">UO is kinda....just going. :D ... and for the record I do hope what I say doesn't come to pass about EQ and it just carries on.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I think we all are, they only give us content when we shill out a bunch of extra money, they have these fucking &quot;idea&quot; threads going, but when something truely cool come up, &quot;maybe in the next expantion&quot; i thought part of everquest was more than just bug fixes and fine tuning, according to ALL the boxes the world is ment to change month to month(of course it does, if your on legends)<br />
<br />
sony treats us like shit, blows smoke up our ass and we dont care, for example.<br />
<br />
melee balance part 2<br />
graphic engine<br />
leveling off melee damage with caster damage(was in upcoming changes for the longest time, would have helped alot of rogues and monks that i know)<br />
<br />
not to mention broken content<br />
<br />
acrylia caverns ring of fire is just an example(Hey fella's lets revamp ac! ok, oops we broke eet! har har)<br />
<br />
plane of war anyone?<br />
<br />
<br />
We would all be less jaded if sony keeps down its current path of talking with us and making changes like they have been on their new boards, but that is only a start, they need to deliver more content then fricking bug fixes between expantions, i swear expantions are the worst thing they come up with, id rather see 2 or 3 new zones every few months then 1 big steaming pile of shit like LoY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>LUMMP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">LOL the stupidity continues. <br />
<br />
We cant seem to fix our dx9 issues so that you wont get stuck but we think we have finally fixed the workaround(lame) to let you get unstuck.(bet your azz its still broke).<br />
<br />
But on a good note we have found the programing time to mess with a regeneration system which has been just fine for 5 years.<br />
<br />
<br />
BET YOUR LIFE SAVINGS that will need several patches to fix all the crap this messes up.<br />
<br />
God knows why they feel the need to continue to dumb down the game. Its not like anyone new plays this game or like it takes any time to level up to the point that regeneration is a non-issue. <br />
<br />
The amount of time it took to screw with regen should have been put towards fixing all the broken content.  But hey that makes sense and I have becomed convinced that the infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters is the coding department aproach at Sony now. Of course they only have a few monkeys so its not working.<br />
