<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acfreak</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I recently came across alot of cash (sold an Earring of Lushest Foliage a friend gave to me).  The thing is though is that my gear is very good for my level and don't want to upgrade until 55 (ornate).  But the new magnetic gear is really awesome, and fairly cheap on Xegony.  Should I spend 160k on that or get ornate, and feel free to critique my magelo and give suggestions.  :)                            http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1122209</div></div><hr />

<br />
And where did you get your Darkened Blade? Been looking for one for a while now.</div></div><hr />

As to your question... I'd go with magnetic over ornate.</div></div><hr />
