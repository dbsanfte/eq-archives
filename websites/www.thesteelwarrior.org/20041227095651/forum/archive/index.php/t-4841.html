<br />
Lucy Link (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4697&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
I have used this alot, but it dont seem to work, perhaps its just me, but if you have 400 hate to start with, plus wielding a BoW or Auged Vanazir, you should never be able to loose agro... But I lose agro all the time, its depressing!<br />
<br />
Anyone know if it works at all ?<br />
<br />
I was Assist on a FRO raid just for kicks and I used Incite on every mob, plus wielding a BoW and could hardly get agro. Taunts were unsuccesful 85% of all the times!<br />
<br />
Anyone notice anything alike or is it just me ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it helps but distance really hurts the bonus it gives.  For instance, a pet is sent to attack a mob and another adds, i use incite on the 2nd but the mob doesnt come running to hit me, where as a slow or something else would send it running back to the enc so distance does play a large role.  incite does do more aggro than slow</div></div><hr />

Today I dueled a friend of mine and used it on him, he said it debuffed one of his buffs and also gave the message something like: &quot;You are besieged by swear words&quot; or something similar.  Made me laugh.<br />
<br />
I think they ought to upgrade the initial +hate it gives, up to 600.</div></div><hr />

You just need to whack the mob once or twice along with Incite, and the shammy can slow the mob at 99%.

In BoT tanking with a Time equiped rog and a shammy slowing, I had very little problem keeping agro with Incite+BoC+GBoS. It was almost trivial, there were only a couple fights that I lost it at all and even then the mob was not hard to turn back on to me with a taunt or 2. So far I am very please with how incite and the other new skills I have tried are working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's relatively weak IMO, and doesn't really touch what a paladin could do for example.<br />
<br />
There were times when I pulled mobs, used incite, and notice no difference from if I hadn't used it.  I've never had much problem keeping things on me mind you, but just pulling, I might pull something and if anyone even shoots an arrow, it will break off to them.<br />
<br />
+hate spells have always been sort of less than stellar IMO, when I first got an EB weapon I was dissappointed in it big time because it wasn't like the aggro sod had back in the day.  Now I'm a bit more used to it and I appreaciate that I can use bow full time and generally only get/keep aggro when I want to.<br />
<br />
I was looking forward to it all but now I'm sort of dreading what else they will do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A successful Taunt + Incite is almost as good as aggro lock.  I mean yeah it is of course possible still get aggroed but your party has to be either really stupid or trying really hard to overaggro.  When used in PoP XP groups I pretty much regen more than enough to use Incite.  In LDoN sometimes you don't regen enough since mobs have a bit less HPs and also there's less break between pulls in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

its definatly NOT agro lock (tho paladins on PoN boards seem to want to claim otherwise for somereason), especially on raids, but it IS a nice tool and helps tremendously.<br />

i think they nailed it dead on in all aspects, its not too much, not too little.</div></div><hr />

It trivilized tanking in BoT. I can now go fetch a coke as long as I keep me eye on the screen.<br />
Im just lazy I guess.<br />
A Wizzy can still get aggro though, but he has to be either stupid or unlucky.</div></div><hr />

so yes its great :). it's just like procing a minor EB at the start of each mob.<br />

And now we can use spirit of rage + incite to have a &quot;super incite&quot; once every 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite correct.  You have a few paladins claiming the end of Norrath has come - however most of the rest of us are doing our damndest to straighten them out.  I would say 80% of paladins on PoN supported these changes.</div></div><hr />

My enchanter bot would still get summoned after tashing right away sometimes, despite having used incite on the mob :(. Hell I don't understand it.

<br />
This has been exactly what I have been seeing.  Most groups it is simply amazing(I still am not tired of hearing casters tell me how 'I just can't pull agro off you.  I should have been summoned in doing this'), others it is like no change from the old system.  Overall tho I am very happy with the changes, and the changing perception of others.  This has been a great week for warriors.</div></div><hr />

Against the stuff I was fighting in PoM, I used to be able to slow at about 92-93% and usually not get aggro.  With Incite, that jumped up to 97-98%.  That plus actually being able to use my offensive discs makes me happy enough with the patch. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason there is no aggro lock from it, is because aggro is probably a composite of things such as :<br />
<br />
- pure hate (think incite, SK +hate spells, EB and anger procs in this area, pure hate, no damage or other effects)<br />
- range bonus/penalty (you get more aggro when you are near it)<br />
- damage potential (those who hurt most, gets more aggro .. DUH)<br />
- probably a few things more.<br />
<br />
If you want good aggro, you will want to hit as many areas as possible, as early as possible.<br />
Incite only covers one area.<br />
I think Slows covers 2 areas, pure hate &amp; effect.<br />
Same with snare and stuns probably also pure hate + effect.<br />
<br />
That would explain why some still grab your aggro now and then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are still people who want paladins for groups, just for the sole fact that they never learned to controll aggro at all.<br />
<br />
But then again.... I did have a friend offer to trade me his bard for my war, so I geuss the changes are ok.<br />
<br />
I'm not loving how incite is atm, we need to budget, and if we use it alot, good luck ever busting a disc. <br />
<br />
I personally believe that a 150 cost would be more than enough, and allow for some felxibility in discs ect.  <br />
<br />
If openings use endurance, this system of careful balance is thrown out the window completely.</div></div><hr />

I've used it briefly, before packing the car to come up to my Dad's house for the hols.  The setting was trivial, a trio of us mucking about in the PoJ caves, and I was with guildies who understand aggro (and avoid it).<br />
<br />
I loved it, it made my job that much easier.  It wasn't a lock, but it was reasonable - the cleric didn't gank aggro with every CH, the rogue didn't spin the MOB with every high backstab, even during a long round with a bad pull where I dumped it on a few &quot;stand-by&quot; mobs and a couple of discs as well.  I wasn't having a problem with burning too much endurance.  A wonderful boost for me, I'm quite pleased.  I think I lost aggro twice.  The caves are small enough that I pulled with Incite, the range may have been working in my favour.<br />
<br />
A nice boon, I was quite pleased.  As I was with the new sparkles from my SotB :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite is pretty much aggro lock if you have good aggro weaopns (though I suppose my standard of 'good' isn't quite the same as yours) when you're dealing with a group that has some remote ideas of what they're doing.  But even with not so good weapons Incite eliminates the slow aggro problem at least with shamans.  Haven't tested with the tash/slow, and I don't think it'll be enough to overcome tash + slow but very few things can.<br />
<br />
Of course it isn't going to help you if your group is trying to kill themselves.  You need a Paladin to deal with that.  The cost is about right, maybe even too cheap.  It looks like you can use about one incite per minute without losing significant endurance and that's plenty.  Most mobs don't even die that fast.  If I'm pulling with Incite, it'd wear off halfway before the mob's even dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aielman</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found it to work quite well in most situations.<br />
<br />
Let me give you an example. Today we were in BoT towers messing around and the mini raid leader made an sk MA. I didn't see that message, and he wasn't using an assist message, so being the best equipped tank, I was taunting.<br />
<br />
Using a VDD with anger3, and hitting incite when it popped, I was stealling agro from him about 60 to 75% of the time. Mob kept pingponging back and forth. He then started to get more agro so I switched to an EoE auged with anger3 in main hand and a standard BoC offhand. I hit incite sporadically and again took agro about 60 to 75% of the time. <br />
<br />
Now this is a nearly fully time equipped SK with the SK time weapon we're talking about here...he actually has a tad more hp than I do, and yet even when he was trying his best, I was stealing agro from him consistently and holding it a good portion of the time.<br />
<br />
I can live with that.<br />
<br />
The one question I had is this...Has anyone noticed a decrease in hits when using a 2h weapon, or even dual wielding, when using Incite? It seems like my hits decrease dramatically, almost as if I'm slowed. It's most noticeable when I'm using my VDD...after encite wears off, I seem to hit more.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this or is it just my imagination?<br />
<br />

I never wanted aggro lock(would be nice, but overpowering).  So I am happy  so far.  Just get the servers working!  MT deaths on a raid today caused it to be called early because they zoned to server select, and kept getting 1017.   Gotta get a rez later :/</div></div><hr />

Since the aggro they pull with just their DPS spells is already plenty for most situations (certainly on par with high end warriors) it seems like most SKs are satisified just doing damage with spells instead of chain casting Fear like Paladins do with stuns.  The SKs I group with usually pull slightly less aggro than I do actually, though they can get aggro if they're willing to dump more mana on a mob, but since their DPS spells aren't free unlike Paladin stuns, I don't see any SK want aggro for the sake of proving they can get it.  And, like I said, if they really want that aggro, they always have Fear, but it has to be a really bad group for a SK to have the need to use Fear.</div></div><hr />

My only complaint is that in a fast pulling group where I use Incite about every 30 seconds the drain on endurance due to Incite almost exactly matches my endurance regen.  So if I use 1 discipline then I'm at around 50% endurance and it never goes up from there.  If I use another discipline then I'm out of endurance and it never goes up from there.  It works out if you don't use Incite on every mob but I think the intent was that we should be able to use it once on just about every mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't kill stuff that fast to warrant using Incite every 30 seconds in PoP unless you've some ridiculous DPS sitting around.  If you actually have that kind of DPS it wouldn't be necessary to have aggro anyway because it's only going to beat on the wrong person for no more than 30 seconds.  I was in a standard decent DPS group in PoEarth and mobs take around 1 minute to die but I don't see a group having twice the DPS, and besides if you actually do then you'll have to start pulling stuff across the zone anyway so you still wouldn't have to use Incite that fast because you'll have to wait for your puller to come back from the other side of the zone.<br />
<br />
Now for LDoN you can potentially get enough mobs if your puller is sloppy but that's a problem of pulling not that Incite doesn't work.  Once again, if your group can kill a mob every 30 seconds, then you already have too much DPS anyway and who's tanking should be irrelevant.  You just don't get that much DPS without having a corresponding amount of gear.  A group that is capable of killing 2 mobs per minute in LDoN needs not aggro control.</div></div><hr />

My endurance was very slowly being depleted through just the use of Incite.  If I popped Fellstrike then I'm sitting at around 50% endurance and it continues to go down.  If I pop another disc I'm at 0% and can't use anything including Incite for awhile.  We did have a high DPS group but nothing amazing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Noticed that incite worked better in BoT when I had the time to pop an arrow on inc and remembered new hotkey lineup and got attack on first before hiting incite than in the confined space of dungeon where sometimes I didn't have an arrow shot on inc (Ranger pulling) Sometimes I hit incite before attack (Cause I moved some hotkeys and kept using the old order just from unconscious habit) and the results were not as nice as when I had attacked then hit incite.<br />
<br />
I know regular taunt was only supposed to suceed ~ 60% of the time or so, but the number of fail messages I got was astounding. One day isn't a big enough sampling with the wacky EQ RNG, but I'll be keeping an eye on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
people keep saying that, and its nonsense. a good group can burn through a lvl 65 hard adventure at a pretty fast pace. i have personally beat hards in as little as 22 minutes. regardless of how much dps your wizard puts out or how uber your rogue's poker is, that wizard rogue cleric or enc will not be able to tank those 900+ hitting mobs in any practical manner, not to mention it lessen's those classes abilities to do their jobs everytime they get hit. <br />
<br />
that being said, i have only gone OOE a couple of times. one time i wasnt paying attention to my END and used multiple discs along with incites on a hard, and the other time it was a normal with just me two rogues and a bst(rest of group locked out due to server problems) and i was having to use healing will. however i do sometimes see my END drop slowly but steadily on hards just from incite, and i only incite once per mob and skip it on some mobs. its not currently a problem, but once more stuff that uses END goes live it might be.</div></div><hr />

I'm fairly certain Endurance doesn't regen as fast while you are meleeing, its like half of normal non combat regen (1%/time), even using incite constantly your endurance will slowly drop over time.</div></div><hr />

That's basically 2 mobs a minute.  That's such a staggering amount of DPS that if you did this without charm, then yes every one in your member should be perfectly capable of tanking any mobs along the way that's not hasted or an assassination boss.  <br />
<br />
If you did it with Charm then this has nothing to do with warrior aggro anyway because the pet will never get aggroed and it would not be necessary for anyone else to get aggroed, as the pet DPS far outweights whatever gain you can get out of from having aggro lock.<br />
<br />
If more DPS didn't solve your aggro problems then you didn't have enough DPS to begin with.</div></div><hr />

i was just using incite during xp groups in ldon. now the timer on it is 30 secs and it works well when u are in the zone. by the time u run out of the ldon zone, incite is ready to use again. but i find that as soon as i zone or ld that incite takes 60 mins before i can use it again.<br />
<br />
after the 60 mins i can use incite again on it's 30 sec timer and everything is as it should be. i usually run 300 stam and the bar doesn't seem to move much. i also don't use any other disc's while xping other than the incite disc... if it is considered a disc.<br />
<br />
this doesn't seem right to me and i though i read it was a bug that was to be fixed in patch but as of last night it wasn't fixed.<br />
<br />
anyone else have this problem or is it just me?</div></div><hr />

I have never seen that happen.  Incite has always been available for me within 30 seconds.  Occasionally I can't use it due to lack of endurance but it's not greyed out.</div></div><hr />

 Seems that Incite IS affected by silence,,, can NOT be used while silenced. So, keep it in mind till they fix it and facing silence`ing mobs. Semi BS considering it`s considered a skill not a spell. <br />
<br />
 Whenever this is fixed can someone post it works even if silenced? So all know? plz/thx</div></div><hr />

An early taunt success and then all the procs do is give me some more breathing room.  I was across from a monk playing with their new super-speed disc and he was getting aggro consistently unless I fired off the Rage disc, but I can live with that.  Since the monk's DPS was running around 350 or so when I had aggro, that is understandable.<br />
<br />
I don't mind not having an aggro lock, that would make things too easy for groups and for warriors.  With folks who are a bit attentive overall DPS should be able to increase in a group (over pre-16 Dec days) and still keep the aggro on me.</div></div><hr />
