<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently got an Anger3 augment and I just can't decide which weapon to put it on. The guild I'm in doesn't raid often, and since I'm new it will be a long, long time before I get an upgrade that way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have:<br />
<br />
Sceptre of Destruction (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6090) <br />
This weapon does pretty well on it's own for aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wind-worn Handblade  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17792) <br />
I like the stats on this one, but the proc is next to worthless. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22009) <br />
Overall a decent weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22010) <br />
Also a decent weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17984) <br />
This one is good dps for a 2-handed weapon, and generates aggro fairly well.<br />
<br />
I also have a War Marshal's Bladed Staff  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19054)  but I like to use it as my non-aggro DPS weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, with all the choices above and being a long ways off from getting another augment, which one would you chose? And then which combo would you fight with assuming not putting it on the GSoT.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly if you aren't going to get another aug for a long time, and you just want to hold agro really well and do really good DPS, why wouldn't you put it on the GSOT?<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure I following the question here.<br />
<br />
Jakle<br />
<br />
The honest to God truth is that you could aug the GSOT, do great DPS (until you got GSot4W or something), get 4 procs a minute, have an alternate DPS weapon in the WMBS, and sell your SoD for some new armor or items.<br />
<br />
the SoD has Cache, but it's not worth 200k of armor Cache.<br />
<br />
Seriously. What are you going to be doing if not getting another augment for a long time and not raiding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I guess I'm wanting to use a duel-wield setup since I get better stats from it, and I have a plethera of weapons to chose from. Each one has it's good points, and after taking so long to earn the adventure points I don't really want to make a hasty decision. It looks like a pretty plain-cut question even after I read it a second time. /shrug<br />
<br />
edit: And there are few things left for me to buy that are an actual upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, then put it on your SoD, and use the Sword of the bloodsworn as your offhander.<br />
<br />
That is: <br />
<br />
2 Anarchy<br />
2 Anger III<br />
2 Planar Strike<br />
<br />
Per minute.<br />
<br />
The SotB adds 15 hps versus the wind-worn. Planar strike has a higher applicable stun level than Force Strike, and No annoying Knockback.<br />
<br />
Sell the CHoS and your wind-worn handblade.<br />
<br />
Jakle<br />
<br />
Keep the WMBS for non-agro and keep the GSOT because it is cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That makes sense. Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd tend to agree with Jakle.  The SoD is probably the best weapon out of that list, and it will kick ass for aggro with anger III in it.</div></div><hr />
