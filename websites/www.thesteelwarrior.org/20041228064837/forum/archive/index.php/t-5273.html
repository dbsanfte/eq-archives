By this time I'm getting upset and told him to let me tank, which I know is possible, I've grouped with sks that didnt take aggro from me and I've grouped with  pally's that told me that I'm keeping awesome aggro.  Any one have any ideas how to handle someone like that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a break and practice 2HB or something.  If the cleric get's upset, he'll let everyone know.<br />
<br />
You can't control everything, so learn to adapt to the things that are out of your control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just learn to adapt to any situation, when the cleric gets tired of running OOM, something will be said, while waiting to rez the knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several ways to deal with someone like this:<br />
 Discuss the situation civilly with the perpetrator and the other group members until you come to a resolution.<br />
 Discuss the issue with the other group members in /tells or in a chat channel. Someone else will probably do something about it.<br />
 Try to adapt, and hope the problem goes away by itself.<br />
 Kick him the hell out because he's a jerk and/or a moron.<br />
This is not an all-inclusive list of course - only a few options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tell him once to stop taking aggro<br />
If he doesn't make any attempt to stop, let him die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An easy thing to do is make it the clerics call.  Call your HPs and AC in group and ask the knights to do the same, then ask the cleric to choose who tanks.<br />
<br />
Once the group has decided who is tanking you are in a position to ask the knight not to take agro, and for the cleric to not heal.<br />
<br />
Pretty much any class can take agro from a warrior if they want to but they dont because they know they dont want the big golem who tripples for 500 to be beating on their silk wearing arse, thats why they have the big warrior in the group.  Knights taking agro from you when you are filling the tanking role is poor play on their part not on yours, get the cleric on yourside and hopefully a couple of deaths will learn them well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if someone else agroes... that means they can/want to tank. care shit. let people die. let people cry. let people rez. now you can tank in peace :)</div></div><hr />

Usually that is more than enough to settle things clearly, and if you do it before the pulls really start, you wont make them sound like idiots when you ask.</div></div><hr />

I tried this earlier it didnt go to well,  he went down fast, and the the mob munched the cleric,  and wiped the whole group, after rezes everyone was pissed and left the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whenever I find someone who seems to lack the simple, but necessary skills of agro management, I try to be civil about it in /tells. The most common problems are nuke happy wizards, other non-tank classes who thought it'd be a good idea to invest in a copper hammer, or shamans/enchanters who cast slow as far away from the mob as possible.<br />
<br />
Most people are understanding and stop over agroing. If they throw a fit, insult you, or just plain don't listen, thats when you can convince your group healer to stop wasting mana on them, but theres no reason to be an ass about it unless the person your dealing with is a genuine idiot and refuses to take your advice.</div></div><hr />

Why tell them ? I lean back and watch them running circles like crazy with the Mob on their ass - love Benny Hill Show :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
been in groups before with casters who could put up with a few smacks. really... if your gonna take aggro off me, and you can take the hits while i regain aggro, please for the love of god stand next to me so i don't end up chasing the mob all over creation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertburch</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to just sit back and let them tank, put up the two hander and start whacking away. If anyone asks why im not taunting, i tell them i cant compete with stuns and snares, if they want me to tank they have to let me. If they want it that bad, its all theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  If someone else wants to tank, more power to them.  I pull out my big 2H stick and start whacking.  To be honest, though, pallies are still better at holding aggro than warriors, it's an unfortunate fact of life.  (And I wield a GBOS with an anger augment and a CHSD, so it's not my aggro set-up.)<br />
<br />
2.  Monks that think it's a good idea to have a CHoS drive me crazy.  I had a guildie who insisted he knew how to manage the aggro, yeah, right.  They'd better have their finger on that FD key.<br />
<br />
3.  As for casters, my shammy is practically a tank in LDoN.  He will pull singles, sometimes doubles, as long as there is a mezzer in the group.  The one he tries to slow sticks to him like glue, but it's awfully easy for the tank to get the other off him or for the mezzer to mezz it, and most of the time we're starting with one mob slowed already.  A decent level 65 shammy can offtank a slowed LDoN mob (regular, not hard) all day and half the night using Quiescence to heal himself.  It really speeds up the group if a non-DPS class is doing the pulling, because you can start pulling while the mob is at 20% health with no loss of DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's nice if the SK and warrior can work together for a mutual benifit to the whole group, instead of competing.<br />
<br />
SK has HUGE aggro spells.  Use them as a benifit to the group, not to hurt it.  Pass that aggro to the character with the most HPs.  Don't hog it all for themself, and end up spending more mana in the end on more heals.<br />
<br />
When the SK in my group (same group everytime, all RL friends) pulls a mob into camp, he has already pissed the mob of a crazy amount with a few choice spells on inc.  The shaman and enchanter can do their things immediately.  The SK has way too much aggro for the mob to care about tash, malo, and slow.  Tuant from me, SK feigns, massive aggro in my lap, thank you Mr. SK.<br />
<br />
Only time there might be a problem is on multiple failed tuants in a row.  But after 3 failed taunts, the SK can feign anyway, cause Incite (even Berate) and my cleaves have already put me above the shaman by then.  So it's all good anyway.  And the SK can definatly handle a few rounds of tanking.  A complete heal on the SK every 6 mobs isn't too bad, and doesn't strap our cleric for mana in the slightest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my mind 1 of 2 things was going on, either way the person wasn't that bright.<br />
<br />
1) They don't know how to control thier aggro, and have managed to get that far in the game without having to learn.  They cast any spell they want when they want and they have not made the connection in thier mind b/c they are either to slow or don't care enough. <br />
<br />
2) They are extremely competitve people who feel like they have to &quot;mark&quot; thier terrirtory and show you and more importantly to them, the rest of the groud that they can hold aggro better then you.  <br />
<br />
As a small anectdote; I was down in CDb, the group makeup was cle,enc,rng,bst, and 2 wars.  The enc and cle I know in RL so they know full well I generally have no problem holding aggro.  So it was set that I would be MT since I had 100 AA's more then the other war. I had no problem holding aggro as we moved into the palace, but as we got in I started having a bit of ping pong between me and the other war.  But after a few minutes he sent me a tell and I knew why I was having a problem...the tell literally said &quot;Hey, do you wanna play the aggro game?&quot;. Too which i didn't really know how to respond.  I mean in my mind holding aggro is not a competition its a group effort in that the ranger jolts, the rog evades, and the other tanks don't taunt =P....etc.  So after a few seconds I haven't responded and he tells me that on the next mob he is going to steal aggro at 50% life ragardless of what I do to it.  Well the Bst slowed on Inc and I got a taunt off right then, threw incite on, and proc'd a good 4 times ( 2 Spike Driver procs, 2 Dukatlos Procs) before 50%.....needless to say whatever he was planning failed or maybe he didn't try it. He never sent another tell about it and left the group shortly after.<br />
<br />
Point of the story is that thier are people out thier who think its a competition, they just normally forget to tell everyone else this competition is going on.  Maybe thier is enough of these people for them to think everyone knows about it.  Whatever it is, I normally group with my RL friends the cle/enc so its not hard for me to say watch aggro or find another group.  If you know you have good aggro just tell them they need to learn to control thier aggro or get the hell out.  If they are still having problems then they are probably type #1 above, if they get thier aggro in check, they are probably type #2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benlin</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the replys have covered this pretty well, I would address the end result of such behaviour in LDON.<br />
<br />
LDON is very much about team work, so no matter what position you end up in, MT, Puller Offtank etc you need to do it (its not rocket science!).  Those players, like the examples detailed above, when groups get formed find that their invites to groups dwindle considerably.<br />
<br />
Personally, I just mention in group X why are you doing/not doing etc and leave it at that.  After the adventure, when I can, I just avoid grouping with them again.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is for most classes, the impact of them being an idiot will hit them further down the road.<br />
<br />
I only do LDON, so I can see how in XP grinds groups might be more forgiving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">55 Warrior here. What I do is this: First establish who is MT.  If I am the MT, then i simply ask the other melee to please swap to non-procing weps (If possible) and to casters to please dont nuke tilll the mob is at like 70-80% (depending on the mob). Thats not me being &quot;Bossy&quot; its the group doing their part in helping me keep the mob focused on the MT which inturn results in a smooth running group. Slow/heal aggro may still occur occasionally so keeping the slower/healer alive is where the skill of the warrior comes into play.  As a side note, Up until recently, I was seeing alot of slower aggro shortly after I bring the mob back to camp. I was pulling with arrows. I tried pulling with Bellow and although the slower aggro still existed, it was far less than before pulling with bellow.  This seems to work well fo rme. It's like someone posted earlier, you sometimes have to be able to adjust things abit to get things to work. I find it helpful to get the rules set in the group first, then start pulling)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaboo</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no problems with knights tanking in my groups.  I tend to group with guild mates and most of our knights are 6K+ unbuffed with nearly all of their defensive AA's done.  I do feel a *little* like extra baggage when this happens since tanking is all warriors can do, but there isn't anything we can do about the aggro-lock that knights can generate.  I get my Blade of War out, do a fair amount of DPS, and leech the exp !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just group with the most uber people I can find and hunt them down from the four corners of Norrath no matter what they are doing. <br />
<br />
I use humor and the promise of a fun group and/or possible chance of horrible death to cajole them in.<br />
<br />
Once I get one of them in group, I name drop that person to make the rest of that guild join my group.<br />
<br />
Then I let everyone, including the cleric, tank a mob (which most melee usually end up loving since there are 3-4 other tanks in front of them most of the time on raids, and they never get a chance) and we win in anywhere from 22-37 minutes per adventure.<br />
<br />
It's a win-win. :)<br />
<br />
Last fun one we had the cleric would take one, the ranger would take one, the Beast would take one, I would take one, and the wizard would root and solo one. I think we had a bard too heh.<br />
<br />
It was pretty funny. <br />
<br />
P.S. A cleric that has the hammer that procs 114 point group heals from Time is really, really fun to play with.<br />
<br />
He actually congratulated us as the best group he had played with in a long time since we got him down to 50 mana at one point from going crazy.<br />
<br />
We pulled so hard the other day we wiped a time level guild on normal.<br />
<br />
We had about 12 mobs plus a named in the middle. We killed the named and two other mobs before we went down and the bard and cleric were dead in about 10 seconds. The pally kept us all alive, and the necro finally FD'd and looted the thingy after everything left.<br />
<br />
I never compete with anyone for agro. I just tell our puller to bring more mobs and never to mez anything.<br />
<br />
I have no problem holding agro on three mobs at once if the other melee are minding their own mobs and not touching mine.<br />
<br />
You just have to incite and proc on one mob, then get procS on second mob, then incite and proc on third mob, then they usually stay.<br />
<br />
p.s. I find that it is really easy to taunt off a bard-slowed mob.<br />
<br />
It goes Bard &lt; Beast &lt; Ench &lt; Shaman.</div></div><hr />

Knight tags on inc with high agro, warrior taunts off knight, rest of group unloads.  Trouble is many knights(and warriors as well) like to turn agro into a pissing contest.  I don't play that game, and if they want it, I let them have it.  I explain to the group that anyone who wants agro can take it from me no prob, and some one does, and rather than fight about it, I will just DPS.</div></div><hr />

Me too. I often find monks and rangers using it and and not having an entwood mace/stained axe of the scions which are both far cheaper on my server.<br />
<br />
And a knight (unless his hp really sucks to the point where he cannot tank ldon well) pretty much always tanks when I group with them.  I gave up that fight a long time ago. I just want exp and ldon points and people want to invite back a warrior with penis envy and who messes things up even less than a warrior who is not Mting.</div></div><hr />
