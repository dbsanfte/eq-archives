<br />
In general I agree with your sentiment Ninja.  However, people throw the McDonalds case around a lot.  What they see is someone spilling coffee on themselves, which any fool would expect to be hot, sueing McDonald's and reaping a big pay day.  But there is more to the story than that.<br />
<br />
McDonald's was systematically, through out the McDonalds chain, serving their coffee at 185 degrees, 20 degrees higher than the industry average of 165 degrees.  At 185 degrees, burn experts testified that 3 third degree burns, which are characterized by blisters on the skin and are the most severe burns, can occur within 2 to 7 seconds.<br />
<br />
McDonalds was aware that their coffee was dangerous, because in the decade prior to the case they had something like 700 burn incidents brought to their attention by customers.  Most of which they settled.  The person who sued McDonalds was a former nurse who said she only sued because McDonalds refused to pay her medical expenses for her injuries.  McDonalds representives on the stand admitted they knew that the coffee was dangerously hot and had no plans to change the temperature nor had they ever consulted burn specialists as to what a reasonable temperature would be for hot coffee so as to avoid injurying customers when invariably someone spills their coffee.<br />
<br />
The jury found that McDonalds had a duty to use reasonable care to protect their customers.  Serving coffee that could cause blisters in 2 to 7 seconds if it came in contact with skin was not seen as exercising due care.  The fact that McDonalds was aware of the situation and showed callous disregard for the danger to their customers was deteremind to be willful, wanton, and reckless conduct, a form of negligence (a legal catagory allowing punitive damages).  Punitive damages are damages that are intended to punish the person or persons at fault and to influence them and others to change their behavior.  The jury leveled a judgement of something like 2.5 million dollars against McDonalds, which was the value of two days worth of coffee sales.  The intention being of course to convince McDonalds to turn down the temperature on their coffee urns to a more reasonable level and stop burning the crap out of their customers.<br />
<br />
Upon appeal I believe the judgement was actually reduced into the neighborhood of $400,000.  Still a hefty chunk of change, but hardly anything to McDonalds.<br />
<br />
In the end, I agree that we as individuals have to take a certain level of responsibility for ourselves and our actions.  I don't think that means that people should be able to hand us boiling cups of liquid through the drive through window knowing that if we should accidentally spill it on ourselves we're going to get the shit burned out of us.  There is hot and there is hot, McDonalds coffee was way too damn hot and they knew it.  And they didn't care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was really using it as an example of the fact that people don't want to take responsiblity for anything. I could also cite the people suing fast food chains for making them fat, the mother who says her skits son died because of Everquest, and people who don't know that eating too much ice cream makes you fat.<br />
<br />
Seriously, a class action suit=pure gold these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, Ninja, and if you are using the McDonald's case as an example of McDonald's not wanting to take responsibility for something, then you got a good example there.  <br />
<br />
I don't think you read Glatius' post.  The truth is that many of the sued companies are the biggest users and abusers of &quot;personal responsibility.&quot;  I wrote up a brief bullet point on the McD case a while ago for another site and cut-n-paste it here for, you know, the helluvit.<br />
<br />
1. The old woman was not driving her car, her grandson was.<br />
2. The car was parked when the coffee was spilled.<br />
3. The woman suffered third degree burns over 6% of her body and was hospitalized for 8 days for skin grafting and later debridgement treatments. <br />
4. The woman sought to settle the case for $20,000 (1/10th her real compensatory damages) but McDonald's refused.<br />
5. Over 700 people reported claims of burns similar to this womans' burns to McDonalds in 10 years prior to this case.<br />
6. McDonald's coffee is held at a temperature about 60 degrees hotter than (or almost half again as hot as) coffee served at home. If McDonald's coffee was held about 30 degrees colder, it would not cause the type of burns it did since the extent of the burn relative to that temperature decreases exponentially. <br />
7. The jury awarded the woman $200,000 in compensatory damages and it was later reduced to $160,000 (i.e. actual damages caused by the burns, cost of surgery, etc). The jury also awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages, which equals about two days of McDonald's coffee sales. The point of the punitive damages was not to award a little old lady, it was to punish a company that knew for over a decade that people were being burned, purposefully served its coffee much hotter than normal and in fact hotter than was possible to immediately drink, and refused to change its temperature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As for the actual topic of this post,  I think its sad and sickening.<br />
<br />
But I do think that many players take this game far too seriously, probably myself included.  I'm actually a member of the EQ Widows, not because I am an EQ Widow, but to give me some perspective as to how &quot;the other half&quot; thinks.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of sad stories on that board.  I do not think Sony is responisible for what happens to these people and their relationships.  The people are.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Sony has done something very recently to the game that I think we can all agree gives it a far more &quot;addictive&quot; quality.  What is that? Flags.  Sony instituted Flags and when you are not playing with your guild 24/7 you risk the chance of missing that progressive Flag.  And when you miss that Flag, you cannot progress with your friends.  So the system, regardless of why it was originally implimented, has led to folks playing a whole helluva lot more and actually being anxious to log off for fear they may miss the progression.  That was a mistake imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree, people don't want to take responsibility for anything.  And class action suits do equal pure gold in many cases.  But there are reasons for that.<br />
<br />
Take for example the case of Ford Motor Corporation and the Pinto with the rear gas tank.  Now, Ford realized that putting the gas tank in the rear of the car, outside the frame, was a dangerous thing to do.  They even knew that is would cause deaths from time to time when a rear end impact caused a fire or explosion.  And they had their accountants sit down and figure out that they were better off financially settling the average number of wrongful death suits they'd get each year than in recalling and/or re-engineering the car.  They made a money decision that would kill people.   Manufacturers have a duty to the public not to put their lives into unreasonable peril just to make a buck.  And companies found doing that deserve to get the legal bejesus beat out of them.<br />
<br />
But who is better able to defend themselves in a law suit?  You as an individual or Ford Motor corporation with billions of dollars in resources?  And if class action lawsuits didn't reap huge rewards, who would ever take on a company like Ford Motor?  Or Firestone tires?   It is seen to be in the best interests of the public to allow class action lawsuits to reap large rewards because it gives lawyers incentives to take on the cases.  And that gives companies the incentive to watch how they do things in order to avoid class action lawsuits.   Ultimately businesses have far more ability to do harm than an individual.  And as a consequence they are far more at risk than an individual.  They themselves must also take responsibility for their actions as a corporate entity.  And since you can't put a corporation in jail, you hit it where it lives, in the wallet.<br />
<br />
As far as the lawsuit against McDonalds making people fat, I happen to have read the revised suit that was filed not too long ago.  The main point wasn't so much that McDonalds was selling food that would make people fat, but that McDonalds was systematically attempting to portray their food as &quot;wholesome good food&quot; which could easily be worked into a healthy diet.  Much of their advertising, rather than focusing on the truths of McDonalds food being fast and tastey, focused instead on trying to portray it as &quot;healthy&quot; or at least &quot;not very bad for you&quot;.   They are attempting to make the case that McDonalds has been trying to, much like the Cigarette companies did, deceive the public as to the extent that their product is bad for people.<br />
<br />
I not sure they'll be able to make their case, because despite McDonalds attempts to convince us otherwise, I think most people understand that McDonalds food it pure crap that is absolutely horrible for you.  But they might be able to make the case that the advertising was persuasive enough to change some people's eating habits.  And when people are intentionally misinformed as to the truth by a company because it will benefit the company finacially and as a result people's health is advesely impacted, many times the company is found liable for at least a portion of that harm.<br />
<br />
And the fact that the case focuses on children is important as well.  Under our system of justice, children are seen as needing even more protections than adults.  Therefore frequently the requirements to prevent harm to children are greater than those for adults.  And I don't think anyone doubts that much of McDonalds advertising is specifically targetted at children.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gazu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is it just me ... or are there way to many people out there that have studied the McDonalds case? Must be in college learning to be lawyers I say. As for the actual story ... being a parent of 2 wonderful girls ... theres no F^CKING way I would ever pick EQ over them. <br />
As for the people that protest EQ as addictive ... I talk with my family before I play the game ... I involve my excitement at times with my wife ( Which usually gets me blank stares ) ... Its the communication on every level that makes my relationship work. To pick EQ over your family is generally a case of something else wrong.<br />
I have played EQ for 3 years ... my wife has no interest in ever playing ... she terms it as a hobby for me ...  just as sewing is a hobby for her. She has her hobby and I have mine. I never ever let EQ effect my relationship ... just as sewing has never effected our relationship. Since then I have made several over 50 characters ... and my favorite ATM is my warrior. <br />
I dont know how long I will continue to play ... but who cares ... its a game not a &quot;Real World&quot;. If you feel that EQ provides more than entertainment for you ... maybe you should quit ... As I feel that poor little girl must have been thinking something along them lines as she was passing out from the heat ... hoping her mom would quit and help her.<br />

<br />
I'm sorry, but again, this is utter and complete bullshit, and is simply trying to remove the burden of personal responsibility from the individual.  Anyone can include McDonald's food, or any fast food, in a healthy diet.  They key, as with anything in life, is moderation.<br />
<br />
The individual who started the &quot;fast food made me fat and unhealthy&quot; lawsuit was a blue collar worker *plumber if I recall correctly*, who basically ate fast food all day every day, and began this lawsuit while in his 50's *still while eating fast foods*.  You would think that after noticing his increasing obesity and poor health over a number of decades, and a number of heart attacks, he would listen to doctors' advice and common sense,  and change his eating habits?  After all, he is an individual who was intelligent enough to become a licensed tradesperson, and be self-employed.  No, it's much easier to try and blame someone else, than accept responsibility for his own stupidity and laziness.<br />
<br />
Beer is also promoted as a product that can be included in an active, healthy lifestyle.  Does this mean that if I pound back a flat every day, I'm being 24 times as healthy as I would be by only drinking a single beer ?  I guess I can sue breweries for misleading me then too ?<br />
<br />
Back to the whole coffee thing tho, and the point by point notes that someone had listed about the coffee lawsuit, such as the woman wasn't driving, the car was parked, etc. etc. ...  Who fookin' cares ?  She ordered HOT coffee !   Is this the first time she had ever ordered coffee from McDonald's, and was so shocked by the insane level of high temperature of the beverage that she spilled it on herself ?   Or was it maybe the first time she had ever had coffee in general, possibly emigrating from Pluto and never having experienced a hot drink before ?   No, she was a silly clumsy cow  who couldn't handle drinking a hot drink.  McDonald's, from a &quot;what's right&quot; point of view, should have refused to cover her medical attention, as they did.  Sheer incredibly mindless stupidity should not be rewarded in any way or form.  From purely a business point of view, they most likely would have been cheaper off to just settle. <br />
<br />
When I make coffee/hot chocolate at home, I use BOILING water *I know, I'm living on the edge here*.  That's water that's approximately 213 degrees F.  I'm actually intelligent enough, as are any guests/friends/family that I serve hot drinks to, to wait a moment or 2 until it has cooled to a suitable temperature to drink.<br />
However, in light of this, should I make sure to refrigerate any hot drinks before serving them, to bring them in line with nationally accepted standards instrumental in keeping morons safe ?   The concept of &quot;thinning the herd&quot; has never been more needed.<br />
<br />
And one last thought.  I completely agree with other posters, who said that had the woman in question in the original post been doing almost anything else other than playing EQ or any video game, it would not have been covered.<br />
<br />
The whole idea of EQ being in any way responsible for this horrible incident is so ridiculous.  What should instead be focused on is the fact that the mother was a waste of a bag of skin and a shitty parent in general.<br />

<br />
In recent experience beer companies are more and more promoting drinking with moderation.  Don't drink and drive.  Use good sense when drinking, and so forth.  If instead they came out and said, drinking to excess in no way impairs your judgement.  It in no way impairs your reactions.  Heavy drinking is a good thing to do routinely, and it's good for you, and people actually believed them, wouldn't you consider they had some possible liability for lying to the public and convincing them that something was true when in fact it wasn't?<br />
<br />
I grant that with drinking, that's unlikely to happen, since the public is well informed as to the dangers of drinking, drinking and driving, and so forth.  But this did in fact happen with cigarettes, one of the reasons cigarette companies were hit with civil liability into the billions of dollars.  They lied, they knew they were lying, and they did it convincingly enough and people were otherwise ignorant enough to the reality that it impacted their decisions, at the cost of their health.  That often equals liability. <br />
<br />

<br />
Do people frequently spill coffee?  Yes they do.  Is it reasonable to assume that if you're serving coffee that some people will spill it?  Yes it is.  Is it such a fucking hard leap of logic that if over a period of 10 years you as a corporation have received 700 suits/claims filed against you for second and third degree burns caused by your hot coffee being spilled on customers that maybe you should take a look at how you're doing things and make changes?  No other restaurant was having a similar problem so just marking it up to customer stupidity is bullshit.<br />
<br />
If you designed a car that occassionally blew up when people turned the ignition key, would you say they were silly stupid cows that knew they were getting behind the wheel of a vehicle that used gasoline as propelant and should have understood the risks they were taking?  It is a CAR after and it uses GASOLINE which is highly explosive.  People should just assume that some risks and suck it up? <br />
<br />

<br />
Very possibly.  The case I'm referring to is the first so-called &quot;fast food&quot; case, which was an individual sueing 3-4 fast food chains for health problems caused by eating fast food.  And to comment on your case.  First off, as you state these are all minor children;  well, quite frankly, if they have health problems caused by excessive consumption of fast foods, their parents should have their children removed from them for again, sheer stupidity and laziness, of such a magnitude that it obviously impairs their ability *being generous there* to be a good parent(s).  Secondly, DO they indeed have health problems already ?  If not, I think the entire lawsuit is frivolous *which really, it is anyways*.<br />
<br />
 If instead they came out and said, drinking to excess in no way impairs your judgement. It in no way impairs your reactions. Heavy drinking is a good thing to do routinely, and it's good for you, and people actually believed them, wouldn't you consider they had some possible liability for lying to the public and convincing them that something was true when in fact it wasn't?<br />
<br />
I agree, absolutely I would feel that they would have some liability if such were the case.  And the same thing applies to McDonald's.  At no point in time do I recall seeing ANY advertising by them that said &quot;you should eat at McDonald's all the time because it's in no way bad for you, and is in fact good for you&quot;, nor would I have been stupid enough to believe it if in fact I had seen it.  The dangers of fast food have been well advertised for at least the last 20 years that I can think of.  Hell, when did McDonald's come out with their first lean sandwich, that lasted about a year or 2 before being dropped due to a lack of interest... 15 years ago, or so ?  10 maybe ?<br />
<br />
Is it such a fucking hard leap of logic that if over a period of 10 years you as a corporation have received 700 suits/claims filed against you for second and third degree burns caused by your hot coffee being spilled on customers that maybe you should take a look at how you're doing things and make changes?<br />
<br />
Let's look at that statement.  700 claims, in 10 years.  So obviously, 70 a year.  Now, if  $2.7 million, was the approximate value of coffee sold by McDonald's in 2 DAYS, at we'll say approx. $1 each, that's 1.35 million coffee customers every day.  That works out to approximately 500 million coffee customers every year.  70 out of 500 million.  No, I'm sorry, that would not make me make any changes at all. <br />
<br />
Last year, here in Canada, Southland Corporation (7-11 stores) had over 1000 claims against them from people slipping on wet floors.  Does that mean they should stop mopping their floors ?<br />
<br />
If you designed a car that occassionally blew up when people turned the ignition key, would you say they were silly stupid cows that knew they were getting behind the wheel of a vehicle that used gasoline as propelant and should have understood the risks they were taking? It is a CAR after and it uses GASOLINE which is highly explosive.<br />
<br />
Don't be assinine.  There is no comparison from a car blowing up when being operated as intended and designed, to spilling coffee.<br />
A more logical comparison would be,  would I say that someone was being a silly stupid cow if they were filling said car with gasoline while puffing on a cigarette, which then ignited ?  Yes, I would say that about them.   Or, say they opened the hood to check the oil, and disregarded all the warning stickers under the hood, and proceeded to put their hands into a rotating cooling fan, losing a couple of fingers.  Yup, most definitely, you're a stupid fuck who should have no legal recourse available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There has been advertising along these lines, they've got documented proof of it, I read a few of the samples.  And that is really the question, can they show that not only did McDonalds misportray the health impacts of their food, but that people, reasonable people, believed them?  I think McDonalds has in fact minimized the health harm their food can have.  I don't necessarily think that reasonable people have believed them.  And if the advertising wasn't changing people's perceptions and behaviors, then there really is no liability.  But that's really an issue for the courts to decide.<br />
<br />
Let's look at that statement. 700 claims, in 10 years. So obviously, 70 a year.

<br />
70 cases a year that were actually brought to your attention by someone filing a claim for compensation or a lawsuit.  There is no telling the number of people burned who just dealt with it on their own.  And you see, while you might not have made any changes, the jury decided that a reasonable person would have.  You don't match their perceptions of a reasonable person in this case, but what you would or wouldn't have done isn't really the point.<br />
<br />
A more logical comparison would be, would I say that someone was being a silly stupid cow if they were filling said car with gasoline while puffing on a cigarette, which then ignited ? Yes, I would say that about them.<br />

So, you figure handing out scalding 185 degree coffee out a drive through window and having people accidentally spill it on themselves is stupid on their part.  I see people spilling coffee as an inevitable accident waiting to happen.  And if in your example of the business moping their floor is concerned, if they mopped their floor and didn't put up a warning sign, careful wet floor, then yes, they could be liable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Don't be assinine. There is no comparison from a car blowing up when being operated as intended and designed, to spilling coffee. <br />

Well yes and no.<br />

There was a time when companies would create a design for a product and factor in hazordous attributes as a cost of business.  As Glatius is showing with the Pinto and &quot;unsafe at any speed&quot;.  The products themselves be it a car,  a dumping of hazordous chemicals in residential water tables as a by product or childrens clothing that was inflammable (I use all 3 of these examples as they are WELL documented as cases where companies knew their product was unsafe and yet took no action).<br />
<br />
The basis of these type of lawsuits was orginally intended to:<br />
1. Provide an incentive not to design hazaordous attributes into products<br />
2. Ensure that consumers were not subject to unreasonable risks<br />
3. Penalize companies sufficiently so they could not factor the cost of lawsuits into costs of products (punitive damages)<br />

Now I kinda agree with Zito on the fast food thing.  Any reasonable human being in this day in age knows that the calories and fat and just plain crap in fast food will shorten your life.  However, I think most people wouldnt expect coffee from a fast food restaunrant to tear a hole in you if you dropped it your leg.  Also in the golden days of cigarettes it was fairly well documented that the companies knew about the hazards involved, suppressed the information and knowingly altered nicotine levels to actually enhance the physical addictive qualitities. <br />

So its on a case by case basis.  Which is the whole reason we are supposed to have an unbiased legal system weighing evidence and reaching decisions that meet the letter and spirit of those goals. <br />

As for EQ.  I know noone likes to think that EQ has an element of social programming/psychology built into its design.  But answer honestly: how often have you needed to go do something else but not been able to leave the game because of a &quot;reason&quot; (Need that last blue AAXP, need that flag, need to do CR, need to ...)?  I think we all have at one time or another over the span of years.  The very nature of EQ is to engross a player in &quot;their world&quot;.  And you know what thats cool...I mean how entertaining is something that is not engrossing?<br />
<br />
Now I'm not sayin EQ is too blame BUT there are hazards to its design for folks who should/need to do something else with their lives.  Does that mean its that ladies fault she killed her kid?  You are DAMN straight it is.  Is the design of EQ a factor in that?  Yup it sure is.  Is Sony accountable for this?  IMHO no....I'd think by the very nature of the experience EQ provides that a reasonably intelligent person would know its immersive and time consuming.<br />
<br />
Personally I have limited my EQ time over the last couple years because I love my wife and had seen it take away weekends I'd rather spend with her.</div></div><hr />
