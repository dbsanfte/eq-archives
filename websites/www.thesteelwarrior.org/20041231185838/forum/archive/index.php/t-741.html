I'm wondering for those of you that have had both windblade and a GST which one would you keep if you could only have 1?<br />
<br />
Level 60, Warrior fighting in PoP tier 1 and luclin mostly.<br />
<br />
I'm the highest level warrior in a small guild and am the MT in about 95% of the exp groups I'm in and almost always on raids.  I've been using a windblade but after reading all the positive reviews of the greatstaff I am wondering if the hit in DPS would be worth the proc.<br />
<br />
There is no way I can afford to have both and my 1handers are not fantastic.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

GoT is WAY better than a Windblade, unless all you EVER do is damage (in which case, why did are you a WAR?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
*mischevious grin*  one too many hits in the head Baadan? :p   at least i know i'm not the only one who types stuff like that on occasion ;)<br />
<br />
edit: useful on topic info - i have heard from friends who have tried windblade and GOT that staff is better agro, though it was just what I was told, i have staff, never have had windblade.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zondelfinni</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The general consensus here is...<br />
<br />
Main Tank = GSoT<br />
<br />
Main Assist = Windblade<br />
<br />
However when I use either or, I never lose aggro... I used the GSoT alot when I first got it, and noticed a huge difference in DPS... So I played around for awhile, switching both in and out, and came up with this conclusion... If I am losing aggro to a Uber monk or rogue, put the GSot in and aggro is mine, but if you can hold affro just with your windblade, keep the windblade in... Like I said though, I never use my GSoT unless I am getting out aggroed, and that is not often... I belive with the right aa's and alittle haste, the DPS of the Windblade make up for the Proc of GSoT...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Windblade = 2211 DPM<br />
GoT = 2243 DPM<br />
<br />
So you have more DPS + Proc.<br />
<br />
Only drawback is increased Riposte Damage.<br />
<br />
Have yet to try GoT in an assist role as I'm nervous of the proc stealing aggro so can't comment on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gear</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sold my Windblade and bought a Greatstaff of Thunder.  I use my GoT 99% of the time even when I am just assisting on raids.  I have found if I let the MT get agro and dont taunt the proc isnt an issue.  Ive also noticed something really weird with the GoT.  While it has a lower delay than the Windblade it seems to take a while to &quot;get warmed up&quot;.  The GoT is'nt some magic agro machine like some people lead you to beleieve on these boards.  Just swapping in is'nt going to magically generate agro.  The thing still needs to proc to make them mad.  That being said it does proc alot more than any other weapon I have used.  There have been times when I have been assisting and the thing would &quot;streak&quot; and proc 3 or 4 times in a row(sometimes more).  In those situations I have always had to turn off attack and pray a healer noticed my health bar.  It does put a smirk on my face knowing that this little crack stick just took agro with no taunting over another warrior with a few levels and many more AA's than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was a firm believer in the Windblade as an agro and DPS weapon ... until I got a GSoT. If you can't afford to have both, then GSoT all the way and live with having to turn attack off some when you are not MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the last 6 weeks or so I've had in my bag o' tools a Windblade, Great Staff of Thunder, and a War Marshall's Bladed Staff. <br />
<br />
I use the GSoT for when I have to keep aggro. With good DEX for procing, it works the best of all three for aggro, plus packs a nice punch to boot. The only drawback (and it's mostly a minor one) is that its proc has a small knockback effect, so it's not the greatest tool for locking down a mob.<br />
<br />
I still use the WMBS a lot, especially in single-group exp sessions. It's got a slightly better ratio than the GSoT and is fast. If the GSoT is a little stingy with procs, the WMBS is a great alternative.<br />
<br />
The Windblade I used last night a bit for the first time in over a month. The hits are impressive, but it swings so slowly that it's very situational. For example, last night I was not the MA, nor was I one of the TM's. My job was to avoid aggro and do damage, and the Windblade helped with that.<br />
<br />
In literally 99% of all situations I've found myself in during the last six weeks, the GSoT or WMBS have served me well and I've not felt the need to take the windblade out of the bag. I find that I am asking myself if I shouldn't be selling the Windblade and getting some better armor with that money.<br />
<br />
If I could only have one of these three weapons, I'd pick the GSoT for overall functionality, with the WMBS a very close second. I'd pick a Windblade over a non-uber dual-wield combo (yes, even over a frosty/whatever combo), but that's about it.<br />
<br />
There are some situations where I can see the Windblade being top of the heap, such as against riposting mobs, but lately that's been less of an issue for me (though my warrior isn't in tier 2 PoP yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azeroke</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had a GoT for a couple weeks now. I havnt been seeing any neck-jerking aggro from it, but it does seem to hold aggro fairly well after the intial slow and such.<br />
<br />
Had a windblade a while ago when they first came out...wasnt all that impressed besides the big hits ::shrug::<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how I feel about it, the DPS seems fine and it holds aggro okay but the proc does not seem to be all that uber. Not like frosty used to be when I had it, it'd proc and mob turned right on you. Most tier2 mobs seem to ignore it lately. But after you lock in aggro it does hold it quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't used a Windblade but I have used the WMBS and GoT.  I definitely recommend the GoT.  Considering the lower price of the WMBS vs. Windblade, you might want to try to get the WMBS as your non-tanking weapon if you can afford it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used both and currently use a GoT.  In situations where it doesnt proc, the DPS keeps you close enough to the top of the Hate list a single Taunt normally gets aggro back.  <br />
<br />
If you have a Chanter in the group, between SoV and boon the GoT will be procing like crazy and you wont have to Taunt except on very rare occasions.  <br />
<br />
How-ev-er, don't quote me on this but the GoT seems to be proccing a LOT less since the patch.  God forbid a Warrior hold aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the GoT seems to have a lot less proc lately.  It still procs a lot, but Ive noticed a small difference.   It use to proc continuously, but its lwoer now (imo).  Still procs like crazy.<br />
<br />
I had wavecrasher and a frostbringer combo.  I got the GoT and havent used either since.  So I sold them, and upgraded some of my gear.  Instead of swapping duel wielding weaps, I just switch between Windblade and GoT.  These two weapons are the ones to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gear</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I havnt noticed any difference in proc at all.</div></div><hr />
