<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">please say a prayer for the soul of, and for the family of Paul Johnson, who was kidnapped, tortured, and today was murdered. they stabbed a knife through his eye, and beheaded him. <br />
<br />
<br />
this wasn't a soldier. this wasn't an officer, or a visiting politician. this was an american citizen working in Saudia Arabia, helping their economy and just earning a living. this man suffered pure hell for the last few days and then death, why? for no other reason then because he was an american.<br />
<br />
may god bless his soul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CleohPatra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes I saw this on the news and it's sad that his life was taken. I can only imagine the pain and hurt and I'm sorry if it were me anger of his family and friends. May he be in a better place. A life taken for no reason other than politics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The way Americans get treated in the other countries is directly affected by your country's foreign policy.<br />
<br />
While I think killing anyone is atrocious. I also think that American government is directly responsible for these kinds of actions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I disagree Casai.  If that's the case you can make the exact same argument for why our government has that foreign policy in the first place.  Example: One could say that American foreign policy is directly affected by terrorist attacks on our own soil.  Of course the counterargument would be &quot;But that attack was provoked by &lt;insert percieved wrong wrought by America here&gt; !&quot;  It's a never ending cycle.  You're never going to figure out whose fault the initial aggression was.  Bottom line, no innocent citizen of any country should be intentionally harmed because of their government's policies.  They have nothing to do with setting that policy.  Period.  There is absolutely no excuse for what was done and nobody is to blame for it except for the animals that committed the act.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with casai on this, we need less war and more cloak and dagger assassinations of terror cells, that way we can say we are not responsible for the terrorists going missing, but we remove a pain in the ass that is costing us innocent lives.<br />
<br />
God bless his family, I am ashamed that we didnt send a team to go try to find him, we would have done it if a officer was the captive :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why are you blaming the government because a group of outlaw foreigners killed an innocent man? The blame for this lies in one place, the men who took part in such a senseless murder.  <br />
<br />
Its like saying its the governments fault people steal since they don't provide for them....<br />
<br />
Fact is there are evil and misguided people in this world, and they do bad things for no other reason then they are evil and misguided people.  Placing the blame with anyone other then the people who committed the act, does nothing but encourage similar attrocities(sp?).<br />
<br />
EDIT: PS, I agree we should be more covert and less blunt, in other words less war more cloack and dagger =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your part of... lets say PETA and they go throw paint on some people,and you have a peta shirt on, people will make fun of you, or even take a swing at you.<br />
<br />
That is the world view of americans at the moment, they expect the common man to step up and stop our pres from doing things they dont like, things we may not like ourselves, they fail to relise we dont have any real power, just a vote every 4 years.</div></div><hr />
