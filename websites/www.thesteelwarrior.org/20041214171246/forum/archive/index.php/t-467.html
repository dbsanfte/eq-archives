I've been plodding along fairly nicely until I got to around 170ish.  Since I reached that point, I've been lucky to get 1 skill up per stack of components.  I even picked up a geerlok to see if that would help.  I reached 187 this morning and skill ups have stopped.  6 and a half stacks of combines and no skill ups.  I've been making field point, wood shaft, ceramic vane, large nock arrows.  The triv is supposedly 202 according to eqtraders.  Is my old buddy RNG just being stubborn, or am I missing something?  I know I am only lvl 36 atm(would be at least half way to 38 if I hadn't had to go bail a group of guildies out when they wiped in Permafrost), but trade skills were never based on your lvl:(<br />

yes, RNG is stubborn sometimes, but fletching has been made harder at high levels ( nerfed skillup chances), and you are prolly near the level it start.<br />
if u don't plan to use fletching more than just to make your arrows, then don't worry too much, u will get 202 soon enough, and with gerlock you have a better success rate. If you really wanna increase skill, try to get dex or int or wis the highest possible, cos it influence your chances to skill up ( and only skillup , it don't change your sucess rate). +% mod only impact your sucess rate, not skillup chances or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way to get skill ups is to buy some cheap wis gear you can swap in and out when doing your combines. Hit up the baz and buy cheap wis gear thats pure crap and then bag it when your done. Fletching up to 202 is easy - just sit down and grind. Past 202 things get pricey and more challenging.<br />
<br />
If you wanna get skill past 202 I strongly recommend getting some wis gear though, and getting a kei or voq to help combines.</div></div><hr />

Up only about 8 since on many stacks (of note wis, int sucks I use blade of tactics when fletching so dex is good).<br />
<br />
So I blame it on the nerf.</div></div><hr />

I guess it was the RNG being stubborn.  I came back the next night and got 3 skill ups in the first stack.  Last night I found an MGB Focus in the Nexus and ran back to the fletching shop.  Took awhile, but I finally dinged 202 Fletching.  I was looking at the message boards at Eqtraders and it sounds like I'm stuck making bows or farming condensed substances if I want to get any higher.  But at least I got my first 200+ tradeskill :D<br />
