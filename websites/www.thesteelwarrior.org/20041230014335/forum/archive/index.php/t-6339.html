<br />
I thought I understood the AA progression that I was going to take, but GoD came out and muddied the waters.  I haven't spent enough time understanding all of the GoD AAs, so I'm wondering where they fit in my progression.  Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Here's what I have:<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3<br />
ND2<br />
<br />
Here's my progression:<br />
ND3<br />
AET<br />
CS1/CA1 &lt;- as in do both, but CS before CA<br />
PE<br />
CS3/CA3<br />
PD3<br />
ID5/LR5<br />
<br />
So, where do the GoD AAs fit?<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm choosing to do mitigation before avoidance, because I'm primarily grouped with my wife's druid as my healer.  Leveling out the spikes is more important to me than the boost I would get from big procs.  I am the MT in our guild, but the above overrides that!  Of course, one could argue that I should work on mitigation before HPs, but HPs seem useful in saving my butt!<br />
<br />
Oh, and before people suggest it, I am working on upgrading my gear. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Kainoa</div></div><hr />

The GoD aa's will cost a lot, so it would probably be faster to do the luclin/pop aa's first because you will get more bang for your buck so to speak.</div></div><hr />

I've done quite a bit of reading on the CA/CS debate.  As I understand it, (1) the damage reduction is nearly identical except for procs and (2) CA reduces the number of procs (can't proc when not hit).  Since I believe that leveling out the spikes is more important to me than reducing the procs (remember, primarily a druid healer), I still plan to work CS first.  Thanks for sharing your opinion, though, which BTW is shared by the majority of the people out there.<br />
<br />
Now, as for your advice on GoD being more expensive and thererfore working on Luclin/PoP abilities first, thank you!<br />

I did Run, regen, ND3, CS/A1, PE, CS/A2, then WA1. If you have procing weapons (all wars should) and having any sort of aggro probs, WA will clear that up fast. Just with the first lvl of it, I proc almost 2x more. I just incite on inc and turn on auto attack and I never have aggro probs again (yes I use taunt if the chanter is slower, mezzer, and tasher).  I don't see any other GoD AAs really being all the much more useful then the normal defensive AAs. Would say do sturdiness when done with defensive AAs if your HP sucks (like mine). Other then that, I wouldn't throw in any GoD AAs into the normal defensive line.</div></div><hr />
