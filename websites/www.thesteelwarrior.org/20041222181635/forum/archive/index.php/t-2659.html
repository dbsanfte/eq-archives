<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So yeah I was talking with a guildmate of mine about gear and stuff and he brings up how I'll always have a hp advantage because I'm an ogre and he's a half elf and ogres get more of a hp bonus per lvl.  So then I spent about a half hour arguing/debating with him about the only ogre advantage really is the high innate sta and no frontal stun but the whole sta factor is eliminated once you both cap out with raid buffs.  He proceeded to disagree with me though saying that ogres still get more hp per lvl cause of there race while I tried to tell him that this is probably just cause of the higher sta.<br />
<br />
So from there, I made a magelo to prove my point, lvl2 ogre war and lvl2 half elf war, ogre war started out with 144sta and half elf with 105sta  + crusty gear that made him hit 144sta also, then I put them both at lvl2, both had the same hp, then lvl60, still both had the same hp.  This would prove his point wrong but he accounted for it as &quot;innaccuracy with magelo.&quot;  I couldn't get him to believe me that there is no such thing as a special ogre advantage in the amount of hp they get per lvl other then that they may have more sta.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure hp per lvl or whatever is figured by a set number for the level + bonus from getting more hp per point of sta.  Heh please someone back me up on this one or correct me so I can end the damn arguement, heh I feel silly but eh.  He had the impression that innate sta gives more hp then modified sta or something.</div></div><hr />

the only things that effects HP are Current STA (counting buffs), LVL, AAs,+/-hp items and +/- hp buffs.<br />
btw, u can tell him the only problem magelo has with numbers is the AC of a monk or a iksar. All other numbers are exact, if there is an erreor it is not more than 1, because magelo is still trying to figure where EQ does the rounding (up or down)</div></div><hr />

Haas always gets right to the point :)<br />
<br />
But he's right.  Your guildmate is wrong.</div></div><hr />

They are always off by as much as + or - 10 and ti changes around everytime my gear changes.<br />
<br />
I am Wizard so perhaps that has something to do with it. (low defense skill maybe different formula, base str only 75, something like that).</div></div><hr />
