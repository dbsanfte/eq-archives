Are all the defensive AA's a requirement (in your guys opionon) for this or not.  I normally play w/ the camera in chase or outer 3rd person veiw and I notice that usually I am the first to notice adds most times and cna jump on them.  The big probelm I see is that raid buffed I am topping out at 7800ish hps and have geared my aa's toward offensive rather then def.</div></div><hr />

The few times I have tried to pick up adds I get agro and smoosh cause the only heals i got were from a BL in my group.</div></div><hr />

oops! Work on those defensive aa's :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My guild always designated a MT/ST, but our groups always had at least 1 healer. Get a hotkey in your raid channel that says I AM TANKING %T NOW! or something along those lines. If you engage a mob, hit it. If you don't get heals within about 2-3 seconds, hit it again. If you don't get healed at all, wait until the next time and spam it 4-5 times in a row. Healers really don't want you to die, but they are busy folks. Just let the world know you're tanking, and you should get your heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Our healers seem to focus on healing all the wars&quot;<br />
<br />
Fix that.  Your healers should focus on healing people who are damaged.  Assist healing is your friend.  A good  healer will notice when a mob takes off, assist heal, and heal whoever it's hitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When my guild got into elementals, we started using an &quot;offtank group&quot; to handle run of the mill offtank duties while clearing.  <br />
<br />
It usually has 2 clerics, 2 warriors, a pally, and a shammy in it.  This group can easily keep three adds on ice for as long as necessary.<br />
<br />
You could easily substitute pallies and SKs for the warriors in this offtank group... but our philosophy is that knights have a lot of other things they can be doing for the raid... while a warrior that isn't tanking is pretty much just gimpy DPS.  So we use our knights in other roles and let our warriors handle the offtanking.<br />
<br />
If you are expecting people to offtank these mobs without cleric support because the clerics are &quot;focusing on the MT&quot; then you're pretty much setting yourselves up for rezzing a lot of dead offtanks.  During clearing, the offtanks are going to be tanking mobs that hit every bit as hard as the the one that the MT is tanking... and they often are not debuffed like the MT mob.  Building an offtank group solved that problem for us.  We have tanks, slower/debuffer, and healers... everything you need to control an add.  The pally adds versatility in that he can help healing or tanking... depending on how many adds you're taking care of and how hard they hit.</div></div><hr />

Its what sepperates good healers from bad healers and good guilds from great guilds. Asssist healing means less death on raids more dps, less down time, better faster raids. <br />
<br />
On another note SK / PAl sohuld get all defensive (or atleast a good bit of defensive) before doing offensive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Out of the EPs zones, only Air contains a significant amount of unmezzable.  I don't see what's the point of offtanking something that can be mezzed unless your CC sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By designating a knight (or warrior) to offtank mezzables, you can reduce the number of cleric or enchanter deaths.  Better to aggro and maintain aggro on a plate class than have an extra mob on inc unaggroed if your mezzers have too many mobs to control initially, leaving it free to run to the healers.  You'll usually have more tanking classes available than mezzing classes so it'll be easier for them to grab a mob on inc.  Some guilds go about it in this manner, others stick with the mezzing.  I usually find it more efficient to just offtank most things rather than rely on mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What Derrict said.  Our encs ar ae strong team but sometimes we are only feilding 1 or 2 at any given raid due to RL things and such.  My guild has about 15 knights (more then our war team) and feilds atleast 6 if not all on any given raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Frankly, mezzing mobs is dangerous, and a waste. First, it puts enchanters onto the hate list of a mob in a big way. Second, a resist can very, very quickly kill an enchanter and move the mob into the heart of your raid. Some mobs being very hard to target can turn this into a very bad thing. Thirdly, it's a waste of DPS. Any DPS class can generally out aggro a tank while putting the hurt on a raid mob. Having 2+ active mobs in camp allows your nukers/dotters to split up their targets without having to waste mana lowering their aggro. It also wastes the enchanters' time and mana, which they could be using to nuke, debuff and buff.<br />
<br />
  Obviously, if you don't have the tanks or the healing, mez. Use it more as a last resort though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its what sepperates good healers from bad healers and good guilds from great guilds.  <br />
<br />
No It's doesn't at all.<br />
It leads most of the time to clueless morons who thinks they are god because they can F8 + cast_fast_heal01 but they can't heal shit their group or a MT.<br />
Communication between healers is the key, also not having clerics who are just  used to &quot;being CoHed / press CH / loot&quot; in EP+ kind of raid.<br />
Else for the original poster, I have seen some war with your kind of gear offtanking spider in Air relatively oky, so as some people said, make well aware in rsay that you are offtanking xxxxx, and/or other channels ( depending of guilds I guess ) and if your clerics communicate a bit, can read and are not lazy, you will stay alive.<br />
Also ask for DI / cha buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">long casting effecient heals are not for the off tank. i run into it alot some cleric will notice i need a heal and start cheal when im at 20-30%  a unlucky full round can wallop 30% off me. 9 outta 10 times i get walloped 5seconds into the casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We use paladin, sk, and ranger OT's, we just always have. Being able to generate agro without breaking mez is something that they do best.<br />
<br />
Let the knights yell at the clerics for not assist healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There's no reason not to mez anything that can be mezzed unless the mobs are utterly trivial to you.<br />
<br />
If you're worried about mez aggro let the Knights deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There's no reason not to mez anything that can be mezzed unless the mobs are utterly trivial to you. <br />
<br />
  Again, there tends to be more tanks and healers than there are enchanters. Clerics and tanks both make mediocre DPS on mobs, so they're best off doing their job. Also, more DPS = faster clearing = done sooner. Maybe it's just my guild's style, maybe it's our class numbers. We started doing the low mezzing, high STing thing in VT and never looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">mezzing is better 1) makes your chanters not want to quit cause all they are is buff whores 2) keeps your people disciplined cause they cant just attack whatever in the hell they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One enchanter can mez more than one mob.<br />
<br />
Mediocre DPS is still DPS.  You don't pull DPS out of thin air by just fighting multiple mobs at once, unless you count riposte and DS damage, both are going to be insignificant assuming the mobs are slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Any DPS class can generally out aggro a tank while putting the hurt on a raid mob. Having 2+ active mobs in camp allows your nukers/dotters to split up their targets without having to waste mana lowering their aggro. <br />
<br />
  From my earlier post. I'm not making this up; think about it. DPS classes can out aggro us, but they can't out aggro two of us. Casting concussion (without clicky EP pants), for example, takes mana and time. The only DPS you lose on STing multiple mobs is that of the healers. The tanks are still doing the same damage they would be. It also keeps, I've noticed, people awake. Tanks want to tank and healers want to heal. More active mobs keeps people on their toes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gobsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The more time you have 30melee and 20 casters standing around while a warrior raunts or a knight casts to make sure they have agro is more time that you have 50 pepople doing nothing.<br />
<br />
The more time your running from one mob to another the less time your attacking.<br />
<br />
Lets face it with a full raid beatting on a mob they die fast, unless your haveing a dangerous number of mobs pulled.<br />
<br />
Haveing mobs off tanked alows rangers to use bows and not have to worry about breaking mezzes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaltek_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think EQwatcher might help out some of the less attentive healers as long as they have others hits on and set it up for alerts.</div></div><hr />

Yes.  If your guild is in the elemental planes, you have zero excuse not to have them.  Exp is fast enough in fire/water that it won't take long.</div></div><hr />
