Short Bone Blade of the Grimling (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12627)<br />
<br />
I read everything I could about it on Alla's, extremely nauseating the number of pointless posts on that site, including looking at some of the AC quests and the AC strategies threads.  I couldn't find anything about where it drops.  The stats are kind of crappy, but since I can never talk folks into doing Shei and Korucust, I'd really like to get some halfway decent LT proccers.  If anyone has any clue about where I can get this thing, I'd very much appreciate the information, thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry, I don't know very much about AC, what ring event? He's not listed on Illia's so I really don't have much clue about him :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it does come from the ring event (which might explain the lack of info) it is because the rings have been removed from AC on the last revamp. I remember looking up some one groupable armor drops from there, some very nice pieces came from there, unfortunately all the post I've seen say, or otherwise indicate, that the ring event was removed or broken? on the last revamp of AC.</div></div><hr />

Take it with a grain of salt. Its just what I have read on Alla's while looking up item upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Relevant info: The Ring of Fire (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1569)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After some further looking, I was able to locate the mob that drops the weapon. It appears to come from inner AC which is keyed. Exact location, I'll leave up to the poster, I've not explored AC enough to know.<br />

Foreman Gworknop (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=9151)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Inner AC is no longer keyed, another thing that was removed with the revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sweet thanks for the info folks, very much appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

they were the one guild that publicly posted their efforts to get deep into acrylia when it was still &quot;endgame&quot;, or rather, was supposed to be, but it was FUBAR, reportedly, and they still dealt with it.<br />
that makes me believe that the event that dropped this item is no longer in place since the revamp. dunno if something else might drop it, haven't been to grimling in uh... forever... since i got my shard a long while ago.</div></div><hr />
