<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild leader was trying to convince the guild last night that Anathema (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52058) is a good enough 2 handed aggro weapon for raiding purposes and that because every warrior in the guild (except me of course) has one we do not need to farm RZ in order to get a few Blade of War (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25989) and instead can move on into Sol Ro and Elementals.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I was the only warrior online at the time and was severely outnumbered by dresses that just wanted earrings and crap.  From a raider point of view, I would think having just a couple BoW in the guild would allow us quite a bit more flexibility in what we do with encounters as we progress.<br />
<br />
Basically, is the BoW, from an overall guild point of view, worth farming if every warrior (and a couple pallies/sks) has an Anathema?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>haddion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A Anathema is fine for the level your guild is at.  When you take into consideration how many hours/days you will waste camping BoW's (unless your really really lucky) versus spending that time in Ele's getting molds/loot, its not worth it.  You can pick up a SEWS while rampaging through the planes that is almost as good.<br />
<br />
Also take into consideration the fact that OOW aa's seem to revolve around reducing offhand damage taken.  It seems OOW will reduce 2handers effectiveness which is depressing to 2hander addicts.  Two handers simply can not hold the same agro as equal level dw weapons.  They also do not have comparative stats.  You will lose out on a lot of stats, mostly hp, when using a 2hander.   The only thing a lot of 2handers have going for it are decent ac. The higher end you go up, the more 1hander's ac levels catch up.<br />
<br />
I suggest let your other guild warriors mt the mosses you deem require a 2hander, and simply worry about picking up decent 1handers and a shield.<br />
Then again what do I know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While I have every intent to get a handful of BoWs for my guilds warriors, our Anathemas are serving us incredibly well even in the Elemental Planes. Will the BoWs be -neccesary-? No. Unless your healers are all botted by morons, you'll be able to keep it off of them, and you won't die. Will they be very nice to have? Yes. They'll let your DPS widen the throttle just around enough to be noticable.<br />
 <br />
Once you bring down RZ once or twice, once you drop Solusek Ro a few times, there's a whole lot more out there than 'just earrings and crap'. Consider that in the time that it takes to drop RZTW for 2-3 drops, just one of which -might- be a BoW, you can shake down the planes for 4-6 pieces of elemental armor/weapon, and you can probably do it with half the forces. Except for the BoW, Rallos loot all has one issue or another with it, Elemental loot doesn't nearly so much. The BoW is an excellent upgrade from the Anathema, it just won't rock your world the way upgrading from a Xanamech Hammer and SotBS would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You shouldnt need more than 1 or 2 BoWars in your guild ... just make sure that your guild's MTs get the few that drop and you will be ok.<br />
<br />
Arathena is right ... you don't need more than what you have now to hold aggro .. but it sure might make things nicer and easier.  I've personally tanked every boss in EP minus the gods with BoC + anger3 and GBoS + anger3 with no real difficulty.<br />
<br />
If you work on a points system and your BoWs go to tanks low on the tanking totem-pole (and you dont plan on farming one for all) then i've said you've wasted your time as those shiney toys wont ever see any action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BoW is definately not necessary, nor is a two hander necessary.  You guys do have BoC, BFs and hategivers in the guild right?  Just use those while defensive is up then switch to 1h + shield or some other 2h weapon once defensive drops.  Lots of times I MT with just a BBB w/ anger 3 aug in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the replies, figured as much.  I'd personally love to have a BoW, but whatever it's not that important to me.<br />
<br />
One other thing I didn't think about that may factor in here.  We are a small guild and tend to do encounters with a lower number of people than a lot of guilds on Vazaelle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tell your guild leader to stop being lazy and farm a couple BoW's ;p</div></div><hr />
