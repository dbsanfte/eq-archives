<br />
I do the same thing. War/Clr or War/Ench.<br />
<br />
I just do obvious shit like close everything else on comp.  Clip Plane at 0, or 10 max.  Spells off, all battle spam off.<br />
<br />
When travelling I put the minimized toon on the 2nd View option (directily overheard).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khur sed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its all about lots of ram, a good video card, not too many models, and a good CPU.<br />
<br />
The one things that sucks a lot, is when one of them dies, it takes forever sometimes to &quot;unlock&quot;. So you will often lose both if one dies, as the other one will be inaccessisable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do it on a 1.5GHz, 512ram, 128mb 5600 Ultra so it doesn't take a super machine to pull off. I normally don't have Luclin models on, and I turn off others hits, spell effects, and do /showname 1. I also turn down clip plane and sky if I need to but for the most part I have very little lag except when you'd expect it. I have run 3 accounts at once during the Fabled camps and didn't have much trouble with a decent amount of people crammed into a small space.<br />
<br />
The toughest thing about playing on one box is that the cursor will freeze if you zone on one char and alt tab to the other. A way to avoid that is aiming your self at a zone then alttabbing to the other char so you zone in the background instance which keeps control of your cursor, but makes the zone take longer.<br />
<br />
Also, obviously, everything happens faster on the focused instance so when loading up the second char, make sure to keep that instance focused or it will take forever to load.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chubz Drago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I run a Dell Dimension 4400 P4 1.56 GHz, 768 MG DDR Ram, 64 MX Video Card (what's lacking).<br />
<br />
Using EQW I have my settings such that I can my Warrior, Cleric, and SK on my main box; my laptop running the Wizard.<br />
<br />
All models off (except Erudite / Horse for cleric, and Human / Horse for wizard).<br />
<br />
Spells Off.<br />
<br />
Sound Off (key.. sound is intense memory intense)<br />
<br />
Other Programs Off (yahoo IM however stays on)<br />
<br />
Graphic Quality at low setting<br />
<br />
Dynamic Lighting off..<br />
<br />
If it can be turned off it is basically</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use EQwindows and 3 box regularly on one PC. Same advice as above, low detail, sound off, spells off, models to a minimum. Each EQ session will take around 300Mb, runs reasonably well. Always remember the &quot;lag&quot; people talk about on the boards isn't actually network lag, its lack of frame rate, with a fast enough graphics card most of it can be eliminated.<br />
<br />
Also setup some hotkeys e.g. cleric<br />
<br />
/target tankname<br />
/pause 5<br />
/cast 1 (CH for example)<br />
<br />
You need the pause as it can take half a second to target.<br />
<br />
My spec: P4 2.8 1Gb ram 9800 pro 128mb</div></div><hr />

The Expo zones aren't that bad for lag!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've just been running 2 instances of EQ at times when I need 3rd character around for some reason (no actual combat involved on the 3rd toon) and I've found it to be extremely buggy.  Sometimes I won't be able to pull up one of the windows without closing the other, and sometimes EQ just completely craps out when I tab out, so I dunno if I'd really want to rely too much on 2 boxing on one comp.  Spending the extra grand for an actual 2nd machine to 2 box with is the way to go if you're serious about doing it in my opinion.  EQ is just too much of a  resource hog to hope it runs reliably alone, let alone with another instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khur sed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I often 5-6 box with my 3 comps, as you can see in my sig, I own 3 accounts, each with a war/cler/enc, I exp in fire alone, or earth/sol ro for cash.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing is, in my oppinion, the set up, meaning getting to where you want to go can take a bit of planning and doing. Like going to reparm castle in fire's second castle is quite a walk when you are running 5 toons there. My main issues is the firgging destruction of auto follow with 105kpp horses since they added direct X 9.0, back before that my toons all followed admirably well on their super fast horses, now they get stuck everywhere, its a total nightmare.<br />
<br />
Once I'm set up however, the exp flows, and no one logs off on you, you decide who does what, and all the loot is yours :)<br />
<br />
However, after dinging 70, I've stopped 5 boxing, and I mainly do 3 box, one EQ on each of my three comps, and just invite guildies along for fat exp, they love it, and they really appreciate it, especially my friends warriors who have a hard time getting groups.<br />
<br />
Hardest part about multi boxing in my oppinion, is trying to run 2 melee, because melee are very time consuming to be efficient, you need to place them correctly, and make sure they aren't out of range. I prefer 1 melee +2-4 casters, makes it so much easier, just click assist, nuke, debuff pet attack, etc...<br />
<br />
My 2 pentium 4 2.53ghz 1gig ram, can run 3 EQW session with no problem, but my celerin 2.5ghz is not doing as well, maybe get it another 512meg ram would fix it, before oow it didn't lag that much.<br />
<br />
I have a FX5700 256mb, a GeForce 4 ti4600 128mb, and a GeForce 3 64mb.<br />
<br />
RAM is always good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ALK627</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">HI.. I take it you boxing on same computer with window method so u need at least 1.5 g ram , or on the options menu when u start eq elimnate some of the races to lower the ammount of memory used</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">with eqwindows and with everything turned down and and using the old eqplaynice i was able to do it with a 600mhz 192mb and a 9200 ati i was able to do fine unless hitting zoning was a pain but as long as you have both in a zone you will do fine, zoning is a pain in the arse and hotkeys and alt tab are your friend also use 2 different UIs because i messed up alot and started meleeing with my wiz instead of war  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did this all of about 3 times, hated it and died every time. Then I got a 2nd comp and now all is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its all about lots of ram, a good video card, not too many models, and a good CPU.<br />

<br />
Use alt tab to switch(if you're using xp)  You have to do a fix though on your computer to be able to alt tab in EQ.  Let's you switch characters on zoning and shit though so one can die and the other isn't left useless heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've been using WinEQ Lite with good success when the 2nd computer is busy.  I zone a tad slow, but reliable otherwise.  2.1 gig, ATI 9200 128mb, 1 gig ram, only female wood elf, female high elf and horse models on and everything turned as low as it can go.<br />
<br />
One other thing, are you disabling the sound of the 2nd instance with the nosound.txt trick?  If you don't, windows will spasam.  Well, at least it did for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have a few accounts myself, but never knew that i could use 1 box for 2 accounts!  Man do I feel like an idiot.  I have a P4 2.53 ghz Dell with a 9500 pro Radeon 128 (maybe 256 ddr can't remember) video card with 512 RAM.  From reading this thread I know I need to upgrade to 1gig of RAM.  What else do I need to install on my computer in roder for this to work?  I don't have 2 sets of discs to install btw.  Please talk s l o w l y to my tech challenged arse=)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, I have 2 hard drives on my system.  I just copied the directory from the main drive to the secondary drive for EQ.  May sound strange, but I run a tad faster that way.  Just remember that both drives need to be patched on patch day, LOL.  <br />
<br />
Also, as I am running XP home, I had to install the windows compatabilty toolkit.  It is soooo much easier for me to Alt-tab between instances than it is for me to Ctrl-alt-X (or whatever combo your window program of choice uses to toggle instances)!  Install EQWindows or WinEQ (whichever suits your fancy more, I use WinEQ because it's actually updated, unlike EQW).</div></div><hr />
