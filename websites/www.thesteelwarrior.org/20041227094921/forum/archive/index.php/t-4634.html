<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agmyleez</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found a large number of Clerics and Enchanters who will simply ignore tells for requests for buffs. I as a Cleric find this behavior rude and do not act this way myself. If I get a tell from someone requesting a buff I will always reply and say NO or that I am busy, but I always reply.<br />
<br />
Then you have those Clerics/Enc who say it is rude for anyone to type /who cleric and then send a tell requesting buffs. I myself have to ask the question, why not use /anon or /roleplay? Then I have to ask the question, well if your busy and a friend sends a tell asking for a buff how do your respond? I bet ya don't ignore them! Then you have those who will say I was AFK. Well if so, then why didn't you use /afk? And what about those people who run around POK with /afk on just so they can ignore people asking for buff requests?<br />
<br />
My point in all of this is that I think it is rude and have been having a debate on this subject with some other buff classes who disagree with me. So I decided to come to a class that uses said buffs and see what your opinion is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then you have those Clerics/Enc who say it is rude for anyone to type /who cleric and then send a tell requesting buffs. <br />
<br />
I have, at my disposal, the following classes.<br />
<br />
65 druid<br />
65 cleric<br />
65 shaman<br />
65 enchanter.<br />
<br />
I regularly spend time on each of these characters, and I regularly get requests for me to buff them.  I ignore people now because they don't want to hear my response.<br />
<br />
I did not make these characters, and I do not play these characters to buff YOU.  I do not give a crap about you, I am not wasting the precious commodity of mana on you.  I don't care who the hell you are, if you're not wearing my guild tag, you don't get shit, and you should be happy with it.  <br />
<br />
I pay 12.95 a month, exactly the same as the rest of you.  I owe you NOTHING because I chose this class, nor do you deserve anything for not playing one of said classes.  It is the ultimate arrogance to EXPECT people to take time out of their day to waste mana/money on your lazy ass.  Ignoring people isn't rude, asking for the buffs is.  Get a fucking group, there's your buffs.  Make some friends, they'll buff you.  I am not walking around in this game to waste time on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agmyleez</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOW such hostility there Haas. :p <br />
<br />
But I bet before you had so many characters you never ask anyone for a buff? LOL Also with this much frustration towards such a simple question I have a feeling your EQ days are about over. No one can possibly be so &quot;aggressive&quot; and actually enjoy EQ. And I bet your gonna blame your lack of patience or whatever you want to call it on everyone asking you for a buff?<br />
<br />
Not trying to start a flame war, I just don't understand why hitting /r and saying &quot;no, I'm busy&quot; is such a problem for people. Heck even I will place you on ignore if you show me your gonna persist and become an ass. But this is not what I am talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I had something called pride.  I didn't go around and fuckin beg for shit, I earned it.  I was playing the game when the high level people were few and far between.  If you got a Bravery on your level 12, you were tough shit, not this goddamned temperance/aego/virtue pussy society of people there are today.<br />
<br />
I just don't see the reason for people to go around asking other people to help them.  What the hell kind of piece of crap are you that you can't stand on your own 2 feet?  Can't do it without buffs? Probably shouldn't be fucking doing it then huh?<br />
<br />
LOL Also with this much frustration towards such a simple question I have a feeling your EQ days are about over. No one can possibly be so &quot;aggressive&quot; and actually enjoy EQ. <br />
<br />
Many before you seem to think that I'm too hostile to enjoy EQ.  They, and you, are both wrong.  I am hostile towards idiocy and laziness.  People are fucking retards.  They need their hand held for everything, they can't just go out and do things for themselves.  You may see it as a simple buff request, but I see it as &quot;Hey can u plz give a noob some spare plat?  My corpse rotted&quot;  It's the same goddamned shit, different level toon.  Learn how to do things yourself and stop asking for welfare.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand why hitting /r and saying &quot;no, I'm busy&quot; is such a problem for people. <br />
<br />
Because after the billionth fucking time of saying no to people, it gets old.  I don't play the game to buff you.  I'm not in this game to serve you.  I don't give a crap what your situation is, that's not my problem.  It's easier to ignore the request than to talk to half of the idiots asking the question.  I talk to a few occasionally, and they remind me why I don't.  BECAUSE THEY'RE IDIOTS.  They just don't get why I'm not going to buff each and every goddamned person who asks.  Seriously, if I buffed every person that asks, I'd do nothing but buff all day long.  Once you start doing that, people start remembering you and asking you again.  <br />
<br />
The simple answer of why I don't want to talk to anyone who would stoop low enough to ask me for a buff?  Because they're not worth my time.</div></div><hr />

I usualyl ask my guild mates for buffs and they happily oblige but in few times i have asked for them i have been replied to politely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh damn, almost forgot this steaming mess of crap.<br />
<br />
I myself have to ask the question, why not use /anon or /roleplay? <br />
<br />
Why the hell should I have to change my game style to accomodate for idiots? I LIKE looking at my name, level and class in a /who.  I didn't spend 300 days played to run around the same as all of the level 1 bazaar mules.  I'm a 65 Overlord, with a 65 Prophet standing behind me.  Anon is a cop out, and a completely worthless feature in the game.  There is zero reason to ever (On a blue server), to hide your race, class, level or zone.<br />
<br />
Then you have those who will say I was AFK. Well if so, then why didn't you use /afk? <br />
<br />
Once again, worthless rationalization.  I don't need to put up a fucking AFK flag to walk away from my keyboard.  I can run to the kitchen, take a piss, decide that my kid needs to be tickled, run to the store, get it on with the wife, or any of million things, and guess what?  I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU AND THE ENTIRE EQ WORLD ABOUT IT.  If I choose to leave my toon parked in a main hallway of the bazaar, or under a tree in PoK and leave for the day, that's my goddamned business.  I don't need to put up a flag that says I'm afk for dumbasses to figure out that I'm not at the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Oh, and then this guy raises a valid point -- <br />
<br />
I usualyl ask my guild mates for buffs and they happily oblige but in few times i have asked for them i have been replied to politely. <br />
<br />
Guild mates are a completely different issue.  If I get a tell on my trader from someone in my guild &quot;Hey, can you slap a c3 and a focus on me before i head out?&quot; that's a completely different issue.  They're my guild, I take care of them  That's what guilds are SUPPOSED to do for each other.  Random tells from random idiots, however, are a different deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agmyleez</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see your a very emotional type person there Haass. Just don't stroke out on me man.<br />
<br />
I do see your point Haass. However I do not agree completely. I am a nice guy by nature IRL. I have found that by being polite to an extent makes life much more enjoyable. But, If after replying to a person asking for a buff explaining that I am busy and they persist, I will then ignore them myself. <br />
<br />
But I stand my ground and say, flat out ignoring people is rude just because they ask for a buff.<br />
<br />
*edit* Oh yeah, I don't expect this post to change people who ignore such requests, I was merely asking to get a feel for what the melee classes think about such a trend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haas revels in being an asshole.  Probably not the best person to base your survey on.<br />
<br />
I voted yes because I assumed you were talking about someone in your group.  For random buff beggars though, I ignore them if I'm busy.  I don't think it's rude to ask if you're polite, but that person doesn't owe you anything, and you shouldn't get mad if you don't get an answer. <br />
<br />
And if you ask me for a peridot buff (I have a level 63 cleric) you better have a peridot if you expect to get it.  I don't want 11 plat, go get the dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see it as rude at all to ignore them.  If you want a buff, use /ooc, say you will pay and provide the dot if the spell requires one, and if someone is willing to then they will tell you.  If you do send a tell, then you can expect it might be ignored, since they might not be in the mood to talk to you, and theres no reason they should be forced to.  Also, from my experience, most people who send tells act as if it is your duty to buff them, simply because you chose that class.  It gets real old real fast talking to them.  I'd rather just ignore it, then listening to them bitch when you say no.  One thing I really agree with Haass about, is that it is extremely arrogant to expect them to take time to deal with you.  I am not as against asking as Haass is, as long as the person understands that they do not deserve the buff simply because they are there and they asked.  The person they are asking has every right to ignore them, tell them no, or agree to buff, and they should just live with how the person decides to deal with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mady</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Haas. I don't ever ask for buffs from anyone outside my guild unless I'm grouped with the buffer. <br />
<br />
Rolled a shammie and got him to lvl and skill just for sow potions, leaving some in bank at all times for that CR. Before the shared bank slot would do the old drop-on-the-ground exchange ;).<br />
<br />
The only exception, before PoK, was to buy the occasional port when a guild druid wasn't on or was busy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, only time I am buffed when doing things on my own is if I still have them from a raid or group, otherwise it's just what I can click.  Hope most warriors are the same, cause it's sad to go begging for buffs all the time.  It's like all those casters who can't do jack anymore without getting a kei first.  Personally, I'm leveling up an alt to group with my warrior and to do my own buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xahulz</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 65 cleric and 65 enchanter.  <br />
<br />
What Haas said.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those who played the game before there was quest armor, when wearing banded at 30 wasn't wierd and when almost no one had ever even had clarity.  This culture of dependancy on high level buffs is pitiful to me.  No, i didn't spend my first 50 level begging for kei.  No, i didn't need temperance to walk from one zone to the next.<br />
<br />
It's not so much that I don't want to help (I'm more than happy to buff an rez people I'm hunting near), it's that i'm too digusted with the pathetic kind of people i'm surrounded by to think up an appropriate response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only time i really ever ask for buffs outside of a group setting is when i need a dex boost for fletching, and even then i only fletch once in a blue moon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a Cleric as well and there are times where I'm just not in the mood to deal with beggars of any kind - At which point it's just like ignoring an OOC. And besides, I'm not a buff dispencer for every one around me, for the group, sure, but the rest are definately low priority.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it really, REALLY depends on how I'm asked and what is asked for. If some dude walks up to me and do the &quot;hail, dude_01's corpse&quot;  or &quot;gimme virtue now bitch !! omg rofl irl !!!11one!&quot;  then I will definately ignore him.<br />
<br />
Also, If they want some buff that requires a component and don't offer component / compensation, I'm not likely to buff them either.<br />
<br />
However, if some low level comes up and asks &quot;Could this lowbie get any sort of HP buff, please?&quot; then I'm most likely to accomodate him .. besides, a resolution buff doesn't even move my manabar.<br />
<br />
Just because I played pre-kunark with a tanished shortsword and patchwork armor until level 8 on my warrior, struggling up hill, in the snow with the wind in my face, doesn't mean they should too. Heck, the bare fact that they are smart enough to ask for a buff in a reasonable way is a plus already, compaired to the meatheads.<br />
<br />
And if the 1337 d00dz get angry with me and flame me ?<br />
I will /ignore them so fast you will see their heads spin as I fly past them going on my merry way.<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note ...<br />
<br />
As a Barbarian warrior, usually wielding a large two-handed axe or two one-handed swords, I often get asked not only for SoW and the regular Shamanbuffs .. but also for resurrects ?<br />
<br />
WTF ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Becaws ay canod speel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I voted I was thinking of the perspective of when you shoot a tell to some in your group or raid asking for a buff, in which case yeah its pretty rude if the person doesn't reply or in the case of a raid doesn't atleast tell you who to talk to for a buff if they aren't going to cast it themselves.  But that much should be obvious to anyone on this board.<br />
<br />
I guess I just haven't been in the position of needing to ask for buffs for so long that it didn't even occur to me when I hit the vote button that you were referring to buff beggars in PoK.<br />
<br />
Obviously warriors aren't going to get bothered for buffs very often (though it does happen - as a half elf I used to get asked for SoW even when I was carrying my epics) so aside from the few of us who do play a buffing class you are going to get a buffee's point of view rather than a buffer's. :p<br />
<br />
As someone requesting a buff if I were in the position of having to do so - things like needing a Lev because I logged on late and need to catch up with the guild in PoFire come to mind - the person being asked for buffs is under no obligation to reply at all and I wouldn't hold it against them either - I afk without putting the tag up all the time.  <br />
<br />
As a buffing class (I have a 65 chanter alt) I never use role or anon and I never use the afk tag and I frequently leave the character standing in PoK / PoTranq / at a wayfarers camp while I play my warrior and buff requests be damned.  Usually if I notice a request I am happy to buff and I dont accept donations any more, but it is more likely that I just wont see it.<br />
<br />
The thing that pisses me off the most is people who don't say what they mean straight up.  You get a tell going &quot;Hi&quot; or &quot;Can you do me a favor&quot; how the hell am I supposed to know if I can do a favor for you if you don't tell me what it is you want, chances are its some tard asking my warrior for a virtue or my chanter for a port.  I make a point to not reply to these kind of tells aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I need a buff from a stranger I usually send a /tell like, &quot;Excuse me, do you have time to toss me a virtue?  I'll gladly pay you 100 plat for your time and component.&quot;<br />
<br />
If I get a response, great.  If I don't, that's ok too... that player doesn't owe me anything... not even a response.<br />
<br />
I don't consider it rude at all if I send a tell to a stranger and they don't respond.  They may not be there, they may be busy, or they may just not feel like responding to the 100th buff request they've had in the past hour... who knows?   I just either do without the buff or ask someone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And most of those were people defending their actions for being the people who ignore everyone. :) If I didn't know any better I would swear those that replied with such hostility may feel guilty for being rude otherwise they woulda ignored my post like they do in POK when ask for a buff! <br />
<br />
With the exception of a couple, who posted they misunderstood the poll, it looks pretty even on opinins here by looking at the votes. I appreciate your guys opinions even if you weren't the most tactful at voicing them *cough* Haass *cough* :)<br />
<br />
There's always at least one Haass on every board. It's guys like him that give life and diversity to an otherwise boring world. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, I don't think so.  Most of us are helpful people who like to actively participate in this board, and state their opinion.  No one is covering for anything.  I don't need to defend my actions to you either.  I really don't care what you think of me, or what I do.  But I will state my opinion, since thats what this board is for.  I guess I should note that though it may sound hostile to you, it isn't actually.  Most are blunt and to the point, no beating around the bush.  Hell, we are warriors =p.  Also a message board is a lot different than EQ; I actually have respect for a good number of people here.  Buff beggers rarely deserve any respect.  There are a few nice ones, who are good people, but the majority are arrogant asses who think it is your duty to buff them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed, I'm not hostile about it, and I don't feel the least bit bad about ignoring somebody asking for a buff.<br />
<br />
Playing on test, the people that are guaranteed to get ignored are level 25s asking for Temperence.  They just got a free ride to level 25, a full set of gear that they never could have gotten for themselves, and now they want me to cast a peridot buff on them that I know they don't have money to pay for.  I could lie and say I never did the temperence quest, but I don't even bother doing that, and I don't feel the least bit bad about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cold calls for buffs are just as rude as ignoring the tells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some fuel for your debate ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you have those Clerics/Enc who say it is rude for anyone to type /who cleric and then send a tell requesting buffs.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think that's a bit forward. But not quite rude. They are after all, asking for something. Not demanding it. You have the choice to say no.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I have to ask the question, well if your busy and a friend sends a tell asking for a buff how do your respond? I bet ya don't ignore them!&quot;<br />
<br />
A friend is a friend. A stranger is a stranger. Don't expect people to give strangers the same response they give their friends. That way you won't be disappointed when they give you the cold shoulder. And you'll be pleasantly surprised when they DO treat you nice, as many people are apt to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you have those who will say I was AFK. Well if so, then why didn't you use /afk?&quot;<br />
<br />
There are many times people go AFK without putting it up.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO ONE: You're in PoK, you just logged on. The PHONE rings.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO TWO: You're sitting in the bazaar, checking prices not really doing much of anything, and your dog comes up to you, with that &quot;Take me out now please&quot; look in his eye. Your dog's potty training is still suspect. Better act quick.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO THREE: You're sitting at zone-line to lower guk. You just zoned in. Your newborn son has just thrown up all over you. <br />
<br />
SCENARIO FOUR: You're sitting in PoK chatting with someone. Those tacos you ate for lunch come back with a vengance.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO FIVE: You're sitting in Plane of Tranquility, LFG, and your mother/father/spouse/brother/whatever asks why you haven't taken the trash out yet. They are very angry and impatient, since they asked  you four hours ago to do that.<br />
<br />
The point? Shit happens. Sometimes you have to go AFK right then and there and don't have time to type it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about those people who run around POK with /afk on just so they can ignore people asking for buff requests?&quot;<br />
<br />
If they're running around PoK with AFK up ... odds are they don't want to be disturbed. It's probably a good idea to respect their privacy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A Enchanter once shucked off my buff request for a donation when I was on my Druid in Cobalt Scar. Ten minutes later he gave me a /tell that he died in Sirens Grotto and asked if I could give him a ride and a succor across - he'd be glad to give me KEI for free. I was too busy to reply.<br />
<br />
Yes, you don't OWE anybody anything. But if you choose to play like that it WILL bite you again, and again, and again.<br />

This board /= EQ.<br />
<br />
I've got 1800 posts on here.  I'm here because I want to help contribute to the community, and I do.  I've run my fair share of parses and given more than my fair share of advice.  <br />
<br />
However, I don't think i've spoken more than 1800 words to people not wearing my guild tag, in almost 5 years of EQ.  Why?  Because there are enough 12 year old's who think that the world owes them something for it not to be worth my time to converse with people.  Do you have ANY idea what a druid of porting level was worth pre-velious?  It was fucking ridiculous spam of beggars wanting to be picked up here and ported there.  There were many times i logged on Bourbon and there'd be a goddamned tell already on the screen when the world loaded, it would actually beat the message of the day.  <br />
<br />
My wife's shaman garnered a ridiculous amount of spam from almost day one.  As soon as you hit level 9, some people think it is your duty to sow them whenever they need it.  These are issues I was having to deal with before the majority of people even started playing this game.  Everyone who had a caster pre-kunark knows damned well what I'm talking about, and they know why I feel the way I do.  We WORKED for what we had, we didn't send random tells for it.<br />
<br />
Now, Battleblade...I'm confused --<br />
<br />
Yep, I agree with Haas. Deny buffs are necessary and then prove you were not telling the truth by going to all the effort to make a stable of characters to buff yourself. <br />
<br />
This doesn't sound like you agree with me at all.  <br />
<br />
Yes, you don't OWE anybody anything. But if you choose to play like that it WILL bite you again, and again, and again. <br />
<br />
See, this is where you're wrong.  I know certain things are necessary.  I don't want to walk everywhere, but that's fine, that's why we have the 65 druid.  I know that KEi makes life easy, but I'm really annoyed by those pussies that zone into PoK and have to say &quot;ANY c3 AVAILABLE?&quot; immediately.  So I took one of my friend's chanters, PL'd him to 60 and paid 40k for the scroll shortly after Luclin came out.  My shaman was my wife's, it just happened to work out that she picked the right class to roll with when we bought the game.  Everyone needs a cleric, and my clerics are 2 of my RL friends.  I know I needed these things, and if you think that my attitude bites me in the ass, you're wrong.  Unlike the majority of people in this game, I can get away with it, because you'll never see me asking for a port, or a virtue, or a c5, or a Focus, or a rez....I can take care of it all myself, because I don't want to have to owe other people anything.<br />
<br />
Bottom line...buff beggars = scum of the earth.  Use /ooc Paying plat for XXXXX, at least then you've got some sort of self respect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically the way it used to be is you ALWAYS offered to pay for a buff....and if someone ignored you/told you no you moved on you tried someone else ALWAYS offering to pay.  If you got a free buff you wrote that name down and made sure you could return a favor down the road.<br />
<br />
I don't know when folks starting expecting the rest of the EQ world to owe them anything.  I have noticed that buffing classes now can no longer EVER be non anon.  I can't even imagine the sheer hell it would be to play a high lvl cleric/ench....I catch enough BS as a friggin warr.<br />
<br />
So is it rude? <br />
<br />
I'd say no for strangers.  You are ALWAYS asking for a favor (even if paying)...the other person owes you zip.<br />
<br />
I'd say no also if it was a raid (most raids are well oiled machines now with mgb so in most cases folks shouldn't need to ask fer buffs if they show up on time).  But in most cases  an ignore is because the buffer is overloaded with more important details (setting up CH cycle etc).</div></div><hr />

If they ARE standing right next to you, the spell requires no component, doesn't require you to be grouped with them, requires an insignificant amount of mana, you already have the spell memmed, and you're feeling nice, go for it.  But really it's just an unnecessary inconvenience.  Unless you're doing something just barely within your abilities 1 or 2 buffs that aren't available within the group aren't going to matter.<br />
<br />
If I'm in a group without a haster I use my clicky haste.  If the only HP buffer in the group is a beastlord then the only HP buffs I'm getting are beastlord buffs.  If people want that buff so bad let them go beg for it in the nexus where people are standing around wasting their time selling that stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some times people go afk with out the flag.  I know I have done it.  Not that I try to do it, but some times you just forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lirelle</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not going to go as far as to say ignoring random tells for buffs is rude, but I also feel that it is just courtisey to send a quick reply.<br />
<br />
I don't play nearly as high level characters as most people who post on here (Shaman 37, Warrior 36, Paladin 26), so maybe I just don't have to deal with the sheer number of requests as others, but I always at least try to send a reply to ANYONE who sends me a tell.  Even if it is as short as saying &quot;One sec...&quot; to let them know I'm in the middle of something.<br />
<br />
Of course, I play EQ mainly for meeting people and chatting.  Quite a bit of my time is spent using EQ as more of a chat forum than an actual game.  If I ignored all of the tells that I received from random people, I would have missed out on quite a few of the in-game friendships that I have made over the last year.  Maybe if I had been more &quot;hard nosed&quot; I would be much higher level than I currently am.<br />
<br />
With that being said, I can't really blame anyone who ignores people who send random tells.  That is their perogative and they have that right.  <br />
<br />
The biggest complaint that I have about people in general is that too many people automatically assume that you are just some twink character looking for handouts and not a honest newbie looking for some guidance and a little help when possible.  As I said, I have only been playing EQ for just under a year now and I can't count the number of times that I've been accused of lying to people about being a newbie.  I keep being told things like: &quot;Get real, there are know true n00bs in EQ anymore&quot; or &quot;Just 2box your Alt and buff yourself.&quot;  As a note to everyone out there, not all of us have been playing EQ for 5+ years.  I am not looking for a handout, but a hand-up every now and then is much appreciated.  <br />
<br />
Is it so wrong for people to want to learn from those that have gone before them so as not to tread through the same failings and wastes of time?  That would be like telling your parents to Shut up and let you dig yourself into a hole that you know you may regret in the long run.  After all Wisdom and Intelligence is not only know how to do things, but knowing when to ask how or for some assistance when needed.  I don't think it is wrong for someone to kindly ask someone else (stranger or not) if they could drop a buff or two on them to make things easier.  Matter of fact, I find the general &quot;random buffing&quot; to be more rude than asking for one.  For all those people know, you may have been trying to do something very specific that their &quot;random buff&quot; just ruined three hours of effort.  Just like asking for buffs from players, you should ask someone if they want a buff prior to casting on them.<br />
<br />
After all, in real life most people get help along the way (even from perfect strangers) and society as a whole is better because of it.  And just because you got a little help along the way doesn't mean that you can't take pride in what you have accomplished.<br />
<br />
All in all, it comes back to the golden rule: &quot;Do unto others as you would have done unto you.&quot;  While nobody in this game OWES anybody anything, that doesn't mean that you can at least extend the courtesy of acknowledgment.  You'll probably get 10x more tells ignoring someone (as they continually repeat themselves) than you would have with just a quick response.  And if you're the person doing the requesting, allow others their time and accept the fact that they don't owe you anything.  Proper respect, shown both ways, will go a long way when one day you need something from someone else.  And it's not a matter of IF you will ever need something from someone else, its WHEN.<br />
<br />
So now I'll step down off my soapbox and resume my normal routine.  Cause even though nobody else may realize it....I'm perfect :D !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dual-box a 65 warrior and a 65 beastlord (not on raids, but for grinds; raids, I pick one or the other so I can focus better).  One of my big frustrations back when I had only the warrior was that I had no way to buff newbies.<br />
<br />
Yep, you heard me right.  I'm a naturally generous person, and I actively enjoy helping people out with buffs.  And somehow logging on my druid alt or my friend's chanter and buffing people just wasn't the same.<br />
<br />
Now that I've got my beastlord up to 65, I can drop beastcrack on people, I can Spiritual Vigor, I can stat-buff better than a shaman for everything but agility and HP...now, I'm happy.<br />
<br />
Beg for buffs?  Please do!  Unless I'm late for a guild raid, you can bet I'll take the time to hit you up with some haste, some stats, some HP, some regen...why not?  It doesn't cost me anything but time, and it builds goodwill.<br />
<br />
That being said:<br />
<br />
1) I don't always see every tell.  If I'm in tell-hell, or briefly AFK, I don't want to be considered &quot;rude&quot; because I didn't scroll back far enough to see your tell.<br />
<br />
2) Whether or not I respond to tells depends entirely on how stupid the person is.  If I get a tell from &quot;Eatmyshorts Donkeybonker&quot; saying &quot;D00d, u got buff 4 me?&quot;, I'll quite happily ignore the hell out of him.  If I get a tell from &quot;Lanariel Treedancer&quot; saying &quot;Pardon me, mighty mistress of beasts, but can you spare an enhancement for my body or mind?&quot;, I'll not only reply, I'll go out of my way to help.  I think of it as applying much-needed selection pressures to the roleplaying environment in EQ.<br />
<br />
And I've been known to ask for buffs myself.  But because I'm a practical little ogre, I don't do it by standing in PoK and shouting &quot;Anyone casting KEI for plat?!&quot;  I do a /who, looking for people of the appropriate class and level.  And then I send them a /tell, one at a time, saying &quot;Pardon me, noble high elf.  Can you spare the time to gift me with KEI, in return for a generous donation?&quot; <br />
<br />
Is this rude of me?  Judging by the reactions of those I ask, not in the slightest.  Most people I've met are happy to help; some of them even reject donations (as I do, when buffing someone below about level 30).  As with anything else in life, it's a matter of courtesy.<br />
<br />
So.  Do I think it's rude to ask for buffs?  Not if one does it politely.  Do I think it's rude to ignore a buff request?  No, although it's certainly more gracious to explicitly deny it, and optimal to deny it with a brief explanation.<br />
<br />
*shrug* If I didn't love playing my warrior so much, I'd be playing one of the true buffing classes, like an enchanter or a cleric.  As it is, I give what buffs I can with my beastlord, and ask for buffs when I need them without fear of being rude.<br />

Yeah, right, I'm gonna ignore healing my warrior in order to buff you.<br />
<br />
However, I have often sat in PoK or newbie zones when I wasn't busy with something else and offered buffs to whoever needs them (not component ones, since I'm perpetually poor.  You want those, you bring the component with you).  I've only played a warrior for a year, but I've played a cleric from day one, and offering free buffs has always been my particular joy.<br />
<br />
While I don't consider it rude to ask for buffs (lord knows I've asked for SoW for CR runs often enough), I also don't think it's rude not to reply.  Fact is, I am usually 2 boxing a cleric/warrior, and my eyes are on the warrior.  Most of the time, I don't see the tells to the cleric till 10 minutes later.  Normally, if I'm asking for a buff, it's in OOC in PoK, and it's usually for SoW (for the aforementioned CRs &lt;grin&gt; I'm a death magnet).  If someone doesn't reply, then I just have a longer run.  Sometimes I actually remembered to leave a SoW potion in the bank, but I usually forget when I take the last one out to buy more.<br />
<br />
Anyway, all this rambling come down to, if I'm in PoK and not afk and you ask for a buff, you're probably going to get it.  But if I'm currently grouped and fighting, I probably won't even see your request.  And if you jump up and down in front of me trying to get my attention, you'll probably find yourself on ignore (as the level 25 wizard begging in PoK did yesterday &lt;grin&gt;).</div></div><hr />

LoL. Since I got my ring of the crimson bull I will sit in PoK and zing random people ALL the time. Just zing, zing, zing. I can't be stopped!<br />
<br />
And sometimes, if people stand still long enough, I'll hit them up with Spirit of Ox, because I have an ox in my pants!<br />

When I'm in PoK tradeskilling and someone sends me a polite request for virtue, I send them a tell back with my location.  <br />
<br />
I like to help.  But... IT IS NOT MY JOB.  Strangers who think they deserve something from me just because I hit the cleric button on the character creation screen get nothing (unless of course they are in my group or raid in which case they don't go in the stranger category).<br />
<br />
I polite tell will always get answered even if I'm busy and the answer has to be no.  But I get a lot of tells &quot;are you busy?&quot; which I know leads to &quot;Rez PLZ&quot; to which I have to reply &quot;where?&quot; and then get &quot;&lt;insert far off zone here&gt;&quot;  I almost always ignore &quot;are you busy?&quot; because I figure if the person can't bother to at least type out the request then I don't need to waste my time with it.  If you need a rez, PLEASE do clerics a favor when asking and type all the information into one tell.  I'm much more likely to help you that way because I know what I'm agreeing to do.  And never ask for a &quot;quick rez&quot; since that has been proven to take longer than any other kind. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as random requests for buffs, I get those all the time.  &quot;Raun, give me BSS.&quot;  or &quot;Can I get a rez?&quot;  or &quot; Can I get virtue?&quot;  Keep in mind, I'm wielding my BoC almost exclusivly...  I just ignore them all. <br />

Some of us actually play a warrior as our main toon WITHOUT an army of other level 65's to buff us and keep us safe.<br />
<br />
One of the HUGE issues with the melee revamp has been lack of warrior utility coupled with our almost nonexistant advnatge in tanking over hybrids.  Without access to an extra buff or 2 here and there we are even further gimped.<br />
<br />
I can understand if you are talking about people asking you to come to their zone and buff you, or ask for buffs while you are busy grouping/tradeskilling/whatever.  But If someone is just sitting in PoK and you ask for a buff from them is that really any reason for them to fly into a rage???<br />
<br />
I never ask for a virtue without supplying the reagent, and I never ask for any other buff without offering a donation.  With virtue I typically give 2-5peridots for the one cast JUST SO the charitable cleric feels rewarded for doing a NICE thing.<br />

Warriors need buffs you say?  What the fuck are you doing?  You're not soloing, I know that, so are you grouping with 5 other warriors or something?  Get buffs from your group.  Don't have a class that can buff in your group?  Make a better group<br />

I am always buffing people with clarity or clarity 2 when I am passing by them.  Sometimes I even give them haste and gift of magic if I have mana for it.  I do this a lot because I like helping people.<br />
<br />
That being said, when I buff someone I get a &quot;thank you&quot; about 10% of the time and I get &quot;Is that all you got?&quot; or something similar about 10% of the time.  the rest of the time I buff people I am ignored.  The newer players now are too spoiled by easy progression and they think everyone owes them something.  They are rude and they have the &quot;me me me&quot; complex.  <br />
<br />
Just the other day, I was in OT helping PL my girlfriend's new character.   I hear &quot;newbtard_01 says out of character, Anyone got clarity?&quot;  and I reply &quot;/ooc I do next to the book, come get it if you need it.&quot;  Next thing I know, newbtard_01 is ooc-ing me to come to Skyfire and buff people because they need buffs and are too busy to come to me.  I didn't go to the Skyfire zone because I was busy so I didn't respond.  In like 10 minutes,  I got 2 tells from the guy saying &quot;whats taking so long?&quot; and &quot;forget it, you are wasting my time and I don't need your clarity&quot;, this being after I failed to go to the Skyfire zone to buff him I guess.  I never said I was going there but they just assumed i would drop everything to go buff them because they were too lazy to come to me.<br />
<br />
This is the crap that makes people want to be anon or roleplay if they play a buffing class.  I take off roleplay and its almost instant begging until I put it back on.  The only time anyone should feel obligated to buff someone is if they are in your group or raid.  I just wish I had a way to ignore tells from people under level 50 but I don't so I usually ignore them when I get a tell asking me to cross the zone to buff their group or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before PoP I always payed for my ports, I've never begged for shit or taken a buff (unless it was a guildie) without offering something in return.  I make sure the buffing class makes a PROFIT and to me that is a transaction.<br />
<br />
So if someone doesn't want to buff others np, but when someone sends you a tell requesting a buff don't automatically assume they are asking for a freebie.<br />
<br />
I make normal groups, but sometimes have a druid healing in which case I may ask for a Virtue off a cleric, or if I have an enchanter I may ask for shaman buffs from a nearby shammy.</div></div><hr />

It's funny, but these days I often completely ignore pretty much everything than the chat box while in non-dangerous zones. It's not to be rude or anything, I'm simply not focused on the buffbox, so I often miss those drive-by-buffings.<br />

When I do notice however, I tend to shoot them a tell saying thanks. :)<br />

Having never had to buff anyone, it was very funny when I joined my present guild; as soon as I was invited to a guild group or raid, I' d be accosted with requests for shrink :p I didn't  have a Cobalt bracer at the time, but picked one up as soon as possible, which helped build goodwill :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, time to step into this...<br />
<br />
i have a 54 druid and a 56 cleric, surpisingly the cleric has not gotten many requests for buffs, rezzes yes, but most of those have been in the same zone, depends on how they ask as to if i will take the time to rez them.<br />
<br />
i have even offered to rez people that i just saw thier corpse laying there, not often but it happens, depends on my mood and if i am in a hurry to get somewhere...<br />
<br />
now the druid on the other hand...<br />
<br />
favorite example, i am sitting in PoK, getting ready to camp, get a tell:<br />
<br />
&quot;can i get a port to &lt;far away zone&gt; for a CR?&quot;<br />
<br />
i have the spell, i figure well, i am about to go to sleep, but what the heck..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;i can for donation, where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TT, just outside OS&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;uhhhh... no, i thought you were in pok&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;pleez this is my brothers character he is gonna be mad&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;take the boat or run to cabalis stone or fv stone&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;boat? there is a boat? how do i get to the stones?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;look it up at eqatlas&quot;<br />
<br />
the character sending the tells was a lvl 64 enchanter.<br />
<br />
my druid has gotten WAY too many requests... no, DEMANDS for ports.<br />
<br />
i have responded to some with &quot;for 100pp i can&quot; and gotten &quot;wtf? pay for a port, i never had to pay for a port&quot;<br />
<br />
this was before PoP /sigh<br />
<br />
some people got rather indignant and even more demanding... /ignore saved my blood pressure from making my head explode...<br />
<br />
now, i have asked for buffs on my warrior before, not often as i also two box a 56 cleric and my wife two boxes a 59 bst and a 56 druid...  but when going into an unknown fight, that i am not sure about, i have asked for virtue, an example being my first trip into Plane of Mischief...<br />
<br />
/tell lvl65_highelf_cleric Master Cleric, could I trouble you for the blessing of a Virtue for a donation?<br />
<br />
he did not answer right away, i did not send the tell again, i waited patiently for a bit and he responded &quot;yes, i am at the bank&quot;<br />
<br />
my philosophy is if you are going to ask for a buff/port/rez, be ready to pay for it, ask in an inteligent manner and don't use d00d spak.<br />
<br />
even when grouped i like to reimburse the cleric for dots (on the rare occasions that i do not two box)... i was horrified a couple of weeks ago, i went to do an LDoN, asked for symbol (from the group cleric), reached for my dots... and they weren't there! /cry<br />
<br />
i explained to the cleric that i normally carried dots, but that they were on my cleric... he said he understood, and that he did not expect to be compensated for them, but the thought was what counted.<br />
<br />
ok... i think i rambled a bit more than i meant to here... but you get the point, be polite, state what you need in the opening question, be ready to pay, and don't get pissed off if they want more than you expected to pay or say no.<br />
<br />
if you are rude when asking for buffs, demanding, or obnoxious, expect to find yourself on /ignore.<br />

<br />
I sure wont pay for the buff so if they say no its no biggie, I just go to the next one in my list.<br />
<br />
If I cant get one I go on about me business 100PP richer than I had if I payed for it.<br />
<br />
AA's make grinding mobs tankable without buffs, just not as effecient.<br />
<br />
If its a hard target others will ensure Im getting buffed cause they need me.<br />
<br />
I dont see it as rude at all.<br />
<br />
Only thing I see as rude be getting hostile with the buffer if they refuse to buff you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While that is 100% true, more often than not tho, it is the case where they just want something for free.  If you want something from someone, offer plat in the tell, I guarantee you'll get 10 times better results.  Well, except from me, cuz I don't need plat :)</div></div><hr />

If people still bug me about stuff after I said &quot;no&quot; thought I just ignore them. I think thats the right non rude way to go about it.<br />
<br />
As for thing with plat for buffs everyone has their own rules for that. I for one do not ever charge for buffs unless its out of my way and same to be said for ports. Mana is free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you send me a tell you will get a response. It may not be what you want to hear but you will get a response of some sorts.<br />
<br />
I have been playing eq since beta and I remember the &quot;old&quot; days and frankly they sucked. I hated haveing to ask in ooc for a port or  sow to get some place and made my own druild.<br />
<br />
I also now have a my very own pocket shaman to play. Sure in the &quot;old&quot; days you didnt have KEI, BoR, BoT9 and all the other fun buffs we have now. If you wanna play that way then do it, I prefer the new way, I love the hell out of soulbinders and the PoK stones. There is no way I would go back.<br />
<br />
Now back to the buffing and not responding, If I not busy and have the mana and you need the buff then I am more than happy to throw one your way. Neither my shammy, druid or enchanter cast any buffs that require reagents so if you give me plat cool, if you dont oh well.<br />
<br />
If I am busy and/or dont want to buff you at this moment you will get a response. Usually something like &quot;I am busy at the moment&quot; and that is that. If you ask again there had better be a good reason (i am really soft when it comes to dead people getting their bodies back) other wise our conversation is over, reguardless of what you think.<br />
<br />
Me personally unless it is a rare case I dont ask for buffs directly. I will ask in OOC if someone is casting Virt or PoT9 for donations but never directly via a tell.<br />
<br />
When I kill a toon and am waiting on a rez and see people asking for buffs I will send them tells letting them know where I am at and if they mosey over then I buff and usually dont ask for a donation.<br />
<br />
But hey that is just me and I am usually not an arse unless you have rubbed me the wrong way.</div></div><hr />

If I luck out and they give me the focus or KEI, great!  If not, I'll do without.  (And yes, I always offer a donation or a buff in exchange.  /tell shaman05, &quot;Could I trade ya a virtue for a focus?&quot; Seems to work when I'm out in the wilds.)<br />
<br />
My 63 cleric is fortunate in that I rarely ever get rude tells requesting buffs.  If I'm not busy, and if they offer compensation for regents used, I give the buff 99% of the time.  In fact, the only time I get rude tells is when I deny request for Temperence because I do not have the spell.  Being over level 55 on the cleric when LoY came out, I didn't think questing Temp was worth my time.  <br />
<br />
As a 60 druid, I don't recieve as many tells for buffs. =p  However, for ports, if they can't type a coherant sentence that is to the point, I don't port them.  A &quot;Hey, could you port me to cobalt scar for a corpse run?&quot; will get more results from me than a tell of &quot;R U busy?&quot;</div></div><hr />

You guys ask for buffs?  When I am looking for buffs, I ALWAYS offer plats for their trouble. If I don't get a reply, I assume they are either busy or don't want the plats, no harm no foul, I'll just ask someone else. While I have access to quite a few high level buffing toon, my choice of characters - wiz and warrior - are kind of light in the buff department. When I am on a buffing toon or when I get TL requests on my wizard, I will usually buff/TL people, assuming that they don't come across as a complete ass hole. If I am busy, I say so. It never hurt anyone to be civil to others, you never know when you are going to need a favor.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and while we are on it, 65% slow is a FAR cry from 75%....30% less in fact.  75% reduces the mobs DPS to 25% or original, while 65% reduces it to 35%...  25%/35% = 30% more decrease in DPS from shammy slow.<br />

I leveled all these characters in some fashion or another.  There is a shitload of my play hours involved in getting each of them to 65.   My friends didn't all start EQ at the same time, sucks when you're a lot higher level than them.  So I helped them out extensively while they slept :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
-is this in a raid? If so why is a person missing a buff? Are they a monk dead on an aborted pull or a latecomer or someone to stupid to pay attention and drop Pot9 for the MGBed Virtue?<br />
-is this a_random_idiot01 who expects you to run 3 zones and doesn't have the decency to say more than &quot;come buff me plz&quot;?<br />
-is this a groupmate or guildmate?<br />
-are you passing through some area to a waiting friend/group/raid?<br />
-are you passing through another group's camp or otherwise causing them any inconvenience?<br />
<br />
Myself, I never ask for buffs outside of my group or raid. I will avail myself of mass buffings at times (i.e. the OOCed MGB virtue at the bank in 3 min), but I do not go up to a random buffer and infringe on their time/mana.  There are times at say an LDoN adventure camp where my group will trade buffs say my shammy will Fo7/boar your group for a BSS from your pally.<br />
<br />
Is it rude to ignore strangers? No. However my friends will politely respond to even the most cretinous of 12 yr old morons.<br />
Is it rude to ignore guildmates or groupmates? Yes (why are you with these people again?).<br />
Is it rude to ignore someone not paying attention on a raid? Kinda but they deserve some censure/slap upside the head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have several high level buffers that I can use...<br />
<br />
Enc, Cle, Sham, Bst, Rang, Pal....and a necro for summoning if that counts...<br />
<br />
then on another server...<br />
<br />
Enc, Cle, Sham, Dru, Rang.....<br />
<br />
NONE Ebayed ty~ Just a good network of RL friends =)<br />
<br />
i got 3 comps within arms reach and whenever I am in PoK and someone sends me a tell for a buff I respond on three conditions....<br />
<br />
**1** I am not anon, (ie your not getting a buff if you saw that I was a &lt;insert class&gt; and decided to ask even though I am anon)<br />
<br />
**2** I am not afk...if I am afk...whether I am afk or not that is your answer.<br />
<br />
**3** You must use the word 'please' or any variation of it.  And your request must be a request not an order.<br />
<br />
Now 99% of the time I am in PoK/Tranq I am anon/role....but if you catch me I promptly go anon and buff you...unless I am otw out of the zone, in which case I promptly go anon and let you know I am no longer in zone and am omw to some place...<br />
<br />
I do lots of MGB's and occasionally buff for donation and sometimes for free....I do this b/c sometimes its just as enjoyable as the rest of the game (depending on my mood).  And because when I am playing my army of alts I like when people do the same for me as sometimes I cannot buff my war with my sham since he is on the same account etc...<br />
<br />
In the end, if you send someone a tell who is not anon, and not afk (tagged or not) and your tell is polite you most definately should recieve a tell of some sort back. Even if it is Hass responding with &quot;Fuck OFF!&quot;, then you know not to send him a tell again.</div></div><hr />

Yes I will ask a stranger for a buff (although I only give them 50p, not 100 for a virt or a foc/sta).  If they ignore me or say no, I don't care. <br />
<br />
Sorry testosterone heads.  I only have 8300 hp fully buffed and I need every bit of them on a hard adven.  If I am in a group minus a sham or BL I will pop over to another ldon camp if necessary and offer plat for a buff if I need it.  In many cases, there is someone on my friends list I know anyway and it is freely given.  If this makes me Pussy_War_01, well I will take that over Dumbass_Gimp_War_05 any day.<br />

I pay for Virtue, usually 12p. I never learned to beg, not a skill I'm interested in. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Erm...  Clearly, I can't (as a beastlord) buff stats better than a shaman can, if said shaman really gives a damn about maxing everything.  In practice, though, a shaman will hit you with Focus and send you on your way, while a beastlord, desperate for the approval of his peers, will hit you with both IoS and the individual stat buffs, as well as SV for the extra HP.  Which is significantly more for most stats than Focus alone.<br />
<br />
But I apologize for the poorly worded shorthand version of the above, which made it appear that I thought my beastlord could out-stat-buff a shaman.<br />
<br />
On the question of slow percentages: while you are of course quite correct that a 75% slow is significantly more than 10% better than a 65% slow, I'm not convinced this has as much practical value as one might think.  Specifically, remember that XP mobs tend to be balanced so that a group without a slower can (in theory) still take them down.  Therefore, pretty much any slow (including the gimp 50% beastlord slow) is enough to make the mob stop being a threat.<br />

My beastlord, in specific, does not yet have her 65% slow.  I've got the 40k it tends to cost.  I just have better things to spend it on.  When we're doing LDoN adventures, Graa handles the slowing even though we have an enchanter standing by with extra mana.  Why?  Because she can take the initial aggro hits better than an enchanter can, and we just don't need more than 50% slowing.<br />
<br />
Now, if we were doing Hard adventures, yah, I'd need the 65% slow.  But for normal adventures at level 65, a 50% slow is more than enough to have our cleric up and meleeing even while our bard is pulling at full speed.<br />
<br />
And given that, the difference between a 65% slow and a 75% slow just isn't that relevant to the way we play.<br />

P.S. Actually, this has changed in recent months, since Graa purchased Ferocity.  Keeping Ferocity up on our top three melees burns enough mana that Graa has a choice between nuking and slowing, and we sometimes choose to have her nuke and the enchanter slow.  Depends on whether the enchanter's pulling, or if we have a bard along to pull, or a cleric who really loves the job.  :-)<br />

P.P.S. And yes, I'm rather excited about the new monk lulls.  It'll be nice to have another class around that can pull that way.  Even with enchanter-level crowd control, a good pacify-puller makes things so much nicer.</div></div><hr />

Also if i am in a group honstly i shouldnt have ot ask for a buff cuz usually im the MT , i hate it when buffers in group expect you to tank your heart out with nothing and then make a comment like oh im sorry do you needs buffs? Duhhhhhh stupid ass what u think? Also whne you buffs do drop in groups and you ask for a rebuff, 10 min later and after the 7th time you ask you get it with an attitude, screw that ill leave a group over that cuz players like that usually get you killed. ( sorry for straying offtopic) But yeah ask nicely and maybe u get buffsbut be sure to compensate for time , mana and reagent but answer me like a bish..... then screw u i hope i see you with adds in a tier3 zone and the laugh as you die and i clicky invis my way out lol</div></div><hr />
