Only complaint I have is that they're not MAGIC.  I mean come on, they're magically transmuted from pure crystal . . . that just screams magic.  I would like to be able to retire my soriz pouch permanently, but on range fights where I'm not tanking, its the only self sufficient source of MAGIC ranged damage.  These arrows are already half the range of the ones summoned by the Tolan's bracer, can't they at least throw us a bone and make em MAGIC? . . . . I did a /feedback about this today.<br />
<br />
I think everyone should /feedback something to the effect of &quot;Hunter's Barbs should be flagged MAGIC, they are magically transmuted from pure crystal for one.  And it would be nice to be able to do SOME modicum of damage when pulling without begging rangers or mages for norent arrows&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've sent in a feedback about making these magical, too.  It only seems right considering how you create them.<br />
<br />
Been waiting ages for something like this to show up in game.  I'm tired of fletching magical arrows at ~80pp a stack, so I hope they change these to Magic status soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 This takes 1 slot to make all your arrows. 2 with component. Fletching is 4 slots *minimum* plus hafta carry a fletching kit. Not to mention actually making them.<br />
<br />
 If you actually think your arrow damage makes any difference, well you're stupid. But whatever floats yer boat. Me, I'll take the summoned easy arrows that agro the mobs just fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't have to lug around anything. <br />
<br />
Make them up in PoK while I'm waiting on people. Got to do something with all that downtime.<br />
<br />
The only reason I would ever need to gain more arrows out in the middle of zones is if I was trying to do some craptastic ranged dps. Something these arrows won't do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I guess fletching isn't the pain in the ass for me that it is for most people.<br />
<br />
I make the cheapest magical 150 range arrows you can make (uhh, magic tip, shitty shaft, parabolic fletching, small nock), which makes 200 arrows per stack (x4 stacks i guess if you wanna get picky), go out and spend all damned nite XP'ing somewhere, port back to nexus and cash in all the crap at the end of the nite and refill the arrow supply.  Takes like 2 extra minutes out of my day.  Would it be nice to have EQ or some shit?  Sure I guess, but it would also be nice to not have to buy food either, and yet we all do.  It's just something you accept after awhile.<br />
<br />
And you can say what you want about 150 arrows being useless, but I don't EVER wanna see that i'm out of fuckin range again.   If I wanna shoot shit from halfway across the zone, then i'm gonna damned well do it, and not inch forward until I get into range.<br />
<br />
Gimme a 150 range summonable item and i'll consider drooling over it.  Until then, I'll use what I got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't mind Fletching my own arrows much. Yes it costs money to make magic arrows but everyone has a cost in this game. We just don't whine about it. :p I prefer to actually do a little damage on incoming myself. However, if this thing summoned magic arrows with 150 range and 2-3 damage I would probably use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I guess it all comes down to why you want arrows, and if these are the answer to your probs or not.<br />
<br />
For me, I use arrows for pulling, and that's it.  It makes no difference to me if the arrow hits for 1 dmg, 500 dmg, or completely misses, as long as the mob agroes.  I have to carry backpacks of the stupid things because one arrow is hardly ever enough to pull a mob.   They always end up buzzing around their heads or something, and finally aggro after the 4th shot.  So I use tons of arrows, and this little item works perfectly for my situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mind fletching, but I HATE running out of arrows while I'm pulling because I forgot to make more (common occurrance) and I don't like carrying around stacks of arrows all the time.  Range and magic/non magic don't matter much to me.  I would use zero range zero damage arrows if I could summon them.  A 200+ range bow is more than enough range for most pulling regardless of the arrows.<br />
<br />
Feel free to keep on fletching if you want, this is the best piece of loot I have seen come out of LDoN for me :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You guys that would rather carry around backpacks full of arrows with 150 range are nuts. You can't see much past 200 to begin with, so a 250 range bow is plenty for pulling. I would much rather make a couple of stacks as I need them. It would be nice if they where flagged magic, but I am sure that is an oversight - how can something you summon not be magic?? Plus its pretty tought to beat 5gp for a stack of arrows. I can't wait to get one. I can finally stop begging mages/ranjas for summoned arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just noticed the arrows are droppable and rentable as well :D  <br />

<br />
Seriously...wtf else do you need the room for at this stage of the game?  Are you still looting fine steel?<br />
<br />
I carry 7 bags on me, and a collapsible fletching kit to fill the 8th slot.  In the first bag is food/drink and the various potions I carry around (I have a shammy, why not?).  Second bag is full of arrow components (it's 10 slot), 4 stacks of components, my fletching kit, and usually 5 stacks of arrows.  3rd bag is empty, for loot.  4th bag empty, for loot.  5th bag is my fletching kid, so when i'm done with my components or have enough arrows to last, that turns into a bag for loot.  6th bag carries misc. shit that I may or may not need but carry anyway.  7th bag is weapons and 8th bag is resist gear.<br />
<br />
Wanna know how many times i've ran out of inventory room in the last 6 months?  Once, crawling HS from the entrance to Drus without a rogue and without the keys.  It's not like that shit is prime real estate when you're 65 and have the best gear money can buy....cuz what the hell am I gonna be looting anyway?<br />
<br />
As far as how far you can see...I can see pretty damned far in some zones.  I can tag giants all the way across the arena in Kael, and I do so quite often.  If you guys really think it's that big of a deal, then by all means, grab yourself a pouch.  I for one won't be wasting plat/time on it.</div></div><hr />

Back on the subject at hand, if you don't want it, don't use it. But if you don't like wasting away your life fletching arrows, then this pouch is perfect. It's a huge time saver. Well worth spending money on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I cannot fletch. It is physically impossible. My computer sucks so much that I cannot do any tradeskills. Imagine...  6 seconds to open a bag (12 seconds for the bag and fletching kit), 1-3 seconds to get 1 item on my curser and another second or so to put it back down, another 1-3 seconds to put the product into my inventory then I get to start over again. So uh.... <br />
<br />
Starting time = 12 seconds<br />
Time per moving 1 item = approx 4 seconds<br />
Multiply that by 4 = 16<br />
Then putting the product into my inventory = 2 seonconds<br />
<br />
<br />
Too much damned time. The sad thing is, I wouldn't have a problem about 2 months ago before everquest literally went to shit on my computer /sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ya, my computers ran EQ like a champ when it came out.  Now all of a sudden my video and sound cards are no longer supported, and the game runs like shit in certain places.  Sad thing is that it happens whether you own expansions or not.  I noticed a big quality drop when each expansion came out before I even installed them.<br />
<br />
And that's a valid excuse for wanting something to summon some ranged shit.  and being lazy is a valid excuse.  All i'm saying is that for minimal effort on my part,  I don't have to use the lowest quality arrows.  Even if it summoned 100 range arrows that would be cool.  For the amount of time warriors use arrows, it's not that big of a deal to fletch up a few or grab some stacks of components before you go out.<br />
<br />
I'm happy you're all happy tho.  The Ssra bag sucks ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Myself, almost maxed archery and an Agnarr bow (32/36 or something -- not that different from a Stonewood), well, I pop an arrow or two into the mob on inc and it eliminates the agro bonus from pulling very nicely, mob makes a beeline for me.<br />
<br />
I dunno if a 1 damage arrow will do that. 25 range means most places you'll only get 1-2 arrows into it before the mob is in range. I'll surely loot one of these, it replaces my Soriz Worker Pouch, but unless those arrows can grab agro off the puller I'm not as excited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Damage isn't as important as positioning.

unless you are sniping Ancient Cyclopses from the wizard spires, 25range arrows are fine. I meen how many times do you find yourself pulling or 5 or 6 hours straight where every mob has to be shot at from half way across the zone?</div></div><hr />

25 range, who cares. 1 damage, who cares. If i have to pull something longer than these will reach, it's time to move camp.</div></div><hr />

I can say for sure they DO hit magic only targets, I love this thing.<br />

Wether you like fletching or not you can make 20 stacks of arrows with this for less than 10pp and only having one stack of components, not to mention it only takes a few seconds so you dont need to carry around bags full of fletching stuff and arrows. Just make a couple stacks and when you run out make a couple more.</div></div><hr />

I don't have to worry about inventory space, I dont' have to worry about running out.  I don't have to worry about anything.<br />
<br />
I'm happy as a clam, and am never without arrows, and my inventory loves me.<br />
<br />
I happen to be a guy who carries a LOT of stuff with me wherever I go, so inventory space is at a major premium to me (I destroyed my epic scabbard so i could replace it with a 10 slot pack prior to Ykesha).    I can carry 800 arrows in the space I used to carry 40 in, that makes me happy.</div></div><hr />

I actually got an out of range message last nite, with a 220 range featherwood bow and a 150 range arrow in DN pulling spiders.  Sorry, 25 range arrows can stay right in that pouch.  They won't be seeing use from me.  I got a SS too, i'm just to lazy to find somewhere to host it :)  <br />
<br />
I don't understand... you'd still rather spend time fletching arrows than running a little bit closer to the mob? Am I missing something here?<br />
<br />
Oh and I'd probably say people hunt in those zones once a week :p. Those zones are empty every time I go there. And further more, DN is 1/3 the top area of spiders where you can actually put 150 range arrows to good use... the other 2/3 of it is below in the caves. I just really don't have range problems ever with my 225 range bow. And pulling is also just fine in the PoTactics pit :p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I ran a test today.  I went to PoN with some Hunter's Barbs, and they did hit a raven.  So I grabbed some field point arrows, and went back to PoN.  Tried the field point, and the tree I had targeted was immune.  Switched to these barbs and they hit for damage.  So, just confirming that these can hit magic mobs even though they don't say magic on them.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but you're wrong. No they do not, unless somebody charmed one and sow'd it. I was there last night helping some friends level and they do in fact run slower than run 3. I've seen a charmed one sow'd and there's a HUGE difference in run speed. And the 25 range of the arrow is added to the range of the bow. Last time I looked, 25 + 225 (my bow) gave me 250 range to pull which is more than enough.</div></div><hr />

Same here man.  I was forever making arrows, and I would eventually run out when I am pulling, and it would make me sad.  I was in an LDoN group the other day, and was the puller, and had no arrows.  The bard (lazy....) didn't feel like being a puller, so he gave me this pouch for free.  He's grouped with me a few times, and says I know how to do my job so he didn't feel bad about giving it away.  After thanking him non-stop for that 45 minutes or whatever, I fell in love with this pouch.  This thing is a major time saver, and the range really doesn't bother me too bad with a 200+ range bow.  <br />

<br />
Yes, and here's why.<br />
<br />
Some people aren't running top of the line computers.  EQ does not run like a champ on my computers, it runs like the memory leak piece of shit program that it is, and every expansion it gets worse, regardless of whether or not I purchase and install said expansion.  I'll take all the time I can between me and that mob so that when my computer decides that it needs to load some more of the game, I don't get fuckin splattered all over the walls.<br />
<br />
And FYI, the first EVER reason why I decided I was gonna go 150 range arrows and never go back was hunting my PSC in DN.   Before Run 3 and before they removed the shadowstep off those, you were fuckin dead if one of them caught you and phased you the wrong direction.  It happened many times and I learned my lesson.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">ill definitely get one of these for those occassions when i need cheap arrows just to pull like ldon. but i think its situational.<br />
<br />
for exp places like bot with longer ranges, ill stick to my 150 range damage magic arrows, for the simple reason that a couple of hits should normally get me aggro off the pullers aggro, which i doubt 1 dmg non magic 25 range arrows would.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt ditch fletching because of it.</div></div><hr />

Then get yourself a ragefire bracer, pull from 300 feet, and you can start running before you ever even agro.<br />
<br />
But if you want easy access to near unlimited arrows for every day tagging and pulling... get the pouch.<br />

I agree with Haass though...rarely if ever use up all my inv...and I carry alot of utility weapons.</div></div><hr />

Right, cuz a 4.0 second cast time is exactly what i want too.  For fuck's sake, if I don't wanna run within arm's length of a mob, what the hell makes you think I wanna stand around for 4 seconds?</div></div><hr />

A few people have said already that these hit magic mobs, even though not flagged magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I'll confirm this. I can hit  magic mobs even though the arrows themselves are not flagged magic. I suspect they just forgot to type in the flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I don't get is the +10 AGI... doesn't work in ammo slot &amp; wouldn't go in range slot when I tried it even though it's flagged that way...</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact the only bow using class to whoom the summoned arrows are useless are rangers and they have EQ so they would never use one.<br />
<br />
It is purely a convenience item, cheap, effective, nothing special and a common drop in my experience.<br />
<br />
Why anyone would favour fletched arrows for pulling over cheap and cheerful toys like the Hunters Barbs is beyond any logic I can comprehend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Since this thread got bumped, the arrows ARE magic even if they are not labeled that way, and with my ssssssssrashsezzzzrian longbow I can hit for 65 or so dmg with them.  I have much &lt;3 for my arrow summoner, and now I can bow-kite the whole orc camp in Sro while waiting for my adventure group to show up!  I occaisionally miss the range (usually when I'm trying to tag a fire beetle from the top of the adenture camp tents) but it's a small price to pay for 8 bag slots and not being out of arrows when I need them to pull.</div></div><hr />
