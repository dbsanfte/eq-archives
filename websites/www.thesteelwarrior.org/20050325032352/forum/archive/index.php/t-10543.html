<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefilim</div><div class="date">02-04-2005, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure all of you have had this problem. You buy some piece of equipment, and it's so flagrant and outlandish that it makes your character look like a complete retard... but the stats are just too good to pass up and you don't want to feel like you wasted 10g on a pair of +22str/10stam blue plate pants.<br />
<br />
When adding equipment, try to stick with rather common pieces or pieces that can be attained through a quest. No point in posting uber-rare equipment that only a handful of people will get.<br />
<br />
Weapons that look sweet:<br />
LV37 Ravager - 2H Axe with awesome proc, attained from Herod in Scarlet Monastery<br />
LV45 Tusker Sword of... -  Beefy looking 2h sword with stats and high damage range for it's level. I think mine had like +15str/agi.<br />
LV46 Executioner's Cleaver - Awesome range for two-hand axe, have seen it on AH quite frequently, though I don't know what drops it. Very nice stats. Big Black ninja-star axe.<br />
<br />
Weapons that look weak:<br />
LV45 Blight - Just because it's blue with good DPS doesn't mean anything. Damage range comparable to some high-end 1h weapons, awful proc, no stats, and looks like a tooth pick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Armor:<br />
LV37 Herod's Shoulder - Drops frequently off of Herod in Scarlet Monastery. Big red claw on your shoulder. Looks quite nice.<br />
<br />
LV40 Field Plate X of the Y - Whole suit of randomly dropped equipment, can see it on the AH very frequently. It's a gray suit of lv40 platemail armor. Helmet is the best looking helmet you'll see for a while if you hate that horned-helmet graphic that everyone wears.<br />
<br />
LV40 Saltstone X of the X - Matches Field Plate quite nicely. Grayish chestpiece that's ribbed for pleasure.<br />
<br />
(Quest) Warforged Chestplate - Attained from quest to kill 2 lv52 elite dragons, looks like samurai armor with yellow/red trimmings.<br />
<br />
(Quest) Shinkicker Boots - Quest from the gambler line of quests (I think). Yellowish and match the Warforged Chestplate quite well.<br />
<br />
LV44 Golem Shard Leggings - Awesome stats and dropped off that first golem boss in Uldaman. Jet black plate.<br />
<br />
LV45 Bloodforged Helmet of the X - UGLY! It's like a red spaceman helmet.<br />
<br />
LV48 Heavy Lamellar -  Greenish armor, not sure what it matches with other than itself.<br />
<br />
LV45 Gothic Plate - Black armor, matches Golem Shard Leggings. Helmet is black with horns.</div></div><hr />

Note it looks much better on a Night Elf or Human then me. You can see what they look like on me (Slightly less purple then my picture shows) on here.<br />
