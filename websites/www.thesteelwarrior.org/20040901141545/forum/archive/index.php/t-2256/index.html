<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Then let's do something about it. We can talk on this board till we're blue in the face and still get nowhere. Why? Because SOE won't do anything until it becomes THEIR problem.<br />
<br />
How do we make it their problem? The druids found an effective method. Park your char in a high traffic area and deny anyone access to these areas.<br />
<br />
I reccommend that we pick a date, and then log in our warriors on our respective servers and park them either around the port stones in PoK or at the bazaar entrances in Nexus and Shadowhaven, and effectively either shut down PoK or shut down the Bazaar. I would also suggest on that specific date that everyone /petition our demands that these issues be addressed as well as /feedback, and link a URL to this board for those SOE employees who are interested in further input. I also reccommend that we do this in unison, unanimous, in order to be effective.<br />
<br />
To do this, all warriors would not attend and MT raids on that day, nor would they group or gain XP. It will be a scarifice not sitting for hours on end with the LFG tag up and /ooc Warrior looking for an XP group! I am a good tank! Honest!<br />
<br />
I am done lurking. I will voice my opinion. But if we want satisfaction, we need to take action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will never work, not in a million years. It's called levitate, and everyone knows the old ping-pong trick doesn't work anymore.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Druids are mostly retards anyway...why do we want to act like em?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Instead if sitting place and pissing ppl off...<br />
you could go level and get gear. That makes agro probs go away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The vote thread is a start. The only way you will get Sony's attention is direct threats. Pick the 5 topics with most votes on the sticky thread, send PM's to a bunch of warriors, and get some people to organize a walkout. THAT is how you get their attention: say &quot;You have 3 weeks to address our issues. If these issues are not fixed, on XX day, the following warriors will all not log on. If they are not fixed 2 days after that, all of the listed warriors will cancel their accounts.&quot; If you actually get a large enough list, and enough warriors actually go through with it, Sony will listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i am willing to not renew my account since i get 3 months to do so, i am willing to make a walk out</div></div><hr />

Money talks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I canceled both of my accounts!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">no no. it has to happend simultaneously, and has to involve a lot of people; at least 100 or so, probably more, for them to notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It would be too hard to coordinate something like this and have enough people follow through for it to matter.  And SoE wouldn't even notice if it was only 1 day.  It would have to be something like half the warriors on all servers stopped logging in for a week.  Good luck getting that to happen.<br />
<br />
I think the poll we have up is a good start.  About the only other thing that might get their attention is if they notice a significant trend of decreasing numbers of warriors relative to other classes on at any given time accrosss all servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Casai, I am doing just that. I am blessed to have a guild that knows I am a good tank and that I know how to play my class well. But even I have bounced up against this issue many times, even in guild groups. I am given a finite set of tools with which to manage agro, and that set of tools has grown ever more finite while the work they are supposed to be doing has increased multifold, and nothing short of a 500Kpp investment will fix my problem. I don't have that kind of money or time, and frankly, why should I be spendting the kind of money or time on a &quot;game&quot;?<br />
<br />
To everyone who is talking of canceling or have canceled their accounts, I think that should be an absolute last resort. SOE needs to know that we are here, we have a problem, and we aren't leaving it alone until it's fixed. That's why I was thinking of an in-game solution, something that will bring awareness to our plight. Show that we can break something down.<br />
<br />
Oh, for the levitate trick, just sit people on top of the stones, and stand people up all around. That effectively shuts down that trick. And if we get enough people into the Nexus and Shadowhaven zone, that avenue could be shut down too.<br />
<br />
Yes, we would be inconveniencing other players, and we might piss a lot of them off, but we would be effective in the fact we are highlighting our issues and are trying to bring them to the forefront. Besides, haven't we been inconvenienced long enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How about you just always petition when you can't find a group, you can't keep aggro etc etc.. :p<br />
<br />
everyone does it..<br />
<br />
you don't spam them with it, but having 10 or so warriors on each server petitioning and asking why his class isn't fitting the Class description at all....<br />
<br />
it may annoy them a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am in total favor of this.. We announce to all the EQ news sites that Plane of Tranq will be CLOSED on all Servers the day of X date by Warriors on all Servers.  We threaten to continue closing PoT every X day until our issues are given due consideration!  Damnit we need a fix!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Stupidity at its best. Honestly, all crashing a zone is going is accomplish is the illusion that warriors are just whiny paladins....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Or worse...druids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you expect to close PoT, I mean realistically I've seen 100+ people infront of the stones before and it's still easy to move around. If 10 warriors stand there in protest people are just going to laugh and grab a knight for their group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Interfering with the gameplay and fun of other people isnt the answer, all that makes us look like is whiney little bitches.<br />
<br />
Use /feedback, fire off emails to SoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grogglebonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We could still pick a date and send multiple emails + 1 feedback each on that day.. even if its only 100 people seding a couple emails and 1 feedback.. it should get noticed</div></div><hr />
