<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, still 24 hours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His current life span is probably about 2.7 seconds though.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How tough is he? Stuff on allakhazam makes it sound like a semi-tough fight for a non-uber group. 1700 max hit + rampage, 100k hp sound about right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bardeil, I peeked at your magelo, he'll be cake for you.  <br />
<br />
There is nothing fancy about him except his aoe rampage.  Pets will be probably be dead before the fight is over, and other melee need to watch themselves as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Moruk. I assume by &quot;cake&quot; you mean as long as I have a decent balanced group around my level we should be fine, as opposed to &quot;waltz in there with a cleric bot and expect to own him&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct, sorry, I was assuming you'd go in there with some friends :)<br />
<br />
I had a full group of 6 and it wasnt much of a fight (cleric, shaman, necro, mage, ench, warrior).   I was botting the cleric and I ended up ducking out of most of the heals, the shaman pretty much kept me full.<br />
<br />
We did have an enchanter charmie for dps, some non ogre npc happened to be wandering out of the arena at the wrong time before we went into the overseers room, so we snagged it and sent it to work  ;)  The aoe rampage served a nice purpose after all, saved me from bothering with the charmie after the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He has been farmed on many servers by a chanter and 2 clerics or similar using charmed pets.<br />
<br />
   The one time I tried him we had a group outside pig pens doing exp and hitting the Stampede, when another partial group came in and asked us top help them for him. I tanked him to about  50% before going down, and that would have gone better except we didnt know about the AE rampage. The bard and my Shambot went down fast from rampage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, we got pwned by this.  Our &quot;group&quot; (actually 8 of us) consisted of 2 warriors, 3 rogues, a shaman, a cleric and a bard.  Clearly one cleric was not able to keep up with AE ramp on 6 melees.  And when people started getting low health aggro, all hell broke loose.<br />
<br />
What is the range on his ramp?  Like if we keep him in one corner and just have a few ranged dps in other corner should they be safe?</div></div><hr />
