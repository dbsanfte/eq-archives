<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As examples of the effect I'm talking about I have both Golem Shard Leggings (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3549) and Ornate Cloak of Defense (http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=21456). <br />
<br />
What exactly is the value of this particular effect?  If you click on your Defense skill the explaination you get is &quot;Higher defense makes you harder to hit and makes monsters less likely to land a crushing blow.&quot; and everyone knows you gain 5 points in this skill every level.  So what does my +22 worth of defense skill mods get me? 4.4 levels worth of what? is there any way to compare this to AC for instance?<br />
<br />
I wear the legs because they're the best thing I can get my hands on atm regardless of the defense skill mod, the cloak is more of an iffy prospect though and I'm trying to determine if its worth it being the only stat(besides AC) on an item or if I'd be better off getting something with stamina on it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just realized this is in the &quot;newbie questions&quot; post, but I wouldn't mind getting a discussion going on JUST this topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if your lvl 30 attacking a lvl 35, you'll miss alot and/or hit for alot less damage.  i'll assume thats because your weapon skill is much less than the mob's defense skill.(try attacking a mob with a weapon you have 0 skill in..you'll really notice it)<br />
<br />
i'm gonna assume this works both ways.  when ya increase your defense skill relative to the mobs attack skill, it makes you harder to hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xebokan</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I read somewhere that Defence skill adds a bonus to other defensive skills like parry, dodge and block. You might want to test that by equip and check the before mentioned skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defense affects special defense skills.  That's why every time you level up your parry % goes down by a small fraction because your defense is lower than what it should be at that level when you level up, and goes back up to the same old 4.96% (max defense for level with no mods) as your skills level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its very small, a tiny tiny boost to parry and dodge.  Some folks thought that it ment you can tank as a lvl+ warrior.  So for instance, every +5 skill means that you are +1 lvl better as a tank.  After further testing, they found that only the crit % was effected enough to show up.<br />
<br />
IE, the higher your + defense skill, the less likely that mob or mobs above it will land a crit on you.  If you fight mobs +3 to +5 higher than you, they crit you a TON.  with the + skills, they crit you less.</div></div><hr />
