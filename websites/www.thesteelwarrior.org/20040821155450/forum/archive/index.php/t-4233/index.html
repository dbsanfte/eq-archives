<p class="largefont">View Thread : <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=4233">Just a Warning for the Stand Down</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eetum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to see this go off.  This cause has caught on like the wild fires in CA this year!  So many people support it for their own reasons.    I have started a new thread because i didn't want this to get lost in the big post!  There are important points here to keep this civil and to keep us out of trouble.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Class Balance<br />
Making a point to SoE<br />
Just to be heard!<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with one toon!  But ALL tooons no mater the class or race!<br />
<br />
Its  awake up call to SoE that we CAN and WILL gather as one and protest!<br />
<br />
A word of caution though....<br />
<br />
The GMs and Guides are aware of this and know it is coming.<br />
<br />
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE remember you manners!<br />
<br />
1. Try to refrain from spamming the /OOC and /SHOUT and /Auction.  <br />
2. Do not BLOCK access to PoT or another other place from other players.<br />
3. If you have a surname that is not with in the naming policy... I recommend you take another character or create an alt.  For I am sure there will be GMs in the zone and if they see you they will remove the surname.Character Naming Policy (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_naming_policy.jsp) <br />
<br />
And the most import one...  I read this in the first post of the STAND DOWN topic....<br />
<br />
**update 11.10.03 - Darkoan**<br />
Due to overwhelming request /petition has been removed from the action items. It was never our intent to flood petition queues and possibly cause harm to other players. Also, made it a bit more clear what we are after with our STAND DOWN. Miscellaneous changes.<br />
<br />
Spamming the petition queue is Guide harassment (planned activity for that night).<br />
<br />
Spamming them may be a good way to get a vaction from EQ you don't want.  <br />
<br />
How about instead of spamming the /petition que....  you pick one warrior one each server.  You all send ONE petition on each server stating why you have gathered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We the Warriors and Friends, of said server, have gathered peacefully in PoK to seek out action on Class Balance!  We plan to be here all day till we come to an understanding.  This is our game and we effect the game play.  This is our stand to effect it and would like to see some action taken!  Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then maybe do it again 6 hours later, then again at 9pm with a new petition.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have stood our ground to be heard!  We will sit on the steps of PoT stone again if we must! Thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
No i am not a guide.  But I do not want to see people get busted for this peaceful demistration.  I can see some people causing problems. <br />
<br />
People that do NOT support the issue will try to start arguments in /OOC or /SHOUT.. you know what  just like on this forum... IGNOR THEM!  even if that means adding them to your /ignor list for the day.<br />
<br />
We HAVE to keep this as civil as we can. I do play to be there for I have a warrior i use to play and my husband's main is a warrior and stopped playing due to the fact that Warriors are somewhat uneeded.  He is lvl 60 almost 61.. he fought his way to this lvl through the unbalanced times.  Just had enough of it.<br />
<br />
REmember the civil protest by Ghandi and Martin Luther King Jr.<br />
<br />
Be nice, civil, if they ask us to disperse (SP?) then we split up and gather in other places in smaller groups.  <br />
<br />
So all in all....<br />
<br />
Be Polite to the others playing the game.<br />
Don't spam the petition box.<br />
Try to keep it out of the public channels.<br />
And above all DO NOT argue with the GMS!<br />
<br />
These are my opinions.  I would like to see this go off and if we organize right there should be NO issues!<br />
<br />
And a side note.  If you join the severwide chant and you class gets bashed.  Brush it off.  state they have your support!  <br />
<br />
As it was stated in another post...  This is a touchy topic!<br />
And to those that are bashing... remember these people that are joining the chat chan may have a warrior as an alt, or a hubby or wife that has a warrior main.  And if the non-warrior starts bashing the cause....  then to me they are fair game.....<br />
<br />
Just remember if this does work and action is taken to work on this balance issue... even if they start it on test, we may be supporting their class one day in the same way..<br />
<br />
ok.  My 2cp<br />
<br />
/gets off the soap box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well stated, thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Is Guts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Basically, some warriors are proposing mass zone disruption to force SOE to address their grievances regarding class balance.<br />
<br />
As you may be aware, this isn't an SOE server. I don't have any control over the Dev Team.<br />
<br />
What I do have control over, however, is the smooth running of this server. If players would like to check sections 6 and 8 of the PnP, it specifically mentions organised zone disruption as being a breach of the guidelines.<br />
<br />
I fully understand the frustration that class balance brings to the game. I also fully understand that trying to disrupt the workings of the Plane of Tranquility (or any other zone on this server) to try and make a point to SOE Developers will not be looked upon in a positive light.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your understanding. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
This is how a GM from the Ubi server i play on views it, and hes a nice guy both in game and on the boards. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eetum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is straight from the PnP page of SoE official EQ site...<br />
1.1 Play Nice Policies - Activity within EverQuest  (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp) <br />
<br />
I havae highlighted the sections that we could run into issues with.  And as stated in another post.. if we do start to lag out PoK then those that are 46+ can move over to PoT, but not block the routes of players. Some can move to the Nexus.  Standing around the outside along the walls should keep us out of the way of those that still want to play.<br />
<br />
1.1 Play Nice Policies - Activity within EverQuest <br />
<br />
In addition to the general guidelines listed in section 1.0, players are also subject to these supplementary rules while playing EverQuest. While by no means an all-inclusive list of the do's and don'ts in EverQuest, it provides a suitable foundation by which the player can determine what activities are appropriate: <br />
<br />
1. You may not steal kills.<br />
<br />
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.<br />
<br />
The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy. <br />
<br />
2. You may not ninjaloot.<br />
<br />
Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.<br />
<br />
3. You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<br />
<br />
There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same NPC or hunt in the same area. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. <br />
<br />
If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a compromise. Any such compromise is final and not open to debate. Refusing to abide by these terms will be considered disruption and may result in disciplinary action. <br />
<br />
It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.<br />
<br />
Note: A &quot;group&quot; in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal.<br />
<br />
4. Foul language is not permitted, in any language.<br />
<br />
Excessive use of foul language in an inappropriate context, including swear words, real-world racial slurs, and other language that is not consistent with the fantasy environment and designed to hurt, will be considered a disruption. The existence of the filter (/filter) is not a license to be profane.<br />
<br />
5. You may not harass others.<br />
<br />
Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience them. As harassment can take many forms, the EQCSR involved will make a determination as to whether or not a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would feel harassed and act accordingly.<br />
<br />
6. You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.<br />
<br />
Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of players. This includes, but is not limited to::<br />
<br />
o Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area. <br />
<br />
o Deliberately blocking a doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get past.<br />
<br />
o Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested spawn site after having been instructed to do so by an EQCSR. <br />
<br />
o Making excessive and inappropriate use of public channels of communications (/shout, /ooc, etc.).<br />
<br />
o Intentionally causing excessive zone latency (creating excessive corpses, abusing spell effects, etc.).<br />
<br />
o Causing intentional experience loss to other players (deliberately impeding fleeing players by blocking their escape route, intentionally training NPCs on other players, etc.).[/i][/b]<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
7. You may not defraud other players.<br />
<br />
Fraud is defined as falsely representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's expense. Examples of this activity include, but are not limited to, using deception to deprive another player of items, slandering another player or impersonating them with the intention of causing harm to that player's reputation, or falsely representing one's identity in order to gain access to another player's account or account information.<br />
<br />
Fraud in all transactions between players may result in disciplinary action when confirmed by an EQCSR. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
8. You may not abuse other players or Customer Service Representatives.<br />
<br />
The following actions would be considered abuse:<br />
<br />
o Hate Mongering - participation in or propagation of Hate literature, behavior, or propaganda related to real -world characteristics. <br />
<br />
o Sexual Abuse or Harassment - untoward and/or unwelcome advances of a graphic and sexual nature. This includes, but is not limited to, virtual rape, overt sexual overtures, and stalking of a sexual nature. <br />
<br />
o Attempting to Defraud a CS Representative - Petitioning with false information with the intent of receiving benefits as a result. This includes reporting bug deaths, experience or item loss, or accusing other players of wrongdoing without basis for it. <br />
<br />
o Impersonating a Customer Service Representative - falsely representing yourself to another player as a Guide or a Verant Interactive employee. <br />
<br />
o CS Personnel Abuse - This includes, but is not limited to, sending excessive /petitions (as an individual or group), sending excessive /tells to a CS Representative, excessively using say or other channels to communicate to a CS Representative, making physical threats, or using abusive language against a CS Representative.<br />
<br />
o Implying Favoritism by EQCSRs - Stating that employees of SOE or members of the Guide program will show favor towards one or more parties involved in any given situation. This includes, but is not limited to, using threats of retribution or inferring that you will not be held accountable for your actions due to special consideration.<br />
<br />
Note: This list is not all-inclusive. Other actions may be determined as abuse at the discretion of the EQCSR.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
9. &quot;Role-playing&quot; does not grant license to violate these rules.<br />
<br />
Though EverQuest is a Role-playing game, the claim of &quot;Role-play&quot; will not be accepted in defense of any of the anti-social behaviors mentioned above. We strongly encourage role-playing, but cannot allow it to be done at the expense of others.<br />
<br />
10. You may not operate a guild that habitually violates these rules.<br />
<br />
Disciplinary issues involving guilds may be addressed with the entire guild. Guilds whose members habitually violate these rules may be issued guild warnings, and can even be permanently disbanded.<br />
<br />
Guild Leaders and/or officers may be held accountable for any actions of their guild members, in addition to any other actions that may be taken. It is therefore the responsibility of the guild leadership to ensure that all guild members abide by these rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eetum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here is a map from the game that will show where people zone in and where the stone is and the wall that surounds the stone.<br />
<br />
This way you can see where to stay clear and creat a path so people can get in and out of PoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Llewelyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Note: This list is not all-inclusive. Other actions may be determined as abuse at the discretion of the EQCSR.<br />
<br />
You forgot to highlight this.  In otherwords depending on their mood they decided if this peaceful rally is abuse.  Also not sure if it's just on the Bertoxx server but POK is already a laggy as hell zone near the POT to Nexus portal and near the banks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arches Nie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heres a thought...everyone sit BEHIND the PoK stone, along the wall, so there is NO QUESTION of anyone blocking any paths to or from PoT.  Its still makes a HUGE statement, as pretty much everyone will see the protesters when going to zone into PoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't petition at all.  The GMs and guides that read petitions have nothing to do with class balance anyway, so all you will do is annoy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sarhea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rather than petition, which is pointless, as Brutul says.  The guides don't have anything to do with this.<br />
<br />
Instead, what about periodic /feedback? I'm not totally sure how the feedback command works, or if it's even a viable option.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I think sitting behind the PoK stone is a great idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eetum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have opened the feedback window accouple of times when i didn't want it open.  Also have opened the bug window to. hehe<br />
<br />
/bug Melee need Balance!  <br />
<br />
That would be a hoot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wyndaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I don't want to do anything to disrupt other players.  I don't plan on blocking anyone's path or anything like that.  However, I have every right to leave my toon in that zone for as long as I like.  I won't petition, I won't do unrully shouts/oocs, I won't even feedback or /bug. <br />
<br />
But, I will log in and place my toon in the plane of knowledge with those LFG's and afk's.  Heck, I'll likely be walking around in the zone, so they can hardly fuss at me for anything.  If a big guild logged in and met near that stone, would they make you disburse?  <br />
<br />
Bah...  Melee's stand down.  Let everyone speak with one voice, just by showing up.  It's a great idea and will be well executed.<br />
<br />
Adventure well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/feedback is the appropriate place to comment on class balance issues in game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xahulz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">o Implying Favoritism by EQCSRs - Stating that employees of SOE or members of the Guide program will show favor towards one or more parties involved in any given situation.

<br />
Hah.  Can't help but comment on this, even if its a bit off topic.  In 4 years of play the number of absurd, rediculous, rule-breaking decisions i've seen Guide/GM's make is absurd, including <br />
<br />
-telling me that snare is not a combat spell (and therefore can be cast on people during corpse run)<br />
<br />
-telling me that pvp is zone disruption on a pvp server<br />
<br />
-telling me that naked players zoning in, agroing mobs, training them on me and zoning out is not training and is not zone disruption (the guide witnissed it happen twice in rapid succession)<br />
<br />
-spawning PoP flag mobs for some guilds and not others (which i thought was a carnal sin for GM's on any server)<br />
<br />
and on and on.<br />
<br />
Only a group of people that corrupt would have to make a rule stating that you are not allowed to imply they play favorites.  EQ has always had the worst custormer service of any company i've experienced in my life.  With rules stating you can't complain about it or you are punished, I suppose they can continue to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you do a feed back, you guys might want to consoladate what you want.  By demonstrating and saying for &quot;class balance&quot; doesnt say much.  Seriously you guys should probably have a list of thing for sony to consider instead of vaguely demonstarting for class balance as a generic thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just a thought. Since 50 or so all gathered around one stone may be considered a rules violation. How about as an option you stand as stated in the general rules of this stand down at your home city stone. Less impressive as everyone at one stone. But much less likely to cause problems. And SOE knows it`s coming anyways, and may have a quick banish/boot for the sit out. May be an option for those who want to participate with a little less risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/bug feedback is broken warriors still suck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The lag caused by the immense population present can in no way be considered zone disruption.<br />
<br />
PoK is already widely considered a rendez-vous zone, and even a merchant zone.<br />
Just like the bazaar, you have every single right to put your character there, and go AFK as long as you wish. <br />
Or just sit there and chat or do tradeskill or whatever you wish.<br />
As long as you don't directly annoy other characters.<br />
<br />
If no one blocks people, spams or petitions... then everything will run smoothly, as long as the GMs present there aren't as retarded as they sometimes appear to be.</div></div><hr />
