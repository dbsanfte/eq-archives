It's kind of like entering Harlem wearing a while hood &amp; cloak, you retard.<br />
And guess what? Both will get you killed.<br />
<br />
Had some idiot ranj0r (lvl 62 - and still dumb) using the thing in a group I was in. Not something that has a better ratio and NO agro proc, like disemboweler or wind-worn handblade or something else, but the hammer. Which costs more.<br />

Being the cleric is like being the parent of your group. You assign the ranger a time out to think about what he's done, and when he's learned his lesson, he can come back.</div></div><hr />

I was tanking a couple of days ago and a ranger whipped out a CHoS.  So I thought to myself &quot;Self, this guy's just itching for a bitching.&quot;<br />
<br />
After I wiped ranger guts off my boots and he got his rez, he actually had the nerve to get crusty about dying.  I told him &quot;maybe you should bag the aggro weapon if you don't like getting aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, the second ranger in the group decided to start using his bow after this.  :eek:</div></div><hr />

Anyway, we were doing well until 2 sentries started making their rounds. One, mercifully focused on a nearby group, while the other focused on mine. I tell my group &quot;Get close if you can&quot; and cast Lesser Evac. It goes off, and when loading into the graveyard the shaman of the group asks &quot;Did I die?&quot;<br />

I had to remind him that I was a wizard and was capable of getting the hell out of a hopeless fight with an Evac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most rangers shun the idea of a 2 hander... funny, a windblade out-parses their epic and has zero chance of drawing aggro. for the most part, the spells they cast do less damage than they'd have done in the time it took to cast if they'd kept swinging thier swords. <br />
They SHOULD be using their bow anyway most of the time. <br />
<br />
but then bitch that we can't &quot;keep aggro&quot;<br />
if they wanna tank it, let 'em imo... it wont last long and they wont get aggro again, from their bind point, gua-ran-tee.</div></div><hr />

&quot;funny, a windblade out-parses their epic and has zero chance of drawing aggro.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They SHOULD be using their bow anyway most of the time. &quot;<br />
<br />
1) Using a bow with Windblade equipped = ok DPS.<br />
<br />
2) Using a bow with Swiftwind (their EPIC) equipped = BETTER DPS.<br />
<br />
It's a better ranger who uses his/her epic when busting out the bow.<br />
<br />
Also, half the time it don't matter if they're using the copper hammer.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because unless the ranger's careful, a LOT of warriors have problems keeping aggro off of a ranger using Earthcaller.<br />
<br />
Nine times out of ten it's not the hammer getting them aggro ... it's the snare they cast, and the poor use or resists on jolt.<br />

Here are the rough estimates of what a Ranger's nukes will do for DPS, using the innate spell casting haste of a 65th ranger.  For lower levels, the DPS will be a touch lower due to less of a casting haste bonus.<br />
<br />
52nd level Icewind = 144 DPS<br />
59th level Calefaction = 180 DPS<br />
63rd level Freezing Winds = 280 DPS<br />
64th level Brushfire = 244 DPS<br />

Which weapons is the average ranger supposed to have that would make it more effective to melee without casting?</div></div><hr />

Well I am not trying to argue that ranger's casting spells lowers their dps, but honestly those number that you put up for dps are so wrong.  I dont know what you did but all of the ranger nukes are fast casting with LONG recast.  Straight from lucy<br />
<br />
Spell: Brushfire, 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 612 (L64) to 610 (L62), Mana: 220, Classes: RNG/64, Skill: Evocation, Casting: 3.5, Recast: 30<br />
<br />
Spell: Icewind, 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 360, Mana: 180, Classes: RNG/52, Skill: Evocation, Casting: 3, Recast: 18<br />
<br />
Spell: Calefaction, 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 444 (L44) to 450 (L50), Mana: 250, Classes: RNG/59 DRU/44, Skill: Evocation, Casting: 2.5, Recast: 45<br />
<br />
Spell: Frozen Wind, 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 700, Mana: 300, Classes: RNG/63, Skill: Evocation, Casting: 3.5, Recast: 30<br />
<br />
So best case a ranger could cycle through all these spells as follows once, then they would be waiting on recast times.<br />
<br />
Brushfire 612 damage 3.5 second cast + 2 second gem refresh (5 sec)<br />
<br />
Icewind 360 damage 3 second cast + 2 sec gem refresh (5 seconds)<br />
<br />
Calefaction 444 damage 2.5 second cast + 2 sec gem refresh (4.5 sec)<br />
<br />
Frozen Wind 800 damage 3.5 second cast + 2 sec gem refresh (5.5 seconds)<br />
<br />
Total time = 20 seconds<br />
Damage Total =  2216<br />
Damage / sec= 110 dps<br />
Man spent: 950 mana (ouch that hurts for hybrid that usually has zero med time and minimal Flowing thought)<br />
<br />
So really rangers can chain all their nukes for at least 20 seconds to do less dps than they can do using bow or melee in about the same amount of time for no mana usage.  Obviously in the real world rangers mix in a few nukes here and there but they aren't chain wearing wizards by any means.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are forgetting about the innate spell haste that hybrids receive on some of their spells that have a cast time of 3.0 secs or more.  Brushfire/Frozen Wind have a cast time of 1.9 secs or so for a 65 ranger.  Cleric Blessing of Reverence buff will drop it to 1.8.  This is how Ladas computed the DPS for the nukes.<br />
<br />
Edit:  As a side note, if I'm wielding my Windblade I can time it so that my casting happens BETWEEN swings.  This makes the nukes FREE DPS, costing nothing but mana and possible aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sulvar... the post I quoted specifically said... let me quote it again for you..<br />
<br />
&quot;the spells they cast do less damage than they'd have done in the time it took to cast if they'd kept swinging thier swords.&quot;<br />
<br />
The numbers I put up show the DPS of the spell for its casting time.  That should be compared against the DPS of the ranger's weapons for that same segment of time... ie swinging for 2.5 seconds or casting for 2.5 seconds.  <br />
<br />
I'm not aware of any weapon combo (DW or 2H) that lets me melee for anywhere close to 280 DPS, which is what would need to exist for the quote to be accurate.<br />
<br />
Any ranger that doesn't cast their nukes when they can is hurting their DPS.  I use a SEWS, and just using Freezing Winds in PoFire exp groups when it refreshes adds about 15-20 DPS to my totals.<br />
<br />
And Surefire is correct about the casting times... Brushfire and FW both cast in about 1.8 seconds for me with my spell haste earring, but I used 2.5 seconds for those DPS numbers to account for some lag.  2 Second is probably more accurate for exp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't disagree with you that casting nukes is worthwhile, but putting up the dps of nukes as (damage / their casting time) is a strange thing to do.  I mean I can run up to a mob and hit attack and instantly get 500-750 damage with a single melee attack round in under one second.  Does that mean that melee does 500-750 dps :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I don't disagree with you that casting nukes is worthwhile, but putting up the dps of nukes as (damage / their casting time) is a strange thing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
And why exactly would casting nukes for a ranger be worthwhile?  Is it because the damage potential of those nukes is higher than the average damage of the melee during the same time segment?  Yes.  And how exactly would you determin that?  Wow, imagine that... by looking at the DPS of nukes over casting compared to melee DPS.<br />
<br />
And I don't give a damn if you think its strange or not, thats how hybrids determine effectiveness of nukes/DOTS, and its also happens to counter the absurd assertion by the poster that the ranger would do more damage in melee during the cast time of a spell than casting the spell.  Or do you have a better method of answering the remark?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean I can run up to a mob and hit attack and instantly get 500-750 damage with a single melee attack round in under one second. Does that mean that melee does 500-750 dps :P&quot;<br />

You should refrain from any further attempts to be cute... they just make you appear stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said this is all theory, in real EQ rangers spend 99% of their time sitting in PoK waiting for the rez box to pop up and doing 0 dps ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossirian</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Using a bow with Windblade equipped = ok DPS.<br />
<br />
2) Using a bow with Swiftwind (their EPIC) equipped = BETTER DPS.<br />
<br />
It's a better ranger who uses his/her epic when busting out the bow.<br />
<br />
Not necessarily. If you're group with that tank who insists on cornering exp group mobs, it makes more sense to just leave your best melee weapon equipped as you're going to end up meleeing anyway at some point.<br />
<br />
Also once you hit the attack cap, both Windblade and Swiftwind are equally garbage weapons. In this case, you with a melee weapon combination that will get you the most ATK when equipped (and only primary accounts) or with one that will give you the best stats for the situation.<br />
<br />
Personally though, I really wished I owned a BOC, which is going to be way more agro than a CHoS. I have this theory that when I am in a group shooting arrows while the cleric and enchanter are tag team tanking, they might appreciate lack of subtilty of a non-tanking class wiped one out and an Enraging Blow weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The numbers I put up show the DPS of the spell for its casting time. That should be compared against the DPS of the ranger's weapons <br />
for that same segment of time... ie swinging for 2.5 seconds or casting for 2.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Your claims are still misleading....<br />
<br />
You do not take refresh time into consideration at all. Spell casting haste only impacts actual casting time, not refresh time. It is impossible to chain nuke Brushfire, Icewind, Calefaction and Frozen Wind in such a way that would have back to back casting with no regard to refresh times. Even on raids where I did my best to get some form of chain-casting going, I would be OOM far sooner than the actual casters and had a delay between castings. Even with Spell Casting Fury 3, it makes more sense to use DD spells as supplemental damage to archery or melee DPS and not as the primary source of damage.<br />
<br />
Additionally the comment someone made about hitting a mob for 500-750 damage on a single round holds true. I have yet to meet anyone that parced DPS based on one single hit. DPS calculating is always done so as a calculation based on substained damage over a preferably long period of time.<br />
<br />
To get to the point, If I normally hit with Frozen Wind for about 800 but can critical nuke for about 1500 - is my DPS for Frozen Wind 800 or 1500? Even knowing this, you cannot average it and make a claim of 1150 because doing so does not take into account things like how often I critial nuke nor refresh time nor overall DPS over a given time.</div></div><hr />

This snippet just confused me... &quot;subtilty&quot;? &quot;wiped one out and an Enraging Blow weapon&quot;? English as a second language for Crydee, perhaps.<br />
<br />
But what really gets me wondering is, why in god's name would you want to rely on a proc weapon for agro when you can chain snare to your heart's content for reliable agro?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossirian</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I meant is sometimes the ranger wants agro as an alternative to the cleric and enchanter tanking. Heck I've been in some groups where 5 people were tanking and not one of them was assigned a job. Just because a ranger owns an agro-inducing weapon, does not automatically make it a bad thing. What matters really is knowing when it is appropriate to use it and when it isn't.</div></div><hr />

All I'm going to say is this ... Crydee ... if a ranger is at a point in their career where they have to choose between Swiftwind or a Windblade, then it is more than likely they are NOT at the attack cap.</div></div><hr />

2)  Those numbers I put up were in direct response to the person who said rangers would be better off doing melee 100% of the time because our nukes do less damage for the time we spend casting them than our melee.  Those numbers are a rough estimate of what the DPS of our nukes would be in comparison to the time missed from melee.  Its clearly said that way, at least 2 over two posts.<br />
<br />
3)  Recast time has jack squat to do with this situation, since recast time doesn't in any way affect our melee... while the gems are refreshing, we are swinging swords (or shooting bows, whatever) and back to our baseline DPS for those weapons.<br />
<br />
4)  I never said anything about chain casting those spells as a replacement to melee.  Sulvar went through some exercise trying to layout the DPS of a ranger doing nothing but casting, but that about as much relevance to my post as your does now.<br />
<br />
5)  I agree that our nukes are supplemental damage only... but oddly enough, thats exactly what I was showing.  Nuking during melee raises your DPS over pure melee because the time lost casting generates higher DPS than the same time with melee.<br />
<br />
Again... maybe I should do this in bold... the comment made was that ranger nukes do less damage for the casting time than ranger melee, so rangers shouldnt cast.  I didn't present sustainable nuking DPS, I clearly said that was the DPS of the spells as a comparison against the DPS of weapons for the time in melee the casting was replacing.<br />
<br />
For sustainable damage, just casting Freezing Winds when it refreshes in PoFire in expereince groups boosts my damage by 18-23 DPS, with SPC3 and Cloak of Combustion.</div></div><hr />

The idea that only three classes in the game (warriors and knights) can handle having any amount of agro without dying immediately is so ridiculous to me that I will treat it as a joke. Bad news for you here if you have not figured out already, the non-tanking classes do have far more than one hit point and one point of AC.<br />
<br />
If I join an EXP group only to find that I roughly have five hundred more hit points and a few hundred more AC then that he has maybe 50 AA on top of that, I'm not going to be fooled into thinking that I will fall over dead should a mob take a few swipes at me. It still makes more sense to have said &quot;tank&quot; do the mob tanking, not because he's better (which he isn't) but because it cuts into my DPS. There are shaman that can do an excellent job of tanking in an EXP group.<br />
<br />
That being said if a traditionally non-tanking class (such as a ranger or monk) wants to own an agro inducing weapon, let them. If the person built up their character to the point that yes they can tank, they're not hurting anyone as there are probably only four or five other people per server of the same class that can do so effectively. If the person cannot, then they are an idiot and needs to die repeatedly for the good of the class until it penetrates their thick skull that tanking isn't for them. <br />
<br />
I see it as a win-win situation. On one hand if might help a high-end person who could handle the agro maintain it, while at the same time weeds out those who have false ideas about the average person of the class can and cannot do.<br />
<br />
<br />
2)  Those numbers I put up were in direct response to the person who said rangers would be better off doing melee 100% of the time because our nukes do less damage for the time we spend casting them than our melee.  Those numbers are a rough estimate of what the DPS of our nukes would be in comparison to the time missed from melee.  Its clearly said that way, at least 2 over two posts.<br />
<br />
Again I don't agree with blanket catch-all statements. Using last night for example, I was consistantly nuking for 25 points of damage with Frozen Wind during the Undead trial in Plane of Time. Brushfire wasn't much better, and overall I only got a few DD hits in the hundreds. I'm not trying to be scientific here, but when you consider the -150 resist modifier on the Cry of Thunder proc and that it still lands for full damage when I do melee, in some ways it made more sense to just straight melee it on the chance that the proc might go off. Personally though, I tend to just do 100% archery as getting line of sight isn't hard and the DD spells do mean a DPS cut in this example.<br />
<br />
However at other times, the mobs seem paticular weak to my nukes and DDs land for full damge. When you add in things like Anger of Solusek (+25% Damage Increase on DDs) and Spell Casting Fury 3, the overall DPS on DD spells is going to be a bit higher on average than when unmodified thus I feel that an DPS average over a period of time both 100% physical damge and a mixture of physical with DD damage would show a DPS increase overall when spells are used than not used. Sure you loose a hit or two while casting, but it is more than made up for in the long run by an overall DPS incease. Blanket statements in the other direction in that rangers should never use DDs on the basis of lower DPS are also similarly wrong, false and misleading simply because sometimes it is true and sometimes it isn't.<br />
<br />
The main reason why I don't like the DPS based on the two seconds it takes you to cast the spell approach is because it leaves things open for member of another class who doesn't necessarily fully understand to go in and make wild claims about what you can and cannot do. If you don't believe me, dig through the Paladins of Norrath forum and find some of stuff they say about archery. You'll find claims about how our DPS for a disclipline with a 72 minute refresh time is our normal everyday EXP group DPS simply because some of them could not distinguish the difference between the two.</div></div><hr />

Actually, in that instance he IS a better tank than you.<br />

Peep the mitigation parses and threads on this very message board to find out how/why a warrior is still the better damage absorption class.</div></div><hr />

Hey I like the fact that rangers come in here defending themselves.  <br />
<br />
LOL Personally I see no reason for warriors and rangers to not get along. You're a tanking class. I'm a DPS class. We should be united against the real enemy (paladins) who are out to get everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only real problem I have with warriors is when they the munchies and sack Rivervale then eat all the hobbits on a day that I'm trying to make picnics. Guys leave some alive so I can buy fresh Jumjum.</div></div><hr />

it seems you 2 definately know what you're doing. Some rangers dont. I've seen rangers in the high 50's and &lt;1k AC with a bloodsworn in PoP. Let us bitch a little, huh? <br />
I didnt mean to make &quot;blanket statements about what (rangers) can and can't do&quot; insofar as to be argueing with rangers about rangering. <br />
I know a well equipped ranger can tank. Ive seen it. In BOT ive seen a ranger kite the mob till it was slowed and then tank it just fine. NP. monks can tank pretty well too. any toon with high enough AC can tank in some circumstances.  <br />
mentioned was that ranger nukes can increase over-all dps 20 or 30. great. Im sure there are plenty of circumstances where that would be truely a benefit. The point i was trying to make was said nukes gain aggro on a mob that doubles for 1100, and ranger DPS goes to zero. <br />
so my rant may not have been entirely accurate, or didnt make sense when applied to most conditions. sue me. Of course, I also realize that you probably wouldnt be posting to this thread as a ranger if you werent lookin' to argue about something, hehe. ... so I'll shut up.... :D :D :D<br />
Paladins still suck, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I do have a question.  Assuming Sean is right that a ranger with a good 2h-er does more damage then one using archery (Outside of trueshot.) And given max offensive AA ranger and Warrior.  Does a Ranger out DPS a Warrior?  They have 100-150 atk advantage on a Warrior, while a warrior has natural tripple attack and flurry/pop flurry.  If xp group tanking add in Tactical Mastery.  If that's the case what's the role of a Ranger really?</div></div><hr />
