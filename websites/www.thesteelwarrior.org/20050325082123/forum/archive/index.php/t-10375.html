I'm hoping to score some AC/hp augs and possibly the 36% haste aug (what im really after).<br />
<br />
PS, are there any duo-able AC/HP augs out there anyone knows of? still have the same 68 druid at my disposal</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks, I kinda assumed it was one groupable hence the title of my post, anyone have any tips on scoring specifically the AC/hp/haste augs?  I have been digging through the library ferubi post but a more up to date (read: post oow release) with strategies on those specific bits would be extremely useful. My eventual goal here is to go to aug haste, as such I have pretyt much 2 options, 350k+ (on trib) 40% haste augment, or the one from here.<br />
<br />
Any tips on the haste aug in particular? looking for personal experience here</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doable with EP- &amp; EP level , CC or Puller highly recomended, Snarer is a necessity<br />
<br />
2 goats that drop  25/25/25 augment : 100% drop rate, pop is random<br />
2 goats that drop 15ac augment : 100% drop rate, pop rate is random<br />
<br />
Some other really nice items do drop there (110hp ring, etc etc).<br />
The haste augment drops on the lower side of the map to the left (not weapon master side).<br />
I have see the named 6 times, and we got lute/ring every one if i remember well.<br />
So seems kinda rarish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps : for haste dont bother, 350k is crazy,  spend 5k to 10k (buy mask of thunder / takish BP)<br />
and you will have enough to keep tribute haste 36% (best choice) running for weeks.<br />
<br />
Ps 2 : Try to farm some oldworld content or grab some PoP droppables.<br />
These will fund your haste for a long time.<br />

Still use 2 of those 15ac to date.</div></div><hr />

The placeholder of Hexxt Pzik Shziaak spawns on the north wall of the center room of the zone alone. Once your group is down there he is a solo pull and hits no harder than the regular mobs in the zone.  I would guess that you could park your druid and warrior in the north-west corner of the room once there and farm him until he drops your aug.  We used to park a spare cleric in that corner so I know it is safe.<br />
<br />
  The worst part of Ferubi is getting around in it.  Every time you want to farm bits for Smith Rondo you have to kill every damned mob along the way.  If you wipe you need a SoS rogue or a corpse summon to CR.  The mobs get tougher past the haste aug room but the experience gets better.  You can pull Hexxt N`Vak Tkan to the haste aug room if you pull out the south door and grab the mobs along the south-east branch. He drops the melle ring with 11ac and 110hps.  The 15ac augs drop in the deepest parts of Ferubi and can be challenging to get the Hammermaster and the Brawler to spawn. Unless you are lucky and trigger them clearing down you need to pull mobs all around them until they spawn. Can take awhile and often is frustrating.<br />
<br />
  At level 65 until we learned the tricks we found Ferubi to be a bit of a challenge, especially the southern parts of the zone.  Was there yesterday farming Rondo bits and the mobs were an absolute joke.  The cleric, enchanter, ranger and monk in my group were being 4 boxed by one guy, we had a 62 wizard twink along for augs and I was pulling and bringing whatever I aggroed with my arrows.  OoW has trivialized this zone alot.  So bring 5 friends and I'm sure you can mine what you want out of Ferubi with little trouble.</div></div><hr />

I remember farming it while 2 boxing a chanter and shaman and using charm. I died about 10 times before I found a working strat. After that, about an hour of steady killing I got the shoulders and a few other drops and augs. Fun zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">surprised you got the shoulders that fast... they are super rare.  I led multiple mini raids in there with my old guild, slaughtering quite a few hundred mobs, as well as doing a few single group grinds.  I saw 2 shoulders drop total.</div></div><hr />
