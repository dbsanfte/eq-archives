<br />
I know in the past I have unloaded pp and gear onto &quot;newbies&quot; and now I somewhat regret having done this because it does feed the beggar mentality.<br />
<br />
Some people just want everything handed to them for nothing.<br />
<br />
I get begged a lot, and it's very annoying. I like to think I'm a generous person, and I like to help others. So saying no to these people bothers me... but I know it's what I should do. They need to learn to stand on their own two feet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylaa</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, to me, it's one thing to be asked or begged for something, and another thing entirely to give someone something out the kindness of your heart, because you want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will go out of my way to see that a beggar does not receive anything from me.  I've even blatantly given out items to non-begging newbies right in front of beggars just so they know that begging pisses me off.<br />
<br />
Lately, I just /i immediately.  I just have no desire to bother with it anymore.  I had a level 20 Warrior in full Crusty beg from me a while back.  After I explained to him what I was wearing at level 20 (early Kunark days, Bronze with 1 or 2 pieces of Crafted and 2 Langseaxes) he laughed at me, then begged some more.  Then I told him to get bent.  Since then I just have no respect for anyone who begs.</div></div><hr />

THough i have to admit, if they make a char and go straight to the pok bank, they arnt newbs. Plus, they could try to look newb like. Totally naked characters without a rusty sword or a candle arnt newbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daex</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I don't understand the point of begging, they've made the newbie game so easy now. <br />
<br />
I had a 65 iksar necromancer and 60 human wizard, gave the username and password to someone I thought I trusted. The account was then taken from me. Trust no one in this game. <br />
<br />
Anyway, after a few months away...<br />
<br />
I recently started up again new on Lany's server last friday. I asked my friend what his guild needed, he said warriors. So I made a level 1 ogre warrior. <br />
<br />
I did the newbie quests and have a full suit of teal armor with damn good stats(good ac, sta, str and hp mods) for how easy the quests were. Filled the rest of the slots with cloth that dropped.  Then did a quest for the newbie warrior sword. Easy enough, lasted me till 8. Made 10pp from hunting, went the bazaar and bought a Crystal Fiber, 8/26 whip for 2pp. Then went to Crushbone until 14 and got a Dwarven Axe(6/26) which dropped form Lord Darish.<br />
<br />
I'm now lvl 25 and rising, with no problems at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I put in my character profile (the one ppl see when they right click) DON'T BEG FROM ME! Work for loot...<br />
<br />
Anyway, the other day I got begged from for the 1st time in ages..<br />
<br />
Begger &quot;Gimme some stuff&quot;<br />
Me (kinda shocked) &quot;No&quot;<br />
Beggar &quot;I bet you were a lot nicer when you were lower level&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he ran off...<br />
<br />
/boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best beg attempt - lvl 40something female monk walks up to me and does the kiss emote, then asks for 2k I think it was.  Still got a no though.<br />
<br />
Worst beg attempt - lvl 20something dwarf warrior asks me for old equipment.  I tell him that all my stuff is no drop now a days, and I don't have any old dropable equip (which is actually true).  He uses /rude a few times.  Since he was near I look at him, and he has dual lammys, and decent armor, and not just that, but he has actually dyed his armor.  Any newb that has enough money to waste on dying their armor doesn't need any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I put them on ignore immediately.  Simple and effective.<br />
<br />
I used to be really helpful, I would take my old gear that wasn't great to sell and hand it to newbies that I saw with crappy gear out trying to level.  But what that got me was constant begging for more stuff...  even to the point of being asked to camp specific items for them.  No way, not again.  <br />
<br />
I killed Muglwump near the zone in Warrens the other day, let a level 10 or so loot the robe he dropped, major upgrade from his senior apprentice robe.  No thanks, nothing.  He's outside talking to his friends about his new duds, I saw it on my wifes computer.  But he doesn't say a peep to me, I thought maybe he was a kid who had trouble typing or something...  but nope.<br />
<br />
I will only hand stuff down to friends and people I have met and have gotten to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its so rare you run across a genuine newbie with no malice nor larceny in their hearts.... About 3 years ago *even then, it was rare*, I ran into a newbie who didn't ask anything of me, had several characters that he genuinely enjoyed playing, and played quite a lot. He barely could make ends meet on his characters, as his gear was always completely sub-par to everyone else of his levels, and he had to make do with what he could...<br />
<br />
When I met him, I didn't give him anything, as he didn't ask. He just wanted someone to kill stuff with, and talk to. And he got it.<br />
<br />
And much more. Three years later, we're still friends, and yet he has no characters above level 63. He plays mostly the same ones, has completely sub-par gear, and yet never asks anything of anyone...<br />
<br />
But over the years I've done everything I could to help him, without 'twinking' him completely *That would ruin the game for him*. He's probably gotten 100,000 platinum out of me in that time. But he didn't make enemies, he didn't annoy people, and to those he's known to, he's known as a friendly competent person. He's made out far better than those beggars out there.<br />
<br />
And yes, I'm rambling telling my story. But let this be a lesson to you beggars. The people who can afford it are 10 times more likely to give you something if you DON'T ask. I know I go out of my way to help anyone who genuinely wants to know how to play this game or this class, be they level 1 or 65. And sometimes that help can be in the form of helping kill something, or helping them pick gear, and getting it for them if they can't afford it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time I fired up a level 1 character I had some random person ninja buff me, and others try and throw some items my way.<br />
<br />
In one case, I had to take the items offered as It seemed the person offering would be hurt if I didn't.  I gave them away later but =/.<br />
<br />
I suppose its just was/is a matter of time before people try and milk it for all its worth.<br />
<br />
I just ignore beggers myself !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually get 5 or so tells every time I go into the bazaar from beggars. Generally I ignore them, sometimes the people send 2 or 3 tells begging and I just reply no and they leave me alone. Every once in a while, if I am feeling mean. I'll say go get me 20 batwings and I'll give you 500plat. Then I'll log an alt, that gives me a few laughs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never begged, but very early on when I first started playing two gifts made a huge difference to me: a sarnak ceremonial sword (2HS, something like 8 damage 34 delay, lol) and a zraxthril forged axe (1HS, 10 damage 31 delay, STR +2, WIS +1, HP +5, and er, Mana +5).<br />
<br />
I was level 8, pre-Luclin, blind-in-the-dark Barbarian standing in Halas with a rusty 2HS I'd looted because I'd heard you were supposed to max all your skills and I was trying to sort out my inventory when a guy asked me what sword I was wielding. He had to ask me a couple of times because my inventory boxes covered my tell box and I wasn't expecting anyone to talk to me, since I didn't know anyone. But he patiently stood by until I realized with a shock that he'd been speaking to me. That guy gave me the SCS and I was so happy (a magic weapon! Maybe someday I'd be able to kill wisps!). Thanked him and asked if there was anything I could do for him. At that point he started offering me other stuff, including plat (5 or 10 pp, as I recall--far more than I had at the time). I refused, of course.<br />
Later another guy saw me trying to help an even lower-level player than myself with a Vengeful skel and suddenly the trade window opens and there's the Zraxthril! I told him I couldn't pay him for it, as I didn't have enough pp for a weapon that good. Lol. After he gave it to me I really looked at it and realized it had stat bonuses, so I asked him if he'd really meant to give it to me and said I'd return it if he thought he'd made a mistake.<br />
Ah, he must have been rolling on the floor.<br />
On several occasions later he stopped what he was doing and told me how to do stuff like make hotkeys. Of course, taking his time to answer my questions was far more generous than giving the weapon.<br />
<br />
I stopped giving anything to beggers the day I was begged for my mainhand weapon. Some things are just beyond the pale.<br />
<br />
I do sometimes try to find new, non-begging players to give stuff to, though, since it made a huge difference to me.<br />
<br />
Weirdly, I've found that switching out my weapons for a Langseax of the Wolves before banking dramatically cuts down on me getting begged. It's a sturdy, but very unflashy graphic. And, if I am begged, I can just link it, tell 'em what I did was quest this and suggest they do whatever newbie quest thingy their class/race allows. Eventually, of course, one of them will tell me that the LoWs sucks, and that their weapon is better than that.<br />
Then, for the first time, I'll beg.<br />

<br />
beggars, bleh....such idiots. Like Frodlin said; if they'd only realise that if you work at just playing the game and enjoying yourself or something; you'll usually end up getting more than what you know what to do with.<br />
<br />
myself as shikarii tho; i think i have equipped every halfling in misty thicket with black alloy gear i pick up from runnyeye...it's nice to pass on stuff who those who are hard working and can put some things to good use.</div></div><hr />

I tell beggers to get there equipment the way I did....it means so much more then.<br />

Wrong he was.<br />
         when i asked him how he saw me when i had only been on a minute he got quiet for a while.<br />
<br />
after a couple minutes he asks if he can still have some stuff cause he's new. i said if you're new you need newbie armor. <br />
<br />
he didn't like that :)<br />
<br />
i just ignored him after that and he left me alone. musta found someone else &quot;he saw earlier&quot;<br />

I do fell bad for the new guys if they are truly new and hard up. I dont give to beggers as I know most have another character they are begging the stuff for. I dont give out pp but I rather give out items that are not worth that much.<br />
<br />
I just remember how tough it was when I first started the game about 3 years ago. I do tend to reward better behavior better than bad behavior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beggers are definitely annoying,but it all depends on their manner.<br />
Ive had some people ask me for a specific (low) amount of pp for &lt;fill in the blank&gt; lvl spells and when told no thanked me for my time, or when told yes thanked me for that.<br />
Then you have the griefers who ask for stuff you dont have/rediculous stuff and bug you till you ignore or report them.<br />
<br />
One thing that always annoyed me when i was new to the game was my brother (he played on a diff server) was always getting new stuff by begging. I never saw someone get so much stuff for free.By the time he quit playing around lvl 48 he had pretty much the best droppable armor available to him + lot of other stuff and way more cash than me in the bank.I watched him ask plenty of random people for stuff(now he would do it as sugar sweet as possible and not grief when they said no) but he would ususlly get somrthing(even had one of the aforementioned &quot;bonechip requesters&quot;,he racked up on cash collecting those)<br />
<br />
I tried &quot;begging&quot; a couple times and after a couple tongue lashings and &quot;i dont have anything&quot; I gave up and figured my brothers server must be nicer.<br />
However when I was in my low 20s I was minding my own business changing copper to pp in the FV bank after a daylong killing spree at the sarnak fort,when some shaman just sitting outside sent me a tell.He told me he was cleaning out his bank and had a nice weapon that he hadno use for and didnt feel like selling and asked me if I wanted it.Well what am I going to say?lol<br />
Anyway he gave it to me (being a halfelf I think he assumed I was a ranger) it turned out to be a Silver Swiftblade.I asked him if he minded if I sold it and he said he didnt care. I thanked him for it and went *skipping* away.<br />
After auctioning to sell it I got a tell from a ranger with an Earthen Blade(This was back in 2001 and i was 20ish,the dmg on it+haste proc looked godly) and asked if I wanted to trade.I jumped on it and weilded that weapon proudly for the next 15 levels or so I think.<br />
Anyway,moral of the story is begging may be bad, but random acts of kindness to *true newbies* can go a long way.<br />
<br />
PS:Still have that old pos earthen blade for memories now, just sitting in the bank heh.Never plan on getting rid of it heh</div></div><hr />
