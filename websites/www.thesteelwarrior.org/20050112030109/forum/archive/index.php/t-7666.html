<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackmantis monkey</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to pick up a pair of silver steel gauntlets for my warrior. Everything I have read on alla's or wherever says they are a pretty common drop off Vkjor above the pvp arena in Kael. I set up shop there for a while now and I'm 0-8 on Vkjor killings. I was wondering if he still dropped them, or if I should gather my minions and start killing mobs back behind vindy.<br />
<br />
thanks for any input</div></div><hr />

Yup, I've been around the block in eq since before Kunark on a number of different high level toons. Done my fair share of camping. I was just wondering if anyone had any recent info on Vkjor and if he still drops them. If its just a matter of waiting him out, then thats fine. But if he no longer drops them, I'll move on.<br />

Vkjor down 12 times now. No gaunts. 5 giant meats.<br />

I read a post from Furor somewhere saying this was 100% proved broken.<br />
<br />
Take that for what you want.</div></div><hr />

I'd guess that if they're just a random GoZ drop then Vkjor doesn't drop them anymore.</div></div><hr />

We're in EPlanes now and I still wear them atm.</div></div><hr />
