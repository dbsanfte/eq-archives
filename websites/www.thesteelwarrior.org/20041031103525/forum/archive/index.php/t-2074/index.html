<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey, i'm new here, as i am to everquest (june 15th). i play a 31 warrior on the newbie server it's very underpopulated. jennafezz burrfoot is my first character (i might make a druid someday though). i got to 31 easily by practically living at unrest, but now i'm growing out of it, and i'm wondering where to go next. i have PoP and Luclin only. i don't like dungeons much. <br />

i need to work on my armor, i know... but any specific tips you can give me? on good weapons, good armor, whatever? i also want to know how you get procs on weapons or what weapons have procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually stromm is more crowded than any other server in these levels :)<br />
<br />
Highkeep is good, Sol A castle is good.. dungeon types though as thats where the high exp boni are.<br />
your best bet on weapons is saving plat and more plat up to buy good tradeskilled stuff, these will hit the bazaar soon. <br />
On armor, you might want to quest a diamond cut inlaied mask with the sarnak blood in PoK, it has decent stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sol A gave good exp through 41 or so down by the clockworks, if you dont mind being kos to them, might have a hard time buying tink bags later on, but can easily get around that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This should be in The Bunker btw....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go to Dawnshroud Place(Luclin) and get in triabl groups untill 38 or 39.  Then go buy Kunark and head on over to The Dreadlands and Group there untill 50.  You sound like the type of person who gets comfortable and attached to a hunting ground.  These two zones will get ya up to 50 and you will meet and group with alot of people along the way.<br />
<br />
This is what Im currently doing with a re-rolled warrior and it is working out pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, Kunark is a good expansion to have through lvls 30-50.  Kunark has alot of good mid-high lvl zones like OT, DL, KC that can get you up fast in lvls.<br />
<br />
Highkeep is good up to about 33, so probably not best for you since you already lvl 31.  Umm, Sol A is good xp, but you might have a hard time getting a group together to go there.  Dawnshroud is probably your best bet, or even Marus Seru.  I'd say once you get to around 38 or 39, if you still don't have Kunark then go to Tenebrous Mountains on Luclin, it's pretty decent there.  Anywho, best of luck to you!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i guess i might suck it up and spend the 20$ on the trilogy..<br />
<br />
but yeah, i get attatched to a spot really easily, im not that much of an explorer. thanks :)</div></div><hr />
