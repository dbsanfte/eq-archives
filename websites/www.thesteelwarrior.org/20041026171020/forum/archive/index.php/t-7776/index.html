<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Those commercials make me sick. I eat once in a while watching TV and boom right around dinnertime while watching some sitcom like Seinfeld and boom… I get a nice dose of tampon/pad advertising and a nice feeling of my food wanting to come out.<br />
<br />
WTF… These commercials should not be shown during daytime. Didn’t they ban all condom and other sex related advertising from TV during daytime hours? Why this should be different? Fucking sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same here, but the tampon/pads dont bother me. It's the bikini line shaver commercials that get me, where they show the chicks crotch with razorbumps /shudder. That or starving children, makes me feel guilty.</div></div><hr />

That's not sex related tho, it's basic biology.  It's something that's gotta be dealt with whether you're sexually active or not.  It's no different than the 900 commercials for fucking toothpaste or deodorant.  Neither of those are pleasant subjects either, yet we all gotta deal with it on a day to day basis.<br />
<br />
Married Casai?  Just curious since my viewpoint on that matter has changed a whole lot in the 5 and a half years I've been living with a female.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Deodorant and toothpaste does not bother me anywhere near as much. Pads/tampons in my books have as much to do with sex as condoms and I can almost fit those in the hygiene department too. Safe sex and all. Basically I don’t want to see any advertising about anyone's genitals while I am eating. Is that too much to ask?<br />
<br />
Nah man I am not married. I haven’t found a woman yet that can stand me for more then a few weeks :) or the other way around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nah man I am not married. I haven&#8217;t found a woman yet that can stand me for more then a few weeks :) or the other way around.<br />

rofl!<br />

<br />
Easy solution to that would be don't eat and watch television at the same time. <br />
<br />
The things you metion are indeed biology. The products are necessary; I'm sure you would rather they advertise and sell these items rather than the alternative.<br />
It's not like anyone is doing it just to annoy or gross you out specifically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup, I agree, if you've got a weak stomach, then I reckon ya might wanna stop eating in front of the TV.  Oh, and don't even think about eating at the computer desk...the intarweb is a strange and wonderful place.<br />

Reason I brought it up is because things change once they become YOUR problem too.  Be happy it's not your problem and all you have to watch is some commercials where they soak up some blue liquid.  Once you start living with a woman, it becomes your problem whether you like it or not.  It's just like being embarrassed about buying condoms...it's no big deal really, it's a necessary facet of life, it shows you're being responsible and at least the checkout lady knows you're getting some :)  Same thing with all that crap, it's a necessary evil.  It's not pretty, but it's gotta be dealt with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sadly I know what you mean Haass. Ignorance is bliss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree...watching Seinfeld makes me want to vomit  :)</div></div><hr />

Do you have any idea how many people want to kill you now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm guessing not as many as think Seinfeld is utter shit that should be scoured from the airwaves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">trust me when yer married and every month yer bathroom trashcan looks<br />
like you cleaned up after 5 murders you get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I don't know about that bad pig; but i got a lid on the trashcan so it's my wife's deal. like the cat's litterbox is my job to clean; she cleans the bathroom garbage can :D<br />
<br />
and i agree with haass on the seinfeld thing; what a waste of television IMO. i'd rather watch Davey and Goliath.</div></div><hr />

I live and work in New York.  Seeing more narcissists on television is not entertainment.</div></div><hr />
