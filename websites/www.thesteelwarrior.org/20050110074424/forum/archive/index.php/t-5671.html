---------<br />
There is a file in your EverQuest directory that is named Datarate.txt. This file determines the size of the packets of information that you receive during gameplay. The default value in the file is 5.0, but we recommend that you try setting it at 7.0. This should speed up certain aspects of the game such as zoning times. If you are encountering severe packet loss at either of those settings then you may want to try setting it at a value lower then 5.0. If you are using a standard dial up modem, do not set the value in that file higher then 5.0.<br />

I think GoD brought back a lot of ppl.  They need to open up 3-4 more servers instead of just one, and offer server splits.</div></div><hr />

I used to 2 box on dial up.. the difference with 9 vs 4 or 5 data rate was huge.  On cable with 5 things seem 'compressed' like your computer is always waiting on data.</div></div><hr />

datarate has absolutly nothing to do with zoning. It fixes a special type of lag you can get in crowded areas like raids, at least thats what it did for me 2 years ago.</div></div><hr />

For the past 3 days, on and off zone and servers have been lagging, causing 30 second /who and /tell times, 5+ minute zone times, ect. This hasn't been occuring on all servers, which probably is why all the snide remarks, some morons think this is a localized problem.<br />

Certain servers have been almost unplayable for the past 3 days. Please drive through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess it's a lag issue rather than something particularly wrong with zoning itself, and probably not a 'bug' as such, it's just the expansion motivated more people to log on, which caused more crowding, which caused more lag.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing it has something to do with fact that I have maybe a total of 15 items on my twinks instead of 8 bags*10 items + 16 bank slots with bags*10 items each.

Looks to me like he wants to be a warrior that also has a full paladin spellbook, so I'd have to say the answer to that question is &quot;yes he does&quot;.</div></div><hr />
