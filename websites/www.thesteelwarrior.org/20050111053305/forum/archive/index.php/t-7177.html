I'm not complaining, never have, never will. My bro is a 65 warrior, i'm a 65 SK. I think SKs are perfectly balanced they way they are. If i wanted to tank as well as a warrior, i would BE a warrior. I'm an sk because i like the versatility of the class. I can buff, debuff, heal, manatap, etc, and offtank most things, not all, but most =oP<br />

and come on i dont care who you are, that is funny =oP</div></div><hr />

Its the impact of seeing an SK post that about Paladin's, at this time when the whining is mostly coming from SK.org.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh contrary to what we believe, all sks are not complete and utterly moronic idiots that want to unbalance the game by requesting something that they don't need (defensive) rather than something that would actually make them more desireable (more dps).<br />
<br />
There's at least two I know anyway... so mebbe Khuan is coo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aielman</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh...well I thought it was funny...no matter who posted it. <br />
<br />
And for the record, pally and sk should both have more melee damage....why the hell not? Give them the same offensive skills warrior have for the same skills in common. No point in being lower in dps...as long as they can't tank as well.<br />

<br />
I disagree. Give em more dps and then they get get bent over any of this defensive nonsense. Their spells aren't landing much in GoD,w hich I assume will be worse in OoW, and their heal has become marginalized. <br />
<br />
Almost every warrior pays at least lip service to the idea that we're here to take damage, not give it...well let the knights do the same melee damage. Not going to put a hurting on warriors as long as we maintain a CLEAR advantage in tanking.<br />
<br />
peace,<br />

So i'm not really sure i agree on the whole added dps thing. I do think that they should actually fix theft of life AA, i have ToL 3 and my lifetaps hit for double MABYE once an hour, and since i tank alot in ele groups i fire that thing off damn near everytime it repops.</div></div><hr />

When was the last time any of you warriors picked up a paladin to heal for your group .. or even to secondary healer? .. Bueler .. anyone?<br />
Ok When was the last time you grouped one to crowd control for you?<br />
How about the last time you grouped a paladin to buff you?<br />
Well what about pulling?<br />
What about dps? <br />
I really wanna see the answers to these questions.</div></div><hr />

I nearly always have a paladin in my groups. If i dont have a paladin, I have an sk.</div></div><hr />

I might just be having a bad string but it's a significant enough number of players that makes me think that either they don't care to learn how to benifiet from what they have; or they are so bent out of shape that they dont have what they &quot;think&quot; they need that they refuse to focus on the good of what they do have.<br />
<br />
This isn't just paladins though I see this in most all classes.  Want to be a good player learn how to deal with what you have.  Stop letting the game play you and start playing the game.</div></div><hr />

Thats WHY there is a WARRIOR class, to tank! Thats why there is a CLERIC class, to heal! etc. dont like the fact you dont have a spell or skill of a different class, then go play the other class.</div></div><hr />

Last night. Thank you so much for asking!!!<br />
<br />
Because the Paladin in question could do all that (except we didn't expect him to pull but he can when in need) AND non-damage OT, regular OT, eat ramp, backup rezzer, backup tank.<br />
<br />
I guess the problem is that he is NOT retarded. Really this game isn NOT that hard. Yes the paladin class is a little harder to play than a warrior, but seriously it still isn't that hard, figure it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yeah, Paladins will never have a stand-down...unless things actually do get bad for Paladins and they are not wanted by the majority of EQ players in their EXP groups. This is how warriors were in PoP days pre-fix, and if you think that paladins suck now it's cuz you are not skilled in playing the class, or have been exposed only to such players.<br />
<br />
But Paladins are whining now anyway, so this phony epic pic makes sense. Yes, if the news of epics v2 came out months ago before warriors were fixed this should be the warrior epic, but it really is now, it isn't then, so build a bridge, and get over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladins make great  2nd healers, love the group heals to back up a cleric (especially using DivArb), give me my BSS. Pally offtank? Even better, good agro control and self heals, not to mention pulling when needed. Pally dps seems decent, considering they have a spellbook and all of the previously mentioned utility roles; however I don't have (or care to have, really) any hard numbers.<br />
<br />
Back on Topic: I laughed at the first post. Very amusing, thanks.</div></div><hr />

In the lower end game (which someone using a 39/32 weapon is at) spell dps means much more then melee dps to a knight but as melee damage increase drastically with better weapons hybrids spell dps doesn't manage to keep up.

A - I've read the SK and Pally class boards.  The vast majority of the posts there don't contribute anything to any community.  Most of the higher end Knights I know don't even bother going there anymore because nothing ever gets accomplished there.<br />
<br />
B - Khuan is 2 flags from Time.  I'd hardly call that the Low end of the game.  He has a bag full of excellent weapons, of which, 39/32 isn't even close to the best one.  Being semi-intelligent, Khuan is aware that different weapons are better in different situations and ratio isn't always the primary concern for a Tank class.</div></div><hr />

A. Most of the higher end SKILLED knights i know do post on their classboards because they care about their class most of the dont have a higher post count a war board.<br />
<br />
B. Any brain-dead monkey can hail flag mob it doesn't mean he understands his class. 39/32 was the number he threw out and is the weapon in his magelo atm, if he was bored and parsing his dps i would hope he was using his best weapon. But even then if he managed to go oom on a single fight casting BoH, festering and spear of decay would suggest to me he doesn't pay much attention to his hybrid side and has a small manapool. None the less im not equating gear with being skill and i didn't mean to incorporate that but him coming to this board and putting down his fellow knights just sickened me, not to mention this was an old joke done about what 6 months...</div></div><hr />
