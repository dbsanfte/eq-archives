Weaponry when we parced requires 2.8 million dmg in 15 minutes w/ 6 people.  If you use the correct weapons you get a bonus but it doesn't seem to offset the large amount of dmg required. <br />
<br />
I have a pretty solid group I hang around with taciv and inktu'ta weapons and we still failed and had to dump our back up healer, shaman and caster for 5 melee and 1 cleric to complete this one.<br />
<br />
What have your experiances been with this trial?  Has anyone been able to finish it with less than 4 or 5 melee?  It's possible it's tuned for upgrades we will see in oow,  we found a 24/20 weapon and some other things off simple 1 group stuff in oow so maybe raid items will be a signifcant dps boost for melee.</div></div><hr />

Wow great, another set of trials requiring a totally set group in order to have any success...  Wow, that's pretty retarded.  Thanks for the great information Brutall though.<br />

Out of curiosity, do pets wielding 'blunt' 'slashing' weapons and such get bonuses?</div></div><hr />

 First it was whining about how tanks / melee couldn't get this and that in GoD because they only needed one tank for a trial blah blah, now that they give melee a chance to do something with the &quot;useless&quot; skills, bitch about it? Bravo! :confused:</div></div><hr />

Your an idiot, since when does a forced group of 5 melee and 1 cleric constitute a good thing?</div></div><hr />

Brutall, i noticed there are a lot of weapon drops from the mini-named in RS.  not the best weapons in the world, but decent weapons, 16 19 1hb, 48 32 2hs type stuff, no drop weapons.  they aren't too hard to farm either for a well equipped qvic+ group of 70's - especially if you have new spells - and a decent selection of modest ratioed weapons can really help on that trial.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, what good is a 16/19 for a group of Qvic people though?<br />
<br />
Unless perhaps what you mean is that most Qvic grouped people don't have all the required weapon types?</div></div><hr />

bingo.  not necessarily everyone has a 1hb, 2hb, 1hs, 2hs, and piercing weapon with strong ratios.  I know if i needed a piercing weapon, the old willsapper would be coming out &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

Frax, if they are 'only' requried for progression, and do not drop any interim nice rewards (ala Glyphed Prayer Rings) and only one is required per guild I agree with you.<br />
<br />
If on the other hand they drop excellent farmable loot, or are required for progression this is a joke that needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

Today we had the Hulking Bazu first (needed slashers), we had a group of monk, ranger, warrior(me), cleric, shaman, mage.<br />
<br />
I used 1hs'ers bloodfrenzy/jos for awhile, then swapped to plankton... was hitting for 7k with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 2nd mob (Steelshock I think the name is) for some reason didn't have any immunities (or atleast none that we figured out) it wasn't hand to hand, not piercing, not 2hand piercing, not hand to hand, not 1hb, 2hb, 1hs, 2hs...Sooo we just beat the shit out of it as the timer ticked down, had 3minutes left after he died and couldn't get to the dragorn. But this seems really bugged imo, the first time we did the trial I used ifir / wicked shank and Steelshock was goin down fast as hell, since then its seemed like he's had/has no weaknesses.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I've only tried it once but I could have sworn Steelshock was the guy we got first and blunt was his weakness.  I was averaging over 700 DPS with Cranial Bludgeoner.  Unfortunately the next mob we got was piercing weakness and only the shaman had a piercer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty sure the order changes every time in this trial, the order of the mobs you get and the order of weapons you need to use on each mob change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Steelshock for us the other day had no weaknesses and was mitigating the hell out of melee.  I went through my entire range of weapons (1HB, 2HB, 1HS, 2HS, Piericing) and nothing changed... I would score critical hits and you see what the hit would have been, but he was only taking 30% or so of the damage.  Hes also immune to archery and throwing.  The only thing he didn't mitigate were my kicks, which sadly, as a ranger, caps at about 60 damage non-crit.<br />
<br />
I thought maybe this was the &quot;caster&quot; weak mob, but my Fire and Cold nukes, while hitting easily, weren't gaining any bonuses like melee does on the weak ones.  Shaman and ENchanter were using their nukes, covering the other resists.<br />
<br />
Steelshock just takes forever to kill and eats a large chunk of your time.  Hopefully we will have better succcess tonight with some new weapons to replace our weaker ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me repharse.<br />
<br />
I am totally OK with some content that favours some classes over others, that's balance.<br />
<br />
What is NOT balance, is having some content that is so skewed, that it is absolutely not winnable if you have certain classes in your group.<br />
<br />
I am fine with not being the best DPS, but I feel that no content should be skewed in such a way that certain classes are precluded slots out of necessity.<br />
<br />
Does that make sense?</div></div><hr />

That's fucked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did another Weaponry last night as well....<br />
<br />
Steekshock = 3:03 minutes of fighting to kill<br />
Hemkai = 6:00 minutes of fighting to kill<br />
Granite Guardian = 5:17 minutes when we ran out of time, he was at 4%<br />
<br />
Group was Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, Enchanter, Druid and Cleric.... quick question... do you have to kill all 4 in the 15 minutes? or just 3?  We found some adjustments we can make to easily kill 3 in 15 minutes, but 4 will be outside the reach of that group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">have to kill all 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then unless there are some rally dramatic changes in weapons available in OoW, the event in my opinion needs to be tuned by cutting the HP of the 3 that are weak to specific melee types down to 70-80% of their current levels.  Otherwise, its going to be impossible for some classe to participate and have a hope of winning.<br />
<br />
I figure it would have taken us 5:30 minutes to finish off the Granite Guardian, and for the 5:17 minutes we did get on him, I did 1020 DPS (984 of it was crush damage only) using Demerix and Timeweaver.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stehle</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to note, Pets (MAG / BST) do not suffer the same limitations that PCs do when it comes to weapon type.  So if a mob requires blunt weapons to hit, a pet with piercing will still damage it normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sythrak</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys have the weaknesses of the mobs wrong:<br />
<br />
Dragorn - weak to pierce.<br />
Golem - weak to blunt.<br />
Bazu - weak to slash.<br />
Steelshock - weak to uh nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Edit: And on a side note, the trials are still broken as of the latest patch.   You will still lose your Trial win and the resistance bonus gained if you train a new AA after a win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the mobs have so much HP that if you don't have the right weapon they might as well be immune to other damages just because they've so much HPs?<br />
<br />
Would a pet using the right weapon types get elevated damage?  That'd actually put a pet's DPS to be about the same as anyone who can't use all 3 types of primary weapon damage.</div></div><hr />

Did this with me + 2 rangers + 1 rogue + wizard + cleric. Rangers slowed the mobs with their earthcallers and then switched to DPS, and we botted a shaman for champion(group FA+10% increased damage mod) outside the trial. We won it with 1 min to spare.<br />

Pre NERF DD was a lot easier with cleric/cleric/warrior, though it was doable with cleric + a supremely aa'd other healer, if the warrior was seriously geared up and you got lucky on crit heals/damage.<br />

I don't mind hard content.  I think that's great.  What pisses me off is content where you are forced into a certain very restrictive group make up.</div></div><hr />

Just confirming that, it's true. At last count this trial had only been beaten a handful of times, while the others were being beaten regularly. The devs are aware of that disparity, and it may be changed or it may not -- but it's being looked into.</div></div><hr />

Regardless of what group you have their is a trial for you.  <br />
<br />
No slower&gt;&gt;ingenuity, <br />
No CC heavy melee&gt;&gt;weaponry,  <br />
Necro and no cc  &gt;&gt; fear <br />
ect ect   their is even one you can do without a priest<br />
<br />
It is a hell of a nice job, I'm not sure if this was intended or not but if you have somone in your group who knows what they are doing they can find a beatable trial for nearly any group.<br />
<br />

I have no idea what weapons everyone was using for each but I know each of us had at least one set that was not all that hot...for example I was using two Velium Gemmed Daggers for the piercing mob, although most of us did have Time/Qvic or above for the other weapons.  The only outside buff we had was a DS from a level 66 Druid, and the cleric/enchanter both had 9/sym instead of Conv.  As stated in the last post the DoT damage from the bard is not shown.<br />

<br />
The weapons I took in:<br />
1hp - Fatestealer (22+1+1/20 [uqua aug]) with 150dd cold + Jagged Timeforged Blade (21/19 )<br />
1hb - Demerix (32/36) with 150dd poison + Hammer of the Timeweaver (26/24)<br />
1hs - Acrylia Handled Broadsword (16/19) + Sludge-Covered Short Sword  (14/19)<br />
<br />
I've got around 1000aa, ~70 accuracy, etc. Other rogues all with similar combos of weapons and similar gear. Warrior with good combos of each weapon type and good gear. Cleric and wizard also. Guild group. We knew exactly what to expect after having done it a few times each previously. All rogues swapped in/out their piercer to slip in quick free backstabs every time it refreshed vs. bazu and golem.<br />
<br />
I know we [i]could shuffle the group a tiny bit, but seriously... after seeing this group come up short on DPS it was very clear to me that this trial needs to be toned down just a tad.</div></div><hr />

We had an enchanter bot outside for mana regen and haste, but that's it for buff bots. Clairvoyance on CLR/WIZ, Shissar on CLR, Salik on everyone else. We also bummed Ranger and Shaman buffs on the way to the trial. <br />
<br />
My point is, what we had should've been (more than) sufficient.  Having to handpick a group for this and exclude certain classes from having any chance to succeed unless they're a lucky &quot;6th man&quot; is not my idea of good design.</div></div><hr />

Yah, cause overpowering slow would be almost as ludicrous as designing a trial in which wars or even bards can outdamage a wizard.</div></div><hr />

How are your rangers getting 150+ dps on steelshock?  Our rangers are parsing at 85-90dps with pretty much every nuke up.  Do all your rangers have ED or something?  Trying to figure out why we're parsing so low here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdraith</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your rangers load 4 nukes and chain nuke on refresh, they should be doing about 110-120 DPS assuming they have Time level focuses (+40% max up to level 65, which would average +20% on Brushfire, Ancient nuke, Frozen Wind, Frost Wind, +15% on Hearth Embers, or +10% on the level 70 Ancient nuke).<br />
<br />
Assuming focuses fire on average as I stated above, nukes are cast as soon as they refresh, and there are NO crit nukes (unrealistic of course), ranger nuke DPS with Ancient 65 nuke, Hearth Embers, Frozen Wind, and Brushfire (my combo so this is the one I calculated) should average 118 DPS.<br />
<br />
Assume a 2 proc per minute rate with some decent combat effects gear (I have +20 or so) and only two DD procs of 150 and 125, that adds an additional 10 DPS, Cry of Thunder proc can add another 6 DPS or so, for a total nuke + proc DPS from a ranger of 134 DPS.  If rangers have access to better nukes and focuses than me and to higher proccing weapons, DPS would be even higher.  Also, if rangers have Locust Swarm (~145/tick dot with no focuses), that might add another 24 DPS (I have it but forgot to mem it!), bringing the spell + proc total to 158 DPS.  Add some from damage shields and melee, some crit nukes, and better focuses/spells than I have and you can get higher.<br />
<br />
We won this last night with:  WAR, WAR, RNG, RNG, ROG, SHM.  Had 20 seconds to spare.  This is with the rogue forgetting to swap in his piercer for backstab during slash and blunt mobs, with me using slashing weapons for the first 12% of the blunt mob (doh!), and some of the weapons being not that great (plus my blunt skill at 240 and my pierce at 250....shame on me!).  Gear overall was good, GoD, Qvic, Txevu gear mostly (all max worn attack, 4 of the melees with Primal Guard clickies, +accuracy going from +10 to +40, rogue with Cleave 3, maybe a few more things!).<br />
<br />
Weapons were:<br />
<br />
WAR:  DBotW and Epic 1.5, 2hp (no idea which one!), JOS and 26/28 (earth hammer)<br />
WAR:  DBotW and Epic 1.5, Narandi's Lance, JOS and 15/19 (Innovator's Hammer)<br />
RNG:  Darkglint and Timespinner, 2hp 39/44,  26/28 (earth hammer) and 16/20 (velium gemmed)<br />
RNG:  Darkglint and Timespinner, 15/19 and 15/21, 13/18 and 15 (+1 magic)/20<br />
ROG:  14/18 +16/20, Epic 1.5 (with +1 damaga aug) and JTB, JOS + 19(+1 magic)/21<br />
<br />
Champion and Spirit of Might from the shaman were invaluable as were the 5 dots he loaded on the spell mob, and we did have outside buffs from an enchanter.<br />

<br />
Actually, in that list, only Ranger2 was supposed to be tanking Steekshock, but because I was essentially mana dumping on the mob and he was getting stunned a bit, I ended up tanking about 15% of the time.  But then, Steelshock is so weak, and he and I have roughly the same stats, I wasn't over concerned about keeping or losing aggro, as long as the rogue had access to his back.<br />
<br />
As for the DPS on Steelshock, what your rangers probably aren't considering is that just about every nuke they have, and some of the DOTs , will all produce much higher DPS than anything their melee could hope to accomplish.<br />
<br />
For Steelshock, I load Ancient Burning Chaos, Hearth Embers, Frost Wind, Brushfire, Firestrike, Locus Swarm and Fire Swarm.  The last two slots are my heal and TW iin case I need to pull aggro.<br />
<br />
I scored the 189 DPS from that quoted number...<br />
<br />
Using a WorldWalker Staff (69/28 with a +4 Fire damage aug) and the nukes above:<br />
<br />
Crush = 43.54 DPS (9.622 total)  this weapon usually produces about 300 DPS<br />
Kick = 4.96 DPS (1,087 total)<br />
Locus Swarm = 25.31 (5,061 total)<br />
Fire Swarm = 5.84 DPS (1,204 total)<br />
Nukes and procs = 113.52 DPS (25,316 total)<br />
<br />
There is no reason why your rangers shouldnt be mana dumping on Steelshock either.  Just load it all and go, because unless they completely lack a type of weapon, nuking on the remaining mobs is pointless as their resists are higher, and  nothing we have for nukes can touch the 900-1400 DPS a ranger should be putting out in melee with the right weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta guess the rangers are tanking in order to take advantage of their self-only ds's, hence the higher dps&quot;<br />
<br />
Rangers were tanking because it was what we had available to put the group together.  We were going to try and do a 4 ranger + bard + shaman group for fun, but one of the rangers had to camp, so we picked up the rogue.<br />
<br />
However, I did this trial again the other day and even though we had a warrior, because we also had 2 casters (mage and wizard), it was decided I should tank Steelshock because of my aggro lock so the 2 casters could go full burn the entire time.  The group was a Rng, Rng, War, Shm, Wiz, Mag and we were concerned about the lack of melee DPS.  We did end up winning with 2 seconds to spare (actually got the win message, got the loot mob, then got a fail message)<br />
<br />
For that run, I was doing 213.31 DPS on Steelshock thanks to my damage shield (other number were close from previous trip, but my non-melee damage was up to 155 because of the DS damage).</div></div><hr />

Had every single buff known to EQ. Literally. We had shaman buffs full new. Had to use SOH from ranger for more DPS instead of BBB. Had fresh chanter haste/speed as well as a shadowknight visage right as we zoned in. Brought a druid outside with us to buff us with Lions strength and steeloak and DS. right as I zoned in, The beastlord had Ferocity'd the rogues, and ranger. Right as I zoned, I had the druid pop SOTG on me and WOTW. Ran in, started automatically, fought first mob unslowed with SOTW on. *EDIT* As well as that, since it apparently wasnt enough, we all had gone to hometowns and bought all DMG enhancing Tribute like Arm of Power and all that.<br />
<br />
All that...granted the weaponry wasnt tacvi grade for the most part...its my opinion this is way too highgrade. My group is the only one to do it on ECI and that's not to brag. I think it's SAD. And upon that, we've won with UNDER 5 seconds EACH time. Literally. I've timed it from the 30 second warning and our mobs at 8-9% and we barely squeeze through. That's my info to give out I hope it helps. Anyone know if this trial will be nerfed anytime soon? The stuff that drops is $$ and I want to farm it, just too settled on group can't swap in and out. Had a cloak rot already. Only 1 priest. Heh ah well.<br />

Well first of all, gratz on winning.<br />
<br />
However almost all the weaponry you listed is time level at best, and there is alot(too much) &quot;velium gemmed&quot; amongst it to expect to cruise through this trial. So in conclusion, you won (barely), with gear 2 expansions old, and alot of bazaar bought weaponry. You know I hate to say it, but that sounds like its working as intended to me.<br />
<br />
All they need to do with this trial is fix or do something for the classes that basically cant get groups there/hold their own there because of their lack or limited ability to use slashers/piercers(like Monks).<br />
<br />
The rest of it seems difficulty-wise fine to me. There is nothing wrong with having one trial that you at least can feel somewhat proud of being able to beat, and isnt easily farmable.</div></div><hr />

Its nearly the same thing if they mod nukes by factor 4 and quadrubel the HP. I think they havn't done this to prevent aggro problems and keep him &quot;tankable&quot;.

I see nothing wrong with the difficulty of this trial if not for the fact that casters are very marginilized.  I'd like to see the 'bane' only mobs be extremly difficult to a particular type of damage being fire/cold/magic/poison/disease or what not, or have pets enjoy the damage multiplier.<br />
<br />
This trial is not 'difficult' by any means, but it is extremly annoying in terms of assembling a group for it, pretty much exactly what wrong with Ikkinz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I think for piercing everyone was using velium gemmed  or worst, except ranger who had a DoD from time.<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head, here were the weapons used:<br />
<br />
Warrior 1 (Pinaduz, best geared war on server)<br />
- Slashing, DBotW / Agnar 1h<br />
- Blunt, Rime Encrusted Pikestaff<br />
- Piercing, Pyrelin Triden/Velium Gemmed<br />
<br />
Warrior 2 (Warrie)<br />
- Slashing Epic/Blood Frenzy<br />
- Blunt Rime Encrusted Pikestaff<br />
- Piercing, Velium Gemmed *2<br />
<br />
Ranger 2 (Darkfyre)<br />
- Slashing Darkglint, Timespinner<br />
- Blunt Quarm hammer, Earth A hammer (26/28 thingie)<br />
- Piercing DoD/Velium Gemmed<br />
<br />
Ranger 2 (Iegan)<br />
- Slashing Hulcror Whip/Forget (he just got darkglint, but didn't have it at the time)<br />
- Blunt (not sure)<br />
- Piercing 2* velium Gemmed<br />
<br />
Shaman and me are both very well geared, with clickie mana regen.<br />
<br />
Warrie riposte tanked slashing mob with plankton, and Pinaduz riposted blunt mob with a dathor great hammer I think.<br />
<br />
Was very close, with 5 meleees + gulu it would have been a joke.  The issue is not in trial difficulty but in that some classes are utterly worthless, I was 'dragged' through group.<br />
<br />
Shaman (Gulu) did not have champion at the time, just FA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To respond to Mearis, actually I think I riposted piercing mob, then followed with aggressive, since we had no rogue in group.  With rogue I riposted bashing mob using Vanazir or Rime Encrusted staff.  <br />
<br />
For piercing we are using mostly velium gemmed daggers.  Where we have really made up time is on Spellshock (druid and shaman nuking and dotting, rangers nuking, others using proccing weapons).  <br />
<br />
We really don't have the best selection of weapons, but our margin of victory is generally between 1-2 mins now.  Several recent weapons upgrades should increase that.<br />

Had just rescently beaten this for the first time a couple days before the patch. Went with a group me (shaman) warrior rogue ranger bard mage. Had descent but not great selections of weapons for everyone. Everything was fully slowable and pretty much a joke to heal with the tank we had. Won with a bit less than a minute to spare. Went back and did it last night  and everything was partially slowable and much harder to heal. We finished with almost 3 minutes left tho. Group was almost identical between the 2 runs. Everyone but the warriors was the same and the 2 warriors where very close. Both used the same 2hb blunt and pair of 1hd slashing weapons. Simular ac/hps/avoidance etc on them too. Peircing one warrior used a trident from rifts and a dagger of distraction from Time while the other used some 2hded piercing from MPG i beleive.<br />
<br />
Didnt have parses for anything but definitely made it harder for a shaman to heal and I'm pretty sure they mobs have a bit less hps. Still need good dps but more room on that while healing is tougher.</div></div><hr />

the spell mob has far less hps so should be easy for one or two nukers.<br />

I am wondering if say using a 2 1hb's vs using a 2hb of the same normal dps, if there would be a diff from the bonus, I use a 41 dmg 24 dly 2hb most of the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
with my 2hb 41/24 I get about 230 dps<br />
I have a 1hb 19/19 and a 1hs 16/18 runs about 180 dps<br />
So if i used a velium id get a little less normal dps from using 2 1hb's<br />
But would i get more bonus dps on the mobs, for swinging 2 weapons?</div></div><hr />

I have to say that the mobs seemed to put out a fair bit more dps than I expected.  It really didn't seem shaman would be able to keep up very well.<br />
<br />
As for 2hb vs 1hb....it doesn't matter, you want to use whatever has the highest of pure melee + crit dps.  You can notice that your hits are all amplified by 4 pretty easily:<br />
<br />
You score a critical hit!(100)<br />
You hit xxx for 400 points of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are they ever gonna make up their mind on this trial?  Haha...<br />
<br />
I had three tries on this trial last night, everyone being Time geared (somewhat) cept for my cleric, which I botted.  Botted clerics don't get the same kind of loot, so she wasn't as strong as, say, a regular main, but she was sufficient otherwise.<br />
<br />
The dps coming out from these mobs are a wee bit heavy imho.  I'm a 2500ac Warrior with 14% shielding and I was taking:<br />
<br />
Steelshock - 357dps (Stonewall)<br />
Hemkai - 430dps<br />
Stoneguardian - 372dps<br />
Bazu - 232dps<br />
<br />
The Bazu numbers are a bit off cause the ranger tanked in WS while I went to the back of the mob and disced.  The thing is, I'm under the impression that these trials are supposed to be somewhat of a way for the none raider types to have a little fun at and gear themselves up with.  Unless your group members are all sporting elemental/time ratio weaponry in ALL weapon types, it's going to be extremely difficult in beating this particular trial.  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong though.  I'm fine with the weapon part.  I just think the dps of the mobs needs to be about cut in half to give the non-raiding tanks a remote chance at tanking this trial.  Even I had a few close calls with near-chaining Complete Heal.  Currently, the mobs are doing a bit more than your standard Riftseeker's mob dps.  Yeah, how many non-raiding warriors tank in Riftseeker's?  My thoughts exactly...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Numbers from when we did trial a few nights ago<br />
<br />
I tanked the entire time, didn't bother with defensive / stonewall on any of the mobs. <br />
<br />
Steelshock - 355dps <br />
Hemkai - 293 dps<br />
Stoneguardian - 298 dps<br />
Bazu - 304 dps <br />
<br />
The mobs dps should be where it is at for the caliber loot it drops.  Cmon, 1 group trials dropping 200+ hp loot that exceeds p4 of time style loot.. It's not meant to be a total walk in the park. These trials aren't meant for your non raiding bazaar warrior to come in, kill some mobs that are putting out 100dps and collect 200hp loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just have to comment a little more on this trial.  When I tried it three times in a row, our group layout consisted of:<br />
<br />
Warrior, Ranger, Monk, Rogue, Wizard, Cleric<br />
<br />
This is a pretty well balanced group that encompasses pretty much every play style.  We had at least two proficient classes for each mob type.  In its current state though, Warriors and Rangers are probably your best classes for this trial simply because they can proficiently use all three weapon types:  Slashing, Piercing, and Blunt.  Backstabbing does NOT count as piercing damage in this trial's current form.  On the piercing mob, myself and the ranger stayed right up with the rogue, and he even used two discs.  <br />
<br />
Weapon Layout - <br />
<br />
Steelshock 170k hp (Magic):  Wizard dps + Monk H2H + Ranger nukes + Rogue backstab.  Steelshock isn't weak against H2H, but he doesn't mitigate it either.  He also doesn't mitigate Backstab damage as well.  The monk used a Shinai + Xegony Wraps against Steelshock.<br />
<br />
Bazu 720k hp (Slashing):  Warrior used BBoTE + Epic 1.5.  Ranger used Darkglint + Epic 1.5.  Rogue used the PoAir Sword (14+4/18) and a Velium Gemmed.  Wizard and Monk were kinda sol.  =P<br />
<br />
Stoneguardian 720k hp (Blunt).  Warrior used JoS+13+3/22 bazzar weapon, can't remember the name.  Ranger used Rotting Fist + Velium Gemmed.  Monk used REBB.  Rogue used a Hammer of the Timeweaver + Velium Gemmed I believe.  Wizard kinda SoL.  =P<br />
<br />
Hemkai 720k hp (Piercing):  Warrior used DoD + Velium Gemmed.  Ranger used DoD + Pyrilen Trident thingy.  Rogue used Epic 1.5 + DoD.  Monk and Wizzy SoL here.<br />
<br />
I don't think our weapon setup was too entirely weak here and we still lost by about a minute and a half.  We could definitely up the ante on a couple weapon improvements, but this setup is already way better than what a non-raider can muster.<br />
<br />
If I were to suggest anything, I would do the following:<br />
<br />
1)  As mentioned above, cut the dps of the mobs by about half, and do this by reducing their innate delay.  Keeping a 13khp/2500ac tank alive for 15 minutes should not be a problem here.  While my cleric isn't a main, she's not exactly gimp either.  She has FT20 and over 7k mana buffed as well as almost 300 AAs.  Using Yaulp, Clairvoyance, Spiritual Ascendance, and Zealot as her mana regen, I found that even she was stressed for mana (1m left...) by the time the final mob came around.  That's doable for me, but it's not necessarily doable for the average Joe (Ie, the majority of your player base) who's not as well equipped as I am.<br />
<br />
2)  Hemkai needs to be weak against backstabs, because the only way you can backstab is with a [freakin'] piercer.  C'mon, this is common sense.  =P<br />
<br />
3)  Any way to implement archery as a functional weapon type?  While the game registers it as non-melee, it's technically a form of piercing.  This could be quite handy for Hemkai due to the fact that piercing ratios are always an expansion or two behind the best 1hs/1hb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cleric, Monk, Berserker, Bard, Wizardbot and myself.<br />
<br />
We wern't by any means properly prepared for this either. Except the Berserker, he's got the top 3 2h the class can get (Ture Spear, Keldoven Hammer, Bonecleaver). Myself, I made no effort to swap weapon combos other than 2hBlunt for the Golem (Stuck with DB / Epic). As well the monk simply used King Shinai and Painsipper the entire time. We beat it with a little under 3 minutes to spare.</div></div><hr />

Cmon, 1 group trials dropping 200+ hp loot that exceeds p4 of time style loot.. It's not meant to be a total walk in the park. These trials aren't meant for your non raiding bazaar warrior to come in, kill some mobs that are putting out 100dps and collect 200hp loot. <br />
<br />
I agree with you, and six months ago I'd be vehemently right behind you.  But, with a shitton of the casual playerbase waltzing off the playscene these days, I'm a little more hesistant to say &quot;Fuck the little guy&quot; if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Single group content should be doable by both the casual and the raider.  GoD was full of this &quot;single group content for the raider only&quot; and guess how well that turned out?  My thoughts exactly...</div></div><hr />

Honestly given the current situtation with this trial that isn't a very good group. Wizard is mostly worthless on anything but steelshock. A mage does much better on the other mobs with pet and DS for dps and does well enough on steelshock.<br />
<br />
Monk is also pretty weak since there are 2 mobs where he's mitigated. If H2H isn't mitigated on steel shock thats pretty handy but you already had that handled pretty well with the wizard.<br />
<br />
Personally the groups i've done have been warrior, ranger, rogue, mage, bard and shaman. If you want to go with less than optimal groups where 2 or 3 people are weak on 2 or 3 mobs you'll need to make it somewhere. Change group around a little and you can probably win it easily.<br />
<br />
Kinda sucks but you either need the right group or really good weapons to beat this trial.</div></div><hr />

Casual players can do it.  It's just harder and they're too afraid to try.<br />
<br />
By definition everything for casual should be harder.  A lot harder, because they're not nearly as powerful.  Believe it or not some of this stuff is actually still pretty hard even for a raider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason you were struggling for mana in that group was because you had no slower.  Add a slow capable class and the slowing becomes trivial.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, wizard is probably the worst class you can bring into that group bar none.<br />
<br />
They mostly need to fix mobs so diferent mobs are susceptible to different types of spells in various amounts, and monks have a raison d'etre.<br />
<br />
I am not quite sure, people are very willing to recognize that wizards are utter shit in those trials, but are ready to accept that because 'not all classes can be equally useful' -  well shit, that's like stealing a kid's candy and telling him life is not fair, deal with it.<br />
<br />
Hard is good.  Requring excellent play and making good gear help a lot is excellent.  Requiring retarded class make ups and having entire classes be absolutely useless is not OK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tipt/Vxed horror stories, for some reason, come across my mind.<br />
<br />
The mobs were slowed.  The ranger had an Earthcaller.  I had the slow club handy.  They were getting slowed, and they all mitigate slow now.  I also gave my tash stick to the rogue and told him to get to work.  <br />
<br />
And yeah, I can agree with you on the wizzy part.  A mage pet could be very handy here.</div></div><hr />

That's not true Phantron;  fear has nothing to do with it.  It's the fact that ya know you're gonna get creamed and spend the rest of the night on a hellacious CR.  A pick up group MPG trial../laugh...but props for anyone who does em.<br />
<br />
And while I agree that basing winnability on gear is *good* to a certain extent; I also think that requiring a 14kish tank for Subversion to even have a chance at winning....<br />
<br />
Removing DS from Ingenuity---a HERETOFORE UNRESISTABLE FORM of DAMAGE--b/c mages are using a spell they were given (a LURE style spell so magician can damage mobs w. high MR...)  And LO and behold ingenuity was used to beat the trial in an alternate format.<br />
<br />
No that's just wrong.  OMG peeps are using a spell they were given correctly; and are winning the trial but not according to my plan!! Easy Fix....Nerf the one form of unresistable damage that has been in the game since the beginning.</div></div><hr />

odly enough i set out to efficiency with a guild grp to get the blunt  just for this particular trial and thankfully it dropped, went and auged and  went back and did the trial all went well finished with 4 minutes to spare shamy healed on all but the caster mob  in wich case the paly healed me overall worked out quite nicely even with my crappy piercers<br />
<br />
<br />
i used the pikestaff on the magic mob figuring that that had the most castable procs not sure if it made any difference but it made me feel better =)<br />
<br />
just did this trial again despite 1 death was still a win <br />
