<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We'll see if Brutul can figure out how to make a poll :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You forgot: None of the above. Mmpogs piss the hell out of me!!!1!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">World of Warcraft is the only game listed on there I'm looking forward to.  I mainly play with my GF, so any MMORPG really needs to be a game she wants to play also (although with mostly high end guild people in the WoW beta, we're both concerned it'll turn into a RAIDING &gt; ALL game eventually just like EQ).<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I'm going to have fun with Baldur's Gate games (she's never played) and Icewind Dale (I've never played these) and other D&amp;D games.</div></div><hr />

Hello?<br />
<br />
Frog notes that WoW has most votes in poll.<br />
<br />
Frog asks if rmingnomers is planing to play alone?<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dear God.  Sorry for not following the masses.  Maybe I think WoW has nothing to offer me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am looking forward to VAnguard the most. Until then I think I will stick with EQ and if i get boored a little COH. Although the WoW fanboi's are rampant it is really the least attractive game to me on that poll.<br />
As far as Vanguard goes I really loved EQ when it first came out and hope that Brad and crew can capture that again</div></div><hr />
