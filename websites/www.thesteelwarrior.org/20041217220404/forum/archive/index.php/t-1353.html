<br />
I was wondering, is there a way for a lvl 40 warr to earn some decent money? (solo)<br />
My warr is my main and I got a little money problem :D<br />
<br />
Thx for the advise!</div></div><hr />

Gather 4 Ulthork Tusks at a time, get your porter to get you to Cobalt Scar, turn the tusks in and cross your fingers hoping for a blue diamond. You can get many different gems and other items. Sometimes you will get some research components worth only 2P or so, but most times you get high level gems or some kind of jewelry worth 120P a pop.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is Chief Kalan (I think that is his name)  Have the Druid invis and levitate you before you zone in, and levitate themself too. Then once you gate in, she just has to invis and then you both float down to the shore. Chief Kalan's hut is near the port in spot down on the beach.<br />
<br />
Do the Turn-ins, port out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another good way to make money at your level is killing highhold keep guards.....The guy camping bards/nobles usually will help you out a bit and they usually drop about 3 pp and a FS Short sword that sells for about 4.5 pp with my 2 opal stiens on<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW: Go you for rocking the trooper scale! That stuff is pimp!</div></div><hr />

Anybody knows if killing halfling guards is a good way to earn money?<br />
<br />
About the Trooper Scale; thx it looks cool as well :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with the halfing guards is that other npcs tend to aggro, and before you know it, you could have the asslings on parade behind you....Did you try the Paineel guards?</div></div><hr />

Avarage pp/hour?<br />

<br />
Gornit, the named HG in OOT, is a nice camp.  Eight minute spawn, you can pull other stuff while waiting for the next spawn.  It's so nice it tends to be perma-camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In paineel, I wouldn't really reccomend it. I died twice because of shitty adds (some level 60 SK decided he wanted to beat me down). With some better knowledge of the zone/guard locs I might have done better, but it was too risky for me. (this was a while ago /shrug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you want to raise plat while in a GROUP, best way ive found is heading to Crypt of Decay (level 55+), aka Ruins of Lxvansorm (something like that).  Head straight out from zone in, clear all the undeads till the church room and camp there.  I think by the time you come back to the entrance everyone in your group will have 3 gems in an hour or 2 depending on dps... items are are semi common drops from Elites, and some other named there.  Just dont fool with Carpyn if you see him as he lifetaps for 3500 and hits 1200, with 3 pets.  Careful of wanderers, respawn is fast, the SK mobs open up with 1k harmtouch so watch the casters as 2 of them can instantly tear one up.<br />
<br />
the gems seemed to have been only Blue Diamonds and Raw Diamonds :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard they nerfed paineel.  It used to be that killing the skelly guards inside the city would not lower your faction.  They are lvl 30ish, and drop a sword and shield each time.  Recently though they changed it so you lose faction, so you can only kill so many before you have to farm the warrens for faction again, which slows down your pp per hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anybody knows if killing halfling guards is a good way to earn money<br />
<br />
Not the best money but it sure is fun :)  I remember the day when the spears they drop(worth 10pp to vendor's) stacked. :)<br />
<br />
Personally I made my best money killing the highkeep guards.  There is a neutral vendor you can sell the FS swords too inside highkeep.   Even KoS if you are careful you can still use the bank in highkeep also.  Highkeep is easy to get too and with the vendor and bank there you don't have to go anywhere else :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;--- Made a bard, lvled him to 39 and now kites 1 HG in 2min = 15-45pp every 2min :D<br />
And you can kite HGs with a naked bard and a good drum :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forget trying to make straight PP from mobs. You will make a ton more money selling trade skill components in the baz. Go farm spiderling silks, spider silks, and pelts. Use the spiderling silks and pelts to make leather padding and use the spider silks to make silk swatches. On my server people pay around 25-40pp per silk swatch and 30-40pp per leather padding.<br />
<br />
Another good source of income is farming velium. If you can easily kill the orcs in Crystal Caverns, farm the velium they drop. I would recommend keeping the stackable pieces since you can get more in your bags, but the blocks sell pretty well too. Pieces go for 25-50pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luczifer</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One good farming place is Acrylia Caverns.<br />
Take healer friend with Ya and camp first cave near entrance.<br />
Acrylia blocks and bricks sold for 50 - 75 PP and they drop very often, also weapons from frimlings go for 140+ with my 2 opals.<br />
And when Ya lucky, Grimling Primalist spawns to drop mask for ya 12AC, 12 STR, 12 WIS, 12 INT which goes for 12 - 15K and ya swim in plat  :) Also zone is near and in bad situation ya can run and zone to save ya butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Werekin</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paineel guards do drop faction, but who cares if ya have your key, and as a Vah Shir, or halfling, or any other warrior race with sneak, you can still bank, sell, buy, etc there without a problem.   At 57 I kill every guard there, including the capt, hes light blue.  With druid buffs- DS, regen, and a sow, I can get 750-1k an hour if I push it hard, some spawns are 6 mins, some are 10 or more.  Only adds I get are if my life is too low, rest just tag with a bow and keel.  I try to stay out fo max kos, when i went that low I tended to get more adds.<br />
 <br />
Halfling guards same deal, sneak and sell to vendors.  Avg. 10pp per guard, quick respawn, and can regain the faction FAST by doing bandage quest.  You get good in neriak too, you get good neriak faction for killin guards in misty, and doing bandage quest gets you all your factions back in rivervale, without the neg faction to neriak.<br />
TOFS wedding floor is good cash, lotsa velium drops there, and some p00n newb gear that sells.  PP and FS-equivalant weapons, velium too i am pretty sure.  But need a lift out to bank/sell every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apoth</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just browsing through the forums, and I'm devastated that they nerfed paineel... I guess its day has finally come.<br />
<br />
I farmed that zone to hell and back for well over a year now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">speaking of farming tradeskill items for pp... i have not found a better way to make plat better than farming Superb and Flawless rockhopper hides (if you can, let me know pls ;p ).  sell easily 150-200pp EACH, thats about 4k per stack for superb... and flawless are like 300pp each (6k/stack).  The thing is you gotta keep the noobs from making the sambatas spawn, and make sure no one is camping caves.  <br />
<br />
You can roll and win on ornate molds in PoP and sell for 40-70k.  You have like 1/6 chance for all rolls.  Or you can get 4 stacks of flawless hides and sell them at 300pp each and get 24k (easy).  Clearing the caves solo yields me usually ~10 each of flawless and superb hides... and they also drop Twighlight Sea armor quest components, as well as Vex Thal shards...<br />
<br />
however i wouldnt sell the hides :( .   Im trying to get Grandmaster Tailor here and buying them from bazaar is not an option at the current inflated prices. Others will pay 6k for a Fleeting Quiver (Trivial ~205), and Velium Mastodon cloaks are like easy 10k for combine (Crown of Deceit quest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ships in dulak harbor has some nice gem drops, when i was there on the oceancrasher i did see peridots,star ruby's,diamonds and blue diamonds drop, sold the bd for 232pp to vendor in gunthak, the diamond sold for 185pp and star ruby for 60pp.<br />
<br />
A healer here would be nice though, the mobs where blue to my 48 cleric.</div></div><hr />

Went up into one of those buildings with legionnaires of the hand for lucid shards last week, stayed about an hour and a half with autosplit ON and walked out with 300-400 more than I came in with.  Was in a 3-person group, 65 monk, 65 sham, and me.</div></div><hr />
