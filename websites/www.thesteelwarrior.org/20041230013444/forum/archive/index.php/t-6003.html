Allegedly there is a first contact aggro bonus with incite which you don't get if u shoot arrows first.<br />
<br />
Anyone heard of this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There IS a first contact aggro bonus, but it has nothing to do with whether or not you use Incite, an arrow, your melee, prox aggro, Kick, Slam, Bash.. whatever. This is why you can hold aggro better when you are pulling, rather than tagging it from someone else.</div></div><hr />

On top of which, there were a number of posts saying that Incite was iffy at range (similar, iirc, to the SK hate spells).  I don't know if that's accurate or not, but acting accordingly has worked very well for me so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't say I've ever heard of that one.  Personally I never use incite to peel or pull, always just stick an arrow in them.  I experimented a little when incite first came out and it always seemed to me that the distance played a factor and aggro never seemed quite as solid as if I were actually engaged with the mob.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, sometimes you do miss with an arrow or it doesn't seem to snatch aggro quite like it usually does.  Noticed before when I have a bard pulling an arrow will peel aggro on to me, but as soon as the bard steps back into melee range the mob likes to take a few whacks at him.  With heavy hitters like we're seeing in GoD it may possibly be more reliable to go with incite as you're almost guaranteed to peel the mob every time rather than risk the puller's life on the chance an arrow doesn't work as intended.</div></div><hr />

You can also work with your pullers to make things a bit easier- like getting monks to use prox aggro instead of thrown damage to aggro the pull, having chanters use boggle instead of tash, or rangers use jolt instead of snare.  With those types of pulls, incite easily grabs aggro from the puller, even if they did aggro it first.<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to test if the order that dots (since incite is effectively a hate DD + dot) are applied in any way affects the mob aggro determination... i.e. because of the way MUDs work, there is a finite interval between mob aggro checks.  Depending on the sequencing and how the stack is implemented, earlier dots *could* have a disproportinate amount of &quot;net&quot; aggro associated with them...<br />
<br />
Or not.<br />

The only time I have trouble with it is when the damn folks slow on inc because they STILL don't understand how it works. :mad: <br />
<br />
 (These are the same people who break mez half a beat after you Incite as well and say 'I thought you attacked it'.):rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I found the thread I was thinking of (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4876) ... and there may well have been others, but this has posts all over it that ring bells for me on review.  Old thread, shortly after the Provoke line came out.  For all I know, it may have been accurate info then and be inaccurate now.<br />
<br />
As far as tagging with an arrow and hit v. miss ... Before I looted my Bloody Ancille's Pouch, I used to tag and pull with non-magical arrows (and so, I didn't hit much if anything) and never had any glaring issues peeling MOBs or pulling with them.  With the summoned Magic arrows, I am not noticing any improvement (except that I don't have to fletch anymore).<br />
<br />
But whatever is working for yer is what yer should be doing, I figger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even at point blank range Incite alone cannot move a mob.  That means if I incite a mob and then I'm not in melee range it'd smack someone else on the aggro list first even if they just have 1 point of aggro.<br />
<br />
This may be part of the reason why it feels Incite has less aggro.  It's hard to say if Incite works worse at range but there's more chance to lose aggro to proximity when you use it from range.  Say someone cast Malos on the mob and he's in front of you, then the mob would beat on the Malos user first because your aggro was not enough to move the mob to you.</div></div><hr />

I think that's the most understandable breakdown of range and Incite that I've read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly what Badaan said.<br />
<br />
Being first contact puts you on aggro list first, so immediately your not having to fight someone for it. <br />
<br />
I do not see incite having any more aggro that it does whether you pull with it or whether you use it aside from a pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tag with incite if short pulls, or in dunguens, long pulls I hit with a few arrows then incite at max range.<br />
<br />
Figure if it has a set immediate Agro amount, and a set DoT amount like stated on Lucy, the sooner I use, the more agro I will have when debuffs / slow is casted.<br />
<br />
In GoD sewers, rare for me to loose agro on tag.  Monks usually flop after tag, bards run right over me, and don't have much agro to begin with.  Only time I loose agro is from early slows, which is also rare thankfully.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is an  bonus on incite if used for initial agro, or a bonus for incite if used in agro range from experience, and what Lucy has stated.</div></div><hr />
