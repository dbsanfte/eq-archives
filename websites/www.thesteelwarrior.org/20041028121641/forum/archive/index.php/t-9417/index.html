<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I consider myself to be a casual warrior.  I usually buff up to around 8800-9200 with around 1600 AC, and that has worked fine for WoS and RCoD for the most part with one exception.... the elites.<br />
<br />
For those of you who have grouped in the northern part of WoS, and pretty much and part of RCoD and MPG you know what I'm talking about.  Any mob named &quot;An Elite Noc........ An Elite Kyv........ and An Elite Ukun.........&quot; hits for around 150-750 max, which isn't bad by itself, but when you add the fact that they mitigate slow and proc a 650-750 DD almost every round, it makes fighting them a real bitch.<br />
<br />
I guess besides a rant I'm wondering, am I the only warrior to get my ass kicked by these gems?  One full quadded round with some full-hits and semifull-hits, add in a couple procs, can take me down 30-40% of my life.  I find myself burning evasive every time it pops when these guys are pulled just to try and let the cleric breathe.<br />
<br />
Anyway, for those who are in the same boat, are you doing something that I'm not?  Maybe I'm missing some key concept to tanking these that others aren't.  Let me know if they are a bitch for you all too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes chaos claw proccers are pains in the ass wherever they are found....  the only defense against them is luck and a good healer, or  really high resists (its prismatic -150) so with a bard its pretty easily resistable.. with beastlord ferocity and other buffs depending on which is lowest its usually resistable.  just let your group know you need resists and get the required buffs, otherwise the mobs atomic damage spikes will be the death of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Aatma, I usually group with either Xinglong or Zyrtec and they can throw some good resist songs on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Chaos Claws is Chromatic -150.  You need around 400 resist on everything to resist it reliably.  <br />
<br />
The spell vie line works pretty well against them if your wiz/enc doesn't mind the peridot cost.  Spellshield (the mod) works great too but I doubt you've access to those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lv 70 and lightning reflexes 10 helps a lot.  Other than that not much more anyone can tell you.  Mobs with badass procs are a pain  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes...had the misfortune of running into those Nocs and dogs that proc alot.  I went from 30 percent to 0 in one round.  my cleric had no idea what happened.  They dont hit that hard, but damn...when they land 4 straight procs on you for 700 or so...it um, hurts...=p<br />

<br />
Ran with a 65war(me), 65cleric, 65 druid, 70mage, 70necro, 70 shaman and it was easy.  The backup heals of shaman just makes it trivial.<br />

65war(me) has 8aa<br />

We were doing Ruined City of Dranik and pulled many elite.</div></div><hr />
