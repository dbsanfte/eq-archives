<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Percevall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, in the last year I have read thousands of posts regarding the topic of balance between the tank classes and I've seen countless possible solutions put forth by both sides.  Yet always someone from the other camp is there to point out how each of those proposed solutions wouldn't &quot;balance&quot; things at all...just un-balance everything in the other direction (ie Paladin arguments against boosting warrior aggro).  Perhaps if there was some consensus on what warrior/ knight balance really meant then a solution that SoE might actual take note of could be developed.<br />
<br />
so...<br />
<br />
Without rehashing all the previously suggested fixes or nerfs, give me your ideas on how exactly knights and warriors could be balanced given the following:<br />
<br />
1) Currently, both knights and warriors are pretty much confined to competing for one slot in your average xp group...the tank.  <br />
<br />
2) Before anyone brings this up: Yes Virginia, Paladins do have more utility due to their spells, but this is very very rarely enough to land them a different spot in a group.<br />
<br />
3) In my mind, &quot;balance&quot; should NOT mean that one class or the other is the preferred choice in most situations.  If a group is looking for a tank and they see a Paladin and a Warrior LFG, then there should be equal pros and cons to choosing one over the other.<br />
<br />
4)  Comments should be specific to xp groups, not raids.<br />
<br />
5)  Again, this is just for general ideas on how you think the tanks would be balanced.  No suggested fixes/ nerfs please.<br />
<br />
Example:  <br />
<br />
I happen to belong to the camp that believes balance comes with knights being the kings of aggro (due to our spellbook) while warriors have a decided edge in ac/hp and dps.  Obviously alot of warriors disagree and I can certainly understand why.  Thats why I want to know how you think we should be balanced.<br />
<br />
*note*  I intentially ommitted Shadowknights because they have considerably more dps and utility than Warriors or Paladins and therefore can actually fill other roles besides tank.  Or they can just go solo.<br />
<br />
I am starting an identical thread at PoN.   I look forward to your flames and hopefully even some productive responses!<br />

Hell no!!!<br />
<br />
They have a full spell book... they asked for that spell book. They wanted the ability to heal themselves as well as solo decently...<br />

WHY should we be JUST as good as them when it comes to tanking?<br />

<br />
This is all well and good in theory. The problem is that warriors have a relatively small lead in in AC/HP and DPS, while knights have an enormous lead in aggro generation. All that AC and HPs is worthless if you can't keep the mob hitting you semi-reliably, or if your damage dealers have to hold back because they are limited by your ability to generate aggro. Sure knights on the whole tank a little bit worse than a warrior, but not nearly enough to justify the gap in aggro generation. Not even close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While I do not entirely disagree with Bunnie and Ninja(utility does not land you a group spot, but you cannot deny it is part of balancing), I will anwer your question strait up.<br />

<br />
<br />
I happen to belong to the camp that believes balance comes with knights being the kings of aggro (due to our spellbook) while warriors have a decided edge in ac/hp and dps <br />
<br />
This is not an entirely bad position statement.  I agree that knights should retain an edge in agro, but that it should be far smaller than it is.  Neither warriors or paladins are a DPS class, I don't feel that, with the limitations you give, it should even be considered tho.  I feel to balance, warrior agro + durability = knight agro + durability.  Obviously we are not there.  This is in fact a simplification, as the true formula for balance should be something along the lines of warrior agro + durability + DPS + utility = knight agro + durability + DPS + utility.  Balance has to include both raid and exp groups(as in, we should all have roles and be desirable for both, not strong raid role + weak exp role), solo and grouped.  In the long run, we should have access to exp at about the same rate.  How to get there is a subject that, as you mention, is being very much debated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With knight aggro the way it is currently, you would have to give warriors an absolutely ridiculous AC/HP/DPS advantage over knights to compensate.  If that was the only two things you were using to define balance anyway.  Getting rid of /disc defensive and putting warriors on a separate mitigation table that made them perma-defensive, while not dropping their dps any would probably be as close as they could come to balance based purely on tankability versus aggro ability.  And even then, the knight aggro advantage would probably negate any advantage warriors had, unless they retuned mob damage to compensate for it, which would be sort of a stealth nerf to knights, since even though they'd be staying the same, they'd be too frail to tank effectively.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Alternatively, they could nerf knight aggro so that it was only slightly better than warrior aggro, and leave warriors where they are now.  Then warriors would be slightly better at tanking, and knights would be slightly better at aggro generation.  This may indeed be the best choice, at least then it would force other classes to manage their aggro to some degree no matter who is tanking for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I  don't believe that knights were supposed to have this agro advantage they had when they were designed.  They have a TAUNT key for pete's sake.  I think something went very wrong between design and execution and all the changes they have made since 1999 haven't fixed it.  Knights were supposed to rely on mostly a TAUNT key to get agro, just like warriors.<br />
<br />
Low mana low level spells makes it all different.<br />
<br />
If they made it so you couldn't use those low mana spells once you were all grown up, maybe that would help.  I dunno.  Just spewing.</div></div><hr />

/sigh....about what I expected <br />
<br />
I seek a constructive discussion on what tank balance is and this is what I get?  I can only hope your peers in the warrior community are more capable than you when it comes to actually developing a solution to this problem and not just sitting in the corner crying about it.   By all means though, post again if you can think of anything that would help make this a productive discussion.  The whole point of this thread is for people to post their vision of balanced classes.  <br />
<br />
For those of you who feel Warriors SHOULD be the king tank....<br />
<br />
If Warrior aggro was improved to where the current knight advantage was gone, how would you change Paladins to enable them to be competitive for the tank job or just desireable for one of those other five spots in the group?  More dps?  More self buff spells to allow us to fully close the ac/hp gap (Paladin + Paladin spellbook = Warrior in terms of tanking perhaps?)<br />
<br />
If we could ever figure out what balanced was, then coming up with recommendations for what changes should be made to get there would be easy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is how it was meant to be:<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadowknights get many nifty spells to compensate their 2nd rate tankability.<br />
Warriors get to be the best tanks by far, to compensate the fact they get nothing else.<br />
<br />
This seems decent doesnt it?<br />
--<br />
<br />
Now here are the problems that were faced, and smashed the theoratically good balance, into the ground:<br />
<br />
°When people look for a tank, they just want that... a tank.<br />
Which made all warriors taken over knights(during kunark).<br />
<br />
So they wanted to give knights a little plus.<br />
<br />
°With PoP, aggro has become a fundemental part of tanking.<br />
Tankability now not only includes hp/ac... but aggro as well.<br />
Which makes knights blow warriors out of the water.<br />
<br />
<br />
So to fit with the initial idea, here are a few possible solution--<br />
<br />
°Nerf the paladin's hp/ac... make it so its frusterating keeping a knight alive,<br />
just as it's frustering for a warrior to get aggro.<br />
<br />
°Boost Warrior aggro, so they get no problems keeping aggro. Just as knights have no problem staying alive.<br />
<br />
°Give warriors new tools and the such, to help boost their aggro a little, and give them new functions that would appeal to groups and raids.<br />
---<br />
personally I prefer the 3rd choice.<br />
<br />
But paladins will hate all 3 choices, because they'll have a hard time finding groups again....<br />
but thing is...<br />
you're SUPPOSE to have a harder time finding a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stop taking those spells for granted, and realise that there should be a price to pay for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's balance to me. If you get a spellbook with a whole bunch of utilities, I don't want you being tank #1. Warriors give up everything to tank. We have no spells, yet we sit on the sidelines as &quot;Tank Option.&quot;<br />
<br />
If Warrior aggro was improved to where the current knight advantage was gone, how would you change Paladins to enable them to be competitive for the tank job or just desireable for one of those other five spots in the group?

<br />
Heh heh. You already pretty much have the tanking abilities of me. You can spot heal when needed. You can ghetto crowd control. But you want more? Every day I believe more that some Paladins are greedy little players. Thanks Apothes and Aeka for somewhat pointing this out.<br />
<br />
If we could ever figure out what balanced was, then coming up with recommendations for what changes should be made to get there would be easy. <br />
<br />
Easy. We have a poll where people are figuring out what would be balancing. Yet all we've heard is, &quot;It's being considered.&quot; Fun fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Knights can tank for groups fine now- that i have no problem with, since tankability is fairly close there is no 'balance' to a massive aggro advantage - and, as i've stated elsewhere, to my mind it hurts the game for any class that can take the damage so effectively to have such command over a mob. So long as knights can do a warriors job they do not require other advantages to do with the role of Tank. <br />
<br />
i'm very much afraid that there will never be total balance between all three plate tank classes, if we accept that someone will be the 'favoured' choice to tank then the class whose entire purpose for being is to tank (i.e. the warrior) should be the class with the mild advantage. Whilst you can say that utility never gets you groups, i can say with certainty that when a group is looking for more members, that utility makes you mildy more favoured than me :p.<br />
<br />
Something else i think all plate class tanks need is emacipation from the utter dependancy for a group on that single role of tank, if you can't find a tank slot you should have some ability to fulfill another role - not more efficently than a specialised class but well enough that you'll be considered for the role. I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible to make a TANK only group that is able to function without total inefficiency. My own take on that is here....http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1734</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">IMO there's basically 2 separate stages of balance that need to be looked at.  First is actually tanking ability.  This includes both healing efficiency and the ability to get and hold aggro.  The 2 need to be proportional.  The easiest way is to make aggro and mitigation approximately the same for all tank classes.  That balances our ability to tank in xp groups without affecting raid dynamics.<br />
<br />
The second stage involves balancing all the other spells and abilities each class gets against each other.  You can't compensate for tanking ability with utility.  That was proven back in Kunark.  By the same token when you eliminate that tanking advantage that warriors used to have without adding any utility or DPS to warriors there is no longer any disadvantage to having a spellbook for knights.<br />
<br />
So in short balance knight vs warrior ability to tank first (only healing efficiency and aggro considered).  Then compare all the rest and adjust skills, spells, dps, and disciplines to get those balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Percevall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Valeris-<br />
<br />
So what would you change?  In this community, at least, it seems that increasing warrior aggro is the only acceptable solution.  What if warrior aggro was increased to where it was basically equal to a knights?  Would it then be acceptable to give knights new self buffs which would allow them to equal warrior ac/hp and dps?  (Warrior + warrior class skill caps and stats = Paladin + Paladin spellbook perhaps?)<br />
<br />
Again, for those who think warriors deserve to be the best tanks (who knows maybe they do)  where do you think Paladins should find their niche?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Problem is, you already get that when grouped with a druid as primary healer :p, and if there is no trade off to having a spell book, then where is my 'upside' for doing without it for 64 levels? A level 55 discipline which makes me stand out on a raid as long as no other warrior is there? <br />
<br />
IF and only if i get utility to match that provided by your spellbook, then i would find total parity with my class  in the experience group tanking role acceptable.<br />
<br />
Raids i would say going by posting s from various people including Aeka (a pally) knights have clear roles not directly related to aggro that make them indispencible to raids. Defensive give one warrior on a raid a glamour role but the raid only succeeds because all classes are doing their bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Percevall... why did you start playing a Paladin?<br />
Was it because you wanted to be a tank?<br />
or was it because of the spells?<br />
<br />
Everything you believe in atm, is Knights should be equal to warriors when it comes to Tanking.<br />
Your beliefs are horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Warriors should be better then knights in Tankability, period. (This includes the capacity of keeping a mob on you)<br />
<br />
If it's spells that made you want to play a paladin, then cherish your spellbook, for it's an incredible advantage.<br />
It allows you to solo blue mobs,<br />
it allows you to help others,<br />
it allows you to serve on raids and groups even when you are not tanking.<br />
Cherish your spell book.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to tank however... why didn't you make a Warrior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I mostly agree with Percevall. Knights and warriors should get about the same number of group invites; knight soloability is greatly exaggerated. It happens either at specific level ranges or with outstanding gear and constant KEI. Even then it's not like you can walk into any zone with blues and grind away.<br />
<br />
Give warriors about 10-20% more DPS and AC/HP than knights (perhaps a small boost to warriors and a small nerf to knights to balance this out, so that encounters aren't trivialized). Possibly add an ability to generate snap aggro, gained either through AAs or like at level 50, one that can be upgraded again either through levels or AAs, and we're in good shape. Knights have issues as well, these would need to be discussed by people more knowledgable about knight issues than I. They're not as glaring as warrior problems at the higher parts of the game but they do deserve attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Percevall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I believe I mentioned that this should not apply to raids.  When it comes to raids Warriors and Paladins do have their distinct roles.  Warriors main tank and add tank while I more or less play lifeguard.  Don't you wish roles were that simple in xp groups?

  What you dont want to hear but what is the truth is that warriors should be perferred for tanking PERIOD thats all we do PERIOD, if makes no difference if you consider your spell book useless you still have  it and I would bet my account you would not give it up to keep your idea of balance but you ask us to do just that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually Valeris, one of the primary roles of knights on raids is directly related to aggro, off tanking. Aggro control is what make this the knight raid niche. Giving warriors snap aggro would also mean that warriors would move in on this role. This is perhaps argument for making knight aggro generation more expensive, so that it can't be done forever (like it is now), but could be done when needed. *shrug*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've done a fair amount of offtanking on raids - aggro control is not absolutely required - it's more convenient but not essential. We're getting a little off topic though heh  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually neither.  I made a Paladin for the roleplaying perspective. It had nothing to do with either tanking or spells.  I never said I live to tank.  I tank because that is the role of the EQ Paladin (in xp groups).  If there were another role I would happily do that and discussions like this would never take place.  Also, contrary to what you may think, the majority of Paladins cannot effectively solo.  My dps is lower than any equivalently geared warrior and my manapool too small to survive the long fight necessary to kill a blue mob.   Given this info, and you still think that tanking should be owned by the warriors, where do you think Paladins should fit in?  Less spellcasting and more dps (like a more durable ranger who specializes in 2hand weapons)?  Or the opposite...a real battlecleric?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If they're not going to change the current situation in any significant way, then they should give warriors additional roles.  In this way, warriors would gain some utility to compensate for their loss of relative tanking power.<br />
<br />
The beginnings of a new role are glimped in the /shield skill, but it didn't go far enough.  I'd like to see a warrior be able to /shield someone full time rather than just for 12 seconds.  Perhaps AA would be needed to reach full time coverage.<br />
<br />
And if we are going to throw around semi-useless utility ideas for warriors, then I always wondered why warriors don't get instill doubt, and I always wondered why crippling blows don't give a short-term snare effect.<br />
<br />
Finally, I have contemplated that warriors should get further &quot;rewards&quot; for being berserk.  Make our taunts always succeed (just like AE taunt) if we're berserk.  Allow a warrior to have aggro lock when he's in the danger zone.  Surely paladins would not begrudge us this?</div></div><hr />

I stated my opinion on what class balance meant.   The purpose of starting this was not to try to convince anyone that I am right, but to see how your opinion differs.  I apologize if I did not make that clear enough.  You may be right that warriors should be the best tank.  If that is true then what do Paladins do in xp groups?  LOL I think some of you people are so used to flames flying everywhere that you missed the fact that I am just looking for a constructive discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Kunark shadows so much of these debates. Back in kunark when looking for a tank a knight was never even seriously considered for a number of reasons. Groups would ignore knights in favour of getting a warrior -  that was wrong. Given how knights have demonstrated throughout Pop that they can viably deal with mob damage on a comparable level with warriors I think it very unlikely that remove of an aggro advantage will mean they are passed over - it'll be more along the lines of first come first served.  Having said this in all my time pick up grouping I have seen a lot of groups with more than one tank - the 'efficent' group is much more in the minority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kunark shadows so much of these debates.<br />
<br />
yeah and it's total and complete Bull shit. even if you stripped insta aggro off knights and made them have to use taunt they would still be just as viable for a group because they got a major fucking upgrade during vleious that put them on the same tables as warriors when it comes to tanking ands with gear out there they can come to without 100hp and a few ac of the top warriors out there. So any knight that uses the fucking kunark dark ages is delusional cause they can never go back people know we can tank and we will tank. the problem was when SoE in their infinite wisdom upgraded out tanking ability they neglected to tak into account our aggro ability which did not become apparent until PoP and knight aggro makes killin soooo much more faster. In kunark the aggro ability was ofset with our crappy mitigation now there is no offset and knight are warrior 99.999999% and 30% cleric and 100% aggro generator(yeah I know that's not class but it matters). now SoE is so chicken shit from all the whiny babies about nerfin stuff they are afraid to nerf knights which needs to be done to achince some sort of balance again actually they need ot nerf knights then upgrade war ac and hp a bit to put them ahead of knights in that area. no matter what all 3 are a valid tank choice now insta aggro or not and the only thing that would change player opinion is if they changed knight mitigation which I may be changing from askin for aggro nerf to mitigation nerf for knights since they seem to want their aggro fine keep it but the price is dmg mitigation you can't have it all period end of point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is in part where your breakdown of the problem begins.  Balance is about the whole game.  You cannot say balance here, or balance there, but balance overall has to be achieved.  The raid part of the equasion is pretty balanced as far as warriors vs knights is concerned to my mind, but it is a consideration.  (side note:  where many knights make a mistake is in saying that since one warrior is needed for most raid mobs, for most guilds, to disc defensive, that warriors have a better raid role.  This is simply not true, knights simply have a different raid role.)<br />

To balance warriors and knights, we have to look at all aspects of each class, and then balance them to equall desirability.  In other words, it is acceptable to consider knights fitting into groups in a utility role(or possibly a DPS role vs undead) and be second choice for tanking spots if all 3 classes where getting groups at about the same rate.  Put another way, the cost(balancing factor) of your spells is that you should be less of a tank.  Soloability should also be considered.  Knights can far outsolo warriors(this does not say much, as warriors simply cannot solo effectivly.  Knights can solo effectivly under certain sircumstances), and as such, warriors should be slightly more group friendly.<br />
<br />
Trust me when I say that I do not think anywhere here wants to 'kill' the knight classes, we simply want access to exp at roughly the same rate as knights.</div></div><hr />

IF you come here and admit that warriors have a problem that needs to be fixed. ( which you claim you do) why do you think a balance would require warriors to be upgraded, then knights to be upgraded as well?<br />

If we get something to fix our broken class, why do knights think they should get anything? wouldnt that just once again unbalance the game?</div></div><hr />

Fairly certain the exp penalty was never applied to aa's so the exp penalty wouldn't do anything.  Also wouldn't do anything to increase the warrior group desireability or balance.<br />

Paladins are a defensiv tank.<br />
Warriors are an offensiv tank.<br />
Shadowknights are an offensiv tank.<br />
<br />
The advantage paldins get with there spells should get removed from the advantage warriors has in dps. This mean groups have the choice between a warrior which give them a higher dps or a knight which give them lower dps but more utility. That will balance the groupe situation because dps is allways more liked then healing. As faster you kill the mob as less healing you need. With a Cleric which every groupe has and a shaman they allready got enough healing power and paladins are more liked in less situation but for groups with lacking healing power they will be first choice.<br />
<br />
This will be balance. Both are liked for the special groups. We have spells but give up dps for it. Will dps for healing not be a fair tradeoff ?<br />
<br />
I have the feeling many warriors here wasnt arround in the kunark time. The ideas you have will get us knights back to this situation.  More dps mean more aggro to which will help your aggro problem to a little. If it need a 2. form of aggromanaging then to i dont know. <br />

And something I forgot to comment on earlier:<br />
<br />
If they're not going to change the current situation in any significant way, then they should give warriors additional roles.  <br />
<br />
I do not like this idea, sorry.  I like  being a very specialized class, that is the best at one role.  I just would like to get back to the point where I am  the best at that role.  If I wanted all that utility, I would have rolled up a knight.</div></div><hr />

For those of you who feel Warriors SHOULD be the king tank....<br />
<br />
If Warrior aggro was improved to where the current knight advantage was gone, how would you change Paladins to enable them to be competitive for the tank job or just desireable for one of those other five spots in the group?  More dps?  More self buff spells to allow us to fully close the ac/hp gap (Paladin + Paladin spellbook = Warrior in terms of tanking perhaps?)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
SHOULD be king TANK?<br />
<br />
Ummm, WHAT ELSE CAN A WARRIOR DO?<br />
 <br />
In order for us to fight just about ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY in POP, we must drag around with us, A Healer, A Buffer, A Slower/Crowd Control.... <br />
<br />
Now this is for killing lt blue mobs in tier 1, which if a WARRIOR tries soloing, he will be lucky to get the mob to oh, 30%?<br />
<br />
We cant Heal, We cant Buff, and We cant Slow/CC... All 3 jobs that a paladin CAN DO...</div></div><hr />

Why isn't the shadow of original EQ lying over this just as much, when warriors were spellless rangers? I think from now on warriors should talk about the &quot;shadow of PoP&quot; in ominous tones whenever some knight mentions Kunark.<br />
<br />
Paladins will NOT be &quot;back in Kunark&quot; if warriors get the ability to taunt, even if it's taunt as good as knight taunt (which won't happen and probably isn't even desirable).<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because of<br />
<br />
1. removal of exp penalty<br />
2. increase in mana pool<br />
3. improvements to 2h weapon damage, increasing their relative dps (while most warriors still dual wield for aggro procs, doing less dps and eating more ripostes)<br />
4. more spells, including those 61-65, fast heals, group heals, a good rez, etc<br />
5. better itemization, both specifically for knights and in the proliferation of all/all gear<br />
6. increase in defensive abilities (which are now the SAME as warriors)<br />
<br />
Knights have gotten ALL of these things, and gave up NOTHING in return.  Oh, warriors did get /shield...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Balance does mean considering the whole game. <br />
<br />
Raiding - Exp Groups - Soloing<br />
<br />
Raiding,<br />
<br />
 in my opinion, Paladins have a huge advantage over warriors. On a raid you honestly use maybe 3-4 warriors max. That is if you have sucky clerics, good clerics, if you use 2 warriors its uncommon. As the MT should NEVER drop. Almost all CH chains figure the worst case non-defensive tank healing, so DEFENSIVE is a red herring, if a fight lasts longer than 3 minutes, and you do not switch tanks, and the tank doesnt die, then did you really need defensive? in almost all cases no. So while the MT has the glory, and sometimes the RT, the other warriors sit polishing their shiny swords and picking their asses... I know in our raids, except on a boss mob, warriors are never to assist, we look for adds... So our vaunted DPS advantage is non-existent there also.<br />
<br />
Now on a raid, I know most places in pop, or even in luclin, I want and prefer at least 6 or 7 paladins, a paladin in most every group of melee is prefered. Why is this? hmmm, CURES, GROUP HEALS, if all the clerics are healing the MT?RT who is healing the rogues, sks, monks, non-archer rangers, etc? Well the paladin, sure that 900pt group heal womt help on a MT , but on people who are taking AOE/Ripost, DS damage, its more than adequate. Hell some curses/dots NEED a paladin to cure them, because all the clerics are busy doing their CH's. How many mobs Curse the MT/RT so he cant hold aggro? these mobs require PALADINS to either TANK, or to chain CURE the MT?RT.  Because in the infinite wisdom of SOE an AGGRO REDUCER doesnt reduce the aggro from stuns, only from melee and EB.... <br />
<br />
So the WHOLE WARRIORS have an edge in Raiding is complete and UTTER BULL...<br />
<br />
Soloing,<br />
<br />
LOL... well we wont go there much, last time I solo'd for EXP was... um  EC's?  I wont even go into the Paladins that can clear the KC basement, and other assorted undead populated areas, let alone lt blue mobs, because they can heal themselves, effectively giving them, 15-20k hps...<br />
<br />
Warrior Soloing, usually means dualboxing a shaman/cleric and a warrior killing light blues in Velious/Luclin...<br />
<br />
EXP Groups,<br />
<br />
Well thats what this is all about, and we all know any 2 week old, 62 pally tanks better in tier 3 than all but the best warriors in the best gear, even then its a roll of the dice.<br />
<br />
Balance you ask... well here are my top ideas, and yes they need tweaked and modified, but I think this is the direction Warrios should go, some are actually upgrades all melee classes.<br />
<br />
HP/AC  -  Warriors get an innate advantage, level 50-5% added to all gear/spells, level 60-10% added to all gear/spells, level 62-15%, level 65-20%<br />
ex - Virtue adds 1405hps 72AC --  at 65 adds 1685 hps, 86AC<br />
ex2 - Ring of Dain 10AC 100hps == 12AC 120Hps + AA boosts<br />
ex3 - CH does 7500 hps healing -- 9000 hps<br />
<br />
Stats - Allow All melee to get AA to boost STA stat to 355 like wis/int - FIXX the damn hp/sta calculation above 255, why do i get less stamina for AA abilities than for regular stamina up to 255?<br />
<br />
DPS- FIXX dual wield, 2h has become WAY overpowered... allow DB in off hand, allow flurry off hand, I almost want to say make all knight weapons ranger/warrior usable but primary only.<br />
<br />
Disciplines - KILL DEFENSIVE It is a CONCRETE Tire around our necks and we are on the TITANIC...<br />
<br />
make all other disciplines on seperate timers, I actually prefer them to be sort of like bard spells, these are tactics that the warrior has learned over time to help him, put them in a new spell gem type bar, and make them use his stamina bar to&quot;CAST&quot; them. Give them a specific cost to maintain, allow them as insta casts. I know some hate the  &quot;cast&quot; idea but thats really the only way to do it, Currently defensive is &quot;CAST&quot; it has a 3 minute duration, recast time of 6 minutes,is uninteruptable, and non dispellable.... ergo.. WE ALREADY CAST.. lets just make it official, and limit the &quot;TACTICS GEM BAR&quot; to say 4 disciplines, and give them LONG resets after memorized, so that you cant just switch you need to prepare ahead of time. Also ADD new disciplines that you can learn skill paths would be ideal spending AA's or exp to learn new skills. And for these I say let all melee classes get this &quot;Tactics Bar&quot;, of course casters should have spell gems greyed out when they are active, and give pallies that defensive they want, see how much they like it then... <br />
<br />
MITIGATION - Give warriors an innate shielding mod starting at level 50 and increase by 2 a level to 60, then 3 to level 65 so at level 65 we have 35 shielding... <br />
<br />
Hmm.. think that about covers it for me, for now<br />
<br />
edit: I almost forgot..<br />
 <br />
 NERF PALLIES TO HELL! NERF THEM I SAY!  <br />
<br />
LOL, but seriously, Personally I believe aggro lock is bad for the game. That it dumbs down and simplifies it too much. But with all the other changes to EQ, the boost to exp, no hell levels, respawn with gear, easy travel, insane exp in some zones (can we say level 30 in 6 hrs? Took me almost 6 months originally) I can see that SOE doesnt want the game harder, they are catering to the people who want it NOW. <br />
<br />
So we need to fix aggro, a few ways to go.<br />
<br />
1) NERF AGRO LOCK COMPLETELY, ie make all knights use taunt to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
2) MOSTLY NERF AGGRO LOCK-  remove all aggro from spells mobs immune to, boost the mana cost/reset/recast time on the &quot;culprit&quot; spell lines, mostly all stuns.<br />
<br />
3) SORTA NERF AGGRO LOCK- remove all current aggro from spells mobs are immune or unaffected by, instead give then effective +1 aggro for that spell. ie, mob immune to stun? == +1 aggro not +5000 aggro like it is now. mob immune to fire? ==+1 aggro for call of fire, etc etc,<br />
<br />
4) BOOST WARRIOR AGGRO- Add innate EB-type effect to warriors, give us added + aggro on ever hit.  Lots of ways to do this..<br />
<br />
5) AGGRO LOCK IS WONDERFUL - Give warriors a EB-BUTTON reset time 12 seconds...<br />
<br />
WELL, thats all i gotta say about that...<br />
I may be back with more... grrr early mornings...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Wait a sec, so those agro debuffers just debuff melee agro?  Doesn't do a damn thing to spell agro?<br />
<br />
SOE has had it out for warriors since the beginning of PoP then...probably even Luclin.  The only tank that will even affect is warriors, as knights can hold agro without even meleeing.<br />
<br />
How are warriors supposed to compete with someone who:<br />
1. Can hold agro on command<br />
2. Can tank sufficiently<br />
3. Can heal themselves<br />
4. Can perform other jobs other than tanking<br />
<br />
The kunark era concerns are bullshit.  Knights have gotten so many upgrades since then, and the only thing I've seen people wanting to take away is the AGRO!  Knights had these exact same agro abilities back in Kunark, but they received tanking upgrades in the expansions afterwards.  People aren't calling for the upgrades knights have gotten to be taken away, they're calling for something knights have had since the beginning of the freaking game to be lowered to compensate for all the tanking upgrades they've recieved.<br />
<br />
Warriors are a dead class compared to the knights, IMO, until such changes happen...except for a few of you for raids.  Sorry for the rest of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Happy to see a few knights that still got open eyes, Kaesorn :).<br />
<br />
Seems all the knights that actually Experienced the Kunark days, are lucid and notice the problems.<br />
<br />
The knights giving us troubles are probably those that started their character after PoP, going &quot;omfg, that class pwnZorZ!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">As elitist as it sounds I agree with Bunnie on this.  Back in the days of Kunark you could do a &quot;/who all Paladin 60&quot; and get 5 players.  If you did a &quot;/who all Warrior 60&quot; it would cap the scroll off at 20.  If that didn't indicate there was a weakness I don't know what would.<br />
<br />
In a balanced situation there should be exactly as many tanks for as many exp groups all zones support.  And of those tanks it should be split evenly across the classes.  Clearly this isn't the case.  In fact its reversed the trend.<br />
<br />
So who is creating the glut?  As much as I hate to say it, its &quot;junk&quot; Paladins and SKs.  They play a class they think is the most powerful and is the shortest way into a guild or the easiest path to high levels.  It happened to Warriors in Kunark but now the situation is reversed.<br />
<br />
Bad players tend to advocate bad things reguardless of class.  Players with clear vision realize that players who advocate bad things really have a secret wish.  Their secret wish to be the most elite over all.  There is only one person who would want to play a MMOG where they get their secret wish.<br />
<br />
It is clear which Paladins and SKs remember Kunark.  There stance and tone is much different than others.  I see some POP Warriors being stuck at that state.  This problem is unusual because it isn't a high or low but a middle ground problem.  Reguardless it should be fixed.  Taking a cue from what happened to Paladins and SKs it didn't involve nerfing any class to fix.  It just took a lot of time and tinkering.  I hope most of you can stick it out because I see the way out as something new and fun for Warriors.  <br />
<br />

I understand the frustration that prompts a statement like that but I totally disagree.  How would an xp penalty help anything?  If I could take a large xp penalty to vastly increase my power I'd do it in a snap.  There's no ultimate cap on xp so who cares how fast you get the xp?  The only way an xp penalty would help is if there was a maximum amount of xp you could get.  So say warriors without the cap could hit level 65 and get every AA available (600 or so?) eventually.  A class with an xp cap could only get level 62 and maybe 200 AAs.  I'm not advocating this as a fix but that's they only way it would make a difference.<br />
<br />
I think knights are fine just the way they are.  They could use a bit of a boost relative to casters but overall they're pretty good where they are.  Pure melee need a rather large boost.  They fall behind both casters and hybrids by a pretty large margin right now.  The only real solution I see is to implement more abilities for all pure melee classes that gives them all some utility.  Fixing taunt would be a big step but that alone wouldn't be enough to balance warriors in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
We'll never again be significantly better tanks than knights so they need to give us something else.  I don't care if it's DPS or group enhancing &quot;auras&quot; or spell like abilities as long as it gives us a meaningful counter to the advantage that a spellbook gives to hybrids.<br />
<br />
It was proven back in kunark that knights can't function as tanks if they're significantly worse at purely tanking compared to a warrior.  Now that there's essentially no difference between our ability to tank and theirs we need a comparable boost to utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cheif complaint that warriors have is that paladins and SK's have &quot;too much power&quot; in relation to them.    Groups have no need to slow down for them like they do with warriors.    Because of this, there is currently an &quot;experience penalty&quot; for having a warrior in a slower kill rate and the iniability of classes to live up to their potential.    Some people like safety, others like more challenge.    A lot of people have expressed the concern about raid level mobs.<br />
<br />
The question becomes... are people willing to pay a cost for safety?  If a paladin or SK can become damn close to being warrior with a mega spellbook, why not pay the price for it?</div></div><hr />

it's not punishing the players it's providing a downside to knights where as none exist atm. where the warrior has many downsides aggro generation for one. So by creating a exp penalty for knights which does effect group exp would in a sense make warriors desirable again.<br />
<br />
It actaully is a good fix I can find no cons the pros being raid encounters unchanged ... desirability for both knights and warriors knighs because of lazy groups still get thier aggro lock and warrior groups get normal exp ok I guess you an consider knights groups gaining exp slower as a con but I dont since it falls into the thing making the fix :)<br />

Ok so my new mission ask for exp penalty back that affects all exp includin AA and ask for knight tanking ability nerfed to bring knight aggro and tanking ability back into sone sort of non god mode.<br />

C. Not deal with either since they don't need a tank to gain exp<br />

Harp on Knights all you want but this is the main reason why I constantly try to push you guys into getting new useful abilities.  Every time a call goes out to screw with groups making them harder it just pushes soloers to keep on soloing.

Most every change to the game has repercutions, and many require more tuning down the road.  If changes to tank balancing actually does end up causing more soloing, and therefore less groups, the fix for that one is obvious...change group exp bonuses and ZEMs again(or simply attach an exp penalty while not grouped).</div></div><hr />

Pals should have 90 percent the War ac/hp/mitigation as their spells and utility easily account for 10 percent and, likewise, with SK doing 90 percent straight dps of the war with their spells/utility making it almost even.<br />
<br />
As you can see there are a number of ways to get to this balance (lower Pal dps to even gimper levels, raise warrior aggro, etc...).  <br />
<br />
To my mind the best way for the game is to lower Pal and SK aggro (no reason a stun that has no effect on a mob should enable one to hold aggro, seriously) and to raise War DPS.</div></div><hr />

it's not I personally think the way war aggro works is fine and knight aggro is overpowerd hence the penalty for using a knight :p<br />
<br />
Although I would prolly raise war tunt a bit.<br />
<br />
You obviouskly fall into the lazy I need EXP wiothout having to work for it catagory and want aggro on par with knights. Might as well go buy chutes and ladders and play that since it is about as challenging as EQ qith insta aggro!</div></div><hr />

Well, in the last year I have read thousands of posts regarding the topic of balance between the tank classes and I've seen countless possible solutions put forth by both sides.  Yet always someone from the other camp is there to point out how each of those proposed solutions wouldn't &quot;balance&quot; things at all...just un-balance everything in the other direction (ie Paladin arguments against boosting warrior aggro).  Perhaps if there was some consensus on what warrior/ knight balance really meant then a solution that SoE might actual take note of could be developed.<br />
<br />
so...<br />
<br />
Without rehashing all the previously suggested fixes or nerfs, give me your ideas on how exactly knights and warriors could be balanced given the following:<br />
<br />
1) Currently, both knights and warriors are pretty much confined to competing for one slot in your average xp group...the tank.  <br />
<br />
2) Before anyone brings this up: Yes Virginia, Paladins do have more utility due to their spells, but this is very very rarely enough to land them a different spot in a group.<br />
<br />
3) In my mind, &quot;balance&quot; should NOT mean that one class or the other is the preferred choice in most situations.  If a group is looking for a tank and they see a Paladin and a Warrior LFG, then there should be equal pros and cons to choosing one over the other.<br />
<br />
4)  Comments should be specific to xp groups, not raids.<br />
<br />
5)  Again, this is just for general ideas on how you think the tanks would be balanced.  No suggested fixes/ nerfs please.<br />
<br />
Example:  <br />
<br />
I happen to belong to the camp that believes balance comes with knights being the kings of aggro (due to our spellbook) while warriors have a decided edge in ac/hp and dps.  Obviously alot of warriors disagree and I can certainly understand why.  Thats why I want to know how you think we should be balanced.<br />
<br />
*note*  I intentially ommitted Shadowknights because they have considerably more dps and utility than Warriors or Paladins and therefore can actually fill other roles besides tank.  Or they can just go solo.<br />
<br />
I am starting an identical thread at PoN.   I look forward to your flames and hopefully even some productive responses!<br />

nice try paladin, we arnt stupid AC/HP means nothing nowdays with the current buffs and gear, DSP, we are only ahead of bards in the case of pure melee dmg.<br />
<br />
Tanking, more spacficaly the tanking spot REQUIRES THE MASTERY OF GETTING AGRO, if you give that to paladins there HP/AC/atk doesnt mean jack shit, <br />
<br />
<br />
TANKING IS AGRO PERIOD! <br />
<br />
dont fucking tell me we need to loose ANYTHING for agro control, paladins lucked into and lost NO abilitys, you have a niffty little spell book that plays a HUGE part in agro, dont try to hide it like its your porno and your still in your perants house</div></div><hr />

How do you work for it atm?.... pressing Taunt like a mad man? hoping the next one will be a successfull one?...<br />
oh yes.. that's definately a challenge...<br />
<br />
I think that you fail to realise that the way warriors work now IS mind numbing and lazy shit...<br />
<br />
you hit A, you hit Kick... you hit Taunt if you lose aggro... you wait 6 seconds... you hit Taunt again.. yes! got aggro... you hit Kick again... lalalala... hit Kick again... dum dee dum....<br />
<br />
The knight on the other hand does not have a mind numbing job...<br />
<br />
if an add comes, he can root it out of the way, all while tanking the other mob... maybe make a couple quick heals to those damaged by the add... etc...<br />
<br />
if a add comes for the warrior... the warrior will do NOTHING, and carry on with his mob.<br />
All he does is hope the Mezzer in his group can handle it...<br />
<br />
Sorry.. but no way in hell is Warrior a difficult class, it's a broken class, period.<br />

 <br />
<br />
I am of the opinion that there should be an exp penalty, but not to fix warriors. The EXP penalty should NEVER affect the group only the individual.<br />
<br />
An exp penalty was supposed to be established because there are different power levels of classes and difficulties of play. <br />
<br />
For exampl if say a level 40 paladin is as powerful as a level 60 warrior, and the 60 warrior is at 1,000,000 xp points then that 40 paladin should require 1,000,000 xp points.  That is part of the class balancing formula, which SOE threw away. When they did that, and then increased skill caps, put knights on same mitigation tables, added dozens of mana regen items/spells, hundreds off all/all knight usable gear.. balance went completely out the window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Landrain, if they give Paladins and Shadow Knights an experience penalty, how would this benefit Warriors what so ever?  Would a group want a Knight less, since their experience isn't impacted?  Would group want a Warrior more, since he still can't do the job as well as a Knight and their experience isn't impacted?  All you'd be doing is making the Knights work harder, but since they'd still be dominating the groups in PoP it wouldn't mean a great deal except to piss them off some.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I don't like the idea of a personal exp penalty. It's analogous to how D&amp;D did things.

<br />
Earlier in EQ, the exp penalty didn't make any sense, since for a long time many hybrid's sum of both caster and warrior part ended up being less viable then a pure class. That is not the case anymore, but I still think the problem is better solved by expanding the vision for the pure classes. I think it would be great if warriors were given skills that allowed them to take a more active role in a group beyond autoattack, kick, taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd rather see no fix at all than see them do this.  I'd view this as the worst possible solution.  I don't think it would get warriors any more groups than they already have.  IMO it would result in about the same number of groups for warriors as we have now, less for knights, and more tank slots for rangers and beastlords.<br />
<br />
Hitting a knight with an exp penalty does nothing to help me do my job as a warrior.  It doesn't even benefit the warrior class indirectly by decreasing the functional gap between knights and warriors.  The only purpose it would serve would be to piss off the knights for no good reason.<br />
<br />
If all they can come up with is an exp penalty then they should just announce that warriors are totally obsolete, raise knight skill caps to match warriors, and give warriors a popup next time they log in to transmute themselves into either a paladin or an SK.  Then also transmute all warrior specific items into paladin/SK items depending on what you picked.</div></div><hr />

etween knights and warriors. The only purpose it would serve would be to piss off the knights for no good reason.<br />
<br />
see my whole point is that I think warrior taunt is about where it should be I am not saying warriors do not need upgraded but I think knight aggro is way overpowered and a exp penalty in a fashion would address this.<br />
<br />
Although I am really not planning on going on a crusade for a exp penalty it was more for dry humor then anything else but it is a viable solution in no way am I saying it is the right one though. Personally I would prefer to see knight aggro abilities reduced. <br />
<br />
You have to remember when replying to my posts that i am in the camp that does nto see warriors as broken but knights as being broken n the sence they need a nerf to aggro because they are over powerd. if they leave knights as is and upp warriros to achive balance I guess I will go out and buy chutes and ladders cause it would beabout aqs much of a challenge as EQ would be.</div></div><hr />

Yup i agree with more utility, but since you and various knights have been at painful length to tell us warriors that utility never got knights a group, i'm interested to see why you think the same doesn't hold true with warriors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">What you dont want to hear but what is the truth is that warriors should be perferred for tanking PERIOD thats all we do PERIOD, if makes no difference if you consider your spell book useless you still have it and I would bet my account you would not give it up to keep your idea of balance but you ask us to do just that.<br />
<br />
WE DO NOTHING FREAKING ELSE BUT TANKING YOU DO <br />
<br />
The question you should be asking is -&gt; with warriors being the perferred tank how can we make sure that knights are still wanted and usefull in exp groups?<br />
<br />
What other role does a paladin fill in a xp group besides tank? What other reason would a group decide to grab a paladin to fill a spot in the group, assuming there was already a tank in the group? <br />
<br />
Warriors are a Tank,<br />
Paladins are a Hybrid,<br />
Shadowknights are a Hybrid.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're a Hybrid,<br />
you're suppose to be able to do both things, melee and casting,<br />
at the price of sucking at both of them.<br />
<br />
So paladins shouldn't have any role in a group then, is what you are saying. Or do groups now look for tank, healer, slower, hybrid, DPS, DPS? We get groups to tank. It's just that simple.<br />
<br />
SHOULD be king TANK?<br />
<br />
Ummm, WHAT ELSE CAN A WARRIOR DO?<br />
<br />
In order for us to fight just about ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY in POP, we must drag around with us, A Healer, A Buffer, A Slower/Crowd Control.... <br />
<br />
Now this is for killing lt blue mobs in tier 1, which if a WARRIOR tries soloing, he will be lucky to get the mob to oh, 30%?<br />
<br />
We cant Heal, We cant Buff, and We cant Slow/CC... All 3 jobs that a paladin CAN DO...<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think paladins get invites to groups because they can root? Or because we have buffs? Or because we can have a fast casting, 850 hp heal that has worse efficiency than superior healing? Those are indeed very nice abilities, but they don't get us groups. <br />
<br />
Raiding,<br />
<br />
in my opinion, Paladins have a huge advantage over warriors. On a raid you honestly use maybe 3-4 warriors max. That is if you have sucky clerics, good clerics, if you use 2 warriors its uncommon. As the MT should NEVER drop. Almost all CH chains figure the worst case non-defensive tank healing, so DEFENSIVE is a red herring, if a fight lasts longer than 3 minutes, and you do not switch tanks, and the tank doesnt die, then did you really need defensive? in almost all cases no. So while the MT has the glory, and sometimes the RT, the other warriors sit polishing their shiny swords and picking their asses... I know in our raids, except on a boss mob, warriors are never to assist, we look for adds... So our vaunted DPS advantage is non-existent there also.<br />
<br />
Now on a raid, I know most places in pop, or even in luclin, I want and prefer at least 6 or 7 paladins, a paladin in most every group of melee is prefered. Why is this? hmmm, CURES, GROUP HEALS, if all the clerics are healing the MT?RT who is healing the rogues, sks, monks, non-archer rangers, etc? Well the paladin, sure that 900pt group heal womt help on a MT , but on people who are taking AOE/Ripost, DS damage, its more than adequate. Hell some curses/dots NEED a paladin to cure them, because all the clerics are busy doing their CH's. How many mobs Curse the MT/RT so he cant hold aggro? these mobs require PALADINS to either TANK, or to chain CURE the MT?RT. Because in the infinite wisdom of SOE an AGGRO REDUCER doesnt reduce the aggro from stuns, only from melee and EB.... <br />
<br />
So the WHOLE WARRIORS have an edge in Raiding is complete and UTTER BULL...<br />
<br />
Sucky clerics? Maybe your guild only raids content that is trivial to your abilities, but in my guild, there are many times that we end up going through all of the available tanks on a single encounter, and we generally have 5+ warriors along. Do you really think tanks die fighting General Reparm because of &quot;sucky clerics&quot;? There is no way that &quot;all CH chains figure the worst case non-defensive tank healing&quot; simply because in many cases, NO ONE can survive the worst case. Again, look at general reparm. Worst case is 24,696 damage in a single round, non defensive. That is ~3170 max hit and a 3k proc. Maybe the tanks in my guild are gimps, but we don't have any tanks with 25k hp. We went through I think 6 tanks before General Reparm died when we killed him, and after the last tank died, we only killed him by burning him down the last bit before he killed us all. We sure as hell didn't have a knight try to step up and tank him.<br />
<br />
There are many mobs in PoP that simply require defensive to tank. Going from taking 3k max quads to 1750 max quads is a massive, massive increase in tankability. I wouldn't call defensive a red herring when it is the only thing that allows many guilds to defeat the majority of the encounters they face. <br />
<br />
Groups heals are very nice for those mobs that AE. They don't do much when fighting mobs that don't AE. I'm not sure why you think paladins are required to remove curses. Shamans and Druids can do that just as well as a paladin can for less mana thanks to specialization and SCM AAs. If you might need curses removed, it is generally better to bring a shaman instead of a paladin. They can cast the spell cheaper, can regenerate mana much more quickly, and have a much lower chance of a fizzle, not to mention Radiant Cure AA and the Blood of Nadox spell for poison/disease cures. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
If AC/hp means nothing nowadays and TANKING IS AGRO(sic) PERIOD, then why not just have a wizard with a staff of temperate flux tank everything? Aggro is part of tanking, but not the entirety of it. You are not &quot;only ahead of bards in the case of pure melee damage&quot;. When was the last time you parsed a fight and had the paladins outdamaging equally equipped, non defensive warriors? Warriors with full offensive AAs and a good weapon are about comparable to monks in melee damage.  Ask some of the warriors on this board with full AAs and a BoW or SEWS what their DPS is. It is just shy of 200 DPS. That is easily 50% more (minimum) than a  paladin with similar equipment/AAs.<br />
<br />
Is the current situation broken? I think anyone who is honest would say yes. I don't think, however, that you'll get any hybrid (or SOE) to agree that &quot;warriors should be perferred for tanking PERIOD&quot; and that &quot;you're suppose to be able to do both things, melee and casting, at the price of sucking at both of them&quot;. There should be parity. A group shouldn't care about whether their tank is  a paladin, a shadowknight, or a warrior except in specific situations and group makeups. Those 3 classes should generally be interchangeable in experience groups. Going on a crusade to make warriors head and shoulders the &quot;king tank&quot; in experience groups isn't going to get you much support outside of your own class. Trying to achieve parity will get you support, even from paladins and SKs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Val, it depends on what you mean by utility. If it is something like snare (in a dungeon) or FD, yes that can get you a group if the group doesn't already have a class that can do those things. Those are the only 2 abilities that would be considered utility that I can think of that would get someone a group. I'm sure someone else can think of more.</div></div><hr />

For the most part, I totally agree with you, that there shouldn't be two levels... tank and suck, with only warriors being tank and the rest being suck.   <br />
<br />
I DO however believe VERY strongly that there should be an inverse relationship between aggro abilities and melee abilities.  In other words, if I'm 35% greater than you in combined offense and defensive melee, then you should be 35% greater than me in the ability to generate aggro.   Disciplines/Spells being a wash, cancelling one another out.   I don't see that as being an unreasonable thing.<br />
<br />
I also don't see it as unreasonable that under almost every situation there should be a visible difference in melee abilities, both offensive and defensive between warrior and knight.<br />
<br />
That situation doesn't currently exist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Things Paladins do when they are in an exp group when I am tanking:<br />
<br />
Crowd Control.  If we have no mezzer, they park root mobs and tank one when we have 3 or more in camp, and they tank the second mob if there are two in camp.<br />
<br />
Pull.  Using their spells, they can sometimes pull better than I as a warrior (getting singles) and can do it more efficiently than others in the group who need to med.<br />
<br />
Secondary Healer.  Throwing a LoH or a heal on the cleric who is about to go squash is very helpful.  Also, the ability to rez group members after a wipe or partial wipe when no cleric is along or just rezzing the cleric if the cleric got wiped... all very helpful.<br />
<br />
Buffs.  Brells helps.<br />
<br />
DPS.  Paladins are not good at this, but any DPS is better than having a second cleric in group.<br />
<br />
Tank.  I know, I said I was the tank in the group at the beginning, but if I am doing a long experience stretch I will have to go AFK every once in a while to grab food, drink, or to make a quick bio-break.<br />
<br />
Okay.<br />

<br />
YES:<br />
<br />
Crowd control, Pull, Secondary healer (and rezzes), Buffs.  I enjoy having a paladin in my group.  They have great utility when played well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Exactly Aeka. I would like to see pure melees get skills that give them more control over how they do their job, as has been discussed may times in many places. The &quot;styles&quot; of DAoC is a good example of this. Skills that allow melees to do some amount of burst damage, or a have some detrimental effect, etc. that has an associated cost (like stamina drain, or short term reduction of offensive or defensive ability). Things that while not being the equivalent of a spell book, provide useful skills that give pure classes more options and more control over how they play their class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">What other role does a paladin fill in a xp group besides tank <br />
<br />
DPS in an undead zone.  Not the best DPS, but good DPS, with other utility.  Pallies also have some ability to solo, which is far  greater than warrior ability to solo.  These advantages need to be offset somehow.  That is balance.  You chose a class with utility, and to have that utility, to maintain a semblence of balance, there has to be a downside.  Right now there is none.<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think paladins get invites to groups because they can root? Or because we have buffs? Or because we can have a fast casting, 850 hp heal that has worse efficiency than superior healing? Those are indeed very nice abilities, but they don't get us groups.  <br />
<br />
But they are part of the balance equasion.  You cannot ignore those abilities, as you do  have them.<br />
<br />
There are many mobs in PoP that simply require defensive to tank <br />
<br />
And there are many that do not.  On those that do not, a pally can actually MT the mob more effectivly than awarrior, and on those that do, there are other roles a pally can fill(spot healing, off tanking, group heals, cures...other classescan fill these roles too, but it does not remove the fact that pallies can fill all these roles).  As more than one pally has said on this board, they are quite happy with their raid role.<br />
<br />
I don't think, however, that you'll get any hybrid (or SOE) to agree that &quot;warriors should be perferred for tanking PERIOD <br />
<br />
I am not sure I absolutly disagree with you on this, but let me ask a couple questions.  Should there not be some penalty for your dominance against undead, your ability to solo and your utility?  Since you can tank, and can solo, and can bring utility, should you be as good at those things as people who specialize in only one of those areas?<br />
<br />
Trust me when I say that I want to see the plate tank balance issue resolved, and I want to see it resolved in a way that does not put knights in the position that warriors are in now.  I do question the idea that knights should be just as desirable as a tank for an exp group, since knights do have other options.</div></div><hr />

Maybe, maybe not. I'm not sure how that would work out, to be honest. There are many things in EQ that once a certain threshold is reached, no more of that thing is needed. Just to explain that a bit, imagine that knights were changed to aggro 5 times better than they can now, and warriors were changed to aggro 1.5 times better than knights do now. Would the massive difference in aggro ability really be a usefull balance factor at all?<br />

Think of healing. Let's imagine class X has a 10k heal that casts in 4 seconds and costs 200 mana. Would it really matter that class Y can cast a 20k heal for the same mana/cast time? No, the 10k heal is enough to get the job done.<br />
<br />
I don't know where that fine line between aggro being unbalanced and balanced is. I do know that right now it isn't balanced.<br />
<br />
I really think the ideas to further increase warrior tanking ability relative to knights is a bad, bad idea. The greater that difference is, the more things require a warrior to tank. Being required necessitates lowered desirability for those situations in which the class is NOT required. Look at what /disc defensive has done to you.</div></div><hr />

there are not that MANY mobs in pop that require defensive. How many mobs in PoP can one round ya for 9k+? it's not hard for apally to get to 9k hp buffed now they can even break 10k but if a mob cannot one round ya you can tank it, well if you are a knight or warrior.<br />

You do not get groups in order to rez, root, loh, fast heal, group heal, etc (except on raids, when in fact you DO). But you bring all those things to groups, and they help groups - they help groups survive and get exp. And they often do that when a warrior would be able to offer NOTHING comparable. ZERO. ZILCH.

Pally friend of mine does some light soling in Veksar.  Not often, but he does do it, and against blue con mobs.  Minor point, but it does show that pally soloing is a possibility.

<br />
&quot;When was the last exp group you were in Graal where the ONLY spells you cast for the duration of the group were those related to aggro generation?&quot;<br />
<br />
How about most of them? Aside from Brell's, I generally am only casting stuns, and that's it if I'm tanking. My job is to tank and get aggro. Why spend 12% of my mana pool to heal someone for 1/2 to 2/3rds of a bubble of health when the cleric is going to heal them to full in a couple of seconds anyway?  Sometimes I will be the puller and in those situations I may use root. If I'm not pulling and we have an enchanter/bard/shaman/ranger/monk/SK in the group, I don't even need to use root. You are likely thinking I am downplaying those abilities, but I'm not. They just aren't as universally usefull as you think they are. Sometimes, they are VERY FUCKING usefull, but often times they just aren't needed. It is very much like ressurection. Sometimes you need it very, very badly. You don't need a rez far more often than you do. <br />
<br />
Imagine a group that is consistently getting single pulls (I know, never happens in PoP). This group has plenty of mana regen, such that the healer never drops below 80% mana. What else is there for a paladin to spend his mana on? Since I don't have anything non defensive in nature to spend my mana on, I use my mana to stun. Or did you think I was going to sit there with full mana and my thumb up my ass pretending to be a low hp warrior with low DPS? At least by stunning, my mana is doing something productive.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the more challenging (and probably fun) the situation the group is in, the more paladins shine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes. Paladins shine when the shit hits the fan. Fast heals, LoH, group heals, roots: all of those things KICK ASS in emergencies. In those situations, a well played paladin is simply beautiful to see. When the group is getting single pulls and the healer has enough mana regen to nuke twice per mob, the only thing extra a paladin brings to a group is aggro. (I'm not disagreeing that we bring more aggro than we should relative to warriors, btw) <br />
<br />
The problem is that our &quot;utility&quot; is defensive in nature. As with all other defensive abilities, once you have enough, you don't need any more.<br />
<br />
P.S<br />
Personally, I would love it if I could get groups as a secondary tank whose job was to handle adds and do ghetto CC. That is the fun part of being a paladin. Groups generally just pick a chanter to CC or a puller who can get singles instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't agree with this idea that giving knights 35% more aggro to balance against 35 % better warrior mitigation will ever work in practice - if the knight can tank a mob with any level of efficiency AND  control it he will  be tank of choice. My extra 35% hp's won't make a goddamn difference. If his mitigation is bad enough that the aggro control is a questionable advantage then people will take the warrior. If my aggro control is just enough to be reasonable, people will take the warrior. You will never in a million years manage to divide up the tank slot between the warrior and knight classes equally. Best you can do is leave it that all three plate classes can tank, none has a massive advantage over the other in either taking damage or controlling the mob and give them enough utility so that they can stack together and perhaps even group together and get something meaningful done. If anyone should be mildly favoured for the tank spot it's the warrior as the specialist class and the most numerous.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly Aeka. I would like to see pure melees get skills that give them more control over how they do their job, as has been discussed may times in many places. The &quot;styles&quot; of DAoC is a good example of this. Skills that allow melees to do some amount of burst damage, or a have some detrimental effect, etc. that has an associated cost (like stamina drain, or short term reduction of offensive or defensive ability). Things that while not being the equivalent of a spell book, provide useful skills that give pure classes more options and more control over how they play their class.<br />
<br />
Great yep I'd like to stack better in a group too. Now remind me why the class which (even with these new skills) you envisage as having less advantages than those provided by the spellbook for knights should remain LESS desirable to fulfill it's primary function i.e. Tanking a mob.<br />

Don't on pain of death say raids.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how many paladins you know 60+, but ask them the last time they soloed a blue mob, undead or not. <br />
ANd how many warriors can solo a light blue?<br />
<br />
Slim to none.<br />
<br />
The other day I was in RM farming HG's, I have 3700hp or so and was using 2 Blood Points (for the life tap). One HG took me to 30% before the mob died, bandaided up to 50 (which took a few min because my skill sucks), then had to sit around using only my Vindi BP to go up the other 1900hp or so.<br />
<br />
Pallies don't have to worry about what weapons they use, they go for the best dmg weapon they got, and if things get icky, can park, back up, heal, go in and go back, and do this forever. The point is, pallies CAN solo if they have to. Might not be the most efficient way of doing it, but they can if they want to.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, kinda.<br />
<br />
One question for the pallies that I don't see them to have answered (maybe direct me to a post if there is one).<br />
<br />
But what advantage does a warrior bring to the table in exp groups?<br />
<br />
A few more HP/AC (which in PoP accounts for maybe 1-2 hits).<br />
<br />
What disadvantages?<br />
<br />
Lack to get aggro if the mob starts wailing on anyone else in the group.<br />
<br />
What do pallies bring to the group?<br />
<br />
Snap aggro, buffs, back up heals, pacify, root, etc.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages?<br />
<br />
Amount of HP/AC is about 1-2 hits les than that of a warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do the pros outweigh the cons for the warrior? Not hardly.<br />
<br />
And for pallies? You bet your ass they do. And when groups see people LFG, they think of what the class rbings to the table as a whole. <br />
<br />
Here's a quote from the Prima's Official  Strategy Guide, Kunark version. (Yes, I know. It's Kunark, but the purpose of a class hasn't changed since then, or at least it shouldn't have).<br />
<br />
Warriors are the epitome of a tank class...<br />

Lets not even get into how many times you've cast spells during all that time spent levelling up which have given you more out of this game than any warrior in a similar situation.

&quot;don't WANT to utilise them because you want to tank not play support.&quot;<br />

I'm not sure I follow this: am I supposed to root the mob even though it doesn't need to be rooted? Am I supposed to cast a heal even though no one needs it? Am I supposed to chain cast brell's until I'm out of mana? I'm not sure what you are talking about. Those things are either needed or they aren't.

It's the near warrior tanking ability + great aggro generation that gets knights groups, not necesarily all the other things that a knight has in their spell book (heals, roots, snares, buffs, etc.). But the fact is, those are all still useful things that warriors don't get. They can't CC, they can't heal a group member in an emergency. Doesn't balance dictate that warriors get something in return?<br />
<br />
Currently just the aggro generation is worth far more than the extra 800hps + dps warriors get. If there was a warrior only item that had right click effect of Cease and was neg800 hps and reduced their offensive skills to knight levels, don't you think most warriors would jump at it, at least for exp groups? And warriors aren't supposed to care that knights get that AND utility? Just because it doesn't get groups doesn't make it worthless. I think that if tomorrow SOE announced that the &quot;balancing&quot; fix was to remove all knight spells except aggro spells, we would see just how valuable utility spells are.</div></div><hr />

Now, it has been a while since I skilled up any melee skills, but for some reason I seem to recall that each skill point = 2 attack. Now knight melee skills cap 25 points below warrior skills (except piercing but I won't rant at the absurdity of warrior piercing being capped at 240). So this spell would boost a paladin's attack to match that of a warrior. I know knights have been bitching for a long time about lower dps than warriors and missing on a lot more melee attacks. A boost to attack would in some way close that gap. Now perhaps I am making a mistake and don't understand the mechanics of the game and raw attack won't make up for the lower skill caps, but it seems to me that knights are getting yet another boost to their power which will put them at a dps figure closer to warriors while whoever is in charge of development for pure melees is still asleep at the wheel.<br />

I agree with the second sentence, I don't agree with the first. A paladin should not only get a group &quot;when a warrior isn't available&quot;. If I'm not mistaken, the complaint of warriors is that the situation is reversed right now: groups will take a warrior when a knight isn't around. If it isn't good for warriors, why is it good for knights?<br />
<br />
I don't disagree that there needs to be a change to help warrior's group desireability (preferably through increased aggro) but I do disagree with the sentiment I have seen many times on these boards that the warrior should always be chosen first for an experience group. THAT is my concern. Like I said, if it isn't right for warriors to be in that situation, why would it be right for knights to be in that situation?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Val, to put that +50 attack into context with weapon and offensive skills: weapon and offensive skills affect your hit percentage while raw attack affects the damage distribution. There is a limit to how much raw attack can shift your damage distribution. Hitting 8% more often is probably going to be a bigger benefit in terms of DPS than having your damage curve shifted to the right a bit. I don't know how much raw atk would negate that 8% advantage, but I don't think 50 atk would do it. Someone with much more experience parsing atk would have to answer that one.<br />

Also keep in mind what the spell does and doesn't stack with.</div></div><hr />

It isn't good, it's the situation plate tanks have to deal with.<br />
<br />
There is no best case scenario where everyone is happy in lala land, best we can do is make it so knights aren't passed over when making a group in favour of waiting on a warrior (a la kunark), if we can enhance all plate tank classes secondary capabilities so they are more desirable for pick up groups then great, but there will never be a justification for a warrior plus spells to be better choice to tank than pure warrior apart from specialised situations or equipment advantages - which probably should have been an additional part of my statement you quoted.  <br />
<br />
Lets be fair as well, even in my gimped format i still get groups - often with knights in that group. Whilst that doesn't mean there is any justification for me to be worse at tanking, the same holds true for knights - you do get groups with warriors that are tanking and you're a damn sight more of an asset to said group than me with my DPS. Hells bells I spent most of my 30-50's with a regular exp group consisting of me, 2 pallies and a bard with an occasional druid friend as healer.<br />
<br />
posted a poll to the tavern  a while back. When asked how many people looked for a perfect group and how many just picked up a group of friends/lfger's 80% voted for the second route.  LFG sucks whichever tank class you play, i spent plenty of time LFG during Kunark when my class had the ultimate supremacy. i say again the only thing that'll make a half decent fix is to break the convention that states 'thou are't a tank, thou must tank or nothing else' in all honesty you're a lot further down that route than i am hmm?.</div></div><hr />

why did I give up all those things?<br />
<br />
<br />
And why shouldnt Knights be chosent as last resort with no Warriors around??? (personally I'm against this as well but... )<br />
Look at the druids... would you take a druid if a cleric was around?<br />
It's not fair isnt it?.... Druids should be Equivalent to Clerics!! and have the same chances to get groups!<br />

This is one of the fallacies that always get my dander up.  Being a Warrior in Kunark and beyond did not mean you instantly received a group every time you logged on.  It might mean that if a 51 Warrior and 54 Paladin were looking for a group in the same place at the same time, the Warrior might very well get the slot if it was available.  This wasn't particularly fair to the Paladin, I grant you.  However even then the Paladin did have solo options fairly well unavailable to the Warrior, at least by far the majority of Warriors anyway.  They also had duo options that weren't as available for Warriors, since a Paladin/Druid team was reasonably viable, but a Warrior/Druid team was more marginal.<br />
<br />
Kunark was the suck for Paladins.  But it wasn't as much of the suck as some of them make it out to be.</div></div><hr />

I do. I distinctly remember the first time I (a caster) was invised by a warrior. It was on the way to kill Kelorek Dar in CS about 2 years ago. It wasn't the last time I got invis from a warrior. Paladins and clerics are the only 2 classes that do not have an item with permanent right click invis. Potions work fine for me though.</div></div><hr />

Think this nicely sums it up.  First choice for a tank spot should go to a specialist tank.  To make sure that knights continue to get group spots, maybe it is time to look at their utility, and expand a bit on it, while making warriors the premier tank.  A knight will do in a pinch to tank, but a warrior is better.  Just make sure knights do have viable other roles in groups.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but I simply don't believe this. I have paladin friends and I see them do other stuff ALL THE TIME, either in my group when I'm playing my warrior or when they are tanking and I'm on the mage. Note that I said *group*, not any given fight.<br />

And leave all that Kunark moaning at the door. Warriors had it as bad pre-Kunark, and are imbalanced again now. Any paladin who expects me to melt with pity at the mention of Kunark these days is wasting his breath.<br />

As for invis -- who uses incarnadine bp anymore. Just get a tinkered invis device and get great invis with 1/2 the cast time. I sold my incarnadine bp as soon as these tinkered things came out and bought one of those. You could, too, and have EXACTLY the same invis.</div></div><hr />

Sure Aeka, take only a part of the arguement to suit your preference again. I refer you to ....There is no best case scenario where everyone is happy in lala land, best we can do is make it so knights aren't passed over when making a group in favour of waiting on a warrior (a la kunark)... if you're the first tank to show up then you get the group - that's fine with me. Heck said group may even decide the minor edge a warrior provides when he turns up later is worth getting and have two tanks in group! followed by...<br />

Maybe it can work but I don't see an example of being viable especailly in tanking. well, given that that is where warriors stand what is your solution? Now that we aren't best choice to tank we should be given a few options so we don't feel useless in a group? Rofl. So you should have your cake and eat it too? Whilst i would like extra reasons to stack a few extra abilities like that do NOT compensate for an all rounder like a knight maintaining tanking supremacy. When it gets right down to it your thinking is as flawed as Arbosch's.... and going back to that same post....if we can enhance all plate tank classes secondary capabilities so they are more desirable for pick up groups then great...<br />

What you don't like is the following statement which I have yet to see any Knight address ...but there will never be a justification for a warrior plus spells to be better choice to tank than pure warrior apart from specialised situations or equipment advantages <br />
<br />
IF they suddenly gave warriors utility equal to a spellbook right from the ground up, then you might have more grounds for complaint. <br />
<br />
To be honest I don't really 'want' that much utility though, giving me too many powers of that sort would break the archetype of warrior (i.e. standing up to face the beating with just his own talents and resolve) it's one reason i can never forsee giving warriors a heal spell for example. They're all about the physical, with maybe a few effects that can be layed out as being due to morale/inspiration from a warrior charging in screaming a warcry or whatever. <br />
<br />
BTW, The BP was just an example to illustrate the point the same holds true for many other knight (paladin)spells. Bunnie pointed out just a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">No the first choice for the tank spot should be the first tank that shows up <br />
<br />
No.  The first choice for tank should be warrior.  A knight should be able to fill the role but at a lesser ability.  Knights should be able to get groups based on their utility(and this needs work, I know).  As some one here mentioned, first choice for a healer slot is a cleric, druids can due the job if no cleric available, and can get groups based on other abilities(snare, buffs, dots, nukes).  This should be the way tank classes fall out.  Warriors are your first choice, but a pally will work if no warriors available.  Pally should(and again, I repeat this needs work) be able to get a group for his other abilities.<br />
<br />
I want to make this point clear.  Warriors chose to specialize in tanking, knights chose utility.  The specialist at a job should be best at it.<br />
<br />
The moment a Warrior isn't allowed to tank they are dead weight. <br />
<br />
So if knights emphasize their utility, and could get groups based on it, then there would be more group spots for warriors, and there would not be an issue.  I realize this would require far more changes than are likely, but in an ideal world, it is how it should work.  One thing I least agree with Val on is the idea of giving warriors more utility.  I want to tank, that is why I play a specialized tank.  Let the hybrids have the utility, and the utility roles, that is what hybrids are about.</div></div><hr />

you hit A, you hit Kick... you hit Taunt if you lose aggro... you wait 6 seconds... you hit Taunt again.. yes! got aggro... you hit Kick again... lalalala... hit Kick again... dum dee dum....<br />

What other role does a paladin fill in a xp group besides tank? What other reason would a group decide to grab a paladin to fill a spot in the group, assuming there was already a tank in the group? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So paladins shouldn't have any role in a group then, is what you are saying. Or do groups now look for tank, healer, slower, hybrid, DPS, DPS? We get groups to tank. It's just that simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think paladins get invites to groups because they can root? Or because we have buffs? Or because we can have a fast casting, 850 hp heal that has worse efficiency than superior healing? Those are indeed very nice abilities, but they don't get us groups. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sucky clerics? Maybe your guild only raids content that is trivial to your abilities, but in my guild, there are many times that we end up going through all of the available tanks on a single encounter, and we generally have 5+ warriors along. Do you really think tanks die fighting General Reparm because of &quot;sucky clerics&quot;? There is no way that &quot;all CH chains figure the worst case non-defensive tank healing&quot; simply because in many cases, NO ONE can survive the worst case. Again, look at general reparm. Worst case is 24,696 damage in a single round, non defensive. That is ~3170 max hit and a 3k proc. Maybe the tanks in my guild are gimps, but we don't have any tanks with 25k hp. We went through I think 6 tanks before General Reparm died when we killed him, and after the last tank died, we only killed him by burning him down the last bit before he killed us all. We sure as hell didn't have a knight try to step up and tank him.<br />
<br />
There are many mobs in PoP that simply require defensive to tank. Going from taking 3k max quads to 1750 max quads is a massive, massive increase in tankability. I wouldn't call defensive a red herring when it is the only thing that allows many guilds to defeat the majority of the encounters they face. <br />
<br />
Groups heals are very nice for those mobs that AE. They don't do much when fighting mobs that don't AE. I'm not sure why you think paladins are required to remove curses. Shamans and Druids can do that just as well as a paladin can for less mana thanks to specialization and SCM AAs. If you might need curses removed, it is generally better to bring a shaman instead of a paladin. They can cast the spell cheaper, can regenerate mana much more quickly, and have a much lower chance of a fizzle, not to mention Radiant Cure AA and the Blood of Nadox spell for poison/disease cures. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If AC/hp means nothing nowadays and TANKING IS AGRO(sic) PERIOD, then why not just have a wizard with a staff of temperate flux tank everything? Aggro is part of tanking, but not the entirety of it. You are not &quot;only ahead of bards in the case of pure melee damage&quot;. When was the last time you parsed a fight and had the paladins outdamaging equally equipped, non defensive warriors? Warriors with full offensive AAs and a good weapon are about comparable to monks in melee damage.  Ask some of the warriors on this board with full AAs and a BoW or SEWS what their DPS is. It is just shy of 200 DPS. That is easily 50% more (minimum) than a  paladin with similar equipment/AAs.<br />
<br />
Is the current situation broken? I think anyone who is honest would say yes. I don't think, however, that you'll get any hybrid (or SOE) to agree that &quot;warriors should be perferred for tanking PERIOD&quot; and that &quot;you're suppose to be able to do both things, melee and casting, at the price of sucking at both of them&quot;. There should be parity. A group shouldn't care about whether their tank is  a paladin, a shadowknight, or a warrior except in specific situations and group makeups. Those 3 classes should generally be interchangeable in experience groups. Going on a crusade to make warriors head and shoulders the &quot;king tank&quot; in experience groups isn't going to get you much support outside of your own class. Trying to achieve parity will get you support, even from paladins and SKs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
hehe..... why the fuck should we need AA's to catch up with a paladin? are you fucking mad in the first place? IF and i mean IF we get a group to do AA's it ALL goes into defensive AA's then, if we are lucky, or a little bull headed we will do offensive, its very rare to see a warrior doing their attack AA abilitys, most of the time they max every single defensive based AA, and i have seen parsed fights, i have used hits mode to compair my dmg to other warriors and other classes, warriors are almost at the bottom of the pile<br />

the funny part about your post is telling me to ask warriors with this or that wepoan... hehe, i dont think paladins are usless with out good weapons but i know for sure warriors are useless with out a good weapon. to warriors these rows and rows of weapons are just there for display, the only thing we want in the end game is proc's if we are going to tank</div></div><hr />

If a knight can hold agro but needs more healing than a warrior, great.<br />
<br />
If a warrior is on a higher damage mitigation table, that seems pretty good to me.<br />
<br />
Then:<br />
* warrior = tricky to hold agro but once he has it, is very efficient<br />
* SK/pal = gets agro well but needs more healing... resulting in more downtime (ideally... acknowledging with current spell line ups and teams, there is very little downtime regardless).<br />
<br />
The problem would seem to me to be the closing of the gap on AC/HP/damage mitigation.  If warriors go up, fine... but tuning issues.  If knights go down, it is actually a better result but there would be screams of &quot;nerf!&quot;.<br />

General Reparm... yeah well he is a little bit different from any tier 3 bosses. And the problems warriors face are not faced by Elemental + Time warriors. It is known that in Elemental Exp groups warriors get the job. And that on elemental boss mobs warriors get the job.. <br />
<br />
Prior to Tier 4, there are hmmm, LMM, RZ, RD, Bert that need a warrior? <br />

I should give up trying to convince anyone here that tanks are tanks.  When a tank is needed you call a tank.  If you want to go back to Kunark, where only the best of the best got any sort of use then I guess we'll just gloss over the fact that multiple classes suffered horribly so that a few could enjoy the cushy life.</div></div><hr />

You want a tank, you get a tank. Warriors and paladins should bring roughly the same power level to a group, but in different ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">No. The first choice for tank should be warrior.

<br />
Aye, I think this perhaps one of the best solutions. This kind of what is like for the priests right now. There is the specialist healer, who can do little else effectively, and 2 other priests who can heal, but shamans have another role which they are usually used for (slowing), and druids have enough flexibility that they can solo very well, and fill a few different roles, though they are restricted to certain zones if they want maximum power (i.e. have animals available).<br />
<br />
The danger with this is that specialization can be boring. I think many clerics would be willing to share their CH with druids and shamans if they were able to get a comparable amount of fleixibility and offensive power (like how many warriors feel about defensive). If all 3 tank classes could all tank effectively, but differently, with a few situations for which one class is more suited than the others, and all could also effectively serve other non-tanking roles, that could be just as good.</div></div><hr />

That's basically what I've been saying all along. All I would add from my admittedly biased perspective is that for general fights as opposed to specific special situations the warrior should have the mildly favoured 'package'. Not Kunark era supremacy by any stretch of some peoples imaginations but a mild advantage....Find an 'aggro control point'  that is considered balanced move knights and warriors both to that point (in my opinion it sits somewhere inbetween current warrior/knight aggro levels) and the extra hp/ac (and relative ability to attain it) of the warrior probably serves as that minor advantage I spoke of. make each class better at performing a secondary function and wah la....</div></div><hr />

Flat out, Slay Undead gives a 20% boost to DPS in normal areas.  Nothing seems to be any different in time.  It is entirely possible to get 7K slays with the weapons I know of and there is a hint that there is an even bigger weapon still undropped in Time.  Once again itemization messes with the game.<br />
<br />
You'll also note that traditionally Clerics do rotten damage with poor mana/damage ratios but they were able to open up with there Anti-Undead stuff too.</div></div><hr />

And the Kunark card gets played finally.  Please understand, no one here is trying to resurect Kunark.  We are mostly bouncing ideas around, trying to make everything work.

<br />
I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at here.   Are you saying that because it's PoTime that balance shouldn't be a factor?    Or that it simply isn't?   <br />
<br />
I'm a little perplexed because I was under the illusion that warriors were supposed to, or were doing approximately 20% more melee damage than non-SU paladins.  If the two statements were accurate, that warriors should and are doing 20% more melee damage than non-SU Paladins AND that SU Paladins do 20% more melee damage than non-SU Paladins, that we'd see a wash on undead mobs in terms of DPS.   <br />
<br />
Why aren't we seeing a wash?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Valeris, that is the point.  Time itemization is, well....off.  And once again Straight Melee are punished.  You can read all about on FOH since I don't have a real handle on it.<br />
<br />
Slays are more keyed to weapons than stats (not that it matter anyway...every melee should be hitting the 305 wall if they are tackling second wave + in Time).  If you gave a nowhere Paladin just a Time weapon you'll see obscene slays.<br />
<br />
So you can say &quot;Paladins do elite DPS with Slays&quot; but the fact still is its roughly 20%.  Is it a Paladin's fault that SOE screwed up again with itemization that hampers Warriors?<br />
<br />
ps. I don't see where else you want to go Red.  You want the only tank to be Warriors.  Its time to call a spade a spade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Liakim1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Hello warriors, yet another paladin here jumping into the lion's den, waving the white flag in an attempt to end the hostility.<br />
<br />
First of all, I started playing EQ when Velious was released.  I never experienced the 'Kunark era' aside from some remnant paladin jokes once in awhile, so I won't try to throw that towel into the ring.  I bought the complete EQ/Kunark/Velious pack, which came with a little player's guide.  If I may, I'd like to share two quotes with you.<br />
<br />
Paladin  - &quot;Paladins are the knights of Norrath.  Part Warrior and part Cleric, they survive attacks better than the other melee classes and hybrids.  Paladins have high hit points and can heal themselves when necessary.  This ability to tank and heal make the Paladin a very versatile character in any situation.  However, keep in mind a few things.  The only offensive spells a Paladin can use for most of his or her life are only effective against undead.  A Paladin can never summon food and water, and can never bind him- or herself - a Paladin is limited to getting a bind in select zones (usually city zones).&quot;<br />
<br />
Warrior  - &quot;Warriors are the epitome of a tank class.  They wield weapons in both hands, wear finely crafted armor, and can absorb massive amounts of damage.  Warriors do not possess magical abilities, making it difficult to heal without a healer.  To make up for this, Warriors get high hit points and armor class from the beginning.  As they gain knowledge of the arts of war, they acquire the skills of Bash, Dual Wield, Double Attack, Parry, Riposte, Dodge, and Disarm.  They are the only class that learns all of these combat skills, and they learn them sooner than any other class.  Overall Warriors are a fun, mighty class to play, allowing you to stand face-to-face with your enemy as you beat them to the ground.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had played numerous RPG's before EQ, and in all of them played a melee class - knight if it was possible.  So, after reading up on all the melees in EQ, I chose paladin.  Put 10 points in STR, 5 in WIS, and 5 in CHA (After all, knights should be strong, wise, and charismatic!)  I had never been to an EQ website (didnt know they existed) nor messageboard (again, didnt know there were any).  Point I'm trying to make is that I made a paladin because I wanted to be a paladin - not a warrior with a spellbook, not a cleric who could fight, but a holy knight that defended the weak and wronged injustices blah blah blah.  Terms like tank, DPS, raid, cc, etc etc were Greek to me.<br />
<br />
Bunnie Burner asked - <br />
Then WHY did you make a paladin? <br />
<br />
Thats why.  Not to be the premier tank, not so I could solo, because it most appealed to me.  And for 55 levels it wasn't a problem.  A tank was a tank was a tank.  PoP changed all the rules, I didn't.<br />
<br />
About utility - I agree 100% with all of you.  I bring tremendous amounts of utility to a group.  I love my near-instant healing ability, my ability to root-park, my ability to lay hands on the hottie enchantress and save her from death.  Fact of the matter is, I get groups because of my stuns.  If you want to take that ability away from me, take it - but I better hear you /ooc'ing 'Group looking for utility'.  <br />
<br />
I can solo somewhat, I agree 100% with all of you.  For extremely slow xp, bored silly.  I play EQ because I get the chance to play <br />
<br />
with other people, if I want to solo I'll play PS2.<br />
<br />
People ask if I am willing to give up my spellbook - hell yes.  If my spellbook is the difference between me paying 13 bucks a month and actually getting groups and having fun vice endlessly soloing light or barely blue mobs ad infinitum, wishing someone would actually invite me to a group.... take it, please.<br />
<br />
Knight agro 'dumbs down' the game - I agree 100% with all of you.  Let me ask you - do you want to grind 65 levels and 562 AA's where every second is on the edge of your seat, nail-biting, hair-raising, shit-your-pants terror?  I like that feeling sometimes, so I'll grab 5 buddies and go crawl a dungeon.  Sometimes, I just want to shoot the shit with guildies and crank out that 6 AA I need for my next ability that will make me more useful to my guild, so I'll head to PoV and mindlessly grind xp for a few hours.<br />
<br />
Experience penalty?  Am I somehow inferior to you?  Do I pay less for this game than you do?  Drop the warrior vs. paladin bravado for a second and tell me you are somehow better than me as a paying customer of Sony.  <br />
<br />
Knight agro is too powerful - I agree with this when I see level 65 paladins chaining Cease for agro.  To me it'd be like using a rusty short sword against a level 60 magic monster and being able to get agro - it does nothing whatsoever but the monster hates rust so it attacks you......  however, you take all agro away from knights to 'put them on equal footing as warriors' and I'll reiterate what Aeka said - we can all shoot the shit together with our LFG flags on, because groups will adapt and render tanks useless.<br />
<br />
I'd say 90% of paladins recognize there is a problem and fully support upgrades to warriors in the agro department, myself included.  Win-win situation for all of us.  You all are basing your opinion of paladins position on the matter on a few trolls who have a grudge against warriors, and a paladin who 3-boxes with a cleric/necro combo who wants to be in your 'cool club' so bad, he'll agree with anything you say and could give two shits what it does to the normal paladin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Liakim1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">As for the list of damage that Apothes so cleverly posted - <br />
<br />
Forgive me if I am wrong, but I thought the trials in PoTime were 6 events, 12 people max per event, to be done in a certain amount of time.  This data looks to me to be from a re-flagging event, since Borofin is using 'Terris in Time 2H'er' (which btw is probably Vanazir's Despair, 60/38 2HB, the best ratio'd weapon in game to my knowledge) which he could only have gotten if he had already passed the trials and gone onto PoTimeB.  I could be wrong, I'd like to see the entire post rather than just some numbers.<br />
<br />
So in one trial, a paladin using arguably the best weapon in the game came in 8th of 11 for total damage done.  In another he was 9th of 12.  In the Undead trial (where paladins are supposedly gods of DPS by your claims)..... paladins came in 4th and 5th out of 9, beating a rogue (must have been sleeping) a warrior and 2 clerics.<br />
<br />
Lastly, in the Innoruuk fight, which I assume is all raidmembers, no paladin shows up on the list as top damage dealers - it's wizards, mages, rogues and monks (and a druid somehow).<br />

SU3 either adds on average 20-25% damage or it doesn't. By it's nature, sometimes it will sometimes pump out huge numbers, and sometimes it won't fire at all. So either:<br />
1. SU actually gives about a 20-25% increase in DPS overall, and these numbers are an example of the RNG being very favorable<br />
2. SU gives more than 20-25% DPS increase, and paladins have been consistently misparsing their logs<br />
3. SU gives more than 20-25% DPS increase and paladins are lying and deliberately underreporting their DPS.<br />

<br />
Paladins for the most part have been dramatically underrepresenting their comparative damage to warriors.  <br />

Why is it ok to suggest making warriors acceptable outside of tank slots, but not pallies?<br />
<br />
I have never personally suggested changes to add utility or secondary abilities to warriors as a means to achieve balance, because it won't. You will never make a class desired solely for utility (including knights btw) unless that utility is something that is too powerful or borderline required (hello FD).  You don't get a rogue because he can pick locks unless you NEED a rogue to pick locks. It isn't a bonus to have it, it is either a requirement or not needed at all.<br />
<br />
The only true way to have balance between the 3 plate tanks is to have them be equally desirable to groups as a tank. The caveat to that is that SKs can do some decent DPS, but I don't know how it compares to the normal DPS classes. I'm guessing groups are still going to pick an SK either because they need a tank or because they need an FD puller, not because of DPS.<br />
<br />
My personal suggestions have been as follows:<br />
<br />
Lower the failure rate of taunt by about 1/3 and raise the  refresh timer to 10 seconds. Dramatically increases the success rate of taunt (from about 60% to about 87%) but penalizes those who don't use the taunt skill wisely. &lt;---- Personally, I much prefer solutions that allow the skilled warriors to stand out from the not so skilled warriors. Even the not so skilled warrior is going to aggro better in this case, just not as big of a jump as the skilled warriors. It would also allow much more successful use of the piggybacking technique. Slow aggro becomes a GOOD thing because it becomes a much more reliable launching pad for the warrior's aggro. <br />
<br />
In conjuction with that, successfully taunting could add an amount equal to taunt skill to the total hate, ie. top of hate list + 240. If the warrior is already at the top of the hatelist and taunts, he will still gain hate but at the expense of leaving himself without taunt for 10 seconds. That would be something that would reward those with good judgement. There is precedent for changing the skill like that. Evade is either -500 hate or down to second place on the hate list, whichever is a greater reduction in hate.<br />
<br />
Add &quot;stances&quot; that a warrior (hell, all pure melee) can move in and out of that change DPS and tanking ability. 3 Stances: offensive, normal, defensive. Offensive increases DPS by 10% but lowers tanking ability by 15%. Normal is self explanatory. Defensive increases tanking ability by 10% but lowers DPS by 15%. Have a timer on how often you can switch from stance to stance (30 seconds seems about right), and you can only switch to normal from either offensive or defensive, you can't switch from offensive to defensive. That would be a mechanism that would allow 1) increased burst damage for all melee classes 2) increase the stackability of warriors by at least a small amount. I'm guessing that with the recent weapon changes this isn't really needed for the 2 DPS pure melee classes, but warriors could sure use it. If it is set up so that you can't be in anything but normal stance to use a /disc, it wouldn't unbalance raid tanking to any large degree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I will cede the fact that a paladin wielding the best 2hander in the game with ALL his offensive AA's isn't gimp.<br />
<br />
With SU3, 305 STR and DEX, and against what I assume is all undead, this paladin nears 90% of a rogue output.<br />
<br />
I don't have SU3, nor do I plan to get it anytime soon, because there have been extensive parses at PoN that show it's really not worth 30AA to get for the 'average' paladin.  Slay acts as a 'chance' to greatly increase a critical blow, which with CF3 is still a small 'chance'.  RNG has to be very kind to first make the hit a full hit, then allow it to crit, then allow it to slay.  It doesn't just automatically give us 5k crits......  <br />
<br />
I am not saying that a paladin cannot add DPS to a group, but average everyday Joe Paladin DPS is pretty gimp compared to most everybody else out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1800.topic<br />
<br />
From looking through that thread, it looks like SU comes out to be about 20-25% of total damage, which is more than a 20-25% increase in DPS. If SU damage is 25% of total damage, that is a 33% increase in DPS (100/75=1.33). If it 20% of total damage, it is a 25% in total DPS(100/80=1.25). The parse in which SU makes up the highest percentage of total damage is 30%, which would be a 43% increase in DPS. Most of the parses seemed to be around 20-25% of total damage, so a 25%-35% increase in DPS.<br />
<br />
It seems like the % of DPS increase from SU has gone up with PoP. I would guess that is due in part to higher DEX achievable by players and lower AC of the mobs, along with possibly more ubiquitous +atk gear and buffs. <br />
<br />
I think I might have to reconsider getting SU. Unfortunately, none of the mobs my guild fights are undead.</div></div><hr />

I made my paladin long before there was anything like high end tanking. At the time, any class that could wear chain or better (or a monk) could tank reasonably well. I would likely have made a paladin even if paladins didn't tank well. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, group dynamics demand that a class fill a needed role. If there was a class that had every single skill in the game but could only do them half as well (at most) as the class that was best at that skill, they better be good soloers because they wouldn't get groups.<br />
<br />
Look at bards. The only reason they get groups is because some of the things they do they can do BETTER than any other classes and the things they do worse generally stack with the class that IS best. Haste? Bards can haste as well as an ehcnater by themselves, and can STACK haste when they are grouped with a chanter. Mana regen? Bards can manaregen faster than an enchanter AND it stacks with chanter mana regen. Damage shields? Bards are the best. Debuffs? Bard debuffs stack with everything and the debuffs are ALMOST as good. Resist buffs? Best resist buffs in game AND stacks with everything. If they truly were only half as good at all of those things AND those things didn't stack, they wouldn't get groups...ever. <br />
<br />
Bard slow doesn't stack with other slows. When your group needs a slower do you say &quot;we need a bard to slow&quot; or do you say &quot;we need a chanter or shaman&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Lower the failure rate of taunt by about 1/3 and raise the refresh timer to 10 seconds <br />
<br />
Surprisingly not far off from what I would like to see warriors get as part of balancing.  I support an increase in taunt success rate(probably a small increase), combined with a(again small) lowering of the refresh timer, possibly in combination with an aa to further lower it a bit more.  Exact numbers would have to be tweaked some, but I think that alone would make a huge difference, in part as you mentioned by using slow agro to piggyback agro.  It could even inmprove knight + warrior tanking(I love grouping with a good knight, they can make my life tons easier) as the knight grabs big agro on incoming, and the warrior piggybacks that.<br />
<br />
As far as the SU/undead damage available to pallies:  I am not saying that the parses on PoN lie, nor that the numbers Apothes provided are wrong.  I will say that pally DPS against undead does take a significant jump, and that the perception is that knights can be utilized as DPS against undead(more than once in either HoH or CoD have had groups grab pallies strictly for DPS).<br />
<br />
Bard slow doesn't stack with other slows. When your group needs a slower do you say &quot;we need a bard to slow&quot; or do you say &quot;we need a chanter or shaman&quot;? <br />
<br />
Actually, I have seen morethan once lately a seeming trend to grab bards for BoT groups as primary slower.  To be fair tho, we choose bard becasue they can do that, and slow, and haste, and...I have been so impressed with what bards can do at high end, made a bard alt, tho I doubt I will take her too far...damn that is alot of work.</div></div><hr />

There's no conspirationality involved.    It's no conspiracy to make assumptions out of ignorance and portray those assumptions as fact because they &quot;make sense&quot;, then to present a convincing argument which others accept as &quot;fact&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've seen lots of claims and percentages on the ol PoN board about melee damage relative to warriors, but VERY little in terms of substance, if any.   Do you remember when we had that little discussion where just about no one on that board believed that the skill caps difference on avoidance skills was not meaningful?   There was a LOT of accepting as &quot;fact&quot; that warriors had some extreme advantage due to higher avoidance skill caps, and no one believed me when I pointed out the difference in the level of tankability that this meant?   Even AFTER doing it, there were a bunch who still didnt' believe me.<br />
<br />
Then came skill mod items (such as the recent thread on the plate BP from time in their &quot;Lord Protector's Citadel&quot; board), and all of a sudden the value of skill differences was seen for what it really is.<br />
<br />
I believe strongly that the same thing occurs in terms of melee damage output.   <br />
<br />
Paladins tend to miss a lot...  so they assume that they're somehow alone in this.   Well, so do warriors, we tend to miss a lot too, but that tends to be overlooked.   I don't believe for a minute that there's a 20% damage spread between warriors and Paladins at similar levels of gear.    I'm just stubborn that way.   I've seen it too many times NOT to be jaded about people accepting the whole &quot;Higher Skill Caps&quot; thing as substantial proof of anything other than that people are good at guessing wrong.</div></div><hr />

Are you serious?  Is this why you made a warrior?<br />
<br />
In my handy little guide to EQ, nowhere does it say Warriors get groups easily, nor that they are 'loved'.  I can't even counter this statement, because I didn't start playing EQ to be loved.<br />
<br />
I made a paladin because I wanted to play a paladin.  If you made a warrior based solely on it being EASY to get groups and because you are loved, I can see where your animosity stems from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I made a Warrior because I wanted to play a Warrior.  Funny thing is though, I've found that as a Warrior I can't just go off and play.  I need a group to support me.  This nasty reoccuring problem where the mob I'm fighting insists on doing a higher percentage of damage to me than the percentage of damage I'm doing to him in the same time frame is just annoying.  If this goes unchecked, I suddenly end up someplace else, without my gear, and lower on experience.  It's not very productive.<br />
<br />
So, I need a group.  Which means that a group must need me, or they're not going to include me.  If someone else can pretty much do everything a group needs me for, and do it as well or better and do other things I can't do, then they're not very likely to want me, now are they?  And since that whole mob doing more damage thing is still there, I'm kind of left out in the cold, wouldn't you say?<br />
<br />
And that is the essence of the problem.</div></div><hr />

I really would like to hear your vision of where knights fit.  Some say utility, and with that I can agree, but as I've stated before, nobody looks for utility other than snare/sow/FD.

What I am suggesting, at least to a certain extent, is that maybe therein lies part of the problem.

What I think we are seeing is the effect of the significantly higher attack raitings of paladins in PoT over someone, say, like Romidar. The rangers (I think) have done some looking into damage vs attack and, what I am gleaning from it, without having seen it, is the bigger the potential range of damage, the more you get out of high attack ratings. Since SU has a HUGE damage range, it can benefit the most from the very hight attack ratings in PoT.<br />

I would be curious to knwo if any of the logs that PoN looked at inclueded any 'uber' paladins with maxed attack ratings.</div></div><hr />

Okies.. put back the XP penalty... (it was 40% more than a caster/druid by the way....  thats 155% more than warriors.<br />
then hybrids should be 155% better than warriors overall right?<br />
In the release we paid 155% to be like 10% better....  the removal of the XP penalty was wise...<br />
<br />
As it is, warriors have STILL paid less XP than knights... shouldnt knights be 111% better overall?<br />
of course, not a single warrior mentioned that.... it might hurt their whole &quot;poor me&quot; act.<br />
<br />
<br />
better to leave sleeping dragons lie....  warriors gain no ground by bringing up years and years of knights' experience of being not even 75% of a warrior....  even when we were paying more for the pleasure of being second-class characters in every way.<br />
<br />
ANYTHING that suggests knights become second class again is going to be shot down quickly.  Knights should be equivalent (counting their spells) in usefulness overall as a warrior.  Remember, our spells serve to AUGMENT our warrior abilties...<br />
Despite having an XP penalty... raid buffed warriors STILL have more HP, more AC, and disciplines that dont suck.  Warriors are still chosen time and time again for raid tanking...  the ONLY thing knights have right now to any real effect beyond warriors is causing aggro...<br />
<br />
once again...  I get tired of seeing warriors tell knights how good they are... and then have to come back to reality every time.<br />
<br />
Knights' spellbook is used to allow them to absorb damage near or sometimes ON the level of a warrior.<br />
<br />
Knights cannot cast as well as a caster/cleric and cannot fight as well as a warrior.<br />
<br />
Casting while being hit for 1000+ is very difficult...  casting while stunned is impossible...  you might notice that /disciplines keep working....<br />
<br />
Knights deal 20% less damage than a warrior in melee combat...  this is using the same weapons and equivalent gear... <br />
if you doubt it.. go parse it...  until you have some proof besides &quot;I don't beleive anything that doesn't help me make myself a god,&quot; you deserve to be ignored.<br />
<br />
note, this is IN MELEE.  Shadowknights outdamage warriors provided their damage spells land.... note once again that this is a shadowknight in full burn mode, with all damage spells memmed, and no tanking or taunt spells memmed, swinging and casting from behind where they are not being hit and a warrior swinging from behind and not getting hit.  This experiment was conducted while another Warrior with a BoW tanked btw...<br />
<br />
Knight spell &quot;utility&quot; is much vaunted by warriors looking to get an upgrade... and pretty much ignored in the group environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights are interchangeable in XP groups with warriors...  warriors could use a boost to hate addition in the pre-BoW part of the game to make it so they dont NEED to use EB weapons...<br />
<br />
I DO concede that warriors need something here...  and as soon as humanly possible.  Most experienced players will admit this.  <br />
Such an upgrade would have to take into account the power of raiding warriors...  note, I said take into account and not ignore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are indespensible on raids, and knights are useful, but not required.  Knights could use a simple tweak to allow transition tanking. (auto-block with shields.. give to warrior too.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Could warriors use a tweak for XP groups?  yes.<br />
Knights could use one for raids.<br />
<br />
there... balance restored.<br />

<br />
True, we do have those things, but note that warriors are not complaining much about their raid role, in fact, niether are most knights.  Both accept they have valuable contributions to make to a raid.  Mostly, we are talking about balance in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Knights cannot cast as well as a caster/cleric and cannot fight as well as a warrior <br />
<br />
Ummm...boo hoo.  Good god, what do you want?  To be every bit as good a warrior as a warrior, and every bit as good a caster as a pure caster?  Not going to happen.<br />
<br />
Casting while being hit for 1000+ is very difficult <br />
<br />
As Frodlin pointed out again, how hard you are hit has no affect on your channeling check.  Also, how many exp mobs hit for 1000?<br />
<br />
Knight spell &quot;utility&quot; is much vaunted by warriors looking to get an upgrade... and pretty much ignored in the group environment. <br />
<br />
So you never FD pull, you never snare, never 'mana tap'?  Of course you do.  Blantantly foolish comments like that just serve to make you look, well, foolish.<br />
<br />
Knights are interchangeable in XP groups with warriors <br />
<br />
No, knights are preffered in exp groups.  That is a significant difference.  While knights can tank nearly as well(you mention 'Knights' spellbook is used to allow them to absorb damage near or sometimes ON the level of a warrior'), you also have significantly higher levels of agro generation, plus utility that you do in fact use.<br />
<br />

So if you have all those spell utilities AND  an big advantage in those regions....<br />
Wouldn't you say it is fair that Warriors get an advantage Everywhere else?<br />
For the mere fact of being 100% dependent on other classes.<br />

Puhhleeez! Get real.<br />

You can't think of ANY situations in which a warrior has more than just &quot;equivalence&quot; with a knight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">*sigh* Its too bad some present a slightly wrong stance.<br />
<br />
The reason why I mentioned Kunark wasn't to invoke the Warrior's state in Kunark.  It was to present the problem of having &quot;the best&quot; run the show.  The feeling of uselessness no matter what tactic or what actions you take is something no class should have.  Including Warriors.  There is no justification for keeping Paladins behind Warriors.  There is no justification for keeping Warriors behind Paladins either.<br />
<br />
Simply put I wish everyone on both sides stop making the assertion that their class should do something better to keep the other in check.  Its not sound design since it leaves one side with abilities that &quot;are good but not quite good enough&quot;.  If a skill isn't viable then it is rarely used.<br />
<br />
There is nothing really different about SK or Paladin abilities.  Every improvement so far has been an extention and increased efficiency of skills, most of which have been defined in the class since the game's start.  Even Slay Undead is just an extention of anti-undead skills given since the beginning of the game.<br />
<br />
So this is the a huge oversight on SOE's  part when it came to Straight Melee.  So where are the Warrior's abilities to extend?  Why are so many of what should have been the &quot;Defensive AA Skill Set&quot; given out to every class?  Why don't Warriors have an skill or AA enhancements for each weapon type they can use?  Why are Warriors so limited in what they can actually do to any monster?<br />
<br />
Agro comes from taking detremintal actions against monster.  What exactly does a Warrior do that is so detrimental to monsters?  Damage?  Gee...every class can do that.<br />
<br />
Warriors can cling to the way they are right now if you want but I see it as dead end.  Warriors need skills that can grow with them as the game changes.  As expandsions continue to come, players expect to see their classes get enhanced.  If SKS and Paladins have several skills but Warriors have a few every then expect to keep falling behind.<br />
<br />
I don't believe specialization is the answer either.  Is the answer to slather on the HP and AC for Warriors?  Is the solution to let run of the mill warriors have 2000 AC and 14K HP?  If some think it is wise then I guess my assertion about exp groups is true contrary to the objections of those here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">The only 2 abilities that knighs have that actaully affect warrior group desirability are knights ability to take damage and their agro from spells.  As so many of you point out, currently utility does not get you groups(SK's it will occasionally).  To regain balance we need to either raise warrior agro or lower knight agro, or raise warrior mitigation(and your example of the 2000ac 14k hp warrior ilustrates the problem with this) or lower knight mitigation or some combination of those.  There are no other solutions to the basic issue(well, outside of stuff like exp penalties that we tossed around a bit, and I seriously doubt would ever be considered, and probably for good reason).<br />
<br />
You suggest giving warriors new skills, I am guessing to gain more agro with.  We have had the argument about whether high agro generation is a good thing for the game before, we both know where the other stands on it.  I do not think we are going to change our minds.<br />
<br />
One comment you made caught my eye tho.<br />
<br />
Why are so many of what should have been the &quot;Defensive AA Skill Set&quot; given out to every class? <br />
<br />
That is a good question, and part of the root of the issue.  Why have knights been allowed to become such good tanks that there is no penalty for using them in that role?  The defensive aa track certainly enhances a knights ability to tank, and is a good indicator of what I see as a big part of the problem.  Once you can tank well enough that mana(and sudden death) are not an issue, then tankability becaomes a nonissue in deciding what class to select for a tank role.  Adding more ac/hp's to warriors won't help, and will disturb raid balance.<br />
<br />
Sorry I don't have much really substantive to add today, just going to be one of those days I think.</div></div><hr />

at the price of sucking at both of them.<br />
<br />
Currently you're not sucking at meleeing, and you're not sucking at casting either.<br />
It's overpowered,<br />
it needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Gee thanks. We are supposed to suck. If we &quot;suck&quot; at melee and we &quot;suck&quot; at casting, put that together and we would still &quot;suck&quot;. That is EXACTLY what caused the problem of Kunark.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are the Specialist class.... what do you think that means?... that we should be just AS good as knights?<br />
<br />
As far as the total package, YES! Aeka had it right: the tank a group chooses should be the first one to show up. I support exactly that, but I don't support making warriors the first choice in tanking for xp groups, which seems to be what you propose.<br />
<br />
Here is a quote from someone else in this thread:<br />
i'm fine with knights being valid group tanks when a warrior isn't available.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your charity. I'm sure all those paladins will gush their thanks when the warrior sends them a tell &quot;I'm done for the night and there are no more warriors on, you can have my spot now&quot;.<br />
<br />
The argument seems to be that the situation is currently that groups will almost always pick paladin or shadow knight to tank for them over a warrior. You say that that is wrong (and I agree btw), but seem to think that it would be appropriate for that situation to be reversed.<br />
<br />

No, I have played since beta.  I want nothing based on the past except warriors to drop the whole &quot;XP penalty should be put back in&quot; idea.  It would have been fine if hybrids turned out to be superior in some way... but it didn't work out in the end, and warriors actually got screwed...  then they messed up and screwed hybrids by leaving it in when the hybrids weren't even as good as a warrior...  reading comprehension is a good thing.<br />
<br />

And the inverse is also VERY true... they can cast orders of magnitude better than warriors and can fight orders of magnitudes better than casters/clerics... so what exactly is the point of such tomfoolery?<br />

<br />
The point is that those &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; have not added up to jack shit until the warriors finally found something the knights were actually game-power-wise and group-position-wise better than them at... and now they want it nerfed.<br />
<br />
Warriors keep throwing the &quot;all that AND cast spells&quot; and have not a clue what our spells do...  they don't seem to get that our spells help us fill in the blanks that our low skillcaps leave.  The actual RESULT of our spells is a XP-group interchangeability and a raiding half-role....  warriors have the XP group interchangeability and a commanding position in raids.  Warriors want a little better piece of the XP group pie... Knights want a little better piece of the raiding pie.  A fair exchange I think.<br />

Hmm.. a warrior telling a casting class how channeling works?  entertaining...  Do this... go get a 65th level knight and cast non-damaging spells at an orc pawn while being beat on... see how many spells are interrupted.  Then go in a raid and cast spells while being hit for 1000+...  Then you won't have to trust my word that casting while being beat on is more difficult that casting when not being beat on.  Also, you might notice that higher level mobs STUN more.  Go ahead and try to tell me that you can cast while stunned...  the point isn't if you channel the spell, but if you actually get to cast it due to not being stunned or dead.  All things lucy will not teach you my poor casting-impaired fellow.<br />

Valeris only prefers I not say anything as he has yet to be able to think up anything intelligent to say to argue with me...  &quot;elitist&quot; is his word for &quot;more knowledgeable.&quot;  I still think he disagrees with me mostly because I am a knight...  but he forgets often that I am also a warrior...<br />
<br />
<br />
Redhenna...<br />
Warriors and Knights earn the same amount of XP in groups... we never did earn XP at 155% of the rate warriors did... not even in the old days.  In time investment, it took TWICE as long to get a troll shadowknight to 60 as it did to get a halfling warrior to 60.<br />
I think we both agree that the XP penalties were silly, and I actually do not care about the 10% bonus warriors get...  I simply wanted to lay some history for the newer warriors...<br />
<br />
our spells do not give us our identity...  our spell abilities combined with our warrior abilities do.  Harmtouch has just BARELY been pulled out of parlor trick status.  If a Shadowknight spends 42 AAXP on his Harmtouch and blows his discipine for the next 72 minutes, he can acomplish an uber 12000 (4800+7200) damage in 72 minutes.... thats less than a 3DPS upgrade.<br />
Knights are a combination...  you cannot separate the two sides or you get a whole lot of nothing.  This is the biggest problem warriors fail to understand.<br />
<br />
I want to be as useful as a warrior overall.  Better in some cases and worse in others.  Never forget that if I am lesser in some places, that I should be better in others.  This should be in overall game usefulness.  &quot;Being able to cast&quot; is not a fair place to be superior at.<br />
<br />
In X situation, you might want a warrior.. and in Y situation you might want a shadowknight or paladin instead.<br />
<br />
How hard mobs hit depends on where you XP/raid...  remember I do not seek XP group changes for knights... and even then... mobs stull STUN.  Frodlin keeps focusing on channeling when it is not the only factor.  I tell you...  it is much harder to CAST when being hit.  The harder the mob is, the less likely you will cast when being hit by it.  Stuns, being pushed back, being interrupted, fizzling, being killed all come into play.  As a hybrid who has played as long as I have, I would think it would be very difficult for anyone to claim more experience in this field.  I actually PLAY a hybrid on the balttlefield and cast whle being hit.<br />

I am NEVER chosen for a group because I can snare.... (my snare wears off very quickly and does damage /bonk lack of spell knowledge)<br />
I am never chosen for an XP group because I can FD pull now.<br />
(the idea is to bring mobs to camp as fast as possible...  harmony, mez, and recent canges to mob AI make FD pulling less necessary for XP groups...  of course. /bonk lack of experience with those spells/abilities.)<br />
I am NEVER chosen for the &quot;mana tap&quot; which isnt really a mana tap, its a HP tap which gives some mana as well.<br />
Knights are chosen as TANKS.  That is the slot we fill.  Not even shadowknights are chosen for damage roles unless there is no one else around.  Not even Paladins are chosen as group healers.  Are warriors chosen as the group's slower because they wield a weapon that procs slow?  No, but this is the same argument you present to the knights for their &quot;utility&quot;.<br />
<br />
I see warriors tanking when knights sit out...  I see knights tanking while warriors sit out.  When building groups, I choose warriors as freely as knights...  depending on where we are, what mobs we are facing, and what the group makeup is.<br />
<br />
Warriors do fine in groups...  or at least the warriors I fight with.  I still frequent pickup groups as well...  when you are clearing the mobs in the whole section of the plane you are in, it doesn't matter whether the warrior or the knight tanks...  and in the high end, this problem goes away. <br />
<br />
&quot;preferred&quot; in XP groups is not what I see...  of course, you could claim prejudice... but then again, so could I in your case.<br />
<br />
Let us remember that I do favor changes to Warrior aggro in the pre-BoW stages.<br />
<br />
<br />
Red, you only hate what I say so much because I bring up the holes in your arguement.  I bring a differnet (and sometimes disagreeing) view that most warriors hate as it stands against their conspiracy-theory level complaints.  I point out warriors' blatant lies and also some of their total ignorance.<br />
<br />
the players who play warriors and only warriors usually hate hearing what I have to say due to the fact that I bring a more balanced view of the game instead of the &quot;warriors should be gods over everyone else&quot; type attitude that is usually displayed here.<br />
<br />
Remember, I play a warrior.. and many other classes, and have played the game since beta.<br />
<br />
I welcome other views... but will continue to point out when you are wrong.  I don't really care if you like it or not.  Reality must eventually find its way to our casting-impaired warrior brethren.<br />

I will try this again, using smaller words so you understand.  The idea behind the exp penalty was that knights would be able to gain exp faster, due to having more options(soloing more effectivy for example).  As I pointed out, it did not work, and was scrapped.<br />

SK's are niether warrior, nor necromancer, they are simply SK's.  Your abilities(HT) and spells are part of that pacage, and are part of what defines your class.  As you comment 'you cannot separate the two sides or you get a whole lot of nothing. This is the biggest problem warriors fail to understand.'  I simply would have left out the 'useless drivel'(as you like to call it) with the random warrior insult.<br />

I do not think anyone here(other than possible a couple random flamers) has suggested you should be less usefull than a warrior, or any other class.  I have personally suggested that your usefullness be changed a bit, but not that it be reduced.  <br />
<br />
In X situation, you might want a warrior.. and in Y situation you might want a shadowknight or paladin instead. <br />
<br />
Wow, something I can actually agree with.  As long as warriors are getting groups at roughly the same pace as knights, these discussions would not be happening as much.  Thank you for pointing out the obvious.<br />
<br />
I actually PLAY a hybrid on the balttlefield and cast whle being hit. <br />
<br />
If you are having all the difficulties you claim, you must be one piss poor player, as I have watched knights cast with little difficulty while getting pounded on.  And if you want to make blanket statements like how hard you are getting hit affects your chance to channel, please provide a parse, as it goes against everything I have experienced and been told(and I in fact play a high level caster, and do at times have to get hit while I cast).<br />
<br />
I am NEVER chosen for a group because I can snare.... (my snare wears off very quickly and does damage /bonk lack of spell knowledge) <br />
<br />
Yes, I am aware that the darkness series does have limitations, but I can state for a fact, as I have seen it happen, that an SK will be chosen to join a group that is in need of a snarer.  They are not first chice for that role, but it does happen.  /bonk assuming I do not know how darkness works(remenber the ass of U and ME comment that goes with assume, except only U are the ass this time).<br />
<br />
I am never chosen for an XP group because I can FD pull now.the idea is to bring mobs to camp as fast as possible... harmony, mez, and recent canges to mob AI make FD pulling less necessary for XP groups... of course. /bonk lack of experience with those spells/abilities.) <br />
<br />
Again, I seriously doubt this claim, tho it may be true.  I know for fact again, that in the absense of a better pulling class, that SK's are in fact chosen to pull in some exp groups.  In fact, I know that darkness + FD can be a very powerfull tool.  You are right, FD pulling is not needed for most exp groups, but it is handy sometimes.  /bonk making yet another assinine assumption.<br />
<br />
Knights are chosen as TANKS. That is the slot we fill. Not even shadowknights are chosen for damage roles unless there is no one else around. Not even Paladins are chosen as group healers <br />
<br />
Part of what I have been talking about in this thread is the possibility of expanding knight utility, while reducing their tankability, with the hope of keeping them desirable in groups while providing more room for warriors.  We could potentially all come out ahead.  Not sure if it would work, but it is an idea I have been bouncing around.  /bonk not reading the thread you are throwing a fit about.<br />
<br />
it doesn't matter whether the warrior or the knight tanks <br />
<br />
Funny, most casters do think it matters, and you can find threads on this topic on most class boards.  <br />

Pallies and SK's are in fact unique classes in and of themselves.  Cleric/SK spells are part of the classes identity, but the spells are used for different purposes.  Whether this is by design or not I cannot say.  I still maintain that warriors should tank better than knights, not because we are a parent class, but because we are specialized in that role(cue Aeka's comments on specialization please:D ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">You mean that same tired 'just because you're specialized doesn't mean you should be better at (something) than me' nonsense again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">There is nothing wrong with the concept that Warriors should have enough of an advantage in the tanking functionalities to distinguish themsevles from the Knights.  While the Knights will always bring tanking+ to any situation.  If this led to a situation where, when a group was picking a tank and a Paladin and Warrior were standing side by side in almost identical gear, the group made a choice to take the Warrior because they invisioned single pulls, effective crowd control, adequate healing, and no undead in their hunting while they would pick the Paladin if they invisioned possible multiple pulls, questionable crowd control, less than ideal healing, and/or they planned on hunting undead, I see this as perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
These differences add the flavor to the different classes and should be acceptable, as long as, it doesn't lead to a situation where a Paladin shows up first to a particular zone and the group, not knowing when or if a Warrior may show up, decides to pass on the Paladin and wait for a Warrior anyway.<br />
<br />
There should not be a completely interchangeable sameness to the two classes.  There should be advantages to using a Warrior.  There should be different advantages to using a Paladin.  Neither advantage set should be enough that one or the other is utilized almost exclusively while the other is left begging.  And both should still be perfectly viable even in those situations where normally you'd prefer the other.<br />
<br />
To me, this is balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">/agree Glatius with one proviso - I  would argue that differences in aggro should not exist or at best be minimal,  it's too fundamental an advantage when the classes involved have relative parity in survivability as Pop has shown rather handily :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">/agree Val<br />
<br />
No matter how it sounds, I really don't have a problem with knights and warriors being interchangeable. I just don't think that warriors should be on the bottom of the heap when it comes to aggro generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">I continue to feel that anybody that believes we will ever have full parity between the three classes for the role of tank is hoping for a situation that will never be more than theoretical - the numbers of each class competing for that role are greater than the grouping opportunities, (thus my support for meaningful secondary abilities). <br />
<br />
In such situations a value judgement as to whom is the 'best' is always likely to occur. Since knights have gained 'fringe benefits' (in and out fo combat) from their spellbooks throughout their career it only seems fair that the minor advantage should stand with the class that has 'sacrificed' most for the role. <br />
<br />
It's by no means a perfect solution but if we accept that someone has to 'lose out' then how can anyone justify it being joe Warrior? /shrug</div></div><hr />

To put it another way, Paladins and SKs bring to exp groups the ability to tank + something else.  Warriors should be the same: Warriors bring the ability to tank + something else.<br />

I'm not even for giving warriors superior abilities (secretly I might like that, but it would break too many things). What I'd like is to have even close to the aggro generation of a knight. As it stands, I don't have anywhere near that.<br />

And is it necessary to remind who is best in Group Situations? <br />
<br />
We gave up broad abilities for specilization.  Within that specilization, yes we should be the best, because we've sacraficed the broader abilities for that advantage.  However, this shouldn't be a situation where the Paladin gets shafted everytime a Warrior happens to be around.  Certainly they have broader abilities, but that doesn't warrant their not having a reasonable chance to participate in the game like everyone else.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not describing the current situation, because we all know, if we're willing to be honest, that it isn't that way currently.  I'm talking ideally, a situation we may never in fact see.  Be that as it may, Warriors should tank better than a Paladin by enough of a margin that it compensates for our lack of broader functionality, but not to the point that people will take a Warrior first under every single possible circumstance.   That's not reasonable.<br />
<br />
There should be circumstances where the Paladin edges out the Warrior.  There should be circumstances where the Warrior edges out the Paladin.  I'd even argue that those circumstances where the Warrior edges out the Paladin should probably be a little more numerous than the reverse, but not by a huge margin. <br />
<br />
Now, does that mean we won't be able to do somethings that the Paladins will because we are restricted by our class?  Certainly, but that is the price we pay to be a specialist.  But also keep in mind there are things that Warriors have going for them that Paladins don't.  An example, I find I'm double boxing a lot these days, since PoP is so hostile to Warriors.  And I use a trudgeon of doom a lot, a weapon that procs a 50% slow.  How many slow procing weapons exist for a Paladin?  Fewer than for Warriors.  There is one of our subtle, not brought up a lot, advantages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knights in decent guilds already do at least the same if not better dps then warriors. With the new knight only 2hs added to time they will do more dps, all the time. Paladins already can stack the best combo of hp/ac buffs of ANY class in EQ on raids, further eroding any hp-gap that exists. Coupled with the retarded itemization in POP (which started in Velious and Luclin) where knights have access to every single piece of plate gear that warriors do ... the hp gap is tiny, there is NO ac gap at all and basically what we are left with is defensive/evasive vs a knights spellbook, 5000mana, ft15, focus effects and vastly better agro control.

All things lucy will not teach you my poor casting-impaired fellow.<br />
<br />
Brik,<br />
<br />
You can try to pull the wool over some peoples' eyes but it's not gonna cut it with me, period.   Spell interruption is based on X/Y movement and has *nothing* to do with how hard something is hitting you for.   Just a little hint for you... I don't only play a warrior, and know this pretty intimately.    The reason that you get interupted more by experience mobs as opposed to an orc pawn has --0-- to do with how hard you're being hit, but with how often you are moved in an X/Y direction.   The more often you're hit, the more chance of movement, and therefore a spell interruption, which is why you'll channel through an orc pawn more than a Doomfire Guardian.   You're missed FAR more often.   <br />
<br />
Having said that, there are many mobs who hit softer who have greater likelihood of hitting you and therefore a greater chance to interrupt.   Of course, someone with your vast experience should know this, but I guess you are too busy copying and pasting &quot;reading comprehension is good&quot; to actually be paying attention.<br />
<br />
Stuns happen... when a mob lands a bash on you.   A mob with a greater likelihood to land a bash on you will likely stun you more often.    You dont' get stunned from regular hits.   So, do mobs who are closer to your level have a greater chance to land a bash on you, therefore interruping you?  Of course you do.... but... we're going full circle back to the fact that it does NOT matter how much you're hit for.<br />
<br />
Do you get interrupted?  Of course you do.   Does it cripple you?  ROFL no, it doesn't, if it did, you'd not be able to have such godly aggro.</div></div><hr />

I frequently use my eyepatch when meleeing, even when I'm tanking. I lose no dps doing so, and if I time my casts right, I can sneak them in between hits, especially on slowed mobs. Brik may have a lot of time on his hybrid; it's too bad he has learned so little in the process. If he can't figure out how melee casting works, or why an orc pawn is less likely to interrupt him than an elemental mob... <br />

Its no big secret that Hybrids fizzle a lot more than casters.  When I say a lot more I mean like a lot.  Also there it is truth to the fact its hard to cast in the face of monsters.  However Brik overstates the issue.  Burning extra mana is a price to pay for tanking and is continually bared by SKs and Paladin day to day.  Mana is lost but its managed all of the time since SKs and Paladins use different spells while tanking and not tanking.</div></div><hr />

At the risk of venturing farther off topic:<br />
<br />
Here is a last parse during a fast raid run.<br />
<br />
129 spells total cast.<br />
8 fizzles.<br />
9 interrupts.<br />
Success ratio = (112 / 129) 0.868217054263566<br />
<br />
I've run longer and shorter parses but about an 85% success ratio is typical.  Runs range from 90% to 60%.  Do you have 1 in 10 of your eye patch clicks fail let alone in or out of combat?<br />
<br />
You are just plain wrong if you claim just because you can click a 3 second spell every once in awhile that spell casting in combat is fullproof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u209"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p209">85% success ratio is hardly a low ratio, wouldn't you agree?  Hell, I'd love it if taunt had an 85% ratio or if my weapons proced 85% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u210"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p210">Hah, 85% success rate sounds pretty good to me lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u211"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p211">That 85% success ratio if how often the spell actually gets cast, not how often the spell is successful...2 different things. Here's a parse of myself in an xp group today:<br />

Successful: 416<br />
Fizzles: 32<br />
Interrupts: 52<br />
Channels: 76<br />
Resists: 102<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that 155 of those &quot;spell casts&quot; were actually from my proc buff, Pious Might. There were 23 resists of Pious Might. The proc buff cannot be interrupted or fizzled, so it skews the numbers a bit. Removing 155 from casts and 23 from resists gives:<br />
<br />
Casts: 523<br />
Successful: 284 (think YALP screws this up, should be 360)<br />
Fizzles: 32<br />
Interrupts: 52<br />

Resists: 79<br />
<br />
20.6% Interrupts or Fizzles.<br />
<br />
I was tank a little more than half the time, so interrupts (and channels) are lower than if I had been tanking the whole time.  The caveat to that is that I cast much less often when not tanking, so it probably didn't skew the numbers that much.  8 of these casts were BSS and a few casts (guessing 10-20 or so?) were heals cast when I wasn't tanking. EDIT: Just found the numbers on heals...17 casts of light of nife and 17 casts of my HoT. I wasn't tanking when I cast those.<br />
<br />
Just for Tugurok...I didn't cast anything besides a stun the whole time I was tanking, except BSS. ;) EDIT: take that back, I cast 1 heal on myself to top myself off. (was full mana and no point in stunning again...I gotta use the mana somehow)<br />
<br />
That comes out to about a 69% success rate, counting resists as failures.</div></div><hr />

You have to admit that THAT is a bit overpowered...<br />

If either of those classes is left out of a round of upgrades they will complain and rightly so. They are playing what they want to play. <br />
<br />
   If warriors get a massive overhaul to compete with the agro aspect of other tank classes then they will end up overpowered in other areas prompting complaints from all over. This is a hard if not impossible scale to balance due to how far this game has evolved from its original state. <br />

   Warriors want to control agro they should gripe about needing more EB weaps to do so. SOE  always reads the boards to see what their game is doing ya know.

<br />
EB is a crutch, and usually worthless during the time when aggro is essential, the beginning of the fight.  Very rarely will you get a proc off the bat.  Not to mention, still being a slave to the RNG.  If it decides that we shouldn't proc, then it is useless.  We want something that makes it so it takes SKILL to keep aggro, not luck.  Because there will always be times when you are unlucky, and then as a warrior, people die.  As opposed to a knight who has aggro on command, so they don't have to worry about a streaky RNG.  Also needing EB weapons makes a good majority of warrior weapons worthless.</div></div><hr />

Again, you continue to overestimate knight spells as to their utility to a group.  I don't think you will ever want to understand, so you never will.<br />
Are the spells useless? NO.  but they do NOT define another role to a group.  Knights are tanks and not much else to a group.<br />
Your arguments have become circular... so I will simply refer you to my earlier posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frodlin...  First I say that casting while being beat on is MORE than just channeling... and then YOU say that interrupts are more due to X/Y changes... <br />
<br />
We just said the same thing...<br />
<br />
Yes, I CAN cast while being hit...  (I never said I couldn't!) I cast LESS WELL when i am being hit than when I am not being hit...  are you really disagreeing with me or just being argumentative?<br />
I cannot tell you how many times I have died or scraped death due to being pushed/stunned/interrupted/fizzled/etc out of a Feign Death/Death Peace.  Do post your parses on how well your hybrid casts while being hit...  until then my experience outweighs your theories.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways...<br />
<br />
I think the problem is in the difference of how knights and warriors define &quot;balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors seem to ME to think they must be better at everything overall than knights to be balanced.<br />
<br />
Knights believe &quot;balance&quot; to mean being better in certain situations and lesser in others.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights are already second fiddle to warriors when it comes to a raid...  and except for warriors who cannot find a BoW, they are just as good as knights in XP groups.<br />
(remember, I am for changes to aggro additions for warriors...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Note, that as raiding is a MUCH larger part of my playing, that my raid role holds a much larger weight for me.  I understand that someone who is not raiding much might feel differently.<br />
<br />
Note, that once raiding, you might be more likely to share my emphasis on raid roles (if not my opinions).<br />

The problem is viewpoint.<br />

Pardon me, but that's one of the stupidest ideas I've heard in a long time.<br />
<br />
As much as I hate to agree with Brik about anything, I too spend the vast majority of my time raiding. Our knights don't tank until the warriors are all dead, and by that point it is only to buy 1 more round for the DPS to try and burn the mob down and/or the clerics to camp out. That likely colors my outlook on the situation.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for making a judgement without knowing the situation.<br />
<br />
EVERYONE in the group with a mana bar was pretty much FM all night, and I don't believe anyone dropped below 3 bubbles of health all night. We had an enchanter and a bard for mana regen. We were fighting mobs that were completely trivial to us (south wing of BoT), just trying to grind out some xp. Since the cleric only had to cast 1 SE on whoever was tanking per mob, what would there be for me to heal? hint: paladins efficient heal is a heal over time that doesn't stack.<br />
<br />
The only other thing I can really do with my mana in a fight is stun. With the group I was in (me, warrior, bard, chanter, ranger, rogue), whoever was tanking didn't need much of an aggro lead. When I first got there, the warrior was tanking and was doing just fine with aggro. The only one he lost aggro to was ME because I have no way of shedding aggro and got DPS aggro a few times. He wanted to do more DPS with his 2 boxed shaman (out of group) so asked me to tank. If I hadn't been tanking, I wouldn't have had shit to do with my mana. I had tried throwing a heal on the warrior now and then, but got &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot;.<br />

You could have done what the warrior does when not tanking....<br />

Warriors need special attacks to increase their versatility, not more of the same to further specialize them into a better meatshield.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of level-based abilities (perhaps improved through AA) that a skillful warrior can choose from depending upon the situation.  Add a special attack that can stun (and causes appropriate aggro if it hits), another that can slow 20% (stacks with nothing), another that causes excessing bleeding (DoT damage), etc.  Then warriors will not just be better tanks, but will have more solo/duo options, and will have something to bring to groups other than tanking.<br />

Hyper-specialization leads to 'ideal' group combinations, instead of class balance.  Warriors need a broader set of skills.</div></div><hr />

Your clerics need to adjust the CH rotation for pallys that is all you can tank most the damn mobs in the game without dieing as long as you have clerics that can count to 2 (not so sure about that though after reading what you posted).<br />
<br />
Don't raid much do you? <br />
<br />
Bunnie:<br />
Graal.....<br />
when you were tanking in that group... what was the Warrior doing?<br />
<br />
I find it funny that you find it's unfair that you can't use your mana while in a group..<br />
when warriors dont even have any mana to use.<br />
<br />
The warrior asked me to tank so that he could get more DPS out of the shaman he was 2 boxing out of group. I don't know if you've ever played a shaman before, but to get the most out of them requires constant micromanagement. If you aren't nuking or dotting, you need to be casting cannibilize. A shaman that just sits and meds has less than 1/3 the mana regen rate of an actively played shaman. The warrior didn't have a very good 2 box setup and it was easier for him to handle the shaman if I was tanking. THAT is why the warrior wasn't tanking. He still tanked on occasion. He was a guildmate and we didn't get into a dick waving match. Whoever had aggro had aggro. <br />
<br />
I understand your reasoning about warriors not having mana, but keep in mind my spells are part of my balance. If I'm not casting, I'm essentially a warrior with lower hp and a 6-8% lower hit rate. I will give you one thing: the warrior was duel wielding for aggro purposes and I would occasionally pull DPS aggro off of him &lt;--- that is wrong. Warriors shouldn't be handicapped in the DPS department by having to use inferior DPS weapons for the proc. <br />
<br />
BTW, just my opinion, but I really think more warriors should just go for higher DPS. DPS is solid, reliable aggro. Almost all of the warriors I see do all of their defensive AAs first. The ones I know with good offensive AAs don't have problems with aggro, and they do very good DPS. <br />
<br />
Brik, as far as that BoW comment...kindly go suck eggs. We only 1 in my guild and it's not for lack of trying. Sometimes you get the booby prize...and sometimes you get it multiple times in a row.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apothes, you started the personal attacks, so don't act so much holier than thou.<br />
<br />
And while yes pallys can be kept up on mobs that don't one round them, by the time it gets to where the pallys are tanking, you don't have time to switch to a new tank for the ch chain.  Usually at that point the shit has hit the fan, so the pallys are just making sure that the clerics can camp, since they can't switch and suddenly have their chs landing.<br />
<br />
Graals post wasn't much of a personal attack either, as most people who raid usually understand the concept that it's difficult to switch tanks without already having started the chain on the new tank.  Sudden change, plus not having def, makes it so the pallys fall before the heals can land if you are on a more difficult mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u236"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p236">Red... no no no no and no... the DEGREE of what you say is wrong and thus the spirit. Again, you continue to overestimate knight spells as to their utility to a group. I don't think you will ever want to understand, so you never will. <br />
<br />
Brik, go back and read my posts from this thread...the ones before you came along(I know, the idea anyone other than you having anything worthwhile to say is hard to believe, but just this once...).  You will see that I have said, and more than once, that knight utility as it currently is is simply not enough to balance things out if warriors where significantly better tanks.  If you are going to come along and atttack us, at least read what we are saying first before descending down from your olympian hights to grace us with your comments.<br />
<br />
As much as I 'overestimate' your utility, you continue to downplay it.  You whine about how hard it is to cast while tanking, then 2 knighs here posted parse results showing about 80 % success rate.  Are you simply not as talented casting?  A warrior states he can cast his eyepatch of plunder in combat with some success, are you less able to time your casts?  The really funny part is that, after 2 parse results on casting success were posted, you asked to see parses...do you actually bother to read what people are saying?  Sounds like not to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't care much about the reason (although in this case, it proves an imbalance, since a paladin was more use to the group then the warrior)...<br />
<br />
What I was asking, was what the Warrior was doing while not tanking.<br />
Paladins are saying how it's unfair that they can't do anything other then tank, that no one likes them for their Utilities....<br />
But it's exactly the same thing for warrior... actually, even worse!<br />
<br />
Yes, paladin spells are part of the balance, ive been trying to convince other paladins of that a lot. But they just won't listen.<br />
A lot of paladins want the Tanking part balanced equally, without even taking into notion the fact they have spells.<br />
Which is find pretty annoying. They act as if their spells mean nothing.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a fix mainy based on DPS as well,<br />
but to make warriors balanced vs Knights by upping their DPS,<br />
one would have to bring Warrior DPS up to Rogue level.<br />
And at the same time up rogue/monk DPS.<br />
<br />
That's one fix I wouldnt mind at all.</div></div><hr />

You are completely misunderstanding the situation. No one asked the warrior to stop tanking. He was not having problems with aggro. &quot;since a paladin was more use to the group then the warrior&quot; Change that to &quot;since a person devoting all their time to positioning on one toon is better at positioning than someone who is devoting most of their time to another toon&quot; <br />
<br />
That xp session is about the worse case scenario you could bring up, since 1) the warrior was tanking JUST FINE and 2) the only reason he stopped tanking was so that he could devote more time to another toon. I didn't tank any better, it was simply a matter of convenience for him to not have to constantly position the DC pet and shammy pet on the backside of the mob while also trying to run his shaman. I really don't see how that &quot;proves an inbalance&quot;. Maybe I'm missing something obvious...can anyone else point it out to me? <br />
<br />
The warrior was doing DPS while tanking...and sending in his shaman's pet, and nuking, and crippling, and cannibilizing...<br />
<br />
He still tanked the named and most of the krigers just because he did it better than I did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paladins are saying how it's unfair that they can't do anything other then tank, that no one likes them for their Utilities....<br />

<br />
With warriors having to rely on lower DPS weapons for aggro, I agree with this to some extent. It is harder to get 2 good aggro DW weapons AND a good DPS setup. It shouldn't be that way though. Warriors should be able to use the best DPS weapon they can get. Aggro procs should be a bonus, not a requirement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u239"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p239">I don't know if this was brought up in any of the previous 230 something posts but how hard could it be to change warriors taunt ability to a &quot;Taunt over Time&quot; effect? Same principle as DoT spells, adds certain amount of aggro per tick. Just a random thought running through my random mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u240"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p240">Aggro procs should be a bonus, not a requirement. <br />
<br />
Thats one thing that I agree wholeheartedly with.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have warrior aggro like knight aggro is now, far from it.  I want there to be actual skill to keeping aggro, which there isn't much of for knights or warriors.  I want to know that if I am one of the people who puts a lot of time and energy into learning how to play my class, that I will be able to keep aggro using those skills.  And people who don't take the time to learn still get stuck with aggro problems, because everyone should have to learn how to play.<br />
<br />
I do agree with Graal about the exp group though.  The warrior was the one who asked not to tank, so that he could pay more attention playing the shaman, thats the only reason.  Though it is true that a non tanking warrior is of less use than a non tanking knight, imo anyway.<br />
<br />
Which is another thing I'd like to see, warriors having some utility.  Preferably in a way that doesn't step on others toes.  That is my problem with more dps.  As it is now, I don't think monks are ahead of warriors much dps wise (parses done by a monk in my guild showed me a bit close to his dps).  Though, since melee have been getting the shaft in PoP, I'd be happy to see rogues, monks, and warriors getting a boost to dps, and knights getting a somewhat smaller boost.<br />
<br />
Zinj, taunt over time actually has been brought up, first by Furor, and is actually one idea I really like.  It would have to have a damage component to it though, even if slight, so you can't do it to a mez'd mob and gain aggro while the mob just sits there doing nothing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u246"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p246">Going back to the discussion of raid role that popped up earlier, I think that just because knights don't get used as boss mob tanks they think they dont have a raid role.<br />
<br />
In my guild we have 8 warriors and about 5 of each SKs and Paladins.  As warrior #7 my raid role for the most part is to sit at the end of the tank list and occasionally shield an enchanter or cleric on a large pull during clearing.<br />
<br />
Some knight raid roles I can think off:<br />
1. Clearing tanks - everywhere but the elementals we will use a knight as often as a warrior to tank while clearing.  Some zones we exclusively use knights over warriors.<br />
2. Add tanks - there are alot of encounters where we use knights as crowd control tanks.<br />
3. MT - there are mobs that we exclusively tank with knights.  Not many but they are out there.<br />
4. Pulling - we use Pallys and SKs as DA pullers to position boss mobs.  SKs also FD pull.<br />
5. SK Group taps - Every rogue wants an SK in their group, damn ATK junkies.  Much &lt;3 for Zevfeers from the casters too.<br />
6. Paladin Group heals and spot heals - pretty self explanatory.<br />
7. Brells - can't say I'd want to be a buffing class, but its one more thing a pally brings to a raid.<br />
8. Remove Greater Curse<br />
<br />
Knights and warriors have different raid roles.  Yeah there are lots of mobs we do that we don't use knights to tank, but knights have alot of roles on raids, warriors have one.<br />
<br />
I think raids are pretty balanced, sure warriors have the glory spot but thats their raid role as a specialist class.  Knights have utility and as a result they have several roles, some of which other classes can do too, and some of which they do better than everyone else.<br />
<br />
There are lots of warriors who arent in guilds, lots of warriors in guilds that only raid casually.  So because of their one raid role which the majority of warriors don't regularly experience, these warriors should be less appealing to a group than a knight?  I don't buy it.  <br />
<br />
I think there is balance in raids and there needs to be balance to groups aswell.  Groups should be saying &quot;we need a tank to fill the tank spot&quot; not &quot;we need a knight to fill the tank spot&quot;.  I have no problems with not getting a group because theres a pally there with equivilent gear LFG,  but to have a knight of lower level or much worse gear chosen over me or to not get a group because the group is holding out for a knight just shouldn't happen.<br />
<br />
I'm not of the school that thinks the warrior should be the best group tank period, and I don't really want to see the lines between the tank classes blurred - a pally is a better tank if your main healer is a druid because of additional buffs and rez, an SK also brings FD pulling, mana regen and snare, a warrior brings better mitigation and a little more DPS.  None of the tank classes should be undesirable for that role however and at the moment thats how some people see warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know you have this fetish with stuns and aggro, but I'll let you in on a little secret: stuns do more than just aggro! In fact, aggro isn't even the primary reason I cast stuns! WoW! Can it be?<br />
<br />
You have this fixation on the aggro produced by stuns. I'm far more concerned with the STUN effect produced by stuns. If the mob goes running off after the slower, I stun it, which stops it (barring resist) from attacking the slower. If a mob is running and we don't have a snarer, I stun it to keep it from running for a few seconds. If a mob is casting, I stun it to interrupt. <br />
<br />
You look at stuns in the only way you know how: aggro. I don't. Aggro is a secondary reason for a stun, which is often detrimental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">Which is all stuff that is WAY beyond the scope of a warrior's abilities. If we don't have a snarer, we chase the mob down; if a mob is casting, we have to try desperately to push it or pray to the RNG that our kick or slam interrupts it; if a mob runs after the slower, we pray to the RNG that our taunt button works.<br />
<br />
Plus, if you can stun as often as I've seen pallys in my groups stun, our marginal mitigation difference is negated if not exceeded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">a warrior brings better mitigation and a little more DPS <br />
<br />
Where does this leave the idea of paladin's as the &quot;defensive tank&quot; and shadowknights as the &quot;offensive&quot; one?<br />
<br />
I feel that (in raids at least) maybe I should outdamage a warrior... my melee should of course be sub-par to a warriors but adding in dots, and nukes maybe I should be doing more dps overall (here I'm subject to the same limitations as casters... the possibilty of over aggroing and getting splatted). I'm not really called upon to be add tanking or MA for clearing.<br />
<br />
For paladins, &quot;defensive&quot; translates into their group healing, individual heals and cures.</div></div><hr />
