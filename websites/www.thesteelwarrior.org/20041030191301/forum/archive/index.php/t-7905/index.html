<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tsunami[mm]</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been a lurker for a while but finally thought that it was time I asked for some gear advice...my current budget is ~4.5k, so I cannot afford anything that is really expensive, but some ideas on what to work towards would make things easier  :)<br />
Right now I think that the huge ones are haste (don't know what to go after :/ )  and some new boots. If there is anything that I could camp with some friends to grab some experience while hoping for an item drop would be great (Probably want to be 62+ though). Here is the magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1036057 <br />

Any help would be great :)</div></div><hr />

Im not sure how good the duel red epic combo is, so maybe look at finding an alternative primary to startwith with a better ratio but still with an agro proc.  If you can squeeze into a BoT tower raid once you are 62 then a GreatBlade of Storms would be a perfect weapon for you, Copper hammer of Striking is a good option too which you could camp with a couple of friends in droga if you can't get one to drop in the bazaar.  CHSD from Xanamech in PoI is another good option and possibly obtainable via pickup raids.<br />
<br />
Other than raid drops your progression is really ornate -&gt; Hard LDoN drops for most gear.  Once you can group in BoT camping or saving up for Ornate legs would be a good start.  Ornate Boots and Arms are more expensive than they are worth so Elbow Spiked Armplates and Bloodied Boot of something (from LDoN Hard) would be better options.<br />
<br />
Start doing LDoN adventures aswell.  The plate from Everfrost at ~700points/piece is great value and would be a good upgrade for you, the ~1400point gear from Tak is nicer but alot more expensive, really depends how much time you have to put into it.</div></div><hr />
