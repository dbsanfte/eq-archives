No need to enlighten us on that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raex BP doesnt &quot;suck&quot;. Its effect is an upgrade to our biggest weak point(agro generation).<br />
<br />
To answer the original posters question IMO the Raex BP is a bigger upgrade to a warrior than the paladin BP is to a paladin. <br />
<br />
Experienced paladins probably already have Marrs Gift from Xegony ring(or similar, forgot if there are more they can use). <br />
<br />
So the jump from a +0-(20-25)% heal to a +0-30% heal (marrs blessing) isnt that big, and doesnt compare with going from +0% agro to +15% agro.<br />
<br />
However, given the current state of the game I think the balance between these two BPs are appropriate. The paladin BP simply serves as a straight up HP/AC/Resist upgrade, whereas the Warrior BP serves as a band-aid fix for our agro issues. Not the right way to fix it imo, but thats a totally different discussion, at this point I think warriors are willing to take whatever agro bonus they throw our way heh.<br />
<br />
Although they could have been a little more creative with the paladin effect I suppose, but then again.. who cares.. paladins have nothing to complain about atm imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Statswise, war/pal/sk ALL got the short straw. Pally/sk should be 230-250hp plus equivalents, warrior should be 270-300hp. Not gonna cry over 50hp though, the effect more than makes up for that.<br />
<br />
Balanced to the warrior one alone? Maybe, though I'd prefer a slightly bigger hp gap to compensate for having no mana. <br />
<br />
Balanced between the warrior and other BPs? Yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
effect on pal BP is nice since its one of two items in game for paladins that has it.. its not a stellar upgrade tho since arms have 20%<br />
<br />
Pal BP should give given Raex BP Stats + Mana along with 50+ Atk (all time bps need some atk imo) 5% shielding<br />
<br />
War BP should be given like 125 AC and 285 HP 8% shielding...</div></div><hr />
