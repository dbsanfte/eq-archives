I have noticed that the returns on pd are quite meager (maybe 70 hp...) for 3 aa.  So what next?  Now I think LR5 pd3 and cm3 are at the top of the list but as I hate to grind exp that is allot of AA so which will give me the bigest return for MTing on raids?  Or do you guys know of one I missed that I should realy get?</div></div><hr />

How many 70hp upgrade items could you camp in the few hours it takes to gain 3aa in a decent group? How many of those items will never be upgraded making that time useless? The good thing about AA is that they'll be serving you now and still serving you when you're fully equipped in PoTime gear. Try thinking of LR AAs are avoidance mods from PoTime items and ID as shielding mods for example.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of threads here about AA order preferences, and there's no 'correct' version. I just wanted to give you another slant on grinding exp so it appears a little more attractive and short term beneficial than an unending grind</div></div><hr />

CS3, LR, ID, PD3, then you can start on the fun stuff.  I agree with you, I find PD disapointing, and am noticing a nice difference with LR(at LR3 currently).  There is no true right path, this is just mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd estimate the gains from PD3 comparable to gains from the other PoP defense AAs.  Since you're probably not at a level where you have so much HP such that mitigation/avoidance becomes more important, I'd recommend getting HPs first since at your level the gains in tanking is similar but HPs have the added bonus of working against spells as well whereas mitigation/avoidance do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Demogorth I see your point, but I was wondering, for example, if CS1 would perhaps be a better call then PD3.  An extra 70hp per CH vs taking 2% less damage per hit.   I know there are lots of threads on this issue but many of them seem a bit too general for an answer I was looking for. <br />
<br />
As far as my level of play, I am 65 and buff up to 7.7k to 7.9k depending on the raid (pot9 line vs virt, ect..) and have been doing Tmax level mobs.  Planning on hitting up the AoW soon.  It isn't that I absoultely hate grinding and won't do it but I seem to find myslef raiding far more then grinding and would like to keep it that way.  So assumeing I am only going to get 2 or 3 aa a week then what would help the clerics heal me as a Raid Tank better?<br />
<br />
Our guild won't have 10 clerics when we do AoW, likely we will have 3 or 4 for me and some druids for the rampage.  In this case would CS1 provide them with more mana then PD3?  Or would LR1 out stripe them both?  In two months this will be a moot point but for now my guild is looking to step it up a notch and I want to use AAs in the best ways posible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way to answer questions like is CA1 better than PD1 is by parses.  I don't know what they are offhand and I don't know of a good place to find them, so I do everything in the order of Arch -&gt; PoP Class since the Arch AAs are needed for the PoP Class AAs anyway so might as well get them out of the way first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cuz I really, really don't want to spend everything on defensive, but as my guild's current lead thank (/rude swg) my defensives AAs have a potential to pay off FAR more than anyone else. <br />
<br />
And I really wanto some fun ones :-p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is, boring or not, defense is our job: we take the beating so our more feeble guildmates don't. Thats why you see so many tanks going the total defensive road. There are arguments that more DPS helps hold aggro better (which is true) but how do you hold aggro when you are dead? Our AAs are incremental improvements, so the effect is gradual, but its noticeable when you have all the HP and Def AAs and the other tanks don't. Ultimately its up to you, but this is why many others have gone this path.<br />

BTW Stalwart Endurance owns if you're not an ughre...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HEhe I think of SE as one of the fun ones--tempting, as it does happen (rarely) that I loose agro while stunned. But I think I would take Tactical Mastery before that. Maybe even as my 2nd fun AA (I have one point in Ingenuity right now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of people sing the praises of LR5 as if it is a huge difference that is very noticeable just by looking at your melee spam bar.  The parses don't back this up though.  I don't recall a parse of CS or CA showing that they actually deliver the 10% that they claim either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm mixing in some offensive AAs with the defense.  I'm doing a cycle of PD, CA/LR, Fer, PB, TM, CF, and PP, emphasizing the CA/LR and PD.  I'm still not far into this but I definitely don't want to be all defensive.  Than again, I am rarely the MT for my guild so the extra dps from the offensive stuff is nice.<br />
<br />
PD is expensive for the hit point gain but worth it anyway.  70 hit points is 70 hit points, which can be the difference between getting purple clubbed and getting a free tl to bind...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that in general the arch skills ND,CS,CA give you more bang for your buck than the PoP skills, LR, ID, PD.  That said I trained ND -&gt; PE -&gt; PD -&gt; CA -&gt; CS -&gt;LR and am now working on finishing off ID.  I guess for me I just like hps.  Its always fun to brag to friends about &quot;whoa new record I have XXXX hps raid buffed&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get CS first, then consider the other AA's like PD.<br />
<br />
I was pretty happy with PD, because I too compared it to 70 hp equipment upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Red do you think you are seeing more of a return on LR than you did on CA? Any chance you have any parces around?  <br />
<br />
No, I would not say that, and no, I don't have parses, just my general observation of how I seem to take damage.  Brutul says that pasrses do not back up the claim that LR is a big difference, but Sscalley's parses(they are in the library now thank god) do show a 5 % reduction in damage for LR5.  That is isgnificant.  I also have never seen any CA/CS parses to see if they deliver the full 10 %.<br />
<br />
I want to add that I am in no way suggesting PD is a bad AA, just that I was disapointed in the number of hp's I got from it, and that, in most situations, I think CA/CS/LR/ID is slightly better return on the value.  That is strictly a subjective view, and as many have pointed out(including myself), there is no right aa path.  I do favor finishing defensive before starting offensive aa's strongly, I feel that is important, but it is not 'mandatory'.</div></div><hr />
