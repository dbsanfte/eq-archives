/buys a round of whatever you want <br />
<br />
To make this more of a legitamate post, I dinged 38 last night, and the cool thing about that is, everytime I ding, I have a character higher in level then I have had at any other time...!<br />
<br />
Also bought a Barnacle Covered Axe<br />
<br />
/pats the axe at his waist<br />
<br />
<br />
(I'm not lying about this at all, it totally stunned me, and I want to post the log when I get the chance, but...)<br />
<br />
The axe double procced for me at least 4 times last night (getting resisted on the second proc twice, twice both went through) and it single procced at least 3 times.... all in one battle!<br />
<br />
The funny part is, during this fight, I was basically soloing the mob, my Druid wife, was medding during 95% of the fight, so all that added hate wasn't even necessary!<br />
<br />
I hope that proc rate keeps up!</div></div><hr />

Got a question for you though... you said your Barnacle Covered Axe procs were resisted.  I thought a hate proc like Pique could not be resisted, is this not true?  I have never seen one of my EB or TB procs get resisted, I kind of assumed (yes I know) that the same would apply to Pique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EB and TB are unresistable, and the only effect they have is the hate.  Pique is hate and a dd.  Because of the dd portion, they keep it resistable, and since the hate is the actual effect of the spell, and not from attempting to cast it on them (like a stun), then a resist means no real aggro.  Same goes for epic red blade.</div></div><hr />
