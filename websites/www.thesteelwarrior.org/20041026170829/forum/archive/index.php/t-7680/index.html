<br />
Last attempt before the 6/16 patch, we actually got to Barxt, and got a taste of how much beatdown he and his golem friend could dish out.<br />
<br />
Attempt after that, following the patch, we didn't get anywhere near that far.  Trap mobs kept warping on incoming, leading to missed targeting by tanks, dead casters and ultimately wipeout.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else having this experience?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We've always have traps warp after the first gas chamber, well at least on my screen, sometimes have a few deaths but usually able to manage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some warping, yes, but its much more pronounced since the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">we have been experiencing siginificantly more warp since that last patch!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could try moving closer to the traps spawn points and see if that help any.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been using Shift-F8 as my targeting key, until this last attempt it worked like a charm.  Unfortunately I don't think this is gonna get fixed till July 8th.  :(</div></div><hr />

Yeah, not exactly on topic, but F8 and cycle nearest NPC keys aren't working worth a damn since the patch.  It's a pain in the ass in most zones, but in a few places it's basically useless (primal caves in yxxta is really bad). I MA this is making my job much harder. Last night I had to target with my mouse a few times, because I could not acquire a target otherwise, even when standing 2 inches from mobs.<br />
<br />
Needing mouse click to target is not acceptable. This needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />
