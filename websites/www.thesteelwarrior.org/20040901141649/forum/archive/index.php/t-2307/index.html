<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is an idea...give a group a FT1 bonus for having a Warrior in it.  Call it the &quot;Security Effect&quot;.  Since a robe has a big burly warrior protecting him instead of a girly paladin, he is more relaxed and can think better, hence his manna regens a bit faster.  <br />
<br />
If the Warrior can't hold aggro, then the ft1 won't mean shit and Paladins get their day.  I have seen that 95% of warriors I have seen are fucking worthless hacks who don't know shit about aggro.  It seems they don't even read these boards.  (One ignorant ass said that the Fleshgrinder is great aggro...fucking dolt).  <br />
<br />
So basically the ft1 is not overpowering enough that a group would risk a constant wipes for, but it is tempting enough that they might try out a Warrior.  I am personally confidant enough that I can hold aggro solid that all I need is a chance to prove it (most of my groups are with people already familiar with me).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the problem, and that's what has to be fixed.<br />
<br />
If you want FT to solve this, youde have to make warriors give a 10ft bonus at least, for the preference between paladin and warrior shift a bit.... a bit. 10ft would only be of any use if there are no enchanters in the group.<br />
<br />
And do you want to be a mana battery?<br />
<br />
we need a tank... get us a paladin..<br />
we need more mana... get us a warrior! <br />
sigh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hey i like the idea, means we get to do 2 things at once, look how well the paladins get off on that!(2 things at once that is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I kinda like it, but maybe not on mana regen... but maybe spell haste.<br />
<br />
Give us a utility since we really dont' have anything to do outside of being a tank.<br />
<br />
Plus it'll make us more desireable in groups, which is one thing we lack in (among other things)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I find warriors taunt is about right for raids, but even eb warriors have a hard time holding taunt against ft15  200 aa necro's and druids, in experience grps.<br />
<br />
I think enchanters and bards should get a buff that can help tanks hold agro, like some damage shield that will do 30 damage and add 100 to hate list every time you are hit.   Now this is to powerful for raids, but that can be fix by making the spell not stack with some hp buff that all tanks want on raids, like brells or maybe fos.  <br />
<br />
With a spell like this you will see less ping pong late in the fight from druids and necro and wiz.</div></div><hr />

Interesting idea, but Flowing Thought 1 is about useless.  With KEI/VoQ and/or 9, almost no one is going to notice an extra 10 mana per minute.  Even if they did notice, it probably wouldn't outweigh the current perception that a lot of people have about warriors being sub-par exp tanks.</div></div><hr />
