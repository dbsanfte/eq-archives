For what, they are not gaining anything from fighting a mob that doesn't fight back.  He has instant regen and you can't kill him.  There is no advantage to fighting him at all so its not a exploit.  I would have told that guide to shove it up is %%%.</div></div><hr />

He is fun, friendly, on the level and even encourages direct tells.<br />

I dont know what happened on this day, maybe some people xping nearly petitioned and Minden had to do his 'duty'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the EULA says we are not allowed to attack npcs that dont hit back? never saw that one .. <br />
<br />
and that's an exploit? doing a parse? ill tell you what is the biggest exploit ive ever seen. its fighting at the zoneline and zoning if you get too much agro. but its allowed. whereas attacking an npc for the purpose of parsing your weapon is considered an exploit.<br />
<br />
sony has too much time on its hands. they need to use some of that time on something more productive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or hire guides with capacity to think for themselves... What unfair advantage did the player in question get? Thats right, none.<br />
<br />
Now if the guide in question was somehow forced to enforce a stupid rule by a higher-up, then he should take the consequence and simply quit their guide program. <br />
<br />
Another possibility is of course it was one of those that BOFH-type guides, who actually enjoy dishing out warnings.<br />
<br />
If I after having played for 5 years without as much as a verbal warning, got some warning from a rookie guide about beating on a NPC(with no possible personal gain except knowledge about my weapon) I would be pissed.</div></div><hr />

[Sun Dec 07 18:08:19 2003] Minden tells you, 'You have no worry of dieing..'<br />
[Sun Dec 07 18:08:41 2003] You told Minden, 'He ripostes for 843 damage'<br />
[Sun Dec 07 18:08:56 2003] Minden tells you, 'the mob does not physically attack you.. <br />
<br />
Ok two things here:<br />
<br />
1.  Correct me if I am wrong please but if the mob ripostes for 843 Damage then isn't that still a loss of hitpoints and therefore = attack?. Yea its a riposte but still the mob has to hit you in order to be a successful riposte.. Correct? <br />
<br />
2.  He never intended to &quot;Kill&quot; the mob but to merely guage his weapon damage. If you attack a mob with no intention of kiling it then im sorry, i dont see the problem. Not allowing that is just plain stupid. Parsing in this manner is not gonna adversely affect anyone in any way (atleast none that I can see). <br />
<br />
Clearly his intent was not to kill the mob or gain any unfair advantage. <br />
<br />
I am not real familiar with exploits but I have heard of one in DL. Cant remember exactly what it was but apparently one could kill a mob without taking damage? again not completely sure in this as it was a while ago when I read it. Something about pathing i believe. <br />
<br />
That to me qualifies as an Exploit. You killed the mob with no worry of dying. Hitting a mob that will not hit back (Less ripostes)  and with no intention of killing it so you can get some parsing info is not an exploit. <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one in DL involes running a large train of mobs to the KC zone, and getting them stuck in the wall, allowing one to PBAoE the lot of them, over and over, and never get hit.  I have seen a druid that pulled about 100+ mobs and AoE'd them all.  This, of course, did result in the sending of a direct tell to the GM on at the time, and a warnin to that dolt, duely deserved of course.<br />
<br />
Was kind of funny tho...<br />
<br />
You tell GM soandso, 'blah blah'<br />
GM Soandso tells you, 'Please use the petition system, do not send direct tells'<br />
You tell GM soandso, 'this is an important matter, and you need to come here now, to witness it yourself'<br />
GM Soandso tells you, 'Please use the petition system, do not send direct tells'<br />
GM soandso is not online<br />
/who all GM<br />
There are no players in everquest that match those filters.<br />
<br />
10 minutes later, the expoiter tells me, 'Did you report me? GM just warned my account, and if I get another warning, my account will be banned, and my characters deleted'<br />
<br />
Oh noz~</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont get it, the mob isnt &quot;taken&quot; or something. Why couldnt 2 ppl parse their dps on it at the same time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hitting Alt-O, clickin the tab at the top, clickin one button, hitting Alt-O is MORE work than /petition soandso blah blah blah blah and so on and so on??  I don't think so.</div></div><hr />
