<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent the better part of tonight brainstorming over the current 'melee enhancement' project.   I really don't like the current setup as it is on beta.  I don't think anyone really likes the &quot;openings&quot; idea.  If openings are going to be kept in at all, I think they should be VERY rare, and thus tied to very powerful abilities.  Such that an entire plane of time clearing of the 'big 9' might only give up 2-3 openings total.<br />
<br />
That said, this is my contribution to what i think the direction this system should take is.   The page this link goes to is a general outline of some random thoughts i wrote down, and then taught out.   When going back and looking for abilities I went back and looked at that outline to come up with possiblities.<br />
<br />
The link at the bottom of the page will take you to a spreadsheet I did with possible warrior abilities, the levels to get them, and what they do.   Keep in mind I am taking the approach of powerful, yet expensive abilities in conjunction with slow endurance regeneration.  These abilities are basically all &quot;chose to use&quot; and do not rely on waiting for an opening (hate the opening system)<br />
<br />
Melee System / Warrior Example (http://www.conquest-guild.com/melee.htm) <br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.   After some feedback ill mail the devs, and if they like some of the ideas I have a lot of other things in mind for monks and rogues along the same lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It appears the opening bar is gone on beta server.   You cant do much as a result atm, but it seems they're either:<br />
<br />
a) getting rid of it and giong to a &quot;chose to use&quot; system.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
b) Moving it to a graphical interface, perhaps in the 3d engine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your endurance costs are far too high.<br />
<br />
50% of my endurance pool for an 18second 10% dps increase to the group? Maybe if this lasted a minute or more...<br />
<br />
Some of the others blowing 33% etc are also very high. Stonewall currently takes about 25% of my endurance pool over the 3 minutes. If I use my provoke skill every time it's up that ups it to about 35%.<br />
<br />
If endurance regen was faster, having a 33% or 50% skill wouldn't be a big deal. But you also say that slower regen is the key to balance (which I agree with).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changed that one to 33% cost so now it compares as follows:<br />
<br />
Assume a group that looks like war/monk/monk/rog/rog/cle.<br />
<br />
DPS for this group is around 1000.   For that 33% endurance the warrior would be contributing 100 dps for 18 seconds, or 1,800 damage.   <br />
<br />
Compare this to the personal Flurry one which would do an average of around  774 damage per use.   <br />
<br />
Flurry useable 5 times = 774*5 = 3870 damage. <br />
Call to arms = 1,800*3 = 5400 damage.<br />
<br />
So call of arms would be better with a really efficient group such as set out above, similar in a more average group setup, and worse if the warrior was the only melee in the group.<br />
<br />
As far as endurance costs being too high, I worked backwards.  Lets look at flurry again while adventuring.<br />
<br />
Assuming similar rate of regen as mana (lets say 10 minutes from 0 to full) we have 774 damage for 3 minutes worth of regen.  This is 6.5% DPS increase if that is all you used.<br />
<br />
I don't think they really wanted this system to be a massive DPS upgrade for the melee classes, so that is what i was aiming for (5-7% dps increase if the melee went mostly all offensive dps abilities over the long term - adventuring etc, and 13-15% dps increase on raids if they only used offensive abilities and blew their endurance as fast as possible).<br />
<br />
Also one element that has been lost from casters is choice.   At high levels, casters no longer have to choose what to do.  Spells have such cheap mana costs compared to their pool and regeneration, they can pretty much 'do it all'.   They're only limited by casting time.<br />
<br />
I think there should be an opportunity cost to useing a DPS ability.  You should lose a certain amount of utility if you choose to go DPS abilities.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don;t mind you ideas terribly except for a couple things.  <br />
<br />
I don;t mind rare, but 2-3  during the process of clearing the 9's?  I am not in PoT but i imagine we are talking about a 2 hourish time span?  I would think these abilities should fire off a little more often, unless it something like instant death to the mob.  <br />
_____________________________<br />
Large dps increases both long term and burst should be avoided – Melee seem fairly well balanced in terms of melee damage.<br />
_____________________________<br />
<br />
by very definition you just made the openings worthless; if our dps is balanced then what possible purpose can you give &quot;openings&quot; that will not be trivial?  I looked over your template of abilities and it's very very consevative for having to wait so long for one to work.  The endurance costs are fairly high.  Most important question to ask is does it really make a difference if i use this ability or not?  using the ability limits the disc's I can use in exchange for what?  18 seconds or eyecandy criting?  <br />
<br />
I think some things need to be adjusted but i think you are off at the base level.  If we have to wait that long for an ability to fire, then it had better make a very large impact on combat.  I looked over the skills and while i like the idea of the warrior making the group do more damage, the rest of the skills were kinda pointless.  Other classes do those jobs far better than a warrior could even begin to hope for.  They abilities don;t really matter all that much, if the ability managed to fire it would not make a significant impact on combat at all.<br />
<br />
The real problem is we need abilities that make a difference, all the more so if they are going to rarly fire.  For example if you rarly go &quot;blitzkreig&quot; and crit for 18 seconds . . . you might get lucky and do what 3000 extra points of damage?  The ranger firing on your mob just did 1000 less than that 2x in a row, a wizard just nuked for 3x as much, your target was undead and a paly crited for 6k; need i go on?  You also got the pleasure of waiting 20 minutes for it to fire, and it fired when the mob was at 2% health so you got to watch the crits for 5 seconds.  <br />
<br />
There are some nice idea's in there, but i think from the start you need to re-think where you are going.  Melee vs caster isn;t exactly balanced, and we are not talking about average DPS here are we.  We have situational DPS, palies get SU, rangers get their massive crits, SK's get nukes, and warriors get?! 14 seconds or criting if they burn a disc and don;t need to use another for 45min.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line is abilities need to be worth the expense of getting them and using the endurance to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the abilities i listed are balanced as &quot;choose to use&quot;.  Meaning the warrior can use them whenever they want.<br />
<br />
What I was saying is that if in addition they decided to keep the opening system, they should be very rare - so it doesnt feel like eternal wack-a-mole.   I.e. these choose to use abilities + aditional, different abilties even more powerful than those listed.<br />
<br />
by very definition you just made the openings worthless<br />
<br />
I havent made them worthless by that definition.  Rather, I am implying that a moderate increase in damage is what we should be looking for, not a large increase.  <br />
<br />
 The abilities as I have listed for warriors represent a 16% upgrade on a 3 minute raid target, and a 5-8% damage increase in exp groups.   Do you really think its realistic to ask for more than that?   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of your post is a complete misunderstanding.   That chart is designed around the warrior being able to use the abiltiies at any time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">percentage cost in endurance is against the spirit of EQ that rewards gear and farming gear.  It essentially makes it meaningless to have more fortitude.   EQ needs gear to be differential between toons at different tiers to function at its best.  Its a form of development.  Its really important that a brand new level 65 warrior with only access to velious type kills cannot do the same things that a veteran time warrior can.  It gives EQ meaning.  To do that you cant use percentages of the bar for abilities.  It has to be set cost.<br />
<br />
Youll also note that using percentages inadvertently introduces a side effect where people with lower fortitude pools can regen a greater percentage in a minute if its a flat rate.  So essentially poorly equipped warriors would use more abilities then well equiped warriors.<br />
<br />
though if you mean 10% to be translated into a constant number later then I would note that at the top.  IE all percentages relative to what a middle range warrior would have. or some other statement of who is the baseline.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If your thinking sliding cost thats fine but it shouldnt be a percentage imo.  And frankly I think sliding scales are overkill and more complicated then they need to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did note that at the top.<br />
<br />
Also note that !=! basically just means: Roughly equal to this. People with less than average equipment would spend more endurance than listed, and people with great equipment would spend slightly less than listed. <br />
<br />
So yes, there would be an exact endurance cost, not a %.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see!  Carry on =)<br />

That was my only concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd just prefer a slider bar that let me change my battle stance once every couple of minutes or so. This way you could chose defense for a few minutes until a timer refreshes then decide whether to continue it or go offensive, or normal. With a timer it eliminates trying to &quot;pulse&quot; the bar inbetween hits to achieve the wrong intent, while allowing skill to to be involved unlike the RNG they seem to be in favor of.<br />
<br />
But since that isn't the way it's going to happen, I like the ideas you have.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so far there are only 2 or 3 skills I real enjoy using. I had suggested that they add a &quot;Remembering skill&quot; to the openings.<br />
<br />
ie: if your fighting lets say Quarm and you get Power Slam opens and you use it, you remember what quarm did to cause that opening. now you can use power slam any time during the fight you want as long as you have the stamina. this goes for all othes excepts for Errors. then once the fight is over the Remebering is gone cause the mob is dead/<br />
<br />
this way its a combonation of timer and anytime use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szlia</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The system on test seems currently to be in a transitional state, probably (hopefully) shifting toward something like Itzlegend posted.<br />
<br />
I definitely prefer a system that is limited by endurance cost (and maybe reuse timers) than one limited by randomness (it was impossible to run OOE with the opening system). And I think I share there the views of the majority.</div></div><hr />

And I think I share there the views of the majority. I haven't checked test today, it was crazy wonky when I tried yesterday.  And you can count my voice among those who thinks Endurance, RNG, and re-use timers is too much.  IMO, a system that uses the Endurance pool AND a re-use timer OR random openings works.  The duration of those openings, based on my last peek on test, is too short.  More skills could, and mebbe should, be on timers instead of random - but the ones I really am concerned about are already set to go that way the last time I looked.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of random openings for some combat moves being randomly available, it's crazy but it's true ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make the random openings rare but the skills they open up really have some bang for buck in my humble opinion (and give them a high endurance cost so if you want to make the 'mega-skill' work you can't previously have gone to town with the minor skills) i.e. trade off's of conservation of resources made meaningful.  <br />
<br />
This whilst allowing most of the more moderate powers to be available for use when they'll actually make a difference for your group - then having them fizzle on occasion actually makes balancing sense.<br />
<br />
And pretty please, allow us to 'memorise' our favourite skills (plus provoke and AE taunt etc perhaps, and possibly even discs) in the casters spell window.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take my comments as coming from a level 63 warrior who is LDoN/tier 3 pre-elemental, and is mostly an exp group warrior. I'm sure my take on this is very different than that of an elemental or time-enabled raiding warrior.<br />
<br />
First off, the only thing I really like about the system you describe is &quot;no openings&quot;. Beyond that, all the other stuff, and especially the sample abilities you've defined, are either too weak or too powerful; there's not a lot in the middle ground or compromise. For example...<br />
<br />
-- Guard III: 33% innate damage absorption sounds great, but let's face it, it's overpowered. It wouldn't be if you could turn it on and off as needed and it ate up endurance, but having it be innate (which I'm assuming means passively on all the time, given it costs nothing to maintain) means you just gave every level 62+ warrior an additional 33% mitigation. If I think that's a lot, I'd think Sony would be having kittens with that level of additional mitigation.<br />
<br />
-- Muscle Spam II: -35 ATK debuff for 18 seconds at level 63? It won't even feel to the mob like a mosquito bit them. By this time, druids can debuff upwards of -180 ATK, and that doesn't seem to do much to the typical tier 1-3 PoP or LDoN mob. Chanters and shamans probably do even better. -35 ATK isn't even a tickle, except perhaps to generate around the same miniscule amount of hate.<br />
<br />
-- The recovery line looks like a bone thrown to the soloing warrior. It's only powerful if you're not moving around much, which means it's only good for downtime. The overwhelming majority of exp warriors (and all raid warriors) will have someone healing them, as well, so most of them won't take to &quot;sitting and medding&quot;.<br />
<br />
-- Vivication: 200 a tick regen for 5 ticks at level 53 is more powerful than the cleric's heal-over-time spell (180 a tick for 4 ticks; they don't get better till level 59). Yes, it costs a lot of end, but it's awful powerful, comparatively speaking. This again seems like a bone thrown to the ability of warriors to solo.<br />
<br />
-- Lunging Bash: It's been a while since I was level 9, but I don't recall a 10 damage bash being that wonderfully powerful. In any case, it's certainly not worth ~25% of your endurance.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you have some good ideas, but I think the details are too sketchy and need some moderate to heavy tuning. For someone like me, who exp's mostly and isn't end-game, a lot of this is not better than what SOE seems to be offering us with their system, albeit the &quot;no openings&quot; thing would truly rock. I can see how this would be a better system for end-game raiders, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont like the percents, IMHO if i have a larger endurance number than the other warrior i should be able to pull off more moves, just like mana users, percentages are not the way to go</div></div><hr />

<br />
no no no! You can't guard yourself, you can only guard other. And then 33% of the dmg that other person takes goes to the warrior instead. The dmg does not vanish, it is relocated.<br />
<br />
And Gerick your concern is adressed on the skill page and also on the page 1 of this thread:  <br />

[/B] <br />
<br />
I still disagree with you that melee damage is mostly balanced.  There are enough parses all over that show casters at the upper end of the DPS sector.  If you remeber the original focus was to balance melee against casters not each other with this re-balance.  I still think we could use some burst type damage increase; again Paly SU3, SK - nukes, rangers 2-3k crits from bows, etc etc.  Warriors get 18 seconds of crits, and not exactly stellar crits either.  Am i asking for too much?  more than likly, but then I will not be one who has not because he asks not.  I still am bitter that every class in the game (practically) got crits, i still think ours needs to be adjusted to make it more meaningful.<br />
<br />
Your aggro abilties were also worse than what Ryan (dev post around here somewhere) has already posted they are going with.  The other skills, being available at all times are sometimes useful, sometimes not.  recovery is a skill that would need much tweaking, when we have warriors with 10k hp will a regen of 12hp a tic do anything?  Like i emphesised before, in order for the system to be worth while we would have to make the skill worth pushing.  Are you really going to push the regen so you get 12hp a tic back, or crit for 18 seconds, or do anything if it could perhaps limit your aggro abilities?  Will 18 seconds of crits, a regen or absorbing 33% of someone's inc hit's (like say a mob who hits for 1000 a swing on a chanter) going to make enough of a difference.  Honestly you might be right, but i'd rather see the abilities on test first.  <br />
<br />
I might be in the minority here, but i would rather they hold off on the patch to get more worked out than push out some crap.  Heck maybe just release the provoke line and disciplines and leave the &quot;openings&quot; for next month so we can get better testing done.</div></div><hr />

Paladins and rangers are aweful DPS...  Even our warriors outdamage the rangers and paladins in pure melee - and it isnt even close with monks and rogues.<br />

<br />
It hardly matter what level of raiding I play; I am refering to several posts done in &quot;Overlord's&quot; section by Furor (see end game DPS comparisons).  If you want to dispute those numbers then run over there . . . by all means.  I also was not refering to normal melee DPS, as much as special circumstance DPS.  Against undead paladin's do extremly well, with a Bow rangers also do well.  Special circumstance burst DPS would not break the game if the warriors actually had something.  <br />
<br />
I also think you shoot yourself in the foot becuase you say damage is esentially balanced . . . so why add any DPS abilities in then?  I don;t want skills that do next to nothing cluttering my UI, maybe you do but i sure don't.  Even marginal DPS addition is just silly . . . i am wasting endurance that could/should be used for something else.  If you are making an issue for warrior stackability in a raid it still doesn;t work.  I guess maybe i'm the only warrior who save his disc's just incase the other tanks died.  I just can;t buy into the mindset that anyone would want a skill that is &quot;marginal&quot;, especially if it uses the same fuel (endurance) as more useful skills.  By giving us &quot;marginal&quot; DPS increase skill it is simply the waste of a spot where we could see real abilities.  Why waste your endurance, especially if you may need it to tank?<br />
<br />
As far as aggro, i don;t think they can go too far in giving us aggro unless they start nerfing knight stuns.  Even with the system ryan showed, it doesn;t even come into the ballpark of what a compitent knight is capable of; even if the warrior is in a raex bp etc.  <br />
<br />
i really don;t care what level of raiding you are at, that does not somehow make you a wearhouse of EQ knowledge.  If you are going to give me a stupid button i need to click then make it do something, marginal does not fit that definition however.</div></div><hr />

BTW, Have you tried parsing aggresive lately?   Last time i bothered versus cazic thule in plane of time, I parsed within the top 3 melee - right in the middle of the rogues.<br />

Aggressive does more damage than anything save possibly trueshot - and even then only if the fight is around 2.5 minutes or less in length.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well that is true, but i honestly NEVER use aggresive because I am saving my disc's.  This patch will change this so i guess then it might be worth checking out.  Still with the reuse timer, and the mitigation it prob is better served using on raid mobs when you are not the MT or maybe when you want to do massive damage and spice up LDoN normal (and boy does normal need excitement heheh).  <br />
<br />
I just don;t think adding a DPS button, for the sake of adding a button is a great direction.  If we are going to add a button make it worth my time, and endurance to use.<br />
<br />
I'd also add that the whole balance issue did not originate because a paly tanked quarm.  10 or so months ago it was becuase there was a large gap in damage between casters and melee; if they are going to give us some skills to boost DPS i would imagine it should be for all melee classes not just warriors.  I don;t think that issue is gone, or at least that is news to me; then again i am sure many a caster argues that melee are just fine where they are at.</div></div><hr />
