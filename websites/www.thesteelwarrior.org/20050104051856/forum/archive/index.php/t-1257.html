<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=253023<br />
<br />
I've managed to save up about 24kpp, almost enough to maybe get a GSoT and I'm wondering, should I sit around in the bazaar 24/7 to try and get one of these things ( Very rare on Quellious, only seen 1 for sale in the last 2 weeks and didn't have the cash for it ) or should I get some other decent weapons ( Namely, is the GSoT really the be-all and end-all of decently priced aggro weapons? )  OR should I go for something else like upgrading my haste or hps for now.  I'm kinda in a bind in that to afford a GSoT I pretty much have to sell my Snowchipper, which leaves me with nothing but a Stonebladed Axe of Dismay until I buy one and I don't really want to have to rely on that in all situations because, although I haven't used it that much MTing, I tend to find that my 2 1handers out aggro it and selling it instead of the SC is a lot easier said then done...  Anyway, any help would be much appreciated and any upgrade suggestions are welcome, thanks in advance ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On my server (e-marr) at least, the SAoD costs about the same as a snowchipper, so you could ditch the axe and keep your 1h setup.<br />
<br />
I've only had my GSoT for about half a week now, but I doubt very much you'll switch it out often. As to its being the be all end all tradeable agro weap (aside from truly &quot;uber&quot; droppable stuff like BoC of course), I'm hardly the best judge, but I find the GSoT to be superior to my 1h setup (Wavecrasher/Frosty) and my 2hs weaps (War Marshall's Bladed Staff and previously my Windblade).<br />
<br />
That being said, I've never been one to blow all my dough on one item- you could sprinkle the 25-35k that you seem likely to have on your hands around a bit. Your rings could be upgraded to Valorium or similar and you'll still have some savings to work with. Not sure what your guild is capable of, but at your level (assuming your guild is comparable levels to you) there's plenty of drops that would be upgrades for you (shaderock amulet for your neck from Va'Dyn, Vindi bp, various haste upgrades) and would cost you nothing but time and raid points (if you use them).<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i just looked up the item, dropped by a 65 mini boss who spawns daily in BoT, one group doable, very easy to get to with invis. normally, absolutely nothing drops off this mob, but supposedly they are fixing the loot in BoT and few other zones. ive noticed spectrals are back to a normal drop rate just tonight, maybe this item will become more common soon. <br />
<br />
BoT is no longer keyed, you can take a group and go kill this guy yourself very easily with just a standard xp group. once you zone in, if im not mistaken, gaukr sandstorm spawns in the very back of the north wing. even if you must camp him, the area is great xp with multiple safe spots to pull to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSoT is very nice, no question.  There is a pally in my guild who claims he can hold aggro against SKs, wizards, and everyone else with no problem, but he has to work at it when I drag out the stick.<br />
<br />
I don't think the GSoT is the ultimate aggro weapon, it has to proc and even after it procs someone else can get the mob's attention, but it's certainly nice for everyday use when aggro control is an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ultimate? No.<br />
<br />
Best lootable weapon? No.<br />
<br />
Best buyable weapon aside from BoC or SoD? Hell yes.<br />
<br />
Judging from the posts above, this weapon also seems to have a very nice risk vs. reward, even though to drop rate sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disagree with how good the GSOT really is.  I still don't see the benefits of having one.  The aggro sucks with can't hold aggro at all.  Doesnt proc  and it is resisted to alot of mobs in POPand to me it was waste of 45k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I had this puppy for a while and it served me well.  I decided to get rid of it for a bit to see if I could still hold aggro well with my other crappy weapons.  With Frosty and that Barnicle Covered Axe, Aggro wasnt really an issue.<br />
<br />
My problem was PoN I think.  With the GSoT in PoN, I couldnt hold aggro at all.  Something weird about the zone I think.  Anyways, I switched to duel wield and did decent again.  PoJ, PoI, PoT had no probs with the frosty/barny axe combo either.<br />
<br />
I used the cash I got from the GSoT to upgrade my gear and now I got a ton more HP's, Stats, and AC.  Its a large chunck of change for a weapon, so if you need gear upgrades I suggest u go with that.  Im one piece away from getting my epics anyways and once I get back to the states, should have it in no time.  I'll use those till I get an EB weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are in a tough situation because 25k would buy you a lot of nice upgrades. You could get Earring of the Solstice, 2x Valorium rings, Heirophant's cloak all for 25k and you would pick up a ton of stats and HP.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, once you get a GSoT, you are set until your guild can get you RB weapons or you can afford to drop 250k+ each for an SoD and a BoC. I have had a GSoT on my now 56 warrior for a bit over a month now. I basically use my warrior to tank when we do small group kills of mobs like Gore, Trak, Vindi and so on. I also use him to tank tier 1 and 2 when there is no one else available. I have had zero problems holding agro with that weapon. My main is a 65 wiz and I can dish out some dps with the agro my warrior is getting. Keep in mind that the vast majority of mobs my war is tanking are all deep red so he depends on agro from procs and DPS, taunt key might as well not even exsist. I am pretty pleased with my GSoT and I heartily recommend it to anyone who is not capable of getting EB.<br />
<br />
In your position, I would get the GSoT then start working on getting 1 upgrade at a time as you can afford it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am very pleased with my GSoT. My guild is not uber by any means ( we are doing HoT with an alliance so we can gear up for bigger and better, you know how progression goes in smaller guilds). I shared tank duty with a 65 warrior alternating. He started the night with Frosty+Red Epic, and after a 10 second count we assisted and my proc would pull aggro. He switched in his GSoT ( first other GSoT i have been around on Torv ) and he held aggro great after the assist call. <br />
<br />
I asked him to test out the 2hs version of the epic, and after 20 seconds he switched back to GSoT. He said it was being resisted and loosing aggro. We were both very pleased with our purchases and decided it was worth every platinum we spent. <br />
<br />
That is just the viewpoint of 2 non-uberguilded warriors. Take it how you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well from my experience everything that conned even or greater than me it was resisted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A resisted spell still generates agro.  In tier 2 and 3 PoP, I have had very good luck with GSoT.  No, agro is not a 100 % sure thing, and I am still dependent on the RNG, but I have been complimented more than once on my ability to hold agro with it.  <br />
<br />
Whether it is the best thing for you to spend your money on is a hard call.  If agro is a big problem for you, then maybe go GSoT, or another agro weapon(s).  If it is not that big a problem, then upgrade gear elsewhere.  One possiblilty would be to replace snowchipper with a smithed Ykesha(have heard nothing but good about them) and use the rest of the cash on armor upgrades...ie PoTC earing, clattering bone necklace, valorian rings, etc.  I will say that an agro weapon would be a good priority for you, as all the hp's in the world won't help when it's not you getting hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still get the mobs to turn around when &quot;Your Planar Stun spell has been resisted.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thulikore</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was using a GSoT in North ToV when I was level 56. Everything there either resisted the proc or was immune to it. However, two or three resisted procs in a row would pull the mob off of the level 65 warrior tank and onto myself. My reward for doing this would generally be a slime mist (nasty slow), so I'd luckily not have agro long enough for anyone to really notice. *grin*<br />
<br />
I'd still get a chuckle out of the fact that I was yanking agro off of Warriors 9 levels my senior without making an effort. ;)<br />
<br />
It's a very nice weapon for its cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just correcting some info about it's drop:<br />
<br />
Drops off of Rorek in South wing of BoT.  He is a random / rare spawn, does have a set spawn point though.  He usually drops nothing at all.  BoT drop rate increase was on Tower bosses only, not minor wing named.<br />
<br />
It can be resisted a lot, but a resisted proc still is a lot of aggro, and I really doubt you are wanting it for the actual stun instead of the aggro.<br />
<br />
Personally, I used it for a month or so.  It held aggro great for me.<br />
<br />
As for other upgrades.  Your stamina is pretty good, at your current level Boar would max out stamina for you.  So really, valorium rings would not be much of an upgrade (you would get 8 dex, 8 agi, and 8 str... but thats not worth it).  Hiero would be a great buy, or Iksar hide cape.  Clattering bone necklace, solstice earring are other good upgrades.  But all the hps in the world means nothing if you can't keep aggro, so aggro should be your number one worry.  While imo a GSoT would be the best aggro for you, you also could get a frosty and while not have as well of aggro, you could then afford some other upgrades.  Frosty should be decent enough, though not near a GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using a Wavecrasher/Frosty combo for some time now; does the job of holding aggro nicely.  I got a GSoT 2 nights ago and so far the results have been mixed...<br />
<br />
Firstly, I'm training up my 2hb skill, which was at 13 when I started with the GSoT so predictably results were very poor to start with.<br />
<br />
My 2hb is now about 170, and the damage output is rising nicely.  Now I'm level 56 its also starting to proc more often, but most procs are being resisted by PoN mobs I have to say, which I'm disappointed with.<br />
<br />
All in all at the moment its not quite as good as my old Wavey/Frosty combo for holding aggro.  I hope it will improve as my 2hb skill goes up and I rise up in levels so the proc isn't resisted as much.  Fingers crossed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chumchum</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no problem tanking in PoV with GSoT @ lv 56.  Like wandor said, taunt key doesn't work for me at all so I rely on proc.  I usually group with 65 monk, shm, clr, 64 wiz and 63 enc.  Fully buffed I have no prob holding aggro against the monk and wiz.  However, if I switched out to Shortblade of Lightning and Frosty, the mobs won't even look at me.  That's just my personal experience.</div></div><hr />
