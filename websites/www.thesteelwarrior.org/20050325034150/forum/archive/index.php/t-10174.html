66 Cleric. 65 Shaman, warrior , rogue, monk. so 5 of us total.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the monk single pulls everytime (and that means he stays down a lot) What are our chances of being able to do this? Cleric and shaman have like 80aa. <br />
<br />
<br />
I know I can tank in WoS south, and WoS north/Caves. How does a LDON compare? <br />
<br />
<br />
I also know we have 90 mins only so that concerns me as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We do LDON Normals in 45-55 minutes and take 3 at a time easily.<br />

WOOPS FORGOT TO TURN OFF MY HP AA :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd pick up another DPS just for kicks though, the only hard thing about hard ldon is keeping the killrate high enough to finish in time.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that is what I am mostly worried about.</div></div><hr />

Maybe pick up another DPS person for the first try if you're worried about it.  I don't know about monks, but caster paci doesn't work worth a damn in LDoN Hard so be sure your shaman has root up and is ready to park adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good monk can single most of a hard ldon using paci only, I think it's unresistable or some such. They can fd split the rest.<br />
<br />
You'll probably be ok dps wise without the 6th, so if you're not worried about your record just try it anyway.  The 6th is won't hurt your xp or points though, so unless you're worried about them taking your drops theres not much reason not to pick up some random dps class from lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are definately ok to tank em. The main part is just getting consistant/steady/controllable pulls into camp and killing reasonably quick.  One thing that can help is make sure everyone knows to roll on droppables later, rezzer at least bind at LDoN camp, assign looters in advance of starting timer, dont waste 5 minutes over a +6 agi aug, no afk's unless someones baby is on fire, etc..  <br />
<br />
As always, a bard makes these about 4 gazillion times easier.  Bards can be scarce though, hehe.  Ask the shaman if he knows how to &quot;pet pull&quot; rooms where you are worried about adds.  This could allow the shaman to be pulling sometimes, while you guys are finishing up a mob.  Wish i knew how it worked specifically, but i've never played a pet class.  Maybe someone here can outline it for ya.<br />
<br />
Having an evaccer can also save ya from full wipes, which can mean lots o lost time. maybe consider that for 6th spot for the first few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lochr</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, you're going nowhere with that crew. You don't have a snarer. Snaring is an absolute must for a hard LDoN. Lots, and I mean lots, of stuff runs. In the rujarkian and tak themes, they tend to run SoWed. You might be able to root a few runners, but the one that gets away will wipe your group. Period.<br />
<br />
Also, without CA 3 and CS 3, I think your cleric is going to have some mana issues. Everything hits for 990 (before mitigation AAs, which you don't have). That's a quantum leap from an LDoN normal.<br />
<br />
IMO, hard LDoN mobs hit harder then even WoS north field kyv elites. No chaos claws proc, but the steady pounding at 990 really adds up. That's a third harder per hit then WoS mobs, though it's possible they don't swing as often. Also, it's much, much easier to single pull WoS, and your cleric can use a horse for mana regen in WoS.<br />
<br />
It's worth a try. But I think you'll have real issues. I would strongly suggest finding either a ranger or a bard. The loot from hard LDoN nameds is generally very, very good (trash like the Granite Halberd of Chance being more the exception then the rule), and track is extremely helpful for finding them. Snaring's a must.<br />
<br />
Bards can snare too, and track, and pull, and sing, and cook, and....<br />
<br />
Bards are the single best class for a hard LDoN. Try to find one with Fading Memories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Snare helps a lot, but you can win without it. I won some hard ldons at level 65 buffing to about 6k hp and almost no defensive aa. The cleric had some more aa but nothing special for gear.<br />
<br />
Ldon mobs max round is a double I think, and they have no procs. Their max hit of 990 doesn't take too much AC to mitigate either. Plus they don't run half as fast as WoS north side.  I wouldn't say it's anything near as hard, aside from the logistical problems of maintaining solid single pulls and stopping runners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They do run at SoW speed, which may as well be as fast as WoS mobs unless you have Run 5, And if the OP doesn't have CA/CS I'm sure hoping he does not. Also, they don't have to stop and open doors while you do. Get a Butcherblock or S Ro with undead in it and you won't have to worry about mobs fleeing, but be heads up on enrage<br />
<br />
Also, think they can triple and add in a kick/bash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in either case I don't think he's going to have tanking problems provided 1. he can get single pulls and 2. stop runners.<br />
<br />
The win may hinge on dps, but if they're steady and don't have to CR or pick up the puller they'll be good.</div></div><hr />
