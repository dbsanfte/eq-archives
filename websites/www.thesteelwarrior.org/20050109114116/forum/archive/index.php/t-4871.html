<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok been using incite all the time now. Doing this level 62 mob in Lair of TT for exp, http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10375<br />
<br />
The new warrior changes are basically trivialized this kind of encounter. My warrior uses a 15damage 19delay with a Proc that is almost like a stun (good agro generator), and a 14 damage 19 delay offhand with no proc. The warrior is level 65 with like 20AA or so, but good bazaar gear. Link: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=290137<br />
<br />
Pulling with warrior then spamming taunt and incite (I really don’t know what my endurance or whatever that is as I don’t have it on my UI heh, but my stamina is like 240ish or so and I don’t see any odd messages about being out of endurance. <br />
<br />
Good trick is to make yur HotKey for incite (Combat ability one) the same as a hot box social hot key (doability 1 for example is taunt) that way both will fire at the same time (Woot!).<br />
<br />
The warrior get the initial agro and then using taunt and the proc (and incite for a 2nd time if the battle lasts long enough) never loses it.<br />
<br />
I social cast 2 concussions with the 3 wizards at the start of the fight (takes about 6 seconds) and then they chain cast draughts. Each wizard does 5000-6000 damage and never gets summoned. The chanter does his strangle harm dot and then casts insanity his best nuke and sends in his animation. These mobs are immune to almost everything (root slow etc.) so no slow.<br />
<br />
The cleric spams CH on the warrior. <br />
<br />
Result complete agro lock on the warrior – he never loses it, mob never summons anyone and just stays on the warrior. <br />
<br />
Basically this kind of encounter is now nothing, even six boxing I am boarded, and the possibility of a death is about zero. Naturally this is 6 v. 1 mob 3 levels lower (but unslowable and hits for 200-500), but still…. <br />
<br />
I predict incoming nerf to warrior abilities.</div></div><hr />

Put it in an existing thread, there's plenty of them to pick from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jet</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW i disagree that the INCITE is  a warrior lock.<br />
<br />
Im a 65 warrior with 23 aa (im young) and yes  incite is very nice but its no  way  an  agro lock. Try playing  a harder  zone, or try playing in a pick up with a wizard or necro or mage that  slams the mob, just cuz they like to and watch your  agro go bye bye.<br />
<br />
Dont get me  wrong, i love incite but please dont make people think its  an  agro lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya well true in this particular case its a agro lock, but naturally that does not mean it will be in all cases... <br />
<br />
Still one could conclude that its a agro lock up to mobs that are level 63 or 64 (and slowable).... thats getting up there. I mean thats almost all of any resonable exping type mobs... <br />
<br />
I am sure a wizard who trys and gets agro should be able to do it but thats not a realistic situation in a group where people are all working together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's only aggro &quot;lock&quot; because your group isn;t getting stupid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jet</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just  know i was in VP 2 nights  ago (had like 10 people), common pulls were 2 guardian wurms, and getting  adds on top of those  as mob died . No way i held  agro throughout the battle, and no one was trying to out agro  me, they  did out  aqgro just cuz they were  doing their jobs. <br />
<br />
It was just  tough cuz Incite  while good, isnt a lock at  all. And  in those tougher zones, id love Incite to  pop up faster, we often had 2-4 mobs  at one time, all meanies, that  dont  mez.<br />
 <br />
I  even had trouble keeping the mob off the monk who  was using a 2hb (ok it was a fast  2hb, but  still).<br />
<br />
Anyway im not actually  arguing  with ya on sayin  Incite isnt  good, it  is good, im glad i have it. Just isnt  a real lock.<br />
<br />
Anyway..gotta run.. holiday  stuff, be safe all. BTW  Orange Alert in USA, be smart too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylaa</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not hard to keep aggro on the tank when you are playing all the characters in your group, I do it all the time. I can tash and slow much earlier than most enchanters try to and have no problem getting aggro, even before the melee patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, what the original poster described wasn't agro lock, it was just good agro control - there's a BIG DIFFERENCE!  Agro lock means the wizards blast at will from the start and still don't get agro...that's what knights do now with their spells.  (which, I think is a bad game concept because it's boring)  Agro control means people give the MA a chance to get solid agro, then respond appropriately.  Also, I'm guessing the casters had SCS3 to help reduce agro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, yeah thats not agro lock when your wizards dont even begin to land nukes until 10sec+ into the fight. Concussion is 2.0 sec cast+2.25 sec spell refresh, so 8.5 sec before you can start casting first draught.<br />
<br />
If you had been smart and created a paladin or SK for your wizard boxing team you would be chaining draugths just after incoming, so I dont know what your point is.<br />
<br />
And draughts are the lowest agro wizzy nuke there is, its not hard at all to keep agro from a wizard casting that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did this morning is after i use incite I <br />
<br />
cast 1 draught<br />
cast 1 concussion<br />
cast 2 draught<br />
cast 1 concussion<br />
cast draught until mob is dead.<br />
<br />
I figure a concussion prior to a draught is wasted.... <br />
<br />
So 2 concussions total and I can chain draught until mob is dead. <br />
<br />
I dont have the SCS3 yet cause i never had a need for it (I would just nuke and take agro with the wizards and hope to get it with the warrior), but it will be my next AA's to get for sure.<br />
<br />
Maybe not full lock but 2 concussions (2.0 cast and 2.5 refreash) for full nuking the rest of the time is great....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, the changes do allow warriors to handle agro much better now...but it is definitely not the same agro lock ability that knights have.  (and I not personally want anyone to have agro lock, so it's not a jealousy thing on my part)</div></div><hr />

Even a Monk can out-aggro Draughts.</div></div><hr />

SoS or Agnarr's on the other hand....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh ya I attack with the warrior. I consider him a &quot;DPS warrior&quot;, 19delay 15damage main and 19dealy 14damage offhand - I was using him basically only for DPS prior to the &quot;goodies for warrior&quot; patch heh.... <br />
<br />
not sure what wpns is but the proc on the 19del15dam is a AC reducer which is kinda like a stun for agro.. it fires I never parsed it, ususaly one or two times per mob, nice effect big red ball kinda really easy to see.<br />
<br />
The other has no proc. I will probabaly put a EB type proc on my mainhander as I might never get better being unguilded.... <br />
<br />
I really dont think Agnarrs is wise, I have it on all 4 my wizards but dont use it becuse of the resist better on draughts and I really hate to over nuke. Because I am spamming nukes and cant duck (not enough keys on my keyboard for all 6 toons to do everything lol) I cant stop a nuke once it starts and to lose all that mana on a Agnarrs is really bad for me..... <br />
<br />
Also the ice draught is nice caus eyou can get a 8000pp item (ornate spectre) that has a focus for ice thats up to 23percent extra damage....  I am working on getting a Manaperservation III item right now then I can use Ice spear of Soloist and the level 63 spell that lets you get 35percent (up to) more damage form it. Then Ill have lower mana cost and more damage on the same spell heh....<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey my head item costs me like 60,000pp, dont want to lose it and its the best spot for haste I thinks...</div></div><hr />

Fella.... *shakes his head* You're hella stupid. Sorry, it had to be said. <br />

Please, someone Outhouse this so I can actually lay into this moron properly. <br />
<br />
Incite in its current form has few uses - very few uses, aggro lock is not one of them... <br />
<br />
The saddest part of all is that a Warrior has to explain HOW WIZARDS WORK TO YOU - SAM DA MAN DEATHWALKER - and Jesus H. Christ, with that INSANE COMBO of Spells you used on the Ench, a level 9 Bard would still have a 50/50 chance of keeping aggro over your &quot;Super Special Friends.&quot;<br />

Furor I owned you so bad on yur forum that you had to ban me. Ya outhouse be good idea, I to would like to take off the kid gloves.<br />
<br />
Lots of conclusory allegation, as usual, with no facts to support your position.<br />
<br />
<br />
Incite seems to be a agro lock on mobs up to level 64ish or so, assuming everyone in the group is doing their job properly, and not purposly trying to get agro. Most exping is done on mobs 64 or less so I would conclude that for exping purposes incite is basically an agro lock. Espically duel weilding EB weapons (plus 2 additional agro procs with auguments) plus taunt, as you dont have to 2H on level 64 mobs... <br />
<br />
The reason incite is a agro lock is beacuse its in addition to the tools we had prior, none of which was garenteeded to generate agro instantly. Now if we pull, toss in a few arrows, incite and taunt, and then randomly proc agro lock probability is looking good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Furor, yur toon is a 8 second kill to me (3 lures, 1 manaburn and rapture and probably group heal with cleric).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So whats Furor gonna do? Come to Sullon and say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. DeathWalker, Sir - I'd like to Killzor you wid my uber toon! Would you PLEEEEZE log yur other five so that I can?&quot; LOLOLOL.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry to degenerate the thread but as you can see there is a bit of history between us.... <br />
<br />
http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=5328  <br />
<br />
It's simple really, you're a tool that doesn't understand (1) How wizard nukes work in regards to aggro generation, (2) How aggro in general works, (3) How to play a Warrior, down to basic principles of how the 'Taunt' button works, (4) What is defined as 'aggro lock,' which would be an overstatement given your post and play history.<br />
<br />
All of the above has been efficiently demonstrated, not by me, but by your own sorry self in this and other threads. <br />
<br />
By the way, only a complete fucking nimcomshit (i.e. you) would link a post in which they were so clearly owned by a solid 30+ people and ended up in the Rickshaw Hall of Fame. This is a common occurance in retarded children that have cruel jokes played on them by the mean kiddies - they laugh and laugh not realizing that the joke was on them; It's funny, as funny as seeing someone anally impaled on a flagpole could be anyway. Tragically funny...<br />
<br />
Plz don't PK me Sam, your burst DPS is too power.<br />
<br />
P.S. You explaining the Warrior class to me is about as hilarious as Corky trying to explain the Theory of Relativity to Einstein. If you had half a brain, you'd actually know where Incite came from... I'll give you a clue, it's a Taunt DoT. Look it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Words fail me when trying to describe the absolute pointlessness, self-indulgence and stupidity of some of your posts. <br />
<br />
Let's see here, Furor is the leader of one of the first guilds to reach Plane of Time and has earned his gear through countless raids. I don't know him personally and don't even allways agree with all he says, but the odds are on he's going to know a shedload about how the PVE environment works. <br />
<br />
You on the other hand are someone who obviousely has far too much time and money on his hands and very few friends.(who the hell would try and six box, when you can actually group and /gasp interact with other people) Your magelo simply proves you have a huge supply of pp and know absolutely nothing of the high-end game. <br />
<br />
I really hope you piss more people off so you get banned from this board as well and we never need to read your innane wibble ever again. <br />
I mean, what on earth are you hoping to achieve with posting all this nonsense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Esvee you agree with Furor that Incite is basically usless? And you won't be using it on every mob in exp situations to get agro?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DeathWalker: &quot;Incite is an agro lock on mobs under level 64&quot;.<br />
<br />
Furor: &quot;Incite in its current form has few uses - very few uses, aggro lock is not one of them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Esvee in this thread: &quot;Furor is the leader of one of the first guilds to reach Plane of Time and has earned his gear through countless raids&quot;<br />
<br />
Esvee in another thread: &quot;Aggro was pretty consistent with incite.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't belive that any Warrior who has incite and the endurence to use it will not use it on every exp mob they can.... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Umm why are you using incite then?<br />

 Did a hard Everfrost adventure with top guild pally yesterday. We basically took turns tanking, letting me stonewall on the odd accidental multiple mob pull to conserve mana, so I got a pretty good chance to compare; <br />
<br />
Aggro was pretty consistent with incite. The only problem came when taunt failed before mez breaking, Incite would not scrape aggro off the enc after. <br />
<br />
Then again, even if the Paladin stunned before breaking mez and his taunt failed, he would have the same problem, his advantage being he can recast. <br />
<br />
I agree with most here, it is exactly what it says on the tin and basically is what we asked for.<br />

<br />
I wasn't even just talking about Incite you moron, but all the other dribbling ramblings and self-promoting rubbish you post on this board. <br />
<br />
Your penis must be shorter than that of a gnat if you need to compensate by posting your alleged superiority on every single EQ board known to man. What the hell do you expect is going to happen? People are going to thank you, you are going to have more sex than a rabbit in spring and you will actually feel you have something resembling a life?<br />
<br />
And Incite is not aggro lock, it is a nice boost; If you ever even came close to something even remotely resembling a raid encounter you'd see it wasn't either. <br />
<br />
I'm done with this; Maybe it s our fault for giving you the attention you crave and ignoring you will make you slither back into whatever dump it is you live in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda out of order but here is my replies to Furor:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furor has been spewing his usual regurgitated drivil over at Steel Warrior and so that him and me can take off the kid gloves I making my replies here.<br />
<br />
I can't wait for WoW to be released for 2 reasons. 1) We'll be rid of you. 2) Two weeks after its released we won't have to hear about how its better then EQ any more.<br />
<br />
You can't serisouly suggest that after these recent upgrades to warriors you will STILL BE WHINNING like a stick pig that warriors is underbalenced. SOE has done their ususal excellent job and should be congratulated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything you say is conclusory allegation. Not a single fact to support any of yur conclusions. The simple fact is that incite, along with our other tools, provides agro lock on exp mobs.... I don't see a single word in yur post that proves otherwise. As I stated agaisnt a level 62 unslowable mob I:<br />
<br />
Pull with warrior arrows, pump in some more, auto attack on and incite. I then get random procs from my main hand that has a AC reduction proc (like a stun for agro).<br />
<br />
Wizards then cast draugt, concussion, 2 more draughts, one more concusion then draught until mob is dead (about 5000K damage total each wizard) and never get summoned... sounds like agro lock to me.... <br />
<br />
<br />
Furor you were owned so badly and obvioulsy that you had to lock the thread and ban me from yur forum LOL..... <br />
<br />
There is no question my 6 toons would slaughter yur one toon. And if GoD expansion gives leadership points for leading a 6 man group then one of my toons will have more leadership points then yur sorry toon will ever have. And by the way I one human soloed a LDoN the other day - something you will never do.<br />
<br />
And Esvee we are talking here about mobs level 64 and under, you are not going to seriously suggest that Furor has killed more mobs of that level then someone who has 7 level 65 toons that he took from level 1 (none of my toons are ebayed I took them all from level 1 and no one has ever played any of them except me) (and each has about 100AA average). How many mobs you think I have killed to get that much exp points? I have 600-700AA total and 455 plus levels in exp .... heh.<br />

No doubt Furor endgame exp is way more then mine, but level 64 and under mobs.... well we will see so far he has said nothing factual to back up his position that incite is usless.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't even just talking about Incite you moron, but all the other dribbling ramblings and self-promoting rubbish you post on this board. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well the title of the thread is about Incite, so you are saying that I am wrong in general, but just not on this subject in particular?<br />
Yes I promot myself, but then so do many.<br />

Your penis must be shorter than that of a gnat if you need to compensate by posting your alleged superiority on every single EQ board known to man. What the hell do you expect is going to happen? People are going to thank you, you are going to have more sex than a rabbit in spring and you will actually feel you have something resembling a life?<br />

50 posts on this forum so far Evsee... very nice, in only 311 more posts you will have as many posts as I have had women in bed<br />

And Incite is not aggro lock, it is a nice boost; If you ever even came close to something even remotely resembling a raid encounter you'd see it wasn't either. <br />
<br />
<br />
I am talking about mobs sub level 64, doubt you need a raid for them.</div></div><hr />

I can't find it, but I can say for certain that it was sugggested first by Furor about a year or so ago really close to what Incite is today. And you pwned noone Sam, for real. Your Kung Fu is weak.<br />

<br />
He didn't say that Sam.<br />
<br />
Here's what he said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Incite in its current form has few uses - very few uses, aggro lock is not one of them... &quot;<br />
<br />
He's basically trying to do two things:<br />
<br />
1- Demonstrate your definition of 'aggro lock' is wrong in comparrison to his.<br />
<br />
2- That the uses for this skill are not quite how you perceive them to be.<br />
<br />
He didn't say it was useless. He said you weren't using it properly.<br />
<br />
You should probably debate him on those grounds, as really, you're just fuelling the fire if you continue to argue with him about it being useless, since that's not at all what he was saying.<br />
<br />
He's calling you out as a warrior. Not the incite skill.</div></div><hr />

Agro lock means only one thing. You get initial agro and you keep it. What else might it mean?<br />
<br />
Well the skill give you 400points of agro initially and additonal points over time. Dosnt seem any other way to use it cept to get agro... And clearly the sooner you use it the better I woud think... I can't really think of any more effieict way to use a Aggro DoT cept as soon as you can... <br />

I can't debate air... general &quot;calling me out as a warrior&quot; lacks specificity. If he has some spicific point to make lets hear it. Sides I am not just a warrior I am 7 toons... <br />

Things went extrememly well for me with this patch. I had weapons that looked really good and with solid DPS but my agro was lacking. Now with the patch I get all three - agro lock for exp mobs, good looks and solid DPS. I toss a EB aug on my mainhand and I be roxor for sure.<br />

<br />
 Let's review, kids!<br />
<br />
 'Aggro lock'. That's NOT 'having aggro' or 'holding aggro'. That's lock. The difference? With aggro lock, NO possible action any of your other 5 toons could do would peel the mob off your tank. You're not doing that in your setup, since you are taking anti-aggro precautions with your toons, therefore no aggro lock. Period. End of story. QED.<br />
<br />
 Of course, I'm still waiting for some dumbshit to sell you a Bard so you can figure how to destroy your rep at those class boards as well. Should be entertaining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agro lock means only one thing. You get initial agro and you keep it. What else might it mean?<br />
<br />
So I guess when you're soloing Fire Beetles in Qeynos you're achieving aggro lock? No, aggro lock does not mean getting initial aggro and keeping it while having your botted gimps using spells that have zero to low aggro in controlled environments wherein you call all the shots. Your problem is, nobody in their right fucking mind would group with you to demonstrate how REAL grouping and team play in Everquest work, so you're off in your own little world drawing up these twisted scenarios of 'Aggro Lock.' What you are experiencing in your retarded (and this is quite the understatement) groups, is 'pussy lock,' Where that tic-tac sized penis of yours is kept in check by the large gaping vag on your forehead, preventing you from casting spells that actually DRAW aggro.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee guys, I have cast 17 times with my Staff of Temperate Flux and my Warrior has managed to somehow retain aggro - IT MUST BE INCITE that's making all of this a glorious happening.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fuck, your stupidity is astounding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well the skill give you 400points of agro initially and additonal points over time. Dosnt seem any other way to use it cept to get agro... And clearly the sooner you use it the better I woud think...

You should tattoo this on your forehead and wear a special hat with mirror attachment that only requires you to focus your eyes upwards 2 millimeters to read this paragraph, make sure it's under the &quot;I'm with the other pedophile,&quot; Tattoo that's already on your forehead so as not to confuse onlookers. Let me see what possible purpose Incite can have.... how bout this: In environments where multiple mobs enter your camp and you need to triage the fight scene, you use Incite to layer aggro on messed and controlled mobs. How about when you have 3 - 4 800 dps mobs coming into your raid camp and you need to split them between 3-4 warrior tanks on the INC? How about when you're trying to establish a multi-tank crowd control scenario and require that a certain amount of aggro be established on incoming to allow your cleric to heal past the initial arbitration and subsequent asspounding (you're familiar with this term, it's what I'm doing to you right now, but not the physical asspounding you so enjoy with the spiked 18 inch Godzilla dildo - I'm speaking in metaphor). <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Look up the word conclusory and then look up the word allegation. Also look up the word 'WE.' We denotes more than one and is usually used in connotation of more than one person. In your case, 'We' means you + your other 5 'You.' Seek professional help. SURELY you cannot be claiming 'WE' as the Warrior caste in Everquest. If that were the case, WE would all need to drink the purple Kool-Aid and be done with it... The last thing WE need is for an ill-informed sycophant such as yourself to even assume he's part of our team, let alone stake a claim as a member of the more experienced Warriors at TSW and Warriors at large. <br />
<br />
YOU should be licking my nuts in respect and admiration, because without ME and many other hard working warriors that (1) INVENTED these tools and (2) Spent many, many, many a late night on the Beta server testing said changes... well nevermind, you would still be a syphillis infested 38 year old man-beast living in your mother's basement, playing Everquest out of a hospital bed and buying the occasional crab infested whore with your welfare checks. The point is lost.<br />
<br />
I can't debate air... general &quot;calling me out as a warrior&quot; lacks specificity. If he has some spicific point to make lets hear it. Sides I am not just a warrior I am 7 toons... <br />
<br />
You're not a warrior. You will never be a warrior. You lack the instruments. Those instruments are also referred to as BALLS and a BRAIN. You have neither.<br />

I've 2 and 3 boxed LDoN adventures for shits and giggles. Had I had enough time, I'd solo them (and in my world, Solo actually means BY MYSELF not with 5 other boxes that I happen to run). The important part of your last inane sentence, though, is the 'one human' comment. That is something you will never be able to lay claim to - in this world, you are an insect...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, should have added this.  &quot;Aggro lock&quot; doesn't just mean you get it and you keep it.  It means you get it and no one in the game can take it from you no matter what they do.  &quot;Holding Aggro&quot; is getting it and keeping it.<br />
<br />
To put it another way:<br />
<br />
&quot;Aggro lock&quot; is basically &quot;Holding aggro&quot;, but has the &quot;no chance in hell of losing it unless I die no matter what anyone else does or when they do it (besides a Taunt skill or possibly Frenzy agro)&quot; added on to it.<br />
<br />
If you can pound your most aggro intensive spells right off the bat (99% health or so) and it stays on the tank without using Taunt, then you have aggro lock, even with other people besides you playing the casters.</div></div><hr />

Good trick is to make yur HotKey for incite (Combat ability one) the same as a hot box social hot key (doability 1 for example is taunt) that way both will fire at the same time (Woot!).<br />
<br />
Why in hell would I possibly do this?<br />
I use taunt to get aggro IF I do not have it. <br />
Why blow my taunt if I already have aggro with incite?<br />
Why blow my taunt if I lose aggro shortly after using incite?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Halivon</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's so much static on this thread that one hardly knows what is worth reading or not but here goes my 2c.<br />
<br />
I recently (about 2 weeks ago) acquired a BoC, that was a huge upgrade comparing to the weapons I had, not important what they were, just suffice to say that I started gaining and retaining agro a lot easier.<br />
Of course it would not be always the same every day or every group, I group with diff people and they don't all play the same... some slow sooner, others nuke later but the fact is the BoC made my day and made me a happy Warrior, I had 'some' agro at last and that made me a more attractive tank too. (status? p3n15 size syndrome?)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I still had to use some tricks like sitting to position a mob while engaged, use disarm (lets not discuss the sex of the angels over this one) and also a beg (I am an optimist) just in case it makes anything, etc... but not as often as before.<br />
<br />
Then came the Incite and I must say it made my day, it certainly is not agro lock as I would call it, and I don't care who owns the definition of agro lock.<br />
<br />
On the day the new skills were implemented I took part of a Emperor of ssra kill and I was one of the TMers, let me tell you that my target pre-targeted and I pulled him out of the crowd of ADDS with an Incite and kept it up with a shield and attack off only using taunt and incite, np there, I loved it.<br />
<br />
Today, my experience as a Warrior is much better than ever before, there is no rule as how I use the new skills, as in all, depends on the composition of the group or the raid, or the place I am at.<br />
If I am not pulling I tend to use taunt + incite (or bellow if the taunt lands just for the sake of endurance savings), If I am pulling I tend to leave incite up in case I loose agro and have verified that I get it back a little faster, one thing I must say, I always taunt before using the agro dot, call me mad but I think taunt fails a lot more if used after provoke line skill and it works better than incite.<br />
I love the way the new skills and discs work as it gives me more control over my potential, a warrior has now the tools to be a good tank as before we didn't.<br />
<br />
Again, and hoping people can talk in a civilized way, (this is my opinion), I do not believe that it gives any warrior agro lock, it does give warriors a better control over agro and how to maintain it (dot effect) and if we look at the package instead of just the incite line then it gives us the potential to be better tanks overall. <br />
<br />
Hali<br />
<br />
P.S. Sam, as a suggestion for something that may clear this, try this once, just over nuke with the wizards and enc on purpose, debuff it on arrival, have the cleric heal positioned on top of the war (like they have to do in many ldon adventures), if its locked you don't have to fear loosing agro at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Until you start grouping with other people, I can't take any of your 'grouping' posts seriously (and I suspect most everyone else here feels the same way.)<br />
<br />
If you want to discuss game dynamics from the perspective of a soloer with 6 boxes...hmm....maybe you should make a special forum for that one :p .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well my error I see you want SOE to give warriors an ability that will allow them to keep agro no matter what any other class does. <br />
<br />
Right under that definition I am not getting anywhere near agro lock. And it seems at no time will anyone (espicially warriors) get agro lock if all the other 5 people in your group are spicifically trying to take agro casting spells that have no purpose other then getting them agro. So you have a term that defines a situation that will basically never occur in normal play.<br />
<br />
Let me restate it then. I have agro lock under cercumstances where all members of the group are engaged in resonable play towards the common goal of killing the mob. <br />
<br />
Or I could just say &quot;Incite gives agro balance or something&quot;.... clearly the closest term to getting and holding agro we have is agro lock.<br />
<br />
Furor no doubt you have contributed well enough in the past (I don't know about &quot;counteless hours&quot; seeing you have a job and I don't [being a landlord I have already won at life], its clear enough I play more hours then you do, as the time you spend working I am able to spend on this game) ... but a simple glance at FoH boards shows nothing but whinning and crying about most everything SOE does, as of late, and yur endless claim you will go to WoW (whats the hold up with that exactly). <br />
<br />
Warriors got a very large upgrade with Incite, regardless of yur lamer flamer opinion. I still don't hear you singing praises to SOE for these long overdue upgrades, rather crying like a little girl that you can't get agro with the new tools if the other 5 in your group are trying to steal it from you. <br />
<br />
Why blow my taunt if I lose aggro shortly after using incite?<br />
<br />
When would you use taunt except when you lose aggro? You want to get snap agro on incoming, and taunt and incite at the same time seem a good method to grab it. Maybe if you did a taunt when you did the incite you would not have lost the agro. Again I can see no reason in waiting to use either. And having both to one key means you can spam the one key and as soon as either is up it fires. Of course if you only play one toon I suppose you are not doing a whole lot anyway, but if you are too busy then this might save some time.<br />
<br />
I don't really think anyone is arguing anymore that they have more DPS then I do, or that Furor could beat me 1v6. As many have stated 1v6 is not fair - so true its not fair that I am so much stonger then Furor da Feeble is.<br />
<br />
<br />
In environments where multiple mobs enter your camp and you need to triage the fight scene, you use Incite to layer aggro on messed and controlled mobs. How about when you have 3 - 4 800 dps mobs coming into your raid camp and you need to split them between 3-4 warrior tanks on the INC? How about when you're trying to establish a multi-tank crowd control scenario and require that a certain amount of aggro be established on incoming to allow your cleric to heal past the initial arbitration and subsequent asspounding (you're familiar with this term, it's what I'm doing to you right now, but not the physical asspounding you so enjoy with the spiked 18 inch Godzilla dildo - I'm speaking in metaphor).<br />
<br />
&quot;Incite in its current form has few uses - very few uses, aggro lock is not one of them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ya well ur top arguments support my argument that Incite is an extremely valuable tool. Also obviously 3-4 warrior tanks spliting 3-4 800dps mobs is a raid situation, and I am speaking only to exp situations.<br />
<br />
I kill mobs under level 64 and have probably killed more then anyone, I have grouped with others many times, but correct most my experience is solo six boxing. I think the first post in the thread makes it clear enough what I am doing. If you prefer people who have experience with random pick up groups where some members are not playing at optimal levels then as you say you should consider their advise as superior to mine. And I don't claim to know about high end raid situations or much about mobs over level 66ish or so, note my initial post did not mention such mobs. There is no doubt that Furor and most anyone in a full time raiding guild has greater knowledge of raid mobs then I do. On the other hand though, Furor could have the best item in the game in every slot and rapture, 3 lures and manaburn, plus some cleric spell will still kill him. No matter what he does (unless he six box also), what I control in game will destroy what he has in game any time.<br />
<br />
Furor sorry to doubt you but lets see the SS of you successfully 2 boxing a LDoN by yurself, and a pic of the computer set up you used (or that you used EQ windows). Yur credibility with me is not the highest.<br />
<br />
Speaking of SS lets see what yur Furor da Feeble looks like - doubt if its anywhere near as impressive as me:<br />

<br />
Firstly, NO warrior in the game (warrior, not a cleric pussy w/ multiple personalities and a penchant for minor nuking) wants aggro lock in any situations.  Paladins currently have it or very close to it.  Warriors want to be able to get groups and do our one and only job effeciently.  So, yes, we needed 'snap' aggro at range and Incite has done wonders for that aspect.  Pallys will still get the groups over us until their stuns are fixed, so we've gained nothing.  True aggro lock would trivialize the game.  Itemization is trivializing the game.<br />
<br />
Please stop spouting off about talking about group dynamics and experience play.  You are a soloer...all 6 or 7 or 12 of you.  Just like your sex life....doesn't matter how many dolls, you are still the only real person there.  Although, person seems a bit strong to use.  <br />
<br />
I know a lot of very intelligent ppl and I've seen quite a few very intelligent posts on this and other boards.  At times, it's made me start to wonder why the average IQ is so low.  Then someone like you comes along and makes it all real clear.<br />

How can you say warriors dont want agro lock, of course we do. Warriors have Stonewall and high AC and can take more damage then any other class.<br />
<br />
The warriors one job is to get agro and keep it, and hopefully do some resonable DPS in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Pallys will get groups over warriors when the mobs they are killing cannot kill the Pallies, when the mobs get stronger then the pallies then eyes will turn to warriors. <br />
<br />
I agree that true aggro lock would trivialize the game. As stated in my first post exp groups is all but trivial with Incite.<br />

You say that warriors dont want aggro lock in any situation but that groups perfer palidens over warriros becuase palidens have close to agro lock and then say I'm a moron.......</div></div><hr />

My understanding is that taunt, if succesfull, give you one more point of hate then the person highest on the list. I guess if you are highest on the list, then taunt is usless (although it does seem to be succesfull on its forth try almost always....). If you lost agro with incite then I can only assume you are not highest on the list. I am not sure which fires first when you press both at the same time, but incite first then taunt would be best. But then if you have agro you didnt need taunt, but it comes up again so fast I dont really see the need to hoard it. So I don't buy this &quot;wasted&quot; taunt theory. Sure if it had a 3 mintue refreash you would not want to waste it when you have agro but considering that its refreash is so fast so what I say. Also is is far from clear that an unsecessful taunt does you no advantage at all as to later uses, in which case its better to use it. And if its sucessful then obvoulsy you should have used it lol... <br />
<br />
I just can't see that you are better off waiting to taunt - you taunt at the first possible oppotunity and you incite at the first possible opportunity.<br />
<br />
Ya I think that 6 boxing, in controled situations, like I discribed in the first post of this thread is way more efficient then 6 seperate people. I kill the mobs with minimal mana usage and dont lose agro with the warrior. Naturally in fluid situations where you cant social the whole encounter, 6 people are more efficient. Like I stated I do almost nothing in killing these LairTT mobs.</div></div><hr />

Well my error I see you want SOE to give warriors an ability that will allow them to keep agro no matter what any other class does.  <br />
<br />
Adding agro lock is not what the posts on this thread have been asking for.  The posts have just been (rightfully) correcting your terminology. YOU were the one that said warriors now had agro lock.  Let me state it again:  &quot;warriors do not have agro lock...they have improved agro capabilities.&quot;  This does not mean I want or don't want agro lock...it's merely a statement of what the current situation is, end of story.<br />
<br />
Right under that definition I am not getting anywhere near agro lock. And it seems at no time will anyone (espicially warriors) get agro lock if all the other 5 people in your group are spicifically trying to take agro casting spells that have no purpose other then getting them agro. So you have a term that defines a situation that will basically never occur in normal play.<br />
<br />
Let me restate it then. I have agro lock under cercumstances where all members of the group are engaged in resonable play towards the common goal of killing the mob. <br />
<br />
Or I could just say &quot;Incite gives agro balance or something&quot;.... clearly the closest term to getting and holding agro we have is agro lock. <br />
<br />
If no other classes in game had the ability to hold agro better than warriors could (with the recent changes) then your loose definition of agro lock could be somewhat acceptable...but, the fact is knights can still hold agro much better than warriors.  Before you quote me out of context...I didn't say this was a problem...I'm merely stating that, even with the changes, warriors are not the best tank class at holding agro.  Therefore, to say warriors have agro lock is abviously a misuse of the term because you have to have a term for knight agro capabilities (hmm....maybe they have &quot;super agro lock&quot;  :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
Warriors got a very large upgrade with Incite, regardless of yur lamer flamer opinion. <br />
<br />
Nobody said warriors didn't get an upgrade - we definitely did.  Note:  even SOE says more is probably needed - check their website if you don't believe me.<br />
<br />
When would you use taunt except when you lose aggro? You want to get snap agro on incoming, and taunt and incite at the same time seem a good method to grab it. Maybe if you did a taunt when you did the incite you would not have lost the agro. Again I can see no reason in waiting to use either.  <br />
<br />
Ok, I'll take this one as an honest question as opposed to an ill-informed statement.  The reason you don't want to constantly use incite is because the endurance pool is limited.  If you use incite constantly you won't have enough endurance left for those critical times when you need to use other disciplines.  I realize this may never be an issue for you since you always control the entire group, but in pu groups and raids, having the ability to use other disciplines is key.  (and, yes, I tested clicking incite constantly with max'd stats to see if it would drain my endurance pool...it does, and my statement is not some random speculation)<br />
<br />
Ya well ur top arguments support my argument that Incite is an extremely valuable tool.  <br />
<br />
I agree on the &quot;valuable tool&quot; part...I'm just not sure why you feel you must use the term &quot;lock&quot; when it most definitely isn't a lock and not even the best agro in the game?!?<br />

<br />
 improved agro capabilities<br />
<br />
super agro lock<br />
<br />
agro balance or something<br />
<br />
<br />
Well its clear enough that everyone has their own definition of what agro lock mean and you guys are just fishing for some term to differentiate what you mean from what I mean. It does not seems there is any common term that everyone uses....<br />
<br />
Whatever I never lose agro on mobs under level 64ish.... <br />
<br />
Humm what you say is mostly true, not a lot to argue with.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Usually the mob is dead in like 30 seconds, and there is not time for incite to come up again so I dont see any reason not to spam it. But ya it would be foolish to use it at start and then again just before the mob is dead. Once at the start per mob seems about optimal.<br />
<br />
I dont have a endurence bar on my UI yet so I don't know whats up with that but I have never gotten any odd message saying that the Incite failed for some reason or other so I don't know if its an issue or not. Also I am on horse back a lot so I dont know whats up with that either. But my sta is like 220ish. <br />

How can you say warriors dont want agro lock, of course we do.  <br />
<br />
I'm a warrior and I don't want agro lock.  I want a fun, challenging game.  Yes, knights have better agro (not sure I'd call it &quot;locked&quot;, but close enough), but as a game concept that kind of agro control is boring to me.<br />
<br />
You say that warriors dont want aggro lock in any situation but that groups perfer palidens over warriros becuase palidens have close to agro lock and then say I'm a moron.......  <br />
<br />
Just because one type of class works a certain way doesn't mean players of another class want their class to work the same way.  That's not a logical assertion on your part...that's a rather poor attempt at manipulating someone else's statements.<br />
<br />
Come back when you are ready to have an intelligent debate...preferably after you have actual experience grouping with other people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason you do not understand mob aggro is directly related to the fact that you play on a PvP grief server.<br />
<br />
I'm sure 4 wizards all landing a Draught at once really pisses people off in PvP.  950dd X 4 = 3,800 damage.  And since you have such an unclever naming convention for your characters, everyone knows it's from one sad guy in a hostpital bed.  So YOU, SAM get 3,800 damage worth of hate. <br />
<br />
The same thing in PvE, however... you may as well hit mobs with four Giant &quot;#1&quot; Foam Fingers with the words &quot;Chicago Cubs&quot; rubbed off and &quot;Sam Da Man&quot; scribbled on with a Sharpie. <br />
<br />
The mob doesn't compute 3,800 hate that no warrior could possibly outtaunt without a long lead or an AA ability.  It gets an easily managed 950 on 4 different targets.  A round of melee and a weapon proc will &quot;Aggro Lock&quot; in this situation, regardless of the new stamina-draining abilities.<br />
<br />
Let me put this into perspective.  I, alone, (just me, my JTB and my Ifir), have had single combat rounds that outdamage your 4 wizard self circle-jerk all landing Draughts at the same time.  From MELEE range, which compounds the hate.  This is also during NORMAL MELEE, which means, I continue to beat ass and don't stop to wait for a recast timer.<br />
<br />
I can get 2999 crits, 1600 normal, 600 minimum, up to two every 5 seconds on top of 200 to 400 normal melee for well over 400 constant, consistent DPS (now for 30 to 35 seconds).  All that aggro onto one character, not split evenly between 4.<br />
<br />
When I'm going balls-out, and Kreugen (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16471) or Xate (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=698293) have Honest to God Aggro Lock, I don't have to worry about things like &quot;did evade fail more than twice in a row?&quot; or &quot;did my deaggro proc land?&quot; or &quot;shit, is Escape up so I don't gib if the MT dies?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's AGGRO LOCKED.  Nothing I can do can get the mob off them.  Not even dropping deaggro weapons and equipping snare daggers.  I've tried.<br />
<br />
In the same situation where a warrior claims he has aggro lock, it is only by the grace of the RNG and my evade key.<br />
<br />
Try Strike of Solusek, or you may as well be testing &quot;End-Game&quot; Warrior Aggro Lock when chaining Burst of Flame.</div></div><hr />

What makes things worse (for us, believe me for us) is that people from his own server understand the mind of a sycophant like Sam and continue to 'egg him on,' forcing him to continue spewing his senseless babble. <br />
<br />
This is how Sam validates his life. He's like that goofy uncle you may have that's going through a mid life crisis and starts to try and 'act cool.' In Sam's brain, all of this has made him 'cooler.' &quot;CHUG ANOTHER BOTTLE OF RUBBING ALCOHOL UNCLE SAMMY! YOU'RE THE KOOKIEST!!!!&quot; And Sam obediently follows through with the request...<br />

I suppose a time equiped SK or Pal will be able to lock agro in the face of 400dps for 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
Thats very interesting to claim 400dps over 30 seconds, Id like to also see a log of that, I was under the impression that non rampage pbaoe warrior dps was like 160ish or so... <br />
<br />
No matter at 1100 damage each wizard every 5 seconds (and total 1000 from the combined chatner and cleric nukes), thats like 1000 or so dps for me, and I can do that for 60ish seconds, so my single person 30ish seconds dps crown is safe. Also thats just using draughts.... naturally with agnarrs I will do better.<br />
<br />
I mean so what is your point, ya SK and Pally can still out agro us... that dosn't seem to be in dispute. And you can do good dps, also not in dispute. Can you hold agro with Incite as against others who are resonable in their use of spells? Can you hold agro better with Incite then you could before as against others who are resonable in their use of spells?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand the comparision to SK and Pally doing their absolute best to get agro, why should they even try and keep agro from you with stuns if you can  tank the mobs better then they can due to stonewall? If they can keep agro and not die then I would agree warriors are not needed, but if they are going up against high dps mobs without stonewall or inate mitigation then I would think they would die or casue the clerics to use up more mana... <br />
<br />
Anyway not much to argue with there what you say is generally correct....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furor you also have nothing to say about incite, damage mitigation, agro or anything of value as ususal. Just boiler plate random insults that you can use against anyone at any time.<br />

I won;t waste my time trying to argue the finer points of aggro, aggro lock, and controling ones aggro; simply this would just be wasted effort.  You neither listen to a well reasoned arguement, nor would you be open to alternate view points.<br />

I do have to say you win the moron of the year award for 6 boxing.  The whole point of EQ is to play with other people; If you want to solo 6 box the game . . . play baldur's gate 2; it's a wonderful game and you can 6 box to your hearts content.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You want to get snap agro on incoming, and taunt and incite at the same time seem a good method to grab it. Maybe if you did a taunt when you did the incite you would not have lost the agro. Again I can see no reason in waiting to use either. And having both to one key means you can spam the one key and as soon as either is up it fires.<br />
<br />
Wow...<br />
Im not going to flame you here because you seriously dont know.<br />
If I do taunt and incite at the same time and lose aggro, it will take 6 seconds for Taunt to refresh. Thats baaaad.<br />
<br />
The only time I would do something similar would be if a wizzy crit nuked. I would then taunt praying for success then Incite to stabalize. But NEVER would I put them on the same button. They serve two different functions.<br />
One gives you raw hate, the other puts you on top on the hate list. You use them based on the situation, you DO NOT fire them up when ever they are free to use.<br />
<br />
I want snap aggro on incoming?<br />
I have had snap aggro on incoming with Incite by itself every single time. (And I have taunt available if someone gets unlucky or does something dumb after I get this initial snap aggro)<br />

I really wanted to flame you on this next one, but again.<br />
You are new to the Warrior class and simply dont know.<br />

The vast majority of us dont because it would destroy all class balance, trivialize the game, and make any stratagy pretty much meaningless. SoE will never give warriors any kind of aggro lock...<br />
And for good reason.<br />
<br />
This one however..<br />
<br />
The simple fact is that incite, along with our other tools, provides agro lock on exp mobs.... <br />
<br />
The simple fact is a Wizzy, Shaman, and Necro can easily shatter any percieved aggro lock you think you have if they want to.<br />
And they can do so on a whim.<br />
For shits and giggles.<br />
Just for fun.<br />
<br />
SoE simply will not allow warriors to have aggro lock.<br />
It would destroy their game.</div></div><hr />

Slansin, well ya everything you say is correct. I suppose a time equiped SK or Pal will be able to lock agro in the face of 400dps for 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
Thats very interesting to claim 400dps over 30 seconds, Id like to also see a log of that, I was under the impression that non rampage pbaoe warrior dps was like 160ish or so...  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't know about warrior DPS.  I'm a Rogue.  Did you think a 2999 crit was from some secret discipline tome nobody clued you in on?  Did you miss where I discussed Evade, Escape, and Deaggro procs?  How would a warrior get such abilities?  What kind of warrior goes for deaggro, specifically?<br />
<br />
Yes, Duelist and Deadeye can get my DPS well over 400.  Deadly Precision can get me there too, if the RNG is being nice.<br />
<br />
Can I donate to a &quot;Move Sam Deathwalker to Veeshan&quot; fund?  Set up a paypal for it.  No, really.  I'd like to see your 6 go up against Furor + any 2 he chooses to box.  It'd be great entertainment watching you backpedal and rationalize the loss.<br />
<br />
Hell, I'd be anxious to see how many of your wizards I could knock off before you gave in and manaburned me.   Given their magelos (even fully buffed) they can't be more than 3 combat rounds from behind...  I'd wager I could down 2 of them before you could say &quot;Heidi Fleiss&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's always been known, that a Wizards first rule in EQ, is to learn how NOT to get aggro.<br />
All the way back from the golden days of newbie hood to the present days.<br />
<br />
However - With a Knight, this is no longer the case.<br />
If a Paladin is intent on holding aggro, a Wizard can chain his biggest nuke until he's OOM and the MOB will still be on the Paladin.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is wrong and bad for the game.<br />

And Esvee we are talking here about mobs level 64 and under, you are not going to seriously suggest that Furor has killed more mobs of that level then someone who has 7 level 65 toons that he took from level 1 (none of my toons are ebayed I took them all from level 1 and no one has ever played any of them except me) (and each has about 100AA average). How many mobs you think I have killed to get that much exp points? I have 600-700AA total and 455 plus levels in exp .... heh. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ill bet you ive killed more mobs of that level than all your characters combined, maybe twice as many, hell maybe 10x as many</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, Sam either _thought_ that &quot;aggro lock&quot; meant &quot;controlled aggro&quot; or he honestly thought that what he had was what most of us would call aggro lock.  Holy shit, lets call the fucking cops and throw him in the slammer the fucker didn't know our definition of aggro lock. <br />
<br />
Second, people being fucking assholes on the eve of the christmas holiday.  Grats.  Jesus christ.  I get sick of seeing all the Sam ego-stroking self-posts.  I don't think he's a real bright guy and I think the whole thing - the six-boxing, the pictures, the validation posts - is very sad.  I also don't think he knows everything there is to know about warriors, mostly because as we ALL saw he started seriously playing his warrior like four months ago.  FFS there is no fucking shame in not knowing everything about your class at that point.  I'm fucking tired of this mistreatment.  (And, yeah, blahblahblah &quot;then don't read the forum&quot; - well fuck you, I thought someone ought to say something and I guess it had to be me.) <br />

<br />
Well ok I will conceed that it is better to seperate them if you are not busy and have the time to hit one, see whats going on then hit the other. For the six seconds saved (and its unclear that a failed taunt while you have agro has no effect on your possible sucess on a later taunt), I would as soon cut down on the extra work but yur point is unquestionably valid.<br />
<br />
Well I agree that agro lock would trivilaize the game, and I did state that I see a nurff as our current abilites are a agro lock on exp mobs when playing with group members who are trying to control their agro. But clearing at ever oppertunity we are trying to get agro as much as possible and attempting to get agro lock, with our current abilities.  I don't mean that SOE should hand us agro lock, but I do mean we are trying to get it with the tools that we currently have.<br />
<br />
Slansin, well yur a rouge? Fine... sorry I just assumed that SW posters without megalos would be worriors....<br />
<br />
Of course I use mana burn. I rapture, and cast one burn and 3 lures (that land .5 seconds after the burn cuase I do it all with one button and socials), and cleric does a group heal for 2500HP. Basically you get raptured then insta killed. Or I could rapture, and then use the chanter and cleric to strip buffs .5 seconds prior to the manaburn and 3 lures landing.... Its really a tough combo to beat. Also all my guys will have DI up (you might have to kill them twice lol), HoV, Rune of Zeb, Force Shield etc... although my equipment is not first class my buffs will be, and if the rule is only self buffs then yur toon gonna be looking as weak as FeebleMeister Furor.<br />
<br />
If Furor can show that he is controling the toons and they are his toons (he owns the accounts) thats fair enough ... He can't just pick 2 top FoH toons that he never leveled up or does not even own. I could buy 6 of the top toons in the game also but that proves nothing, these are my toons that I took from level one up. If he is 3 boxing or so he might win, who knows. Once I get 300 or 400 more AA under my belt on each toon his probability going to go down though. Although gear is nice, AA is what really gives you strenght, assuming yur gear is &quot;good enough&quot;, as mine is.<br />
<br />
You can't do full gear moves to SZ anymore.... <br />
<br />
It really would be nice if they had a &quot;all server&quot; instanced PvP zone (like WC large with varity of terrian) where people could settle their differences (no exp or items lost) and port back to their home servers after the battle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Behemoth I dont know who you are but ur probably one of FeebleMeister Furors' cronies.<br />
<br />
Maybe a bit more background on you and yur toon and we could see if you claim has any validity. Given I have 640ish AA's in total i kind find it hard to see why someone with one toon would be spending any time killing mobs for exp after they maxed out all their AA......<br />
<br />
Still no picture of FeebleMeister Furor's toon, and no SS of his doing a 2 box LDoN and winning....</div></div><hr />

I hate to say it, but that makes sense.<br />
I DO always strive toward better aggro.<br />
<br />
But even before the recent upgrade we could pretty much hold your interpetation of aggro lock as long as the group was very careful and kept DPS low.<br />
Why would we get nerfed now?</div></div><hr />

Sam is as clueless as they come.<br />
<br />
Clearly he does not understand group dynamics the way a normal person would because he 6 boxes.  Look in all fairness maybe everyone is coming down on Sam a little hard . . . then again looks like he is exploiting his 15 minutes, and the clock is just about up.  While this is entertaining Sam, I am glad Furor works with developers during beta and you don't.  <br />

Oh and in case you didn;t guess it already NO ONE cares if you can duo, 6 box or whatever you do in LDoN . . . I play because I want to have fun and that includes interacting with people.</div></div><hr />

I once posted upgrade suggestions for your Warrior. Concidering how you use him you need to change weapons.<br />
<br />
I would suggest looking at Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn. To familiarize you with playing a Warrior I would suggest doing LDoN with others and getting Force of YKesha for both weapons. This would give you much improved aggro from weapon procs at not a huge DPS loss.<br />

I am not certain why you chose to direct comments to Furor.<br />

 It's an ac debuff, what do you think it's going to be for agro?  Try chain casting flame lick, or other spells of that line, or use a frostbringer. AC debuffs are mega agro, comparible to stuns.                                       <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly how much hate is generated by the AC debuff, but if that guy is right that its close to a stun, then its like  SoD, which none is complaining about. <br />
<br />
Although offhanding the CHoS instead of my SBoD would increase my agro I like the awsome look of my weapons, espically the SBoD. And the 20AC on the SBoD is nice for sure.<br />

DPS<br />

Agro<br />
<br />
I am more then satisfied whith my super combo then yur junks suggestions of SoTB and CHoS...... And I can agument both of them also. Also as this thread has shown I have no trouble keeping agro so why lose any DPS or Looks or Stats and get worse weapons in those 3 catagories for additional agro (offhand at that) that I don't really need. <br />

Well another master of conclusory allegation. Lets see a quote where Furor disagreed with me and was right and the counter quote where I was wrong.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsebach</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot; but incite first then taunt would be best&quot;<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about this, and I'm afraid I have to completely disagree.  Forgive me if I was taking this statement out of context and it was in referance to a specific condition, but it looks to me like you feel this is in general the best way to do it.<br />
<br />
Let's look at it on a case-by-case basis:<br />
<br />
1)  Incite is insufficient to gain aggro (someone is ahead of you by more than 400 points), but taunt succeeds.  You go to the top of the heap +1.  Net hate gain: highest + 1.  (ie. exactly the same as before Incite came in, so essentially wasted endurance)<br />
<br />
2) Incite is sufficient to gain aggro, taunt succeeds.  Net hate gain: 401.  You basically leapfrogged yourself (assuming this is possible, I don't believe it was determined one way or another), thus wasting taunt.<br />
<br />
3) Incite is insufficient to gain aggro, taunt fails.  Net hate gain:  Who cares?  The chanter/cleric/other-random-robe is paste.<br />
<br />
Now, take the possibilities by using taunt first, then Incite:<br />
<br />
1) Taunt succeeds.  Net hate gain: highest + 401.  You've taken the lead and given yourself a nice pad. <br />
<br />
2) Taunt fails, Incite is sufficient to gain aggro.  Net hate gain: 400.  Hurray, Incite made up for our old inadequacy. ;)<br />
<br />
3) Taunt fails, Incite is insufficient to gain aggro.  Net aggo gain: once again, it doesn't matter because you are now a low-DPS monk until taunt recycles. :P<br />
<br />
Granted, there isn't too much of a difference between the two, but what catches my eye is the possibility of getting outcome #1 in case two.  Essentially, the ability to turn that highest + 1 of the old taunt into highest + 401.  That, to my eyes, is the most attractive use of incite.  Indeed, when I have had been able to successfully taunt then apply incite right after during the pull, I find I hardly have to use taunt until the killshot is delivered.<br />
<br />
Feel free to point out anything that I've overlooked... but from where I stand, incite then taunt seems to have a good chance of wasting one skill or the other a majority of the time.  Flipping them around seems to be using them to the most beneficial effect.<br />

<br />
I agree with everything he said except that we don't know what happens when taunt fails if it has any advantage as to a future taunt being more likly to suceed. Otherwise I stand corrected, taunt then incite is the best (think Ill set up my socials for that...)<br />

I figured it was obvious, due to my choice of skills and weapons. Not many warriors have Ifirs.  Less have JTBs, Backstab, Evade and Escape (i.e. none)<br />
<br />
Also, some steel warrior members seem to know me from the end-game unbuffed DPS comparisons.<br />
<br />
I'm not even going to attempt to address your strange PvP code of (non)ethics that allows you to claim a 5 character advantage right off the bat, then further cripple your opponent by asking for a self-only buff clause.  <br />
<br />
You've been demolished on the subject before, by better people, and the proof is in the Retard Rickshaw Hall of Shame.<br />
<br />
But this really pissed me off:<br />
<br />
Behemoth I dont know who you are but ur probably one of FeebleMeister Furors' cronies.<br />
<br />
Maybe a bit more background on you and yur toon and we could see if you claim has any validity. Given I have 640ish AA's in total i kind find it hard to see why someone with one toon would be spending any time killing mobs for exp after they maxed out all their AA<br />
<br />
<br />
Behemoth has more days /played than you have on all of your characters combined.  He started his warrior shortly after the game's initial release.  He was one of the first players on his server to reach the level cap (50).  He still played and killed shit.  Kunark came out.  He was one of the first players to reach the level cap (60).  He still played and killed shit.  He killed shit all through velious without a level boost.  Luclin came out and introduced AA's.  He got the cap.  Still played and killed shit.  Notice a trend here? <br />
<br />
Pop Quiz:  What do you think he did with Planes of Power's upped level cap and new AA's?<br />
<br />
And while you gain 6 AA's simultaneously to skew the numbers (realistically, you've probably put in the time for about 110 of them), most of Fires have put in time to get anywhere from 350 to 600 AA's on a single character.  <br />
<br />
I find this an intriguing mystery how your 6 characters only have 100 or so AAs apeice, where everyone (60 active players) in our guild, taken on average, have double or triple it (or more).  <br />
<br />
How can this be?  How could we have gained so many more AA's for so many people from killing less mobs than Sam Da Man?  Just thinking about it makes me want to dust off the Oija Board and ask the Ghost of Freddy Mercury how it could could have happened.<br />
<br />
But I digress.<br />
<br />
Frankly, when Behemoth says he's killed 10X as many &lt;64 mobs as you, you can take that as a genuine fact.  When he (or any one of these guys that have played infinitely longer than you) talks about the warrior class, you shut up and listen.  At least, you should.  But you don't.<br />
<br />
It's always BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH SAM DA MAN BLAH HOOKERS BLAH BLAH BURST DPS BLAH BLAH BLAH, never stopping to see that nobody's listening; they're all pointing and laughing.</div></div><hr />

Sit down, shut the fuck up, and listen to and learn from your elders. They have far more experience than you do. They know far BETTER than you do. That's what experience will tend to do. They've been places and seen and done shit that can't even imagine until you've been there and done it yourself. You can learn LOTS from people like Frodlin7th and Furor, and improve yourself and your playing abilities quite significantly if you would only get a clue and listen to what they have to say instead of thinknig you know all there is to know.<br />
<br />
You remind me of nothing so much as a little fuckin pissant little teenager who thinks he knows everything, but in reality knows nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
IN regards to your claim about your five guys killing one guy. Well no shit, dumbass. In ANY combat situation, the advantage is with the person with superior numbers. You're like a little boy got a big mouth with all his friends behind him, but when the outcome is anything but certain, shuts his mouth. You brag about how your team is so good, but I don't see you challenging Furor to any kind of fair fight where he could log on the characters HE has access to. No, you know better than to even mention that, because you know damned well that if Furor was to log on enough people to make it any kind of fair fight by the numbers,  or even to make it a one on one man's fight, you'd get spanked and sent crying back to Mommy. So instead you're reduced to bragging about how your 5 guys can kill one guy, which really shows nothing except how much of a coward you are.</div></div><hr />

If Feeblemeister Furor has something intelligent to say Ill be happy to listen, just a bunch of conclusory allegation means nothing to me regardless the source. I never heard of Behemoth Blowhard either but he has little to say also from what I seen. <br />

Ya 6v1 is unfair.... so whats yur point, you agree Im stronger, and thats my point. In fact I am so much stronger that its &quot;unfair&quot;. <br />

So whats FeebleMeister Furor gonna do? Come to Sullon and say &quot;Mr. DeathWalker Sir, I'd like to Pwnzor yur toon 1v1 wid my Uber toon! Would you PLEEEEEZE be so kinds as to log yur other 5 so that I can?&quot; LOL..... <br />

At least my opponents on SZ don't whine like a bunch of little FoH girls about how &quot;unfair&quot; it is when I manaburn and 3 lure them.... you would think Furor's Servents and Assorted Cronies would have a bit more fortitude.<br />

I think Sam is asking for jeehaad or something of that nature.... <br />

That's from your thread on the SZ baords. I'll warn you once sam...If we have an influx of SZ people onto this board for no reason other than to 'grief' in a message board sense, I'll not only ban them, but you as well. If you're going to flame Furor go for it, thats between you and him. Use the PM feature or something - but starting an inter-board flamefest is not something I'm going to let happen.<br />
<br />
I've gotten tons of PM's and tells ingame telling me I should have banned you the moment you registered. I've defended you because you haven't really done anything against any rules. You seem to genuinely want to learn about the warrior class. Don't make me regret doing that.</div></div><hr />

Therefore you will never have a situation like 'OMG, I overaggroed, and it can't be me that's sucking so let's blame it on the warrior, which is also myself.&quot;  It's not like you're going to slap your own right hand for not being able to taunt enough.  No, if you're playing all the characters you obviously sit down and think about a way not to repeat the same mistakes instead of firing yourself to get a Paladin to tank for you.  Most people I know who two-box (or more) knows exactly how much aggro all their characters pull since if you screw up it's your own fault and you can't blame it on anyone else.  <br />
<br />
But most groups also don't work like that.  Warrior aggro has always been quite sufficient in a group that knows how to work with you, and it's easy to get a group to work with you when you are the group.  Most groups, unfortunately, has absolutely no intention of working with the warrior which is why aggro lock is even a necessity, because people are too stupid to learn.  I mean I'd see like enchanter cast tash, dies... rez, and then do it again... and again... you'd think if it hurts, you should stop doing it, but this simple concept is lost on a great deal of people.  So no warriors do not have aggro lock when you're working with the common LFG guys.</div></div><hr />

You don't see me asking anyone from the SZ board to come here... <br />

I only posted there in the first place not to violate your policies when this post was not in the outhouse, when I was attacked by Furor.

I showed you great respect by following your rules, and not flaming Furor when he flamed me by moving my comments to another forum. <br />

Look at the first post in this thread, properly dealing with Warrior issues, and then look for the first post that violated your policies, you will see that I am just answering in kind, and clearly did not start anything with anyone.<br />

I post here a lot (my 3rd most popular posting spot), how is it to my advantage to have this or any board spammed, and I am winning this thead right and left anyway. This argument is between me and Furor, going back to prior arguments.... I am not asking for any help from any quarter. <br />

 As one of those 'lamebrains', I'd like to point out the obvious: That you haven't a clue.<br />
<br />
 Ignoring the fact that I posted 'facts and logic' previously that you never responded to -<br />
<br />
 It's been repeatedly said, and not just by me - You have no clue even how the fundamental terminology is used when discussing Taunt. There's no use to further discussion with you - It's like discussing colors with a blind man who refuses to contemplate the existance of colors to begin with. Of course, discussion on things like aggro with a person who 6-boxes is meaningless on a fundamental level to begin with. That's because one person makes all the aggro decisions for the entire group - which is a condition shared by &lt;1% of all people across all servers.<br />
<br />
 Your 'experiences' != the normality of existence of the EQ Warrior.<br />
<br />
 Hell, you yourself even admitted previously that what you were using for max DPS was wholly insufficient for aggro generation - Incite is merely papering over that gap. If Obsidian Shatter really was &gt; Planar Stun or Planar Strike for aggro, that wouldn't be the case. Rightly, the majority of Warriors reject your claims, because they recognize that stuns are larger aggro than AC debuffs.<br />
<br />
 Frankly, you've been wrong before, you've stated things that are contradictory to anecdotal experience related to you by Warriors of different levels/playstyles/gear levels/skill, and recently in a post you admitted that what you were SO sure was correct was, in fact, mistaken. Now you want to post drivel like &quot;Incite = Aggro Lock&quot; and then claim -<br />

I tend to agree with you but it is very far from clear that stuns are a larger aggro then AC debufss (and a 30 HP damage I might add) ... ya I got the weapon for looks and DPS, but that does not mean its proc is usless for agro. Do you have a link showing AC debuff is not as good as a stun? <br />
<br />
That guy at allkazahms said Try chain casting flame lick, or other spells of that line, or use a frostbringer. AC debuffs are mega agro, comparible to stuns... <br />
<br />
Whats flame lick or frosbringer? Do those things generate as much agro as a stun?<br />
<br />
But no matter Incite is a big plus, and anger III on the Sword should also help a lot.... I am happy as things are...</div></div><hr />

 Have a Paladin stun a mob, with his level 9 stun, and not attack. Then have a Ranger use Flame Lick (Level 9 for them) to try and pull aggro - see how many casts it takes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or how bout that great advise from Furor to not use Incite to get agro lock.<br />
<br />
Throag<br />
<br />
The only good advise in this thread is to use taunt prior to incite, from a guy with 14 total posts, but who made good sense.<br />
<br />
Thats not to say I have not learned a ton here at Steel Warrior, no doubt this place is the final authority on Warrior issues. There is more good infos here then on 100 posts at the FoH forum for example. I was told that AC/HP is the best things to look for in Armor and did that and it has paid off well. And many other good advises.<br />
<br />
But that does not mean that every time FeebleMeister Furor, or others make some conclusory allegation that I should just turn off my brain and accept whatever they say.<br />
<br />
And Throag go through this thread and give me a single quote where I was clearly wrong (cept for using incite before taunt) and someone else was clearly right, espically Furor. I doubt you will find such.<br />
<br />
Kalantek Good point. Yes higher DPS weapons do generate more agro in a manner similar to higher DPS spells. So that points even more to OSoW as being better then SoTB because in addtion to everything else it generates more DPS agro.... <br />
<br />
<br />
Well with this new incite I have completly changed the way I play, before it was DPS totally and I expected the wizards to get agro, and if the warrior got it from taunts and dps and procs, fine but if he did not fine also. I would then SR with the cleric whoever needed it but thats a lot of work cause you never know who will be on top of agro list...<br />
<br />
Now because I can get and keep agro for sure if I tone down the wizards a bit I am using CH only on the warrior and saving a  ton of mana on the cleric, the battles last longer but I take over all less damage because all of the mobs dps is on the warrior who naturally has the best AC and the inate mitigation. Clearly a much better situation. <br />
<br />
<br />
FeebleMeister Furor has brought nothing to the table in this thread except to cry that SOE has not given us enough, when in fact Warriors have gotten a TON from this patch and we should be more then happy, and hope we don't get nerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND we STILL dont have a SS of FeebleMeister Furor sucessfully 2 boxing a LDoN like he &quot;claims&quot; that he did, and we don't even have a SS of his sorry looking toon to compare to my powerfull looking Warrior.<br />

You know for a fact that in this case your controlling all four toons, you know exactly how to handle aggro. It becomes second nature to do so.<br />

Get some raid experience gear Sam, a LOT actually.  And you'll get out of your bazaar gear too =P.

<br />
If the point of the test was to determine how the changes work for the 99.999% of the population that do not 6 box, the tests need to be done with other people controlling the toons in separate physical locations.  And if you want to test the impact on a pu situation, the people must not know each other.  (I personally think the pu situation is the best test to use since we all know agro could have been managed before the situation with people that knew how to work well together...but I see a use for also testing with people that had worked together)</div></div><hr />

I'm not trying to prolong a flamefest, but Sam has me confused. (I've been playing a year and a half but am very new to the warrior class).<br />
<br />
If Taunt puts you at the top of the hate list +1 point, and Incite is a 400 point +DoT-type hate generator, why would you not always use taunt first?<br />
<br />
Example of taunt before incite:<br />
<br />
-puller pulls and has 50 hate<br />
-warrior taunts to 51 and then incites to add 400 making him 451.<br />

Example of incite before taunt:<br />
<br />
- puller pulls and has 50 hate<br />
- warrior incites to 400 hate then taunts making him 401.<br />

My understanding may be flawed, but wouldn't you want to taunt first? Is it because incite can be used from a distance and taunt can not? I've tried looking around some, but am having a hard time finding a FAQ on aggro control strats.<br />

Incite is NOT the huge improvement you want it to be, it does help, it's a fact, but it is not trivialising aggro management in any way, ANY.<br />
<br />
You say people do not bring good points to you, and you think that means you are right?

You are correct...use taunt first if you can.  The only times I use provoke first is if;  (1) I'm already engaged with a mob and we get an add so I need to get agro without switching mobs (well...switch for 2 seconds then switch back), or (2) I lose agro, taunt is not up, and whoever I lost agro to can't wait for taunt to refresh.</div></div><hr />

Because of its high failure rate.<br />
<br />
You could just go like this:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Incite, getting some fresh 400 points of hate.<br />
<br />
Step 2: Taunt, fail<br />

Step 3: Incite ticks you 100 points of hate<br />

Step 8: TAUNT, SUCEED, you're at the top of the list baybeee!!!!<br />

Step 9: Incite ticks you 100 points of hate ABOVE the list! You rock the house now!<br />
And you still have 3 more ticks of hate incoming.<br />
<br />
Sorry, it's just my experience with taunt is usually steps 2, 4 and 6 far more often than it is step 8.<br />

I don't think anyone was suggesting holding out for a successful taunt, but rather mashing taunt if it's up and then Incite/Provoke - the point being that if you get lucky, you have a 400 Hate lead on the whole group.  (Me, I'm still waiting for successes on mezzes, but the guild chantah's are a little ... delicate :D.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also no one has clearly shown that a taunt while you are at the top of the hate list does you no good at all as far as its effect on possible success of furture taunts...<br />

Still waiting on this:<br />
And Throag go through this thread and give me a single quote where I was clearly wrong (cept for using incite before taunt) and someone else was clearly right, espically Furor. I doubt you will find such.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still waiting on this:<br />
AND we STILL dont have a SS of FeebleMeister Furor sucessfully 2 boxing a LDoN like he &quot;claims&quot; that he did, and we don't even have a SS of his sorry looking toon to compare to my powerfull looking Warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best use for incite is right after a successful taunt - because it gives you a 400pt lead over anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about that theory that you will always suceed on your 4th taunt even if you fail the first three? If thats true can anything be concluded about the effect of failure on a taut because you are at the top of the hate list?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well more impotantly should you Inicite at 100 feet and then taunt whenever or should you wait for the mob to get to you taunt then incite?<br />
<br />
Actually if you are the puller you will already have agro so it would seem using incite at 100 feet has no downside cause you are already at the top of the hate list from the pull and waiting to taunt and then incite might not be very effective.... <br />
<br />
If you are not the puller then seems you would also wish to use incite at 100 feet (I am assuming that taunt is mellee range limited) becuase you want the mob off the puller asap.... Although maybe if you are not the puller its better to engage the mob, taunt then incite...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would you not use it at 100 feet if you are the puller? Being the puller means you have agro which is equivilent to a succesfull taunt.<br />
<br />
Well I guess it is a lot less work to insult someone then to actullay have to articulate an intelligent statement on the issue at hand.<br />

God you're fucking retarded.  Listen very carefully.<br />

The reason your ATK is higher than mine is because you have 60 raw str on me.  Guess what happens when I get a Focus?  That's right, my str is maxed too and my ATK is the same as yours.<br />
<br />
Guess what happens when I get a virtue and a focus of soul?  I STILL have 1khp on you.  You're such a fucktard you can't even comprehend the fact that I don't need certain stats maxed because I'll always have them.  <br />
<br />
DI?  What the fuck are you smoking?  You've got permanent DI?  What the fuck for? Like to go AFK and let your toons fend for themselves?  If you're not a fucking dipshit and know how to heal you don't need DI any goddamned day of the week.<br />

And if we're gonna go off of the buffs we have on our other characters, well then my ATK is always at 1459 from avatar dur dur, looks like I pwned Sam Teh Man Deathwalker <br />

This is what we're fucking talking about here, you're a goddamned retard and you don't even know it.  Your toon is better than mine?  You go ask around.  Ask which fuckin tank they'd want.  I guarantee they want a 8khp/1370ac tank over your 7khp 1400ac.  The fact that you even think you hold a candle to someone with 1khp more than you proves your lunacy.</div></div><hr />

This isnt the first board hes come to and done this and i guarentee you it wont be the last.  He's insulting people who have been apart of this community for years longer then him, he basically just covers his ears and ignores anything anyone says in an attempt to help him, and never ceases spewing mindless drivel, that only causes more people to get annoyed with him.  The end result is you get more PM's and tells begging you in game to ban him already.  <br />
<br />
Seriously the attempt to reach out to this guys been made and hes basically ignored you, 95 percent of all posts in response to this guy are &quot;ban him already&quot; or insulting him because of something idiotic hes said.  Just save the warriors ( and anyone else who reads these forums ) the headache and put and end to this already.<br />

I find your disrespect of that hard work and raw intellectual effort distasteful, ignorant and fully uncomprehensible.

You use reactionary language when your viewpoint is threatened, you contradict yourself mid-thread and you insult a man that has not deigned to reply to you in three pages. <br />

You are correct. However, taunt failures are so miserable, one can also take the CYNICAL approach that even having your taunt key &quot;available&quot; is almost exactly the SAME as having it unavailable.<br />

Well, after the melee changes every group ive ever been in I was always puller (after the cleric pacified), so I end up getting in a few hits, so thats a few hundred agro right there, and then I use my berate which is a few hundred more + agro over time.<br />
<br />
MOST of the time thats enough to ensure me solid agro for the rest of the fight, the only exclusions being people who don't know a thing about agro management (ie: overnuking wizards, snare happy druids, etc...)<br />
<br />
This guy pretty much sums the situation up in another thread<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4860<br />
<br />
Is he a fool and an idiot because he pulls and uses incite on incoming (or berate in his case) and is talking about getting rid of his SoTB and CHoS.... <br />
<br />
Also he is not six boxing, yet his experience with the new provok line is about the same as mine.... <br />
<br />
Ok yesterday I did get another wizard into my group, and exactly as you all said he over agroed and not only that he then kited the mob away from all my guys. But that was at the start after he saw that my warrior was not a flimsy peice of paper and that we did not have to kill the mob instantly he was able to control agro and we killed mobs as we had planed.<br />
<br />
On the one hand you are saying I should group with people who don't know how to play and then my &quot;opnion&quot; will be more valuable and then you say that 6 boxers are &quot;less effieicent&quot; then a regular group. <br />
<br />
Apparently 6 boxing in general is a vastly superior way to play this game, as clearly we don't suffer from having some people in our group who don't know how to play... And we don't waste any time LFG.... <br />
<br />
<br />
Then when a simple question is posed &quot;Should we use incite on incoming?&quot; We have one post saying that everything is varible and a bunch of posts that are little more then insults from people who have nothing to say on the subject.<br />
<br />
Ill look upp that 9 taunt thing... 20/20 is fabulous and I probably won't see it but then again the goal on a pvp server is to win at pvp and I dont need to see it to do that.<br />
<br />
Ya I think showing full buffs is a better comparision, as you correctly point out haass why max a spicific stat when you will almost always have a buff that will compensate for it. But then we are not really comparing one persons toon to one persons toon... You don't have 1000K HP on me you have 700HP at best. No one can cast a 300 HP buff on you that stacks with Virtue. Yur toon is maginally better considering I have a cleric 100percent of the time and DI 100percent of the time, both will easy compesate for 700 HP less. <br />
<br />
Lets see I say &quot;I been playing fantasy games before Furor was born&quot; you say &quot;He has been a warrior longer&quot;, I say &quot;Incite has been live less then a week and thats what we are discussing&quot;. I mean pick your point is general experence in the area we are  discussing more important or just experience with the spicific subject. <br />
<br />
How many times has Furor used Incite is the real question when dealing with Incite ... not what has he done in the past.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets see if I got this stright. FeebleMeister Furor is a Superior Warrior because when he groups with idiots who can't control agro he has more experience in dealing with those situations. <br />
<br />
Gee yur right I need to group with idiots more often, maybe I should join FoH.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also seems the majority of posters here at SW are in agreement with me that the changes are just fine and disagree with FeebleMeister Furor's constant whining that Warriors are underpowered. I don't see Furor da Feeble coming out and thanking SOE for these long overdue benifits so I can only assume that he does not feel they have gone far enough.<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4805<br />
<br />
<br />
Also for those of you who say I am never convienced I am wrong here is a thread I started about an ear item, and was proven wrong and I clearly admitted that my suggested item was trash.<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4918<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok looked up the taunt thing and given the fact that some people report 9 or 11 or 14 failure in a row I am going to conclude that a failure taunt is just a waste and has no benifit at all.</div></div><hr />

you are right (/gasp)...but what he does have is a pocket shaman following him around that can give him a 544hp buff that stacks with virt.  this buff is called focus of soul, perhaps you've heard of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unbuffed?<br />
Pocket toons buffed? (my vote)<br />
6 person optamial group buffed?<br />
Full Raid buffs?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I can see where he would not max str given he has a that spell availabile all the time, I wouldn't either. I dont try and max INT on my wizards unbuffed but only when they have VoQ, because I have it all the time....<br />
<br />
<br />
And is he less of a warrior becuase he has a pocket shaman?<br />
Or does the pocket Shaman make him stronger?<br />
<br />
And if you count the extra 544 HP from his pocket Shaman, and the 70str (which increases his atk whcih increases his dps) then why would you not count the extra 600-1000dps I get from my pocket 3 wizards.... heh....</div></div><hr />

YES if you plan to do XP groups and/or raid with others.<br />
NO If all you do is 6 Box and PVP.<br />
99.9% of warrior discussion here is on warriors that interact with others. If you dont do this, then knowing how a warrior works is irrelevant. If YOU find 6 boxing is more intertaining than for YOU it is a superior way to play. but for the vast majority, 6 boxing is NOT entertaining and therefor NOT superior. It is not a black or white area, it is not debatable. It is personal preference.<br />
<br />
the goal on a pvp server is to win at pvp and I dont need to see it to do that.<br />
<br />
Almost everything we are talking about warrior wise in this thread is warrior aggro and the way NPC's react to it.<br />
You will NOT be able to get aggro from another player with incite, taunt, or anything else which makes all that PVP stuff irrelevant.<br />
Stick to talking about NPC's and how they react with you.<br />
Your title for the thread was warrior aggro lock. Nothing to do with PVP.<br />
<br />
But be honest with yourself.<br />
If all you want to do is 6 box and PVP.. Why do you care about how Incite and taunt work anyway?<br />
It doesnt apply to your gaming style at all.<br />
<br />
This should sum it all up for you.<br />
<br />
6 Boxing is 100% aggro control, PVP is 0% aggro control.<br />
<br />
Thats covers PVP and 6 Boxing.<br />
When you want to seriously group with others or raid, come back and talk to us!<br />
But remember that the game play is going to be radicaly different then what you are used to.<br />
Ye can either find out by asking here, or surprise yourself by actually doing it.<br />
<br />
We're not going to tell you how to PVP and 6 box, dont try to tell us how aggro and tanking tactics work.<br />
<br />
They are not the same.</div></div><hr />

You cannot log off your wizards, playing only your warrior, and keep your damage.  It's as simple as that.  The shaman casts a buff and can log for over an hour.  The wizards must be there to keep the damage.<br />
<br />
However, if you don't want him to use his shaman in the argument, then you can forget about your permenant Virtue and DI argument, as that is coming from your pocket cleric.<br />
<br />
And for the record, I'd take a Haas over any warrior who's done nothing but spend his entire warrior career playing with himself and thinking he's the best because he can control all 6 members' agro, for some reason thinking this gives him the right to wave his little dick around like he's a big man and can give advice on how to be a warrior when he's clearly not.  I'm done listening to this guy, thank god this board has an ignore list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This seems fair enough, buffs that you or yur pocket toons can cast. I mean its true enough that you will never be without these buffs on your character (unless CR), as you own yur pocket toons.<br />
<br />
This is what I ususaly have up I am sure I could squeeze a bit more but this is my normal set up <br />

Plus I have 100percent haste with pocket buffs.<br />

I dual box constantly, where ever one toon goes, the 2nd one goes.  But my 2 toons don't count because it's not &quot;self buffs?&quot; Since when has Sam Deathwalker ever given a shit about per toon?  Oh that's right, only when it benefits him in an argument, otherwise it's his 6 toons against everyone else's 1.<br />
<br />
Ya I think showing full buffs is a better comparision, as you correctly point out haass why max a spicific stat when you will almost always have a buff that will compensate for it. But then we are not really comparing one persons toon to one persons toon... You don't have 1000K HP on me you have 700HP at best. No one can cast a 300 HP buff on you that stacks with Virtue. Yur toon is maginally better considering I have a cleric 100percent of the time and DI 100percent of the time, both will easy compesate for 700 HP less.  <br />
<br />
Ya, that's funny, considering that I sit at 8219hp with Virtue, Focus and Brells.  What do you sit at again?  Oh that's right, your little picture says 6700.  But I've only got 700hp on you, riiiiiight.  Might wanna check your fuckin calculator too, it seems to have the same problem you have.<br />
<br />
When you pull your head out of your ass, feel free to contribute around here.  Until then, you might wanna just shut up and learn a few things from people who know more than you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So HotAir Haass whats the proper way to compare - you chose the way I don't care. Pocket buffs, Full raid buffs, single group buffs, no buffs whatever..... <br />
<br />
Someone would get the Kizrak BP precisly because of the effect. And if you have a Vengance item should it not count towards yur ATK? There is no way I would agree to a comparision not counting the effects of items I am wearing. When wizards compare they count FT items for sure. And I am confident that when somone buys a BoC for 200K and compares it to other weapons they are taking into consideration its proc. Anyone who considers items to compare them will consider their right click effect, how silly to claim otherwise.<br />
<br />
Then lets just compare based upon stuff you are wearing. Yur like 600 HP better, bigs deal, with worse AC and ATK. For someone who posts as much as you do and who claims this and that I would have though you to be a bit more uber then I am by more then about 600HP. (I have the two new bracers now). <br />
<br />
<br />
Sam, you're a fucking idiot. I dual box constantly, where ever one toon goes, the 2nd one goes.<br />
<br />
Ahh HotAir Hass so you duel box, all the time.. humm seems yur opinion on warrior issues is limited to always haveing a shaman in your group something 70plus percent of EQ players dont have! Why should those 70percent of SW readers even consider yur opinion - go play your warrior in groups comprised of idiots for a few months and then come back here and bless us with yur HotAir. (This paragraph is sacasum by the way)..... <br />
<br />
In fact isn't the slow from shamen a lot less agro then the normal chanter slow, how can you talk about agro control when yur slower almost never overagros (I assume that since you are playing yur shaman you know about agro control)?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also all this stuff about EQ being social and all that, I group sometimes and I can go into any crowed zone and will get tells instantly given I ahve a changer (KEI) and cleric (Virtue, Rez) and wizards (Ports). And I play the &quot;merchant&quot; game arguing about items pricing 1/2-1 hour a day. Frankly I have to much interaction, I am trying to control 6 toons and someone wants me to go and buff them... bleh. Or I am doing JC items and someone wants to talk about how I can control 6 toons at one time or link this or that item. Ya maybe solo warriors dont get much interaction alone but chanters and clerics have people talking to them constantly.</div></div><hr />

The comparing gear with Haass is a classic;<br />
<br />
I may have more hp than some on this board due to being in a raiding guild, but if one of the long-standing members has something to say, you can be pretty sure I will value their opinion due to their huge experience (my toon was started in feb 2002, so I m not really old skool), regardless of what gear they have.<br />
<br />
But well, this is obviousely falling on deaf ears, as you don't understand English and we don't speak Moron..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that I would consider a PoTime geared warrior who has only played for 6 months over a Bazzar warrior that has played for 4 years (I mean if the guy has been playing for 4 years and has not advanced his character how well can he know how to play). <br />
<br />
I mean would you take the advice of someone who was lower level then you and worse gear, even if they claimed to have been around for a long time.... <br />
<br />
A lot of people on SZ were like in their 30's begging for buffs from me and then got to 65, joined a guild then passed me up in gear, they still asking for buffs though lol.... <br />
<br />
I didn't think a lot of them when they were level 30's but once they passed me in gear I was more willing to see what they had to say.<br />
<br />
Actually bottom line I don't really consider the source, a good solid argument with logic behind it from a noob is better then some conclusory allegation from FeebleMeister Furor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Haass yur megelo shows 5606 HP, <br />
mine shows 4798 without 300 from the self buff from the BP. So mine is 5098 effictive. Not to mention 40STA from the legs... <br />
<br />
5606 - 5098 is about 500 HP on me. LoL... And worse weapons I might add at least for DPS and its really unclear if my mainhand proc is as good as yurs or not for agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
And when I first came here all of 5 months ago and looked at megalos everyone had all this great stuffs and my toon was nothing in comparision, now I looking closer at some megalos and seeing people with less AC and ATK, claiming they know more then I do, and not even attempting to back up their statements with any hard facts, links, parsing or anything.... Sure Im not going to take as gospel conclusory allegation from FeebleMeister Furor, and I am even more not going to take conclusory allegation from someone with less of a toon then I have. And not only that how dedicated to this game are these poeple who don't even spring for Megelo premiumn so we know that they did not just make up a Megalo. <br />
<br />
Of course in Hotair Haass's case there is no question he is telling the truth. <br />
<br />
If he was lieing he would have picked a lot better gear then he has.<br />
<br />
Oh and we are still waiting for that SS of Furor 2 boxing a LDoN successfully by himself.... purhaps some of his conclusory claims should not be taken at face value....<br />
<br />
<br />
And a Merry Xmas to all also! Remeber that TeH MIGHTY DEATHWALKER has been keeping Norrath safe from mobs for 2.5 years and shall continue the battle against the Legions of Mata Muram so that others may sleep in peace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haass has more hitpoints than you do, whether unbuffed, self buffed, or raidbuffed. This is an incontrovertible fact which you are trying to obscure by splittin hairs, and disputing the actual amount.<br />
<br />
Secondly, and more importantly, Haass has ALL the defensive AA's, which SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the damage that he takes, while you have AA choices which I can only describe as ill-advised, with only one exception. Not only that, Haass also has a fair amount of the offensive AA's as well.<br />
<br />
Between them, ANYONE with a clue would take Haass over you in a heartbeat, and in a one on one duel, Haass would absolutely own you. There's really no question in anyone's mind but yours.<br />
<br />
No one can cast a 300 HP buff on you that stacks with Virtue<br />
What fucking planet do you live on? BMB, BSS, the Focus line, and the Talisman line all stack with virtue and provide 300HP or more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK slansin megelo slaughters me.... <br />
<br />
<br />
Haass yur toon is overall better for sure, but like if you are 100 then I am 96 or so, better but not by much.<br />
<br />
You can't use pocket toon buffs because then I get 5 pocket toon buffs and you lose there easy.<br />
<br />
The only fair way to compare is to use megelos and add in any effects on items that you are wearing. Doing that you have like 500ish HP on me bigs deal.... <br />
<br />
I have not seen his AA but AA are even more important then the lousy 500HP. Yes if all his defensive AA are maxed that is a big plus indeed. But thats just a matter of time, I have the earthshaker and a &quot;pocket&quot; pbaoe group.... not hard to get exp.<br />

<br />
Just wanted to kind of mention that post count has really nothing to do with credability. I've been around EQ since about velious launch, and have hung around steel warrior off and on for a long time, even before i registered after luclin launch i was constantly hitting sites reading and such.<br />
<br />
I didn't learn anything less, i just chose to wait til i felt confident in my knowledge before i said things. It even became apparent in my young days in OT/DL when you could tank 3 mobs if u balanced ur aggro to overcome heals.<br />
<br />
And also not everyone had their post count moved from the old board.<br />
<br />
And furthermore, posting 9000 times doesnt make you any more knowledgable or credable, theres no caption that says &quot;Meaningful posts&quot; under the number.<br />
<br />
If a game dev who plays his 65 warrior with capped AAs when at home logged on and made his first post,  no one is gonna tell him off because he is new (he may do other things)<br />
<br />
If a doctor tells me they need to do some procedure immediately or i die, but its his first day at that particular hospital, i know im definately gonna flip him off and go for a jog.<br />
<br />
<br />
I read posts, and usually i dont have anything relevant to say because it has already been said, i dont wanna see this board be like the SK board where every question has a 2 page thread with &quot;Use the god damn search&quot; on each post, and thats likely what alot of people are doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I only brought it up because it seems every few posts your calling someone an idiot because of their post count, or hinting to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming their claim was true......<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn right i would, 3 instances i can specifically recall it happened.<br />
<br />
Had a level 30 warrior give me some tips on some luclin boss, turns out he had his account hacked, and  SoE couldnt verify his identity because the person had done his homework on social engineering prior to jacking the account.<br />
<br />
<br />
This other time was when a 33 warrior told me about some old piercer that was decent cheap aggro when i was in DL struggling for a weapon combo. The guy had played since pre-kunark casually, and didnt even have a character over 45, when he was playing twin SSoY were teh ubah, and he shared some experiences with me that held useful (namely the weapon im trying to find a link for, cant remember name)<br />
<br />
And when i was about 53 i had some lower warrior tell me that black blade of tormenting was a damn nice aggro weapon for 300pp, i tried it, and i was pwning teh velks, <br />
<br />
<br />
And I, myself have given advice to higher warriors, and it was useful info.<br />
<br />
For example, we did some PoS key collelcting for charm stats once, and we were gonna do some of the named mini's. I told our MT to be sure to make a hotkey with /stand and /attack in it. I had read about him procing FD on people. Our MT who hadn't tanked this before didnt give me a &quot;STFU j00 n3wb, 0mg h0w d4re you t4lk to m3, im s0 k-r4d&quot; he made the hotkey.<br />
<br />
You dont have to shoot yourself in the face to know suicide makes you die, however......nevermind<br />
<br />
Just saying you dont have to be a 65 eq addict that works for myplayerauctions because not playing EQ causes physical pain, to know stuff, same as you dont have to jump in a valcano to see if lava is real.....errr yes, jump into valcanoes....its fun</div></div><hr />

Fully Buffed with every buff in the game (raid buffed)<br />
<br />
<br />
Unbuffed I am 4798<br />
Ubuff with worn effects probably like 5200<br />
Buff with Pocket toon 6700ish<br />
Raid buffed   not sure<br />
<br />
So don't be comparing yur Raid buffs with my unbuff with worn effects.... <br />
<br />
Post count is meaningless, lots of people put in one line resposes just to increase their count and say nothing. Each of my posts has more content then some conclusory insult.<br />
<br />
Sam you know nothing about any of the classes you play really. <br />
for the warrior part your posts here are pretty clear, for the wizard part this thread should be enough =P<br />
<br />
Lucy states that Iceflame of E'ci will not stack with Anger of E'ci. Apparently when one is on an item they will.. just wanted to get verification of that. I would have been using ice spear a long time ago if I was sure of that.<br />
<br />
Also notice that unlike FeebleMeister Furor the people at Graffee can say &quot;It stacks&quot; instead of &quot;It stacks you stupid child molesting serial killer&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can now do 1500damge for 270 mana every 17 seconds, indefinatly. Only a bit less then 300dps with my 3 wizards, true enough (assuming I don't cast other spells inbetween) but I never have to stop to regen mana lol.... And thats not counting spilization checks or crits so its about 300dps constantly never ending. And give time for the warrior to do his DPS, NEVER GET AGRO on the WIZARDS lol, and then the chanters pet in a LDoN (grats Raaj and The Rune for those ideas), I gonna be doing very very well in LDoN I am thinking.....  I sure got way stonger this last week. 3 helms of nocturnal phatasums (10percent mana reduction on ice spear) - the two warrior bracers and the new warrior abilities, dang... I can't see how things could possibly be better... <br />
<br />
gonna make more coffee and discuss throag points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes is does.<br />
<br />
And now listen te me: Shut the fuck up and listen to those who KNOWS what they are talking about.<br />
<br />
And by the way Im not telling you how to play or how to do anything, as the title of the thread shows its my viewpoint on the issue, you might agree, you might disagree - how you play is up to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Incite being the new badass skill that change completly the warrior class? WRONG<br />
<br />
I would not go that far but I would say that warriors are now balanced enough, as the poll would indicate with 80percnet showing that they are happy<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4805<br />
<br />
And it sure did change the way I play, and will be a BIG BIG plus for those who group with people who know what they are doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Incite being aggro lock? WRONG<br />
<br />
Its an agro lock when you are in a group that knows what they are doing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nerf incoming to the provoke line? WRONG<br />
<br />
Well I have to back off on that, if we assume what you all have been saying is true that most people group with idots that can't control agro I guess there is no need to nerf. Better for me anyway if there is no nerf.<br />
<br />
Using taunt always after incite? WRONG I think we concluded that incite is best used after a sucessful taunt or when you already have agro, is that the concenses? But ya initially I was wrong... <br />
<br />
Stating that all those people like Furor or other well know warriors here knows nothing? FUCKING WRONG<br />
<br />
Thats not my position at all, each post, even from the same person, is to be taken on its own merits no one is always wrong or always right. But to take anyone as always right is foolish. Lets see what they say and then go from there. FeebleMeister Furor's posts in this thread have been trash. In other threads he has done a fine job.<br />
<br />
Thinking that you, playing your 6 gimps make you know how the game works? Wrong again<br />
<br />
Bottem line, I can kill you in game.<br />
<br />
Thinking that magelo or postcount means anything? Fuckin gay.<br />
<br />
Post count is meaningless. Magelo is of course important, someone who has advanced their toon must know how to advance lol... <br />
<br />
Thinking that you, being able to kill ONE SINGLE PERSON with SIX FUCKING characters means that you have the right to brag and insult people who have proven to be quite knowledgeble (sp?) ? Fuck no.<br />
<br />
No one has a right to insult others, but when someone insults me I am not going to cower from battle. I can brag whenever I wish there is no forum rule against bragging espically in the outhouse. What is the whole FoH forum expcept bragging, what is every magelo expect bragging, what is &quot;Should I but a Auger 3 aug on my BoW or SWES lol&quot;. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, I can kill you in game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thinking that you, doing a LDoN alone makes you the messiah? Wtf, a normal adventure can be done with only 3 bots...<br />
<br />
Lots of talk on this one but few SS. But its not so crazy of a cliam that 3 time geared toons can do a LDoN, I guess it can be done. But by FeebleMeister Furor? With 2? Won't belive it until I see it.<br />
<br />

ISoS is 1200 damage both effects total 53pecent. 1-53 random is like 25 constant. 25percent of 1200 is 300 wich is 1500 total.<br />

2 sheild<br />
8 familiar<br />
15 ft<br />
<br />
<br />
Mine was a off the top estimate. lets see to the above you add 20 (atleast) for medding. and 6 for yur standing, 3 and 3 for the AA that gives you mana regen. <br />
<br />
18Voq<br />
2 shield<br />
8 familar<br />
6 normal<br />
22 meding<br />
15 max ft (mine is 4ft though)<br />
<br />
so mine is like 60FT, including medding (well I can sit inbetween casts maybe or if I am on horse) but there is a lot of time pulling and looting also its not indifinatly chain casting.<br />
<br />
But the mana cost is less with crits and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Effictively I will do a LDoN without long times to regen lets say it that way.<br />
<br />
Plus there is chanter and warrior and maybe even cleric DPS, I might not even have to chain cast.<br />
<br />
As soon as I get off this board I will test it out I know that with like 3 mintue pulls I was running positive mana. <br />
<br />
If you have to kill 60 mobs in 90 mintutes thats one mob per 1.5 mintutes, but then I have 6 toons not just 3, we will see.....</div></div><hr />

Do you never aggro if you sit after nuking? If you don't sit instantly, you must be losing med time. So we can assume your med mana regenned it 66% max? That means your high estimate, 22, becomes more like 15!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You claim you discount others' opinions simply because they are being harsh to you. Perhaps if I was more civil, you would listen?<br />
<br />
I have played the two main melee DPS classes since the game's release, with small breaks inbetween... combined to a total of over 120 levels of monk, and currently 65 levels of Rogue (+365ish AA's.  The monks were pre-Luclin on different servers).<br />
<br />
Exclusively playing DPS classes for over 4 years, it has been my duty and specialty to control my aggro.  I know exactly what kind of DPS I can sustain without pulling aggro in pretty much all  circumstances, from level 1 to 65, from Cracked Staves to Jagged Timeforged Blades, paired with any class having any ability to tank.  As a direct result, I also know exactly what kind of damage it will take to GAIN aggro from damage alone.<br />
<br />
I come to the Steel Warrior simply because improvements to Warrior Taunt are direct improvements to my class as well, since they decrease my reliance on deaggro abilities tied to a streaky RNG.<br />
<br />
With my knowledge of how Aggro works, and especially with recent in-game experience with Warriors using the new Taunt effects, I can, with some amount of authority, tell you that Incite is not Warrior Aggro Lock.<br />
<br />
How often do you nuke?  How often do your wizards go OOM?  How often does your cleric?  Your enchanter?  How fast do you get an AA point, on average?  Your answers to these questions will prove, without a doubt, that you are not using your 6-box crew to their full potential.<br />
<br />
When I and my friends group for experience, it is balls-out.  The casters are always on the jagged edge of OOM.  The pulls come constantly.  There are multiple mobs mezzed at all times, waiting for their turn to die.  The AA's flow from 1 per character every 25 to 35 minutes, in a melee-heavy, non-AE group.<br />
<br />
It is only through Knight Aggro-Lock, or with other tanks: serious Aggro-Control by the DPS classes that make this possible. <br />
<br />
Incite seems to &quot;Aggro-Lock&quot; for you, because you are in a situation where the warrior will always be ahead on the hate list.<br />
<br />
1) You are using low damage nukes that have extremely low hate. <br />
2) You are not trying to kill as fast as humanly possible for maximum experience gain.  You do not chain cast. <br />
3) You have some decent aggro / DPS weapons.<br />
<br />
Your claim that Incite &quot;Aggro-Locks&quot; in this situation is akin to this similar scenario:<br />
<br />
1) Instead of a 20/19 JTB mainhand and an offhand 18/19 Ifir, I equip a 16/21 Sharp Gem Formation, and a 15/20 Acid Pocked Mithril Blade.<br />
2) I backstab once every 20 seconds, instead of every 5.<br />
<br />
In both situations, the warrior never loses aggro because the supposed &quot;DPS classes&quot; have severely gimped themselves to the point that they are no longer doing anything even remotely aggrivating to the mob.  Because of this, In your experience groups, your warrior will always be on top of the hate list from melee and weapon procs alone.  The added hate DoT serves as nothing more than extra insurance against the RNG giving you a bad streak of procs and melee damage.<br />
<br />
All you need to do to see that everyone else is correct is to use Strike of Solusek.   Delayed and sparse Draughts generate little to no aggro whatsoever.  <br />
<br />
If you consider playing your wizards in a diminished capacity so that there is no way humanly possible that the tank can lose aggro is &quot;Aggro Lock,&quot; then you have a terminology problem.  <br />
<br />
Aggro is Locked when nothing anyone can do short of the tank dying will cause him to lose aggro.  If you cannot chain-cast Strike of Solusek, aggro is not locked.<br />
<br />
This has all been pointed out in the past.  It is all true, regardless if it is told to you in a derisive way or a civilized manner.</div></div><hr />

In the vain hope that I can help Sam find a clue, just a few comments.<br />
<br />
1)  Unsubstantiatable(sp?)  claimes just make you look foolish and will make people laugh at you.  You can offer no evidence whatsoever as to how many women you have slept with, and making such a claim strongly suggests that you have a)never slept with any women, or b)if you had, you had to pay upfront to do so.  Also, c) it has absolutely no bearing on anything being discussed, it is simply bragging, and comes across as phoney.  I strongly suspect you are not, as you claim, a 50 year old man, but in fact are an early 20's male, trapped in adolescence, living in Mom and Dad's basement.<br />
<br />
2)My favorite comment of yours in this thread has to be:<br />
<br />
Bottem line, I can kill you in game. <br />
<br />
First, as most of the people posting in this thread have better gear than you, and much more of a clue about the warrior class, most likely 1 on 1, almost everyone could kill you ingame.  This is where you pop up and say but you have 6 toons...well good for you.  Trust me, it is no accomplishment to be able to win at PvP against one toon with 6.  Simply put, on an even footing, one on one, you loose.<br />
<br />
Second...what the hell difference does it make?  EQ sucks for PvP, it has never been balanced for it, and never will.  Who cares if you can kill some one ingame, it is meaningless.  Once again you come off as some half retarded adolescent living in your parents basement, thinking that you are tough becuse you have 133t dueling skills.<br />
<br />
3)  Pretty much every thread you have started, or ever been a part of, comes off as you talking about how big your virtual penis is.  Let me give you a big hint...get a bit over yourself, loose the ego, come back down to earth...get out, get some sun, maybe shower...and just maybe you will get a woman into bed who is not actually your hand and your imagination, and maybe people will treat you slightly better when you post something on this board, and maybe we won't all laugh at you for being so stupid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I haven't been playing, or reading about eq on any boards in a few because of...gasp, real life things.  Such things that Sam is obviously lacking.  I am almost afraid to post here, after what happened last time I went off on someone (ie. Zhenobia).<br />
<br />
Lets see, where should I begin.  First, let me start with the fact that I have actually slept with 5% as many women as Sam claims to have, and for that I am ashamed.  Only those that are without think that more is better.  If I could go back, and undo all of them except my current girlfriend, I would do so in an instant.  With each one I lost part of me, part that I will never get back, and would desperately love to give to my current girl, who I believe, for the first time in my life, is possibly my soulmate.  From your posts, and your attitude, I think that you may have possibly slept with over 300 women.  That is NOTHING to be proud of.  Had I taken every opertunity to get laid that I could have, I would easily be in the 500's, if not more.  Why not? Simple things, such as standards, for starters.<br />
<br />
Point? More is often not always better. <br />
<br />
You honestly should seek out counciling.  You have a problem.  I am certain that you put an inordinate amount of value on everquest due to shortcomings that are beyond your control, or even worse, ones that are within your control.  Perhaps  you are grossly overweight.  If thats the case, go exercise.  Perhaps you were born deformed, perhaps you were in an accident, perhaps you have a personality disorder (obviously), and if thats the case, I am sorry.<br />
<br />
Point? You need help. <br />
<br />
Any sort of acheivement in a FUCKING video game deserves you NO LAUDEMENT, period.  It's just a game.  Its what most eq players do when RL stuff isnt available.  RL &gt; EQ, always.  In a matter of years, eq will be dead, a few more years after, it will be mostly forgotten.  There are NO tangible accolades to be had from exceling in eq.  You are not better than anyone else that plays the game, in fact, your over emphasis on its importance shows nothing more than that you have no life outside of the game, and that is truely sad.<br />
<br />
Point? Its just a game. <br />
<br />
Your complete inability to maintain any form of discussion here without angering everyone shows that you have no ability to do the same in any setting.  Not everything revolves around, in fact, I place money on the fact that if you were to die at this instant, no one would notice.  Your funeral would be small, and no one would be crying.  Am I trying to belittle you? No, I am trying to point out that your values are far from where they should be.  No one will attend your funeral, and think &quot;he was a great man, able to kill anyone in eq 6:1&quot;.  No, they will think &quot;how sad it was he wasted his life attaining meaningless goals&quot;.  You claim to be a landlard, and good for you.  I am sure you have a nice car. <br />
<br />
You know what? I drive a hyundai.  I don't give a damn about my car.  Why? It is MEANINGLESS.  I would not think I &quot;won at life&quot; if I had a ferarri.  I would think I have an overpriced car.  Just like everquest doesnt matter, neither does material posessions.  When you are lying on your death-bed (and I hope thats in a long time, to allow you to fulfil your life some), you will NOT look back and think of the job you had, the car you had, or the house you live in. Why? That DOES NOT MATTER.  That car will rust, someone else will do your job, and most likely do it better, and that house will age, and fall down after a few years.<br />
<br />
What really matters??? People.  Yes, people matter, and not just people that you &quot;kill&quot; in some fantasy game.  No, I mean people that had a part in your life.  You wife, your kids, your best friends.  These are all things you ar obviously lacking, and by your claim of 300+ women, obviously do not value.<br />
<br />
Here is my suggestion to you: Go to the local hospital, and talk to some of the terminally ill.  Spend some time cheering up those with only days to live.  Talk to them, find out what they think about, what they value, and what they think was important in thier lives.  I can promise you the words &quot;game&quot; or &quot;everquest&quot; or &quot;money&quot; will be brought up once.  They will talk about people.  They will talk about those close to them.<br />
<br />
Point? Everquest doesn't matter <br />
<br />
So yea, I haven't slept with 300+ women, I don't have income from doing nothing, I have to work for my paycheck.  I don't have the fancy car, the expensive house, or the nicest anything.  You know what?  I don't care in the least, littlest bit.  I have a full life.  I have someone that loves me.  Can you say the same?<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether all your (outlandish at best) claims are true, you need a serious wake up call.  <br />
<br />
You have to be ONLY person to play this game, that if told they had 3 weeks to live, would continue to play the game, aside from perhaps a few minutes to say goodbye to everyone on thier friends list.  From the way you act, you would lock yourself in your room, and spend your last few days trying to get that last piece of gear, or last AA point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not only most people that you are accosting here know more about this silly game, have more hp, have played longer, etc than you, they are BETTER PEOPLE than you.  If I had to spend 10 years on a desert island with anyone from these boards, I can promise you that you would be my absolute last choice.  While your may have more characters on some piece of shit game, they have a better personality.  Guess which one matters, and which doesn't? Right, a fucking game doesnt matter.  Bingo.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, lets digress from how pitifully confused you are in real life to how confused you are in this game.<br />
<br />
First, Agro lock.  When I hung a lock on my locker in gym class, I didn't think, &quot;Hmm, that will keep my stuff safe as long as no one tries to open the locker&quot; No, I thought that it made it practically impossible to open my locker.  Thats what LOCK means.<br />
<br />
I play a shaman, which is a great class for casual play btw.  Let me explain agro lock vs. agro control.<br />
<br />
Agro Control:  I malo on inc, slow a bit later, wait, dot at 50% if they die slow, nuke at 50% if they die fast.  If I do more, I tank the mobs.<br />
<br />
Agro Lock: I malo on inc, slow immediately.  Immediately land 2-4 dots, and not worry, refreshing dots if they fade.<br />
<br />
I can out aggro ANY warrior, easily.  There isnt enough EB procs in the world to counter 1700 damage/tick in dots + slow + nukes.<br />
<br />
A pally, chain casting thier lowest level stuns will hold aggro off me, every time.  Not even an SK can hold aggro off me when I go full tilt.<br />
<br />
Second.  Your warrior is NOT even close to being top-shit.  Not even close.  You have about the same HP as my shaman...yes, my fucking shaman.  I have MORE AC than you, and more defensive AA as well.<br />
<br />
You are like a man with a 4 inch dick running around challenging everyone to a dick-waving contest.  While its funny, its sad at the same time.  Put it back in your pants, no one is impressed.<br />
<br />
Third.  Attacking the most senior of those here gains you NO respect, quite the opposite.  Would a man walk into a biker bar, and punch the biggest guy there in the nose and expect good results? No, because that would be fatal.  There is no pride in your actions.<br />
<br />
Shut up, and open your ears and eyes.  You will learn something.  No one cares about your 6 characters, NO ONE.  Its just a game.  If you want to learn how to play that game better, then listen to the adivce given, and don't act like you know it all,  because you don't.  No one looks down on ignorance, but they do look down on boasting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You have not &quot;won at life&quot; you are losing in a VERY big way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 50 years old its not all that big of a claim. Look at the dates in that thread... thats like one a month heh... <br />
<br />
Ok, first you are 33, then you are 50? Which is it?  You need to keep your lies straight if anyone is to believe them.<br />
<br />
Oh, and is this you shaking Phil Anselmo's hand? That sure doesn't look like a 50 year old there, more like a 33 year old loser that lives in his mom's basement.  And, is that a flannel shirt?? Woah there, partner.  Maybe Bob Villa would have a job for you on his show, you'd fit right in.<br />

<br />
Hmm, your fictional life seems to be falling apart.<br />
<br />
Oh, and since you 6-box due to lack of friends, those posts you made, with people 'supporting' you, how many of those were you posting under a different name? All of them?  Maybe the reason you don't get any support here is that your IP is logged, and it would be known if you were posting under multiple names, to try and make some sort of self-validating delusion like you obviously did on the boards you posted links to.<br />
<br />
I want some proof, or I am calling you on your bluff.  Admit it, you are a 33 year old, living in his mom's basement, that is either a virgin, or has only slept with women that weigh more than you do, either of which is very very sad.<br />
<br />
I want to see a few pictures of you, I want to see a few deeds to the houses/apts you supposedly own, scanned, with your real name clearly visable, I want to see a scanned drivers liscence with your name visable, and the same picture as in the other supposed pictures of yourself, all of which better be of a 50-year old guy.  You post those, and maybe, just maybe you might convince someone that you are not just a complete, utter, piece of shit, lying, delusional, self-rightous man-gina.</div></div><hr />

exactly what I mean. Given his 6 chars played individually could do a LDoN mission in 35 minutes and it took him 121 minutes to complete it he was playing at 29% effectiveness of such a group. Awesome, Sam. Vastly superior.<br />

<br />
I haven't a fuckin clue what the hell a sand table is, but I'm assuming this is some lame-o d&amp;d shit.  So according to this, you have been a loser for 33 years, grats you.<br />
<br />
Yanno what normal fuckin people do when they get together, they play shit like poker, euchere, darts, hell, even board games like monopoly or clue, and drink beer.  Yea, beer and cards.  They don't sit around some fuckin &quot;sand table&quot; and pretend they are some frilly fuckin elf in tights prancing thru some dungeon that only exists in thier and their gay lovers minds.  D&amp;D is a small step away from playing with barbie dolls, and I'm not even sure its a step up, more of sideways.<br />
<br />
I still want to know who was in that pic?  I still want some proof that even half of these lies you spout here are true.  Keep going on about them, and maybe you will convince yourself they are true, becuase you are sure the hell not going to convince me.<br />
<br />
What exactly about your life is so sad that makes you come here and parade around how much better you are than everyone else??  Do you think that making things up is going to impress anyone here??<br />
<br />
I remember the guys that used to play d&amp;d while I was in high school, and I SURE THE FUCK don't remember ANY of them getting ANY girls.<br />
<br />
I shall diverge a bit, and go into who I think you really are.<br />
<br />
From what you say here, how you act, how you word things, describe things, and in general are, I am going to make the following descriptions of the REAL samloser.<br />
<br />
You are late teens, possibly early 20's.  You have been rejected by females for as long as you can remember.  You lacked the 'stuff' to impress them, and come here, and play eq the way you do to make up for that.<br />
<br />
You only had a few friends in school, and they were just as bad off as you.  You spent all your time in imaginary worlds, rather than face your demons, and trying to better yourself.  You continue to do this in everquest.<br />
<br />
When you were rejected by girls you asked out (or was simply ignored by them, and never had the balls to ask them out), you assumed it was because you lacked the 'stuff' they wanted.  So you proceeded to create the 'stuff' with lies, rather than actions.  What you failed to realized is that girls DO NOT care about what kind of car you have, or what job you to.<br />
<br />
You want to get girls?? Talking about yourself is the ABSOLUTE FUCKING wrong way to go about it.<br />
<br />
I have always dated &quot;out of my league&quot; per say.  Why? Becuase when I meet a girl, I have a genuine desire to get to know her, to hear about who she is, and just simply listen.  Its fuckin amazing how much you can do just by asking questions (and honestly wanting to hear the answers, girls can detect bullshit a mile away), and NOT BABBLING about how fucking great you are.<br />
<br />
You want a girl to think you are great, then be her hero, don't tell her great you are, that gets you no where.  That gets you no where on these boards, either.<br />
<br />
You have definately NOT slept with more than 300 girls.  Hell, I got more fucking game than you could dream of having, and it would take me 100 years to have that many girls.  Whats the point of banging a chick once and moving on?  No one does that, unless they can only manage to talk/bribe the girl into doing them once, and after she realizes how bad/ugly/small you are, she refuses to do it again, leaving you with no choice but to pay for another.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Until you show some hard evidence, we are all going to assume you are the cubby kid in the flannel in that picture.  We will assume you live in your mom's basement, play d&amp;d with your other, overly pale friends.  We will assume that you have never been with a girl, and aren't given the light of day with them, based on how you act here.  Girls, chime in on this if you like.  Explain exactly how NOT FUCKING impressive a guy that goes on about himself is.<br />
<br />
Show some proof or go back to playing you d&amp;d while pullin your 4 inch pencil dick and thinking about how fuckin great you are.<br />
<br />
Jesus I wish there was something more entertaining to do during down-time at work than read shit like what Sam posts.  Damn internet filter blocking all sports is the suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slansin, yur post is basically correct. I guess we should break it down a bit.<br />
<br />
Complete Agro Lock would be what you are talking about, keeping agro no matter if others try and take if from you.<br />
<br />
Normal Agro Lock would be what I am talking about where people are trying their best to play optimal. <br />
<br />
I am not arguing with that you say. I agree I do not have a complete agro lock with incite.<br />
<br />
First, as most of the people posting in this thread have better gear than you, and much more of a clue about the warrior class, most likely 1 on 1, almost everyone could kill you ingame. This is where you pop up and say but you have 6 toons...well good for you. Trust me, it is no accomplishment to be able to win at PvP against one toon with 6. Simply put, on an even footing, one on one, you loose.<br />
<br />
Ya its no accomplishment to win a PvP against 1 toon with 6, in fact its so easy its unfair. I am so much stronger then someone with one toon that its unfair.....  Ya I would lose 1v1 but FeebleMeister Furor dosn't log 5/6th of his gear for a duel, why should I?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Been a busy day. Got a BoC for my CoM, 70K and Bloodmetal Ear.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm confused.<br />
<br />
I thought you only equipped what looked cool.<br />
<br />
And lamentation looking weapons ... they don't look cool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont have any haste item now... and Im dead broke&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I'm really confused. I thought you had millions of plat?<br />
<br />
My world is about to implode<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya the weapon looks like crap compare to SBoD. But I still have my SBoD and might toss and Aug3 on it....   I mean its &quot;ok&quot; look but SBoD is WAAAY better looking (and better dps, well with the OSoW in the mainhand)... <br />
<br />
And the DPS is worse for sure, gonna have to work on my Offisive AA's I guess.<br />
<br />
I have about 2-3 million of pp worth of items over my 7 toons, have like 10K in the bank now. Got a soulscream belt for haste though and bagged the heavy rubisite. If I can pick up that nature belt fine, if not i get a CoM and reuse my rubicite belt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any sort of acheivement in a FUCKING video game deserves you NO LAUDEMENT, period. It's just a game. Its what most eq players do when RL stuff isnt available. RL &gt; EQ, always. In a matter of years, eq will be dead, a few more years after, it will be mostly forgotten. <br />
<br />
I already won at &quot;RL&quot;. I can do whatever I want and this is what I choose to do. If you like RL better go do it. This forum deals with EQ and more spifically EQ Warriors, if you are interested in RL activities then purhaps you should post on boards dealing with those activities. <br />
<br />
This is what I decided I will excell at, and I am doing a good job of excelling at it. You prefer other activities fine.... go argue about those with others interested in them.<br />
<br />
EQ might die but TeH MIGHTY DEATHWALKER will just move on to another conquest on his path to ultimate victory! I was very well known in AOK and am working on my reputation here as well.<br />
<br />
 While your may have more characters on some piece of shit game, they have a better personality<br />
<br />
LoL.....   I play to win, not to be liked LOL. Oh ya FeebleMeister Furor has a great personality.... LOL... Yur a riot dude. If the &quot;love&quot; of yur wife and kids is so important to you why you wasting time posted here?  Why don't you come home tonight and say &quot;Honey Im going to quit my job and won't be able to support the family anymore but I know you love me and we will have great sex all the time like we ususally do.&quot; We will see if she loves you or yur paycheck LOL LOL LOL. Well you are young still, and have much to learn.....<br />
<br />
Third. Attacking the most senior of those here gains you NO respect, quite the opposite. Would a man walk into a biker bar, and punch the biggest guy there in the nose and expect good results? No, because that would be fatal. There is no pride in your actions.<br />
<br />
But FeebleMeister Furor is not &quot;the biggest guy&quot; in the bar. I am. Six is greater then One. Its not all that complicated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and is this you shaking Phil Anselmo's hand? That sure doesn't look like a 50 year old there<br />
<br />
Thats me. And I was like 45 or so at the time. Thanks. I know I look younger then I am. (I never did like the sun and staying indoors almost all the time has kept my skin very young looking).<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to see a few pictures of you, I want to see a few deeds to the houses/apts you supposedly own, scanned, with your real name clearly visable, I want to see a scanned drivers liscence with your name visable, and the same picture as in the other supposed pictures of yourself, all of which better be of a 50-year old guy. You post those, and maybe, just maybe you might convince someone that you are not just a complete, utter, piece of shit, lying, delusional, self-rightous man-gina.<br />
<br />
YOu just saw a picture of me, the guy with Phil hello.... Raaj told me not to link to pictures of me when I first joined this forum. Go to the SZ Forum and make a post and I'll put a link there to pictures of some of the women I'v had sex with and see if I can find some other pics as well. Im not giving out finaincial infos on the internet. Who cares if you belive if I am well to do or not, this is a EQ forum not &quot;who's the richest guy&quot; forum. I have 6 computers and 7 accounts thats all you need to know.<br />
<br />
<br />
75 or 105 minutes? even if it was 75, you are still far from the rate Furor does normal LDoNs =P<br />
<br />
Ok I won the 90 minites collection (only needed 24 to win) at about the 77ish minite.  I doubt Furor One Person Solos LDoN's, regardless his claims....<br />
<br />
Mystaviant the rest of yur drivil really isnt worth to respond to, you can belive me or not I could really care less.<br />
<br />
Lets go to more recent times for which proof is easly accicalbe, such as my Distigushed carrer in AOK, where i invented the &quot;Castle Clump&quot; a stratagy used by the vast majority of DM players. <br />

Who cares about 1 personing LDoN? He sends out a few tells, gets a group with people together he can call friends and that respect him, do a hard LDoN in 30 minutes and ports to PoEarth to get an AA while waiting for him to finish &quot;resting from adventure&quot; while you, the laughing stock of SZ and all other servers struggle through a normal mission, not knowing whether you succeed or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok how did I manage to own a LDoN with the BoC etc. many of my fans are wondering? <br />
<br />
Well one thing we left out was the mana regen from the two Harvest type spells the wizards get. <br />
<br />
But most important is the ability to kill some mobs with only 2 casts of ICE Solosit spell from the wizards.<br />
<br />
If I let the warrior work for awhile on the mob so that he does like 20percent of the damage (with the chanter animation - charm is still to unreliable for my taste and maybe chanter nuke tossed in) then the wizards need only cast 2 times to kill the mob. Thats like 400-600 mana (I gonna start using ranges so if I say 275 someone dosn't claim is 278 and that I was wrong) per mob... nothing.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it takes more then 2 casts, but about 1/2 the time I can do 2 instead of 3. And two casts is under 25 Seconds which is a good speed to be killing mobs. Three is also under 25 cause I cast draughts while the ICE SOloist spell refreashes.<br />
<br />
Anytime I get rid of a mob with two casts is just super efficient.<br />
<br />
Ya its gonna take me awhile to get everything down (have to write the socials) and memorize the layouts (I have maps but knowing which pulls will result in 3 or more mobs is important), naturally I lost the first couple with the new hold agro methond, and no doubt i will lost more but I am fairly confident that I should do very well indeed with the BoC and Incite keeping the mobs on the warrior exclusivly (cept when I misspull and get two then I just off tank one). <br />
<br />
I've have had almost no trouble with BoC and Incite to hold agro, as my spells are low agro and I don't even have to bother with concussion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also now its impossible for the mobs to kill me if I dont try and &quot;tough it out&quot;. If I see three mobs on a bad pull (I have pacification on the chanter and cleric) I cast 3 evacs to the zone in with the wizards, word of morell with chanter (pbaoe mez wich works on these mobs), and 2500 group heal with cleric, all with the push of one button.... LOL. <br />
<br />
Who da Man? Sam da Man!<br />
<br />
<br />
While you &quot;one toon&quot; peoples is all &quot;OH nos BAD PULL EVAC!!!' &quot;NO! Don't evac I can kill them!&quot; &quot;Yes EVAC EVAC!!!! MOBZORS INC!!!&quot; &quot;NO we can take them we have FEEBLEMEISTER FUROR WITH US!&quot; &quot;DONT OFF TANK THE MEZED MOB!&quot; &quot;OH NOS I CASTED FACIANTION AND MEZED MY SELF!&quot; &quot;OH NOS FEEBLEMEISTER DOWN!

<br />
You rock at Age of Empires! Good work, sir!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But FeebleMeister Furor is not &quot;the biggest guy&quot; in the bar. I am.<br />
<br />
ROFLMAO... damn, you are truly deluded.<br />
<br />
I can just imagine Sam going up to a 300 lb biker in a bar with 5 of his little 13 year old, 100 lb soaking wet buddies, and tapping him on the shoulder saying, you're not the biggest guy in a bar, me and my 5 buddies are. He'd get laughed out of the bar.<br />
<br />
Jesus, Sam really does live in his own little world that has little or nothing in common with the world the rest of us live in.<br />
<br />
Let me clue you into something, Sam. Take any 6 characters which are about your level, even if they have inferior gear, even if they have inferior levels, and send them against your little &quot;uber&quot; group, and you would get owned and sent crying back to mommy. Take 6 level 62 warriors for example... not a healer, slower, or mezzer among them... One engages each of your characters, bashing and stunning em all... What are ya going to do now? Your casters keep getting interrupted, you can only heal one at a time if that, you can't focus all your attention on one character, have everyone hit him all at once, kill him, and brag about your cowardly zerg tactics in PvP. You can't react fast enough, you can't control all your characters as fast or as well as they need to be controlled... Your wizards are the first to drop because you can't keep them healed, because your cleric's spells keep getting interrupted... and while you're trying to heal your wizards are sitting there idle. Your chanter drops next after MAYBE managing to get a slow or mez off on maybe one or two of them... your cleric second last... and guess what, you got 4 warrriors bending yours over making you scream like a little girl.<br />
<br />
One on one one battles, you're fucked. On group on group battles, you're fucked. The only way you can win any kind of fight is by waging cowardly, unfair fights in which you outnumber your opponents several times to one, because you don't have the skills, knowledge, gear or experience to win a real fight. You've deluded yourself, off in your own little world, into thinking this makes you such a big powerful man, but let me tell you something. Everyone else thinks you're just a sad little man, who is completely incompetent as a player, and has to make up for it by sheer numbers alone. You want respect? You don't and won't get ANY here, in fact you're being laughed at and ridiculed.<br />
<br />
As for your little comment about all the one toon peoples... Hey look, Sam's talking out of his ass again! Big surprise there.<br />
No, in reality, I'll see a pull of 5 mobs or so, and between tanking several of them, AE Taunt, Incite, etc, and the other members of the party doing some CC themselves, be it mez, pet tanking, or even just plain old root, I'll almost always handle it smoothly and without deaths. I've had 6 and 8 mobs in camp at once and pulled through with no real problem. Your party would wipe. You know why? Cause you can't handle that kind of a pull. You'd evac or wipe, guaranteed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And normal players don't wipe on even hards when they pull 4 mobs at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But I have 6 toons and Furor only has one. Sure I would probably lose 1v1 and 6v6. But thats not what we have. Furor has what he has and I have what I have.<br />
<br />
<br />
So whats FeebleMeister Furor gonna do? Come to Sullon and say: &quot;Mr. DeathWalker, Sir. I'd like to PWNzor you 1v1 wid my Uber toon! Would you PLEEEEEZE log yur other 5 sos that I can?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean the United States beat Japan in WWII casue we had the bomb and they did not. Was the fight &quot;unfair&quot;, of course it was. Is America Stronger? Of course we are.  <br />
<br />
Bottom Line I'm the stronger because the fight is unfair.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya I might handle 3 (I have) but 4 forget it... in fact I will evac with 3. So whats the difference if I win I win... The comparison isn't me vs. 6 people, its me vs. one person. I mean listen to what you are saying. IT TAKES 6 PEOPLE to beat the MIGHTY DEATHWALKER - so true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No. You're the weaker, so you have to make the fight unfair to have a hope in hell of winning.<br />
<br />
Furor can log on the same amount of toons as you have, I'd bet money on it. And you know what, he'd spank you again.<br />
<br />
And don't be spewing bullshit about how that doesn't count because the billing information is different. That's sophistry, at best, and you're only making up these little &quot;rules&quot; of yours, because they happen to benefit you. I just love how people come in and make up all these different new &quot;rules&quot;, like they come in and can dictate these things. Here's another clue for ya, Sam. One I again don't expect you to get. You can't walk into, say, Mensa, and say that you are allowed to be a memeber, because the IQ between you and your 5 buddies is over the requirement. Nevermind that not a one of you even approaches average, because when taken alltogether you're over the requirement, you should be allowed to join, in fact you're smarter than Einstein. You know what, they'd bust a gut laughing, and tell you to get lost. It's much the same here.<br />
<br />
No, the reality is, it's one on one comparison. Warrior vs warrior. Mano e mano. That's the way the real world does things. You can sit there and claim all you want that you're so good, but the rest of us are laughing in your face, and thinking just how much of a moron you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And the fact Furor has leveled *atleast* 3 characters up means what?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you can use toons that you did not level up then I could just buy the top toons in the game, what would that prove? That I have more money? If you don't level the toons yurself then they are not yours... Hello...<br />
<br />
<br />
No. You're the weaker, so you have to make the fight unfair to have a hope in hell of winning.<br />
<br />
So America is weaker then Japan because we have to use the unfair nucular bomb to have a hope in hell of winning?<br />
<br />
<br />
Who is stronger FeebleMeister Furor or a naked level 40? Furor is weaker because he wont take off all his gear and delevel to 40 to fight the naked level 40. LOL.</div></div><hr />

Funny that, according to this commonly accepted system of ranking going by hitpoints, there are THREE THOUSAND and EIGHTY people at this moment, who are all bigger than you are, out of a total of 4300 or so. In fact, there's less than 500 warriors of your level that are SMALLER than you are.<br />

Jesus, do you know ANYTHING? America didn't HAVE to use the bomb to win, they could have won without it.

Thats conclusory speculation at best.<br />
<br />
No. It's historical fact.<br />
&quot;Having found the bomb we have used it. We have used it against those who attacked us without warning at Pearl Harbor, against those who have starved and beaten and executed American prisoners of war, against those who have abandoned all pretense of obeying international laws of warfare. We have used it in order to shorten the agony of war, in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans.&quot; <br />
(&quot;Public Papers of the Presidents: Harry S Truman, 1945&quot;, pg. 212). <br />
<br />
Thanks for talking out of your ass. Again.<br />
<br />
Thats it takes everything I have in game to kill FeebleMeister Furor<br />
<br />
If HE is so &quot;feeble&quot;, yet it takes YOU everything you have in game to kill him, that would make you even MORE feeble. Ohhh, i'm shaking in my boots here. Really. Or even if you're talking about his mental faculties... If he's so feeble, yet he's the one who's shown to know what he's talking about, and you're shown to be talkin g out of your ass over and over again... that makes you something about the metal capacity of a vegetable.</div></div><hr />

The truth of the matter is, you're 6 100 lb weaklings swarming the 300lb man under, because the 100lb weaklings know that's the only way they have a hope in hell of winning... and then the weaklings try and claim that they're the new big man on the block, while everyone else calls a spade a spade... it's a group of 00lb weaklings banding together, because it's the only way they're not going to get their asses kicked.</div></div><hr />

This is not a pvp forum, most of us are on blue servers, and dont give a damn who you can kill, and we here the random crap that spews from pvp'ers regularly elsewhere. (You know, the &quot;play a real server&quot; crap.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now i know its going to be pointed out that this is the outhouse, but damn this is losing its relevancy to anything as the thread gets longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Notice that Furor is the #1 most popular by a FACTOR OF 3 and change.<br />
<br />
You aren't on that list, and you NEVER will.<br />
<br />
You are not stronger.  You are not better.  You NEVER will be, EVER.<br />
<br />
Don't you get that the majority of EQ doesnt give a FLYING FUCK about PvP???  Why, because most people play to accomplish things with other people, not to kill them.  It's a MMORPG because most people like playing with other people, not doing everything they can to disassociate themselves with society, or online society.<br />
<br />
Do I care if your 6 toons can kill Furor's warrior? No.  Does ANYONE, I mean ANYONE give even the slightest fuck whether you can?? Again, NO.<br />
<br />
Sorry Sam, you LOSE at LIFE.  You lose at being a TOLERABLE human being.  You lose at EQ...Fuck, I can SOLO a LDoN normal in 2 hours, for fucking crying out loud.  No, not solo as in play 6 toons, I mean SOLO, as in Me, My Dots, and My Dog...<br />
<br />
You LOSE.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I am still wiating for the proof of all these women.  I REALLY REALLY hope you bring some good proof.  It will just validate ME further, and champion my view that you have NO CONNECTION to the world, other people, and are UNABLE TO MAKE A EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITE SEX.  Very Sad. Very very sad.</div></div><hr />

you are bragging about something you cannot prove.</div></div><hr />

Ya right... Lets see the SS on that. I'v provided SS or certified megalos (at least Furor bothered to spring for a premimun megelo costs I'll give him props for that unlike others who we have no idea if their toons exist or not) for all my EQ claims lets see you do the same.<br />
<br />
As I told you Raaj will not allow me to link to pictures of myself or any kind of &quot;proff&quot; as to me being with women. Also as I stated all you need to know is that I have 6 computers and 7 accounts, I only compete with you in EQ, so quit attempting to derail the thread. <br />
<br />
Ok you admit that I can kill FeebleMeister Furor 6v1 so whats the argument about, you claim no one could care less if I can fine also. <br />
<br />
I can kill FeebleMeister Furor at will and none cares, fine with me.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as to the Bloob vs. PvP servers I just have to question how much competition AI is.... Rest assured you will kill Quarm before you will kill all 6 of me.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to the list, yes he has way better stuffs then me. But then again I have much suprior DPS (with my 6 guys), ability to heal, rez, pacify and port... I can solo a LDoN, he can't (if he can lets see a SS). End of Story.<br />

Hey check this out, I was looking at Behemoth megalo his proc on his weapon (vaz dream dispar) is this:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_spell_info.jsp?num=3877<br />
<br />
<br />
The proc on my offhand is this:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_spell_info.jsp?num=965<br />
<br />
<br />
Both are AC debuff and HP reduction (although his is greater) that should put to rest that my offhand is not good for agro....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's see. Quarm is a 5-6 group mob for most guilds that take him down, and only a very few guilds on each server actually can field a force capable of it. Yet, Sam would have us believe that it's easier to kill Quarm, than to kill all 6 of his fairly poorly equipped characters. Sam couldn't be talking out of his ass yet *AGAIN*, could he? Tell me, moron, do you even understand what Quarm is capable of? I don't think so. Just your very act of questioning how challenging AI can be in regards to how tough mobs are really show that you don't have clue one about what it takes to succeed in Tier 3+ PoP.<br />
<br />
He claims to have provided screenshots for *all* his EQ claims, yet I see that he's constantly claiming that he can kill Furor, and there isn't a screenshot to be found of proof.<br />
<br />
Sam, the more you post, the more of a idiot and a fool you're shown to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sam has 2 major problems<br />
he does not get the idea behind MMORPGs, the idea to get friends and do stuff together<br />
<br />
also, he is bitter with his 51 years he is too slow with mouse and keyboard to play Quake3. Roughly 15% loss on reaction time cripples you at playing TRUE pvp games.<br />
<br />
Also Sam, we do not agree on you being able to kill Furor, as you have no proof of yourself being able to kill a time geared warrior, as the noot and the good team has no Time geared warriors you could PK</div></div><hr />

Unless you call mindless ganking with horridly lopsided classes running around PvP then don't mention that term and everquest together, ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you think playing 6 players at once makes you better than playing 1 player at a time?  Also, why do you think people care how you are able to do an adventure with 6 toons?  Finally, Why do you bother posting here when all you get are insults?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CATEIRE</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd even Venture to say that Furor could probably chew through a couple of your &quot;toons&quot; even if you did have a 6 on one battle. I know that I have bested a wizard or 2 in duels. All it would take is a couple of resists,  and your Team Gimp would get PWN3D.</div></div><hr />
