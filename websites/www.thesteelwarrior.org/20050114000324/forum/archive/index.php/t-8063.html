SEWS is better dps and equivalent aggro to the best of all those, and it looks cool to boot.  The &quot;AE Aggro&quot; affect and mitigation provided by the rune proc seems pretty darn cool for one-group multi-tanking type stuff, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm ~ 10 procs per minute atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With a BOC/GBOS it's not really a step back to a BOW.For me it's pretty close to my bf/boc combo.Warriors often assist with bf/various aggro weap etc and I'd say I hold aggro well.Though it's definately safer if they equip dps stuff on big hitters in case i get stunned ,unlucky etc.<br />
<br />
Do you usually tank the hard hitters like Reparm,Blazz,that stupid fiend otw to fro ,etc?I like the 2 handers then for survivability.Also pretty kewl to have dps and aggro.Are their other warriors tanking raid targets that need it more?Sews with a3 would probably be close to your 1 hand setup for aggro.Maybe a lil better off the break and a lil less in a long fight ...really I think It'd be hard to judge.<br />
<br />
I looted my BOW because I was told I was going to ma from that point on and a lot of my friends felt it would make a big differance breaking into ep's.People will debate it,but,I think it has helped.I was happy with my bf and had never planned on bidding on a BOW.In the end I'm glad I did.<br />
<br />
Hehe,you'll have to be all over the 2 hander aa to make the best of it though. :)</div></div><hr />

i think this is overplayed, sure it helps a little bit but id say it is a minor thing really. last weekend my guild killed reparm while i was unable to be online and the SA with a bloodfrenzy and BoC lived till 4% vs reparm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
even with 305 agility and WA5 we're looking at 6 tops ... maybe if i had AHR gloves ....<br />
<br />
<br />
so is the DPS on the BoWar sufficient to cover the extra 3-4 procs? I doubt it.  Not to say it isnt plenty of aggro ... i just doubt that in the long run the BoWar will win for aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To do the math:  <br />
<br />
BoC/GBoS both with anger 3 and wa5<br />
Mainhand aggro per min from procs:  (700 x 3) + (600 x 3) = 3900 hate per min<br />
Offhand aggro per min from procs: (600 x 1.5) + (450 x 1.5) = 1575 hate per min<br />
Duel Wield aggro per minute from procs = 5475<br />
<br />
Blade of War with anger3 and wa5<br />
Aggro per minute from procs: (700 x 3) + (600 x 3) = 3900 hate per minute<br />
Total Aggro per minute from procs= 3900 hate per minute<br />
<br />
In the end, is the dps aggro from the BoWar 1575 hate points above and beyond the dps aggro from the duel wield?  Knowing first hand that 1575 points of hate is more than enough aggro to let me hold the mobs attention over a rogue doing almost twice my dps, i seriously doubt the BoWars proccless aggro will let it be &quot;stronger&quot; over time.<br />
<br />
I've tanked General Reparm ... and duel wielding didnt hurt me ... it was actually a double proc + 6k in melee dmg that did the trick ... thus far i've had no problems with aggro or with dying.  After defensive falls i simply toss up my shield.  The procs throughout defensive + the 3900 hate per minute mainhand has never been too little .. and the 54 ac from the shield &gt; the 50ac on the BoWar .. especially considering that shield ac is a bit more valuable than regular ac (go check threads in the arena).<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, i would gladly give up what i have for a Blade of War in a heartbeat.  The increased dps, 50ac, and lack of ripostes is more than worth it imo.  My questoin was would you get a SEWS in my situatoin?  This would be gotten from a raiding club and not via my guild, so i'm not robbing said weapon from any guildy knights etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would go for a BoW for grouping, but when Im in a serious encounter and I need aggro, I would have to DW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well,rogues don't pull aggro normally unless somethings funky.It's a poor example and you'd have no problem holding aggro with  a equal geared rogue using  a BOW.Don't kid yourself a BOW pre time is a good aggro weapon and more than competitive with anything you have or anything anyone else has pre god/time.I've never had a SEWS,but, I've heard and seen good things concerning them /shrug.<br />
<br />
As far as riposte being overplayed....by who?I'm not overplaying anything imo.Personally,I wouldn't of bagged my bf for anything,but, a BOW pre time/god.I always liked dual wielding and i'm sure I will again hehe.Some people feel a SEWS is a worthy aggro alternative and I don't doubt them.I've tanked almost every raid encounter since before we hit EP's.For a few months we had EP's to ourselves and I tanked the fire and water mobs especially week in and week out.I tanked Reparm about twice a week always past defensive until recently.I am absolutely sure that I would have died more often dualwielding ...take it for what it's worth.I normally stay up past defensive on all the ep mobs and a tank switch is the exception not the rule.Now that is due to healing,luck and di more than whether i dual wield of course no question.These days with better hp and ac,better geared healers and dps I don't berserk as much and mobs often die before my disc drops so really the risks from riposte are much lower.When we first got to mobs like Reparm,Blazz and Ofassa I was berserking constantly and any extra damage would have likely seen a few wipes imo.<br />
<br />
Do I think that Riposte is worth bagging aggro for? no.Do I think that it can occaisonally make a differance in a close fight with a mob hitting 2-3k+ after disc? yes.Do I believe that my damage intake is smoothed overall by using my BOW vs my BF/BOC combo?Yes a little.Would I be afraid to tank Reparm etc. without a 2hander?no...and I'd use my bf anyways if I didn't have a BOW.<br />
<br />
Using a 2 hander on hard hitters is not a requirement.It's just another little advantage in some cases and I look for little advantages like most warriors.<br />
<br />
Yeh ,no parses here /shrug.Apolyon asked for an opinion so I gave him mine.You can play with numbers all day long and try to hold your conclusions as scientific evidence without all the facts accounted for.A BOW is good aggro better than a BOC/GBOS imo.SEWS has been long touted has decent aggro and with a3  I'd put it against your combo from what I've seen and heard.Yeah in a long fight you may have a small advantage /shrug.People with SEWS who have tanked with them a lot could better comment on this.<br />
<br />
Really ,when stuff gets trivial it's not a big deal for the ma to die.We have lots of great tanks, a few with very similiar ac/hp etc.Usually a tank switch is np at that point. When we first broke into EP's when I died (luckily it didn't happen often) there was a good chance of a wipe so anything reasonable to mitigate that risk was worthwhile to me.I've never been a 2hander freak,but, at times it has it's merits.<br />
<br />
As far as whether you should get a SEWS next chance you get...Our sa got one today and he's a happy camper so far(first one to drop omg).Myself, I would probably hold out for a BOW or a DBOTW if I was high in the tank order,but, that's probably cause I'm an anal tard.The SEWS is probably a good weapon for you to pick up.Should be good aggro with a3,could probably still assist with it with care sometimes and it'd be nice dps for you.Whether or not you choose to tank  with it next time you see Reparm would be up to you.<br />
<br />
ps. in a fast encounter with stuff dropping like flys it's hard to measure aggro.Taunt, position ,luck are all far more important.The other warriors in my guild use a3 BF/aggro weapons etc and I keep aggro usually with my BOW /shrug.</div></div><hr />

But you're gonna lose some aggro probably.  SEWS + A3 + WA5 &lt; Darkblade + A3 + WA5 in aggro.  But VDD + A3 + WA5 &gt; Darkblade + A3 + WA5 when I compared them to warriors who tested w/ me.  Thats DB + shield to keep off hand out of it.  I know VDD is similiar to BoW in aggro, so you can take that how you want.  The gap between SEWS and DB was closer than gap between DB and VDD, because aggro bounced for abit with SEWS but VDD grabbed aggro early and held it solid till our subject... the freeport guard in Nro that regens uber fast died.. <br />
<br />
If only I could find more bored warriors who wanted to compare weapons vs mobs not just numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye hehe. Although dbotw doesn't really figure here.If you're playing with pre time/god stuff BOW is a good choice and SEWS probaly isn't bad either.When you get to time/god there are certainly better choices and I plan on dual wielding again if I get lucky. :) <br />
ps<br />
All of these weapons are inferior to a DBOTW for a tank generally.</div></div><hr />

youre right, bad math and not thinking = wrong answers. but still i definately wouldnt count out the BoW's aggro coming from dps, its much more than i had origionally figuired</div></div><hr />

Like i said i will gladly give up my duel wield till time when i get a shot at a Blade of War.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying from a pure aggro standpoint it is a moderate step back over time... not that anything more than an a3 BoWar is necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming here that BBB and Sews are &quot;similar&quot;  to each other,  slighty better stats on the Sews.. and a slightly higher ratio.<br />
<br />
I get pretty nice aggro using my A3 BBB,  sometimes early aggro is a pain if no procs,  but then, using 1 handers, with an unlucky string of no proccing, its the same thing, but in addition to that, I completely rely on procs for 1 handers, wit ha 2 hander,  I get some form of aggro from dmg, pretty quickly actually.<br />
<br />
(Just thought I'd toss this is as an opinion on the SEWS,  since it was originally my plan to get that, but a BBB fell into place faster, and I'm content until I can earn better.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
With Flurry and Ferocity (both work with both 1h and 2h weapons), and  Punishing Blade (2h only), I have no problems on raids or in single groups holding aggro in content up into Elemental Planes, Hard ldons, and GoD trials.<br />
<br />
I tank fairly regularly next to folks armed with Blade of War, Bloodfrenzy, etc.  I can swap aggro around pretty much at will with folks armed with those weapons if/when we want to switch. <br />
<br />
You should never be having to fight with other melee for aggro anyway, with proper use of taunt and bellow.<br />
<br />
The stone etched war sword is frankly a lovely weapon.  If you don't think so, please don't get one, so the rest of us can enjoy it.<br />

I can move an anger3 to the sews for sure or a yak aug.  <br />
<br />
Need to know rather quickly.<br />
<br />
SEWS is significantly more DPS and significantly more aggro than all of those.  BOW is a little better aggro so probably a little better for raid tanking.  SEWS has a build in rune proc so it's better for XP group tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With anger augments and WA5, bloodfrenzy/BoC absolutely destroys an auged BoW for aggro.  I've had both and the difference is very noticeable.  When our dual wield EB weapon warriors tank on bosses, I don't even think about bagging my BoW...when the other BoW tank does, I almost have to.  I have recently grouped with another warrior in the guild that has augged BF/HG and WA5 and with me pulling and using incite, taunt, and every trick I know I can't hold aggro from him more than 50% of the time when all he does is assist and turn on attack.  Even my augged BF with an unauged BBotE offhand easily out-aggros a BoW, and I often switch to dual wield when grouped with a high aggro class like a beastlord so they don't have to worry about getting beat up.  I would say a SeWS would be a nice dps weapon for you, but even with anger 3 it certainly won't be an aggro upgrade to your BoC/GBoS and might even be a step down.<br />
<br />
With the AC and reduced ripostes, the BoW is a great weapon for DPS and survivability and solid for aggro, but you can certainly get much more aggro dual wielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamov</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, the aggro between the 1 handers and 2 hander (the ones you mentioned) is so close that AAs alone can tilt the favor towards either setup. (Speaking from experience with guildies... we have a bunch of war with BoW/Sews and a few duel wielding EB proccers. I observe no obvious superiority of either setup and the aggro difference can only be contributed by AA differences.)<br />
<br />
Any proc enhancing AA (eg weapon affinity) would make 1 handers more favorable, while any AAs that increase your attack rounds (ferocity, flurry, doublt riposte, punishing steel, etc) would make 2 handers more favorable.<br />
<br />
I like the way you can hold aggro throughout the fight calling assist 3 seconds into engagement  with 2 handers tho~  but i could be biased since i got a sews :P <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i seriously doubt the BoWars proccless aggro will let it be &quot;stronger&quot; over time.<br />
I really don't see how you can say this without empirical evidence.  Ask Bigchest, he said this over and over again too, until he actually got a BoWar and found out how it performed.<br />
<br />
The BoWar outdamages your setup by about a third, and its damage bonus is 3x as large as your dual wield.  Do you think that difference is worth no aggro?<br />
<br />
BF/BOC is better than BoWar, sure.  But BF/BOC is in a different aggro category from the weapons that you have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm getting differant results Brutal.I've got warriors with me that have Wa - 5, a3bf/hg &amp; a3bf/gbos who tank every day with me.We all taunt on trash clearing and often&quot;compete&quot; for aggro on lighter mobs.I have aggro most of the time.Sure the tanks setting up on the next break will usually have aggro if i do it fast thinking they have aggro.However,I usually pull it back fast.I believe that an a3 BF/ebweapon has more potential for aggro over time.I would give an &quot;edge&quot; to such a combo,but, I don't believe it &quot;destroys&quot; a3 BOW aggro.I would also give an &quot;edge&quot; to the BOW on engage.We play with this on every raid and I see the results.<br />
<br />
As far as beastlords go.Even aggressive beasts pulling for me and slowing and chain nuking have not given me any real problems in groups and none in raids.There are only 2 classes that I really worry about post slow aggro(which is trivial now usually if people are anywhere near me) and thats occaisonally wizzys on raids when they're being very agressive and especially necro's.Of course any caster can pull aggro being silly,but, necros pull aggro just being necro's omg.I've never had a problem with a beastlord since I got my BOW.Several of them slow  well before the mob gets to camp and it's never been a problem to get aggro back and hold it reasonably well.You can proc for 3 minutes with your bf/hg setup and my necro buddy will drag a mob off you now and again anyhoos.<br />
<br />
I also ma'd with both setups quite a bit.I like the BOW and our warriors often assist with dualwield eb auged weapons on bosses without a problem.Personally I prefer tanks to use dps stuff less they want aggro for blurring mobs etc.If i get stunned and knocked back than aggro can be tricky and a sa using an auged eb weapon is likely to catch it.We engage most mobs very quickly.I almost never get halfway through furious if i have it up  before the dps has engaged.Sorry, I do see some advantage,however, in most fights between these weapons it comes down to the rng and tank tactics imo.<br />
<br />
PS. no offense intended.I like a lot of your posts,but,&quot;destroy&quot; is way off imo.I've tanked ep bosses start to finish without having to taunt way past defensive with dualwielding eb wars on them from 3 seconds in.I only have furious for like 1 mob a plane as well usually because we pull fast.Again stuff will happen on occaison if assists use high aggro combos between the rng and situational aggro modifications.</div></div><hr />

I have VoT on and the other warriors are at max range.  I still think they're stupid if they don't swap out their bloodfrenzy though.  As I said, a BoW is perfectly acceptable as an aggro weapon, but bloodfrenzy/BoC is much better.  It's obvious in exp groups.  With WA maxed BF/BoC is almost 11 procs per minute to the BoW's 6.  I don't care how much dps you're doing, BoW is just not as much aggro.  If you get no proc obviously more DPS is better, but averaging a proc every 5-6 seconds it's extremely rare that you won't get one very quickly after engaging.</div></div><hr />

VERY accurate.<br />
<br />
Have neither warrior taunt.<br />
Just let the raw aggro show you.<br />
After a few minutes (If the mob is still living) Have the BoW warrior use incite.<br />
He still cannot regain aggro unless he taunts.<br />

But yes.<br />
BoW owns on engage.<br />

I agree assisting with an eb weapon is dumb unless you want a certain amount of aggro for a reason.When ever I assisted I always swapped out at least my mainhand to dps.You didn't read my post V.I agreed the dualwield combo has an &quot;edge&quot; over time given an average return in procs.But imo it's close no way does such a combo &quot;destroy&quot; a BOW.<br />
<br />
This is a fact in my experience.Many of the times I have engaged a raid mob in say fire I don't have to taunt.This includes many occaisons that warriors assisting were using A3 bloodfrenzys/eb weapons...I didn't have to taunt.Without having furious up and using incite on engage with red con mobs like reparm and the fire crew I didn't have to taunt despite the warriors using their a3 dualwield combos that &quot;destroy&quot;my BOW for aggro.On many occaisons I've had to taunt as well.Usually to cover a dps caster on summoning who rode the line to fine,although,taunt on red mobs sucks as we know and they usually die or often the mob returns to me after summoning.Now i've seen these guys inciting on raid targets as well hehe sometimes a few carry over aggressiveness from playing with clearing mobs.<br />
<br />
 I've talked to our warrior cadre about max range,timing for use of aggro tools and weapons etc.On a lot of occaisons some with your favored bf/ebweapon setups have jumped in fast eb weapons blazing away.In fact it used to be the standard /shrug it worked I held aggro no biggie.It's not the correct way imo,but,if those combos destroyed BOW aggro I never woulda been tanking.All thi s time the rng has heavily favoured me I guess go figure.<br />
<br />
When i used to swap out my bf/boc a3'd combo for hours on end with groups trying to place the BOWs aggro in my mind  before I had my offensive aa it left me with this impression...<br />
<br />
1) my dualwield setup had a small advantage in aggro over time.Not enough to rely on mob after mob,but, after a bit it seemed a little better.<br />
<br />
2) the BOW is consistently stronger on engage and overcomes slow &amp; early dotting etc quickly.One of my best friends in eq is a 450ish aa necro who is an aggro magnet.<br />
<br />
3) on raids I couldn't tell my aggro apart from the 2 setups. I mt every raid and BOW aggro worked as well for me as my dualwield combo.In fact for early aggro lack of riposte damage It has worked better.<br />
<br />
Friends could tell you I beat my head against the ground for months playing with these weapons.Everyone I know says I hold aggro extremely well for a warrior even beside guys wielding the touted dualwield combos /shrug.If I felt that the real aggro differance was significant on raids I'd bag the BOW in a heart beat.Of course I wouldn't have held aggro at all the last cpl months if those combos really &quot;destroyed&quot; a BOW for aggro.</div></div><hr />

Did you mean just instead of your staff?I wouldn't knock the BOW before you get one.I ma with one a minimum of 4 days a week.It works well and the mobs are usually red cons.If I had to rely on taunt I'd be outa luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, &quot;destroy&quot; isn't a particularly specific term.  Here's some &quot;facts&quot;. <br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy mainhand = 4.65 ppm * 700 hate = 3255 hate per min<br />
Marble Sphere of Ire = 3 ppm * 600 hate = 1800 hate per min<br />
Blade of Carnage offhand = 1.5 ppm * 700 hate = 1050 hate per min<br />
Marble Sphere of Ire offhand = 1.5 ppm *700 hate = 900 hate per min<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy + BoC = 7005 proc hate per minute<br />
<br />
Blade of War = 3 ppm * 700 hate = 2100 hate per min<br />
Marble Sphere of Ire = 3 ppm * 600 hate = 1800 hate per min<br />
<br />
Blade of War = 3900 proc hate per minute, or roughly 56% of the dual wield combo's proc aggro.  <br />
<br />
In MY experience, the added DPS does not make up for the 3100 lost proc aggro per minute, and it's not what I consider a small difference.  I still use my BoW all the time, but it is what I consider a pretty significant downgrade in aggro from my old dual wield combo.  Is it possible to hold aggro off of people who aren't trying to get it from you?  It sure is, but still a large (by my definition of large) loss of aggro.<br />
<br />
SEWS will be a downgrade from the BoW aggro-wise.  I don't know what the numerical aggro on rune proc is, but I would guess it's &lt;400.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
*Updates magelo*<br />
<br />
Unfortunatley, you are incorrect.<br />
My combo beats BoW everytime and will continue to do so regardless of your perceptions.<br />
If you want to think the BoW is the be all end all of aggro, thats on you.<br />
<br />
But dont try selling it to me.<br />
I know better :)<br />
<br />
Im not knocking the BoW, I want one:)<br />
But I know where my aggro lies.</div></div><hr />

.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not really paying attention the actualy math you did, but isn't main hand aug ppm approx 1.8?, Not 3ppm, which gets cut approx half on off hand, to about .9?<br />
<br />
And it'd be even less since BF has a considerable proc mod. Also BF has a 155% proc mod, which means on main hand, it has a PPM of 3.1, not 4.65.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just realize you added in WA5, which would further off set the aug ppm with even higher main proc Putting it probably at around...<br />
<br />
mainhand = 205% PPM, 4.1<br />
Aug = Somewhere around 2.6 PPM<br />
Off hand = 1.5 PPM<br />
Off hand Aug = Somewhere around 1.3 PPM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far has perceptions go you don't even own a bow.At least I have one to compare with a better dualwield set up to form mine.I stand by what I said.A warrior i raid with every day uses a blood frenzy/gbos auged combo he has for a long time.My aggro is stronger ask anyone who has been around long enough to have a clue in Final Door on Stromm.There are many high aggro combos in our raid force and the augedBOW is not destroyed by any of them.When we compete for aggro i have it most of the time.<br />
<br />
Again,I'll say that a bf/ebweapon has more aggro potential over time imo.But the differance isn't huge.Without taunting an a3 BOW can draw aggro off any setup I've fought beside.Obviously a dbotw and such stuff is better and I hope to go back to dulwielding one day.<br />
<br />
I think me and Brutal disagree in degree,but, your idea that your combo is good for ma'n on raids where an auged BOW is not is ridiculous.With my BOW I compete well with BF/eb weapon combo's nevermind a BOC/GBOS setup.The rng could favor any of these in a given moment even over time/god stuff i imagine.<br />
<br />
Believe what you like.Raiding maintanks have used BOWS well into time with good effect since augs and wa-5.I've raided with the same people for a year and have used the bow since I got it.The warriors weilding bloodfrenzys seem to think I have good aggro.<br />
<br />
Btw I never suggested that a BOW was the &quot;be all and end all of aggro&quot; nice try.I said it's competitive with the best pretime/god combos.Better at engage a lil weaker over time.Not &quot;destroyed&quot; or ruled by a BOC/GBOS setup.You wouldn't know though because you don't have one.<br />
<br />
I think some of my first posts here were regarding whether I should upgrade to a BOW from BF/BOC.If I had read this and relied upon your &quot;perception&quot; of BOW aggro I never would never have bid.Believing that I possesed a combo that destroyed a BOW in aggro and that even lesser setupes would consistently prove stronger i never would have bid.I would have missed out on a great weapon at this stage in the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Destroy&quot; is not accurate at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do a search and see Varalla if you want.Alot of warriors who own both combos feel similarily to me on this board from time to tactics.I own both.I've tanked with both on raids a lot.Disregard me for making stuff up if you feel like it.If people are aiming at an exact figure we can't do it with our info and I wouldn't blame anyone for viewing the aggro balance between a BOW &amp; BF/BOC from either side a little,especially if they own these weapons and have tested them a lot.Suggesting a BOW will get consistently over aggro'd by a BOC/GBOS or that A BOW doesn't do a job well tanking against&quot;serious&quot; encounters is silly.</div></div><hr />

Time tanks use BoW till they can get their hands on DB.  I got every respect for that weapon, and only combo I gave up that weapon for was DB/EoE. I used BoC/GBoS till I got BoW, and fuck the aggro math, BoW had a nice dps aggro, that I noticed right off the bat, it made the early part of the fight smoother, so even if over time you're producing less aggro, the early part is the important part, hence BoW is a very respectable weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah yeah yeah opinions opinions :)<br />
<br />
I am well aware some use BoW to tank.<br />
Thats what its for.<br />
Never said it wasnt, never said it sucks, never downed it, knocked it, or dissed it in anyway.<br />
<br />
But when push comes to shove and I need the highest aggro possible, Im going to pick the superior setup.<br />
<br />
I know you &quot;Percieve&quot; and &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;Others dont agree&quot; and your &quot;Best friend Bob told you&quot; or &quot;You really really like your BoW&quot; and &quot;Its just the best thing that ever happened in your life&quot; &quot;Really noticed the aggro right off the bat&quot; etc etc.<br />
<br />
Didn't mean to offend you or make you think I dissed your most prized possesion or anything, didnt mean to step on your manhood.<br />
But it isnt the best aggro available.<br />
Sorry :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">varalla reminds me of a post by omnus a while back that went something along the lines of &quot;ive never used a BoW but the aggro seems disappointing&quot; which seems to me to be the prevailing views of anyone with a BoC + weapon who hasnt used one. it certainly was mine when i was using a yak aug'd bloodfrenzy until i went to tactics one day with a warrior friend who had a BoW and the aggro was completely split between her BoW and my yak aug'd BoW and anger3 BoC. <br />
<br />
the bloodfrenzy is an amazing weapon, and an anger3 BF and anger 3 BoC will beat an anger 3 BoW, but the dual wield absolutely doesnt destroy the BoW. i would rate the BF/BoC for aggro as a 10 out of 10 (i know theres better) and then a BoW as about an 8, and then a BoC as about a 7.<br />
<br />
if you look at your aggro set up, the procs from the BoC cancel out the procs from the BoW. then you have your offhand procs to take into account, its 1.5 of about 400 hate, and 1.5 of 600 hate per minute. so thats 900 additional hate a minute from your offhand. do you honestly think that the BoW dps wont clear that hate? i can promise you the BoW hate from dps will rip that shit apart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only competes for aggro if a non warrior's name is on HOTT for an extented period of time....when mob turns back to a tank type...it too random on who it turns too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe.So Varalla you think you place a higher value on aggro than I do.I'm not making shit up.Reasonably,perception can account for some latitude and thats all we have.Number's being used to account for aggro by us in calculations are means to an end not fact unto themselves.We cannot calculate accurately calculate the aggro differances between a BOW and these other combos we can only go by our experience.You definately underestimate this weapon.Using Big's formula with BF at the top(it's the highest aggro weapon I've tried to date over time) I'd rate BF at 10,BOW at 9, and BOC at 7 with a gbos around 5.5.Of course thats just my perception and it suggests the dualwield weapons are working inside of a combo.When you do all your offensive aa I'd move the BOW to like 9.5 overall and suggest that although it may put out less over all hate than a BF/BOC long term it will often out aggro the other combo in practice. <br />
<br />
Btw ,you're making up stuff then implying I said it. I never said that either a BOW  is &quot;the be all and end all of aggro&quot;,or,&quot;the best aggro available&quot;.<br />
I did say many times that my BOW produce a little less aggro over time than my BF/BOC combo.I did say it's better for me on engage.I also suggested that for raidtanking the differance in aggro is small enough that most of the time I'm better off with my BOW.I also said that every day that I raid for hours with warriors with a3bf/eb weapon setups I usually out aggro them when we compete(stuff is often dieing fast then) and hold aggro from them  when we don't.<br />
<br />
It's not &quot;my most prized possesion&quot; and don't worry you're not &quot;stepping on my manhood&quot; hehe.I always wanted my BF and if anything have a sentimental attachment to it... er well Gunnar does.The BOW has just turned out to be a better tool for me in raidtanking.I wouldn't blame anyone for choosing the BF/BOC combo for the same duty instead,though, I'd laugh if they chose a BOC/GBOS over a BOW all a3'd.<br />
<br />
Like a lotta warriors I came up struggling for aggro a long time it sucked.I have an interest in aggro and most things about tanking it's why I post here.People like Aspit , Brutul, and others have helped me learn by reflecting on their posts and my own experience.I could care less what you use to tank with.However ,I appreciate Steelwarrior and imo your sense of these weapons is outa wack.Other people will read these posts like i did when I decided to loot my BOW and your posts could mislead them...no offense.What i've taken issue with is you suggesting that dualwield combo's &quot;destroy&quot; BOW aggro and that you would need to dualwield to tank &quot;serious&quot; targets.That you think your combo is stronger aggro than an a3'd BOW everytime by a large margin is wrong.I have tanked mobs lasting for 5 min+ with a3 Bf/eb wars smacking the mob beside me and never taunted.Yeah it's not a good idea to play to the rng.<br />
<br />
In the end it's hard to prove stuff.I'm under a scope every day I raid though with a guild full of great people who watch and depend on my aggro to get stuff done.A raid tank could do well with any of these setups.BF/eb weapon and BOW a3'd are the best setups to tank with pre time/god imo.A BOC/GBOS doesn't compete well here although it's perfectly capable of pulling aggro time to time like any eb or high aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh Kiwo,it still works though and some people constantly taunt while we're clearing and I only taunt when I see the HOTT change as well hehe.If the BOW was that weak I'd be losing aggro a lot more and woulda bagged it.I'm not meaning any disrespect to my guild tanks here.All our warriors are good at picking up and sliding aggro.I work with the best group of people I've met in eq and love our tank core.Still do you guys think the BOW is significantly less aggro than a BOC/GBOS all auged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that you would need to dualwield to tank &quot;serious&quot; targets.<br />
<br />
Now you're the one building strawmen.  <br />
<br />
I think I made it clear that I use the BoW almost exclusively for both exp groups and raids.  I'm saying it's a pretty significant downgrade in aggro from my old setup, but I still use it for the total package.  <br />
<br />
Strictly for aggro, I would call it a 7 compared to BF/BoC at 10, but I still use it over my dual wield combo 99% of the time.  It is &quot;enough&quot; aggro, and the higher ac, higher dps, and lower riposte rate make it my first choice in most encounters.  When I do pull out my dual wield weapons, it's to get more aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes they did Brutul.<br />
<br />
quoting Varallas first post&quot;I would go for a Bow for grouping,but when Im in a serious encounter and i need aggro,I would have to dw.&quot;<br />
<br />
she also said &quot;Destroy is  accurate.VERY accurate.&quot;<br />
<br />
she then said&quot;My combo beats Bow everytime and will continue to do so regardless of your perceptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those are the statements I took issue with.<br />
What &quot;strawman&quot; am I building?<br />
<br />
PS I can accept your position Brutul although I disagree with the exact measure and the use of &quot;destroy&quot; and  the method of calculating BOW aggro vs other combos.I woulda dropped it there but for Varalla's posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty picky I agree.In any fight anyone wielding an a3eb weapon is likely to pull aggro due to the rng.People will place the BOW alongside the other highend weapons according to their own perceptions,but, the BOW remains a good raid tank weapon at the pre time/god stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiwoadi</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still do you guys think the BOW is significantly less aggro than a BOC/GBOS all auged?<br />
<br />
If you take aggro generation from weapon in itself....the bf/boc a3 will generate more aggro than bow a3....though hard to tell with the bf/gbos aug VS. a BOWs A3..Again, weapon in itself. When you add in other variables (long list) that enhances the aggro generators and attention from mob.....it might be to the point that those indirect aggro generators might overcome the weapon in itself aggro generator.  Another variable to consider is the roll of a tank in &quot;waiting&quot; VS. a tank &quot;tanking&quot; especially since the only time we do compete for mobs attention, along with other tank types, is when mob's attention goes to a non-warrior type and its random on which tank type the mob turn back too. If Kiwo's name pops in the HOTT box (which rarely happens..IMO..;)..), I can easily get back in max melee range and lose attention.<br />
<br />
What matters the most is that the MA generates sufficient aggro to sustain the mobs attention to the point that other peeps can give high DPS output....which is an attribute that Final Door can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, I don't disagree with you Kiwo.as i stated i think my bf/boc is a little better long term aggro than my  BOW.I also think that a A3 bf/GBOS is very close possibly slightly better long term as well though again it would be difficult to draw comparison between them cleanly.Those combos have a BLOODFRENZY mainhanded not a BOC...big differance.I wasn't contending those points. :) <br />
<br />
Of course there are many tanking variables including luck that come into play.I'm not discussing that either really.If you look above you'll see the points I was contending.I agree that what matters is you can get the job done and that it could easily be done with a even a BOC/GBOS because teamwork,luck and tank tactics play a big role in confronting raid mobs.But,I already said all of that.<br />
<br />
By significantly less aggro  I meant easily noticed in the aggro quality of a tank doing his job.And that was a BOC mainhanded btw.</div></div><hr />

Really it depends though, Blade of carnage proc rates pretty low so thats one of the main reasons it was a major upgrade for me back than.</div></div><hr />

In this thread you have warriors with firsthand knowledge saying that BF/BOC &gt; BOW &gt; BOC/GBOS.  You accuse them of speculation, but they are not speculating.  It is you who are speculating, since you have drawn conclusions from observing other warriors whom you do not control.<br />
<br />
As for the tone of this thread.... I remember not too many months ago when your posts had a much more pleasant tone than this.  Did something change?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe people keep taking things out of context ,or, rewording them to suit an argument made or unmade.We could stand here and disagree all day about the exact aggro output of these weapons.For most warriors looking to pick them up I can probably honestly say this:<br />
<br />
Most warriors ma'n through ep and early time content would find an a3 BOW &amp; an a3Bf/ebweapon combo good setups for tanking raids with.A lot of warriors I've read and talked to say the a3BOW is still good aggro for time/god content though of course there are better aggro weapons there.By the same token an a3BOC/GBOS combo though capable of doin the job is not as favored as either of the other setups.If a BOW was &quot;destroyed&quot; in aggro by other available combos people would eat the lil bits of riposte.No warrior likes losing aggro.If a BOC/GBOS was always obviously stronger aggro than a BOW people would prefer that has well.These basic views seem to be roughly shared by a majority of warriors.<br />
<br />
When Varalla said she would use a BOW for grouping but in a serious encounter fall back to her dw setup which destroyed and or beats a BOWs aggro everytime(her BOC/GBOS combo) she represented very much a minority opinion imo.Of course our speculation is only in use of both weapon sets that we have tanked with and we don't share any experience in comparison testing as she has done./shrug<br />
<br />
Outside of this I have my personal experience.I have tanked many encounters with my BOW with warriors assisting with a3bf/eb weapons with seldom having to taunt off of them.I'm not saying a couple here,but, a lot ...months of raiding.Some changed to dps weapons and probably due at least partially to my request more do now.A month or so ago We engaged Reparm and the assists came in fast ,in the opening seconds.Several of them were at close melee including the sa.I got stunned and knocked back very early very far and the sa caught aggro and died.He wasn't wielding a bf like at least one of the other wars there.Rather he had a3 auged dps weapons,but, they proced I was outa range and the  rng didnt favor him.Using hate weapons on assist can be tricky there is luck involved and if you don't take care to mitigate your risk your likely to catch aggro sometime.After this  some wars swapped to dps weaps more often some slapped a shield offhand with their bf etc.In any case unless my aggro was mitigated by circumstance,range ,debuff,blur etc. I almost always held aggro  on serious encounters well past defensive.I have also walked up in groups and taken aggro from warriors taning with these weapons without taunting.That of course is subject to the ring.<br />
<br />
The point is BOW aggro is good and it is certainly suited for tanking serious encounters until you get a dbotw or similiar despite what has been stated in this thread.You can word play with that all you like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I can say I never once disputed this.<br />
I AGREE with you! 100%!<br />
I WANT A FRIGGN BoW!<br />
<br />
Now that outta the way, look at my profile.<br />
Seems kinda weird doesnt it?<br />
I am also a completly different warrior than you. :)<br />
I am in a small guild that got stopped by PoP.<br />
While the rest of you guys moved up, I worked on AA.<br />
<br />
While most guilds work together on a daily basis, know each other well, and work like a well oiled machine able to anticipate the other, I tank open raids. :)<br />
<br />
Due to the power of AA's and GoD gear the smaller guilds on our server are starting to advance. Tanked MM on Karana successfuly yesterday. With a duel wield set up.<br />
Extra ripostes that &quot;eat you alive&quot; like someone above said are my last concern.<br />
<br />
Here is where I prefer my setup over the BoW :)<br />
I know you dont believe me, but my setup has a bit higher aggro.<br />
In an open raid with the chaos, confusion, and inexperiance of others AGGRO IS GOD.<br />
<br />
Our MM fight took well over 10-15 minutes while people tried to figure out whether to assist me or off tank. Mean while MM is stunning the hell outta me while the Wizards are still nuking him to death. I NEED that extra aggro more than I need to avoid riposte damage. I do NOT need the DPS of the BoW.<br />
All I need is max aggro.<br />
<br />
If I was in a well tuned guild I would probably go BoW as well.<br />
(It would definatly be my prefered weapon in GoD)<br />
<br />
Im not trying to say your wrong or anything, but all I have to look at is the math, and the opinions.<br />
<br />
Ive had a Novae warrior ask how I got two red epics.<br />
I had a Time geared warrior tell me that disarm was aggro.<br />
<br />
Im not trying to troll or upset anyone.<br />
Or be unpleasent.<br />
Im not a bad person like that.<br />
I come here to learn and to teach.<br />
<br />
But when what your saying conflicts with the math that our community put together in the first place...<br />
<br />
What am I supposed to believe?<br />
It doesnt help without taunting I pulled aggro from a BoW in a lot of LDoN's. RNG maybe, but the BoW has only been able to grab aggro from me early, never over time.<br />
<br />
I would very much like to have all of agree on it.<br />
Help me help you!<br />
Make me a believer.<br />
<br />
*Hugs Gunn*<br />
<br />
And if you were offended it wasnt intentional.<br />
Just felt you were trying to blow me off like my opinions werent as good as yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayida</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You keep quoting the math Varalla as if you (or anyone else) had presented a complete analysis of it. <br />
<br />
If procs were the limit of aggro life would be a lot easier.  But they aren't, I don't know anyone who has all the math or the coding for aggro, and your &quot;opinion&quot; flies in the face of experiential data from a majority of others. <br />
<br />
People say that everyone is &quot;entitled to their opinion&quot;, and I disagree (/smiles).  Reality is that folks are entitled to an opinion up to a point, and then not anymore.  The lines on that make for interesting philosophical arguments, but it certainly isn't a free get out of any situation you want card. <br />
<br />
Aggro has a number of components to it.  In use, not only does BoW perform on a raid and group level as well as or better than pre-time 2h combos, but my SEWS (oh wow, what *was* the original title of the this topic) is sufficiently good that I have no problems with it in raid or groups when there are BoW / dual combo users around, in either gaining initial aggro, taking aggro when necessary, or sustaining aggro through one of those lovely 1 million+ hp mobs back in VT (for example).<br />
<br />
Given that we have taunt and incite most of this is moot anyway.  Unless the other warriors on a raid or in a group are *also* taunting / inciting the mob you're tanking, &quot;competition&quot; for aggro doesn't really exist with them.<br />
<br />
It's the other classes that can cause potential problems, and aggro management is as much the responsibility of those classes as it is the warriors.  <br />
<br />
One of the nicest things about my SEWS is when facing multiple mobs.  I regularly (not &quot;frequently&quot;, but regularly) get mobs turning to me just because of the Rune III aggro, even when I haven't touched them yet.  I can wade into a multiple pull situation, whack anything, and between AE Taunt and the extra from a lucky Rune proc calm everything down quite nicely.  <br />
<br />
I was in ME (helping folks hunt shards) recently in a group of 3.  It was interesting to be able to see the cleric cast a group heal, have the extra mobs turn to her, then have my sword proc RIII, and see them turn back to me - a bit of a surprise, frankly.  I've had 2 different paladins comment recently in groups that they were wondering what was going on, because their group heals weren't pulling the aggro they expected.<br />
<br />
If you can't get a BoW on your raids, or if you (like me) don't like the BoW graphic, the SEWS is just fine.  <br />
<br />
If you think that you need/prefer to tank hard Ldons, PoP boss mobs, and GoD with dual combos for the aggro, then you are odd or uninformed.  Please note that until I got into high end 2hs, I laughed at the notion of giving up my BF dual combo.  The first week or so I had my SEWS I played with using one set up or the other constantly to test how things were working.  I haven't had my BF combo in my hands since then.  I'm keeping the BF only because someday I might have a darkblade of the warlord or similar weapon, and I'll want my BF then. <br />
<br />
It might be possible to construct a scenario where I'd suddenly want my dual combo instead of my SEWS, but I haven't figured it out yet. <br />
<br />
Btw, I am the MA for a joint guild &amp; independents raiding alliance that has 300 members on the rosters.  We aren't an &quot;open&quot; raiding guild but we aren't a 60 person tight guild either.<br />

A 10 to 9 makes it easy to understand. <br />
<br />
but you dont have a slight edge in aggro, everyone whos used the weapons in questions says youre wrong. youre like a blind person saying the sky is pink while everyone who can see is yelling that its blue!<br />
<br />
<br />
Your speculation is in use, mine is in comparison.<br />
I cant compare my aggro to a BoW if im using a BoW, but I am able to compare it with others that are using a BoW. <br />
<br />
For uninformed speculation, my logic is sure sound and no one has been able to come up with anything better than &quot;I think your wrong&quot; hehe<br />
<br />
youve never used a BoW so you dont know what youre talking about, all youve done is play a few times with a warrior with one and gotten a few lucky procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh the large threat aggro from swings on these weapons is worth more than some people think and can't be properly accounted for with the basic aggro calculations that have been tossed around.I don't  do the funny math myself just rely on experience which is easily refuted by anyones perception individualy.Although, playing with the numbers can lead to better understanding and I value peoples work here with them our aggro comparison calculations  here are hardly proof of anything as we don't have enough info to work with.I found the BOW competitive without offensive aa ,but,since I did that my  aggro with it has improved to the point that it's extremely good  for my content level.I doubt the cursed necros will ever stop stealing it when they want to,but, I can engage stuff in POW get stunned ,spun in circles has the mob is pushed through me miss a large number of attacks due to facing and range and still hold aggro from dualwield combos choppin away nonstop from the sides.<br />
<br />
You guys with the numbers ever factor in the pb stuff and swing aa?PB would cause more procs or no?Certainly, at this point offensive aa does more for 2handers than 1handers imo.Whatever the reason a BOW is very strong in the practical application of raid tanking.Anyone using ana3 BOW is likely to see better results imo than with a BOC/GBOS subject to the rng.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My aggro against other warriors with BoW/a3 has always been a tossup at the start with me always holding aggro after a few seconds.  Unless they get very lucky with a string of hardcore procs, their aggro generally belongs to me as the extra dps aggro is not sufficient to counterbalance another 3-4 procs of anger3 and stun over time.<br />
<br />
At first i always believed that i could just assist with my aggro weapons when the MT had a BoWar (as i dont have a BF etc), but even with him inciting and me assisting on bosses/trash,  i'd peel his aggro every other mob if not every mob ... and always on longer fights. at 12500/2500 fully buffed i assume this time tank had all the perky offensive aa's to go with his BoWar.<br />
<br />
Once again, i'm not knocking the BoWar as i would retire my duel wield for it any day of the week.  I'm simply looking at the numbers and judging from past experiences.  It is an amazing weapon, but it sure as hell isnt the end-all for aggro. All in all i'd say it's 3 steps forward and one step back for me ... with the only drawback being a very very minor setback in aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well again I think all hate weapons can pull aggro due to the rng.Really imo ppl wielding BOC's mainhand are biasing their experience here hehe.The few warriors we have still with BOC's almost never pop up in the HOTT on my mobs so I dunno.The bf/hg type guys have pretty competitive aggro and I can tell that when tanking raids.However, my ability to hold aggro as a ma has improved with my BOW since I switched from my BF/BOC combo.All our BF/eb weapon wars love aggro and want BOWs bad hehe.Again assisting with hate weapons should only be done with care and in appropiate measure.Although people often do it and I still have aggro until the necro/wiz cranks it up in the first 10 seconds. :)<br />
<br />
PS As I've said many time yeh I feel that a BF/eb weapon combo has more POTENTIAL hate long term.Not always in practice though.First time anyone grabs aggro and taunt is used BOW pulls ahead again imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only really skimmed over the last 2 pages, but I have to add this.<br />
<br />
Warriors have great agro over time, pretty much any EB+A3 weapon in main hand gives us enough hate over time.  More is better sure, but once agro is established generally warriors will hold it till the end of the fight.  What we lack is snap agro.  BoW destroys any DW combo in snap agro.<br />
<br />
My combo has awesome agro overtime and I can't dispute that if I attack a mob with DW and another warrior in my guild attacks the same Mob with a BoW (both have echo of anger) at the end of the fight the mob will be on me, but at the beginning of the fight it will be on the warrior with a BoW.<br />
<br />
For XP groups, especially fast killing ones such as mountain trials with a charmed pet I use BoW over Darkblade+EoE because the fights last less that 15secs and the DPS agro of the BoW can beat fast snare / chain SL while the DW combo relys on it procing.  Fights like Xegony, Warlord Ginto, any earth or air mini that blurs the DPS agro of the BoW is significant.  I know warriors who had agro issues on these mobs using BF/BoC combo that had no issues when they got BoWs - procs were not reliable, BoW's DPS agro is.<br />
<br />
You can do the math on your BoC/GBoS or whatever all you want, but until you use a BoW you simply won't appreciate how good its &quot;snap&quot; agro is at the begining of a fight, and snap agro is more important in alot of situations vs agro over time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first 3 minutes of the fight, I'm fairly certain that a BoW or SEWS will hold aggro over a BF/BoC.<br />
<br />
Riposte discipline generates a LOT of aggro on an unslowed mob.<br />
<br />
DPS on a 2h weapon generates a LOT of aggro.  I'm using a SEWS, and I don't care if a taunt failed before I break mes, because an incite + three melee swings is enough to get aggro from messed mob (if its been slowed by the same person who messed it, I usually wait a tick for incite to build up 70 more aggro before breaking and almost always get aggro back after the second round).<br />
<br />
Yes, over the course of a 40minute fight, the tank using a BF/BoC will have generated more aggro than the tank using the BoW or the SEWS --- but since most mobs die before stonewall drops (pre-time), you'll still probably generate more aggro in that time using furious with a good 2h than you would dual wielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the thing with a rune proc is they need eventual build... rune doesn't make agro on first cast, it needs to be knocked off and recasted to create agro. This is an excellent type of agro as well, as it will increase hate on all mobs you have agro'd - however in the early stages of a fight, it really sucks. (first 30 seconds) - Furious helps HUGE to counter this, but it still is quite a problem. I've had a chanter put a rune3 on me to start a fight so I can lead in with rune and 1 proc will give me agro instead of two.<br />
<br />
That, in my opinion, is why the blade of war will always beat a sews. You usually need 2 rune procs to generate the solid lockdown agro - 1 proc from a bow gives you an immediate edge. I only have an A2 BBB, mostly because i'm too lazy to get A3, and RZ won't drop my BoW. <br />
<br />
Dual wield is an excellent stat booster, it looks good, and is nice. However, I only use 1handers when I don't trust my healer.  Plus, rune procs can save your ass :p<br />
<br />
In short... if I had a BoW and a SEWS, i'd likely use the bow early on and switch to the sews for a long fight. However I still have a bit of roleplaying left in me, so blade of war you'd better drop! :p</div></div><hr />

The damage output of some of the EP mobs is unreal and can tear you up if ripostling(which seem to do a good deal that I can see), unless you like looting your gear a good amount I highly recommend 2h top end wepon.

1handers were h8giver and boc for fights I needed agro on me at all times, ie rallos.<br />
