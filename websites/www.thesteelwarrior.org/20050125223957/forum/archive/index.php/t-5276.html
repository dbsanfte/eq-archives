i got a few questions about where what to upgrade and maybe which augments to buy now and what to aim for and dont waste endless apts on?<br />
maybe some &quot;uniq&quot; way to go i.e. all up to AC gear etc would help also, guild i'm in is currently 1-2month max away of beeing in Elementals currently just pharming any tier 3's in pop and most old world stuff including VT.<br />

<br />
lots of things in Ele's (like poair avatars) will be &quot;range attack only&quot;. <br />
<br />
otherwise you gtg for tanking elementals</div></div><hr />

Just yell out a good &quot;Yoink!&quot; and take it all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leafstorm</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aimras, are you serious? I don't see any item on you that would require an upgrade. And with 530 AA points you've spent enough time on Norrath to know that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't bother buying any augments at all. While your gear is superb for pre-elem, there are tons of upgrades that should be available to you as soon as you beat RZ, which would of course make any augs a waste. You are probably better off augmenting elem gear when you get it, just save up APs for now.<br />
<br />
Incidently, with a 7k tank at the helm, why is it going to take you so long to get elem flagged? RZ is not that bad, particularly with a beefy tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aimras</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, <br />
1st off using dkp wont allow a &quot;yoink&quot; of gearing up, so i gotta play and earn dkp to buy gear lol.<br />
<br />
2nd, i'm not sure if we really will be fast in eps (below 2month), still lacking few core classes to be of high dps. we just did bertoxx last night the 2nd time and had again 30mins+ spare at his spawn, with an let's say Avg crew.<br />
<br />
3rd, my concern about this gear upgrades was serious, i heard many stories about plate EP molds beein the rare totaly and with seeing my clerics whoring their dkp like mad toys, i know i will have to spent a truckload on molds when they pop.<br />
<br />
well, now where i read this i guess i will start collecting AP's, just came to the level i can do the hards very easy with a few guildys and getting 100 pts is wayyy better rvr then 50pts, :)<br />
<br />
thanks for the advices guys!</div></div><hr />

Here's our count, taken from our main public webpage<br />
<br />
Leather: 45 peices<br />
Silk: 40 peices (no silk legs yet)<br />
Chain: 29 peices<br />
Plate: 73 peices<br />
<br />
<br />
If the other tanks in your guild compare to you, trust me... your fine. Don't even worry about upgrades. Your first loots will go for huge amounts of dkp. Let your clerics get armor. Patience &gt; all. You'll be able to get ele plates way cheaper, just a month later. With the current gear you got, you'll have no problem at all.<br />
<br />
Named dropping ele plate melle for 2k, some have 1500DD, some 500/tick dot, some proc 3kDD. That's what ya gotta deal with. If you have the raid force to get to the ele's, you'll definitly have the raid force to farm ele gear.</div></div><hr />
