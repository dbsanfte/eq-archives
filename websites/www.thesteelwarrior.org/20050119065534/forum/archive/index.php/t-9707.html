<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently weild a SEWS + A3, and am pretty satisfied with its agro and performance.  But with some of the new OoW one-handers out now, I'm wondering if I might be better off with a BoC + A3 plus a new offhand for better overall stats.  I'm pretty sure that a BoC + A3 would already be more agro than the current SEWS + A3 is, so if I add to that another weapon with some stats to go along with BoC's stats, I think I could achieve a better result.  I would miss weilding a rarer type weapon though =/  Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Also, the raiding guild I was in when I got the SEWS fell apart, and I'm back in my family-oriented casual guild again, so I'm pretty much limited to one-groupable or buyable OoW weapons.</div></div><hr />

would be good picks. Both are attuneable, and one groupable so you have the option of farming them or buying them. The MPG one I'm not really sure where exactly Sentinel Siof spawns...but generally speaking your gear should be able to handle it with a good group (though lightning warriors and elites will most likely give you trouble, just like they do with most tanks)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really depends on your offensive aa's though.  If you have max pre ooW flurry and max triple attack, they say SEWS is very close to a BoW for raw aggro, and a BoW is much nicer than a BoC + anything other than a BF.<br />
<br />
Opting for a SEWS means trading off some proc aggro for superior dps aggro.  DPS aggro is with you all the time .. rain or shine ... luck or not.  I'd honestly go with the SEWS, but a BoC + any weapon offhand with an aggro proc + another anger3 will more than suffice for aggro.<br />
<br />
In my opinion BoC is a far lesser weapon, so reverting back to it unless you have something on par with the epic 1.5 to go with it is just plain silly.</div></div><hr />
