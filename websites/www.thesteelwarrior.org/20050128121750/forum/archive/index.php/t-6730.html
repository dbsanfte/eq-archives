No GoD flags, but I have farmed the sewers with friends, getting me 2 upgrades thus far. Unfortunately only my main has GoD and LDoN, rest are up to LoY. About 10K in the bank and about 100K in gear that just isn't moving in the bazaar...damned economy IRL and in game. I would just purchase the plat to buy whatever I needed if things were better off around here...<br />
<br />
I have a 58 cleric and a 56 enchanter to aid in the farming of items to resell, or to actually hunt with for gear. I'm rather competent in 3boxing them...PoS/PoV level mobs, but has to be MOB's I can deal with singley. The chanter cannot mez the same level of MOB's I can tank yet, but he can usually slow/cripple anything up to about 62 with his self buff and tash.<br />
<br />
What, if any, advice can peeps give to upgrade the fierce pieces and get something better on the other upgradeable slots? I do have a Dain's Head in my bank, but I am having extreme problems getting non-KoS to the storm giants to do the turn in. Max Ally to the frost side of Kael. Advice on that would be great too...150 coldain heads and 400 or so MOB's in Skyshrine haven't budged it. I may just switch back to Thurg since I have about 10 pieces of MQable armor and few for myself if I had too...<br />
<br />
I've got a ton of friends on 24/7 that would probably help me in a pinch if there is something I need, but without EQPrices being updated, I really have no idea even what is out there anymore better than what I have that I would be capable of doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vxed is a great place to farm gear.  Chavoor the Trickster (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14588) is any easy pull and kill, drops both Burnished Antique Greaves (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68582) and Polished Garnet Loop (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68591).  Also in Vxed, but much deeper(middle northern most room) is a misguided beludu creque (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14747) which drops Cloak of the Caverns (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68586), not the best of tank cloaks, but an upgrade for you nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Also a 1group mob in Barindu(spawns in the building in the northern portion of the zone, just to the east of the northernmost creek) drops Blood-Speckled Scaled Boots (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68428).</div></div><hr />
