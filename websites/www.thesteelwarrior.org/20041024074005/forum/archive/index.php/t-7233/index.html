<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The AC camp is tedious, but jboots are very nice, especially if you can't afford a horse or are too low to get Run3.<br />
Some people like the OT gate hammer, though I'm a Tribunal Barb and the faction hassle has never seemed worth it to me.<br />
Oddly, the quests that have paid off most handsomely for me have been other people's quests. The cleric epic is pretty nice for a lot of clerics, and some parts of it, such as the skyfire shards, have mindnumbingly low drop rates. By mindnumbing, I mean you can send hours hunting and not get any of the drops (yep, more than one of them) you need. I've helped a number of clerics with this and every single one of them has come close to having a nervous breakdown. You help a cleric through that, and it's like having free rez and and buffs for life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hah! Brabble, you are so right. <br />
<br />
Another benefit I found to camping shards for the cleric epic was money. It was really one of the first places I went to that I heard that wonderful cha-ching at the end of the night. Spells, Essence of Sunlight, and random vendor crap. Woohoo!<br />
<br />
But in terms of quests:<br />
Add in the Enduring Breath neck item from Katta that you get for 3 Shissar Organs. In Echo Caverns there's a lonely shissar (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7129) who is warrior-soloable. He respawns every 30 minutes and can drop the organs you need for this quest: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1301.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure if this is a considered a quest or not, but doing Emp key in Ssra results in a 80hp ring. Also gives you access to Emperor raids and is ultimately needed for VT key.<br />
<br />
Also, shissar and seru bane quests aren't bad ideas for a war to do seeing as without them you don't have much or a role in Seru or Emp fights (unless you are MT or  offtanking in Emp fight).<br />
<br />
Some nice 100hp quested items come out of ToV: Silver Bracelet of Speed, Pauldrons of the Deep Flame. Also a decent mask i cant rember the name of from same line of quests.<br />
<br />
Belt of Dwarf Slaying and Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying are not bad either.  A lot depends on what sort of stuff you will be killing and what sort of man power you will have workin with you.</div></div><hr />

Paineel molar quest for buílding faction with Heretics. With enough faction, you can start kill the guards in Paineel (level 22+) for xp and plat. Killing the guards doesn't drop faction and you can bank a few steps away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thought of another one:<br />
<br />
Lodizal Shell Shield (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4061)<br />
<br />
This one you could do with a solid group in your high 50's. Four of my buddies and I took out Lodizal last night. The average level of the group was 63. Our druid never had to cast a single heal on us. The only difficult part of this quest (as is the case with so many others) is catching the spawn of the key mob.</div></div><hr />
