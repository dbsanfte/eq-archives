<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cozlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Man, I just got f'n fed up with the bullshit spewing from my peer's mouths, and I had to say something.  My main is a druid, Keltic Draoi, and I have watched a thread turn into a mixture of warrior bashing and hybrid tank salad tossing.  Just couldn't let it go unchecked ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for bringing this to our attention, however, they weren't really bashing warriors (at least not the posts that I read) They were bashing that one idiot warrior who decided that classism (read racism) can go both ways and was trying to put down the druid.<br />
<br />
Stupid moron giving the rest of us a bad name if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of it seemed to be, Druids are good at X, Y, Z and anyone who doesn't understand that is ignorant or an idiot.<br />
<br />
Nothing to see there, move along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're so dang hard to hit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Eh, there were a couple warrior bashes, but the last post on the second page was nice.  Overall though, most people were just bashing the original dumbass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The last time I rounded up a gang for bard bashing, we left them after 5 min. It wasn't even a show: one punch and they were curled up on the ground crying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow, must have been some tough bards.  Most just fall over the second you lift a fist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hitting them isn't nessary just break their beloved flute/mandolin/horn*you get the point*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well you see...<br />
<br />
We had a monk pulling for starters, so he took a good 3 min just splitting the bards, then took one min to pull the bard to camp.  When the bard finally got back to camp he was still aggroed on the monk, so the monk just ran around jumping all over the place screaming &quot;Taunt omfg!&quot; While the bard was chasing him at mock-5 and was forever out of range. <br />
<br />
So finally I kickstun the monk, who promptly FD's from the impact of such a blow. The bard seeing this runs circles around the monk laughing all the time. By this time, I am pissed off, and stand in the path of the oncoming bard.<br />
<br />
The bard does not see me. I make a fist, the bard now sees me. The bard tries to stop, but the laws of physics do not agree until the bard comes to a screeching halt right in front of me, then I punch the bard right in the gut. Luckily for the bard the catgut absorbs a significant portion of my punch ( h8 100 skill h2h &gt;&lt; ) and then falls over into a sobbing mass.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but they make a satisfying crunch when you DO hit them.</div></div><hr />
