I want to know what every day casual warriors think that they need to make their class more playable/enjoyable.<br />
<br />
So, casual warriors, please give some ideas of what you want/need to make your game more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of my issues with the game aren't really centered around the warrior class alone. We don't have EQ gameplay/general correspondent, I'll post a few of those idea/issues here.<br />
<br />
Most of what I wanted to say i've said here. http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=123709&amp;postcount=422<br />
<br />
Major points being these:<br />
<br />
1. Persistant messaging system, think email, bard mail..etc.<br />
<br />
2. Offline traders. Theres no need to have 500 afk traders in the bazaar. Currently this system is biased to those with persistant internet access, such as broadband, or a dedicated dailup connection.<br />
<br />
3. Old world revamps. Taking existing dungeons and expanding them to include b, c, d..etc progression for high and higher levels while maintaining the dungeond theme. Say, zones further inside Befallen or Mistmoore for higher levels all the way to the highest levels in the game. Not LDoN tpye cookie-cutter zones, but true separate zones based on existing themes.<br />
<br />
4. Revamping and expanding old world progressive quests. Think more quenos badges, or higher level versions past the warden symbol quest for the various dieties.<br />
<br />
5. &quot;Epic&quot; progressive armor quests that can be started with your noobie armor all the way to 65 and beyond.<br />
<br />
Like I said, nothing class specific, but its reallt hard to find something wrong with casual warriors that I can thnk of except maybe reevaluating ldon point rewards, note the lack of them in the lower levels and little (not much) too low at 65 normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, everything I can think of is both non-Warrior specific and pretty much unchangeable by this point, sad to say.<br />
<br />
 EDIT: What the hell, never hurts to post.<br />
<br />
 1) As BB mentioned in the other thread, instanced raids available to the non-EP geared small guilds would be a godsend. Especially if they could tailor them to the specifics of the toons that log in. That way a guild like mine (which isn't a progression guild at all) can do these, and get reward loots U-Z of say Luclin quality, and a guild like BB's could do them and get reward loots AA-GG of GoD quality. It would take MUCH of the pressure off of existing content.<br />
<br />
 2) LDoN needs some revamping, but not much. I'd like to see that 'Medium' option, and more points at the sub-65 level. When I played my Bard, it took an excruciating number of advents at 52 to get that 53 Focus song.<br />
<br />
 3) Spawnable epic mobs. They've done this with Ragefire, time to do it with the non-Cleric epics as well. Phinny especially is my teeth-gnasher, seeing as how so many epics depend on it, and drop rates are pretty damn miserable.<br />
<br />
 4) Continued old world revamping. I like CT. I like the upgraded Hate. And, yes, I'm a minority, I like the new PoM, although what I've heard of the old one makes me want them to do another revamp and put the two together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macenion</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. 3rd rung of LDON where there is middle ground between the current normal/hard with appropraite point structure<br />
2, Lockouts of old world zones like ntov sleepers ssra vt etc when u hit sol ro to stop ep+ guilds farming content for stuff that they will only sell or put on an alt<br />
3. 2 or 3 person instanced ldon adventures or quest even just something that gives me a chance at progressing my warrior when LFG is flooded by all the raiders after they are done raiding for the day.<br />
4. Spawnable epic mobs for every class, kill the gouging of epic items. I could have killed severilous 5 times over by now and have the green scale and my epic if he was spawnable instead i either spend 35k buying it or month after month trying to catch him up when i have the guild force online to deal with him.<br />
5. Revamp oldworld zones yes, but cater for everyone not just EP flagged raiders. I will not see the inside of the new VP at my current rate for at least another 4 years due to the fact SOE made the quest for the old/new key revolve around a raid style dragon. Even if i got my entire guild online and everyone available to attempt this dragon we would fail, over and over again. Is all well and good to Update old content, but when u do it and lock 90% of ya player base outa it makes me think even more the casual/raider gap just got bigger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of locking charaters out of zones that they have already managed to access I'd prefer to see a trivial loot code enforced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see...<br />
<br />
First another general concern:<br />
The problem with being level 65 is that there's &quot;level 65&quot; and &quot;LEVEL 65!!&quot; I'm level 65. Someone such as yourself, Frodlin, is LEVEL 65!! The only way to distinguish a raider from a non-raider is whether or not they are EP flagged, and that line is being blurred with the waves of PUR organizations forming on mosts servers (PUR orgs are WONDERFUL for the casual player, don't get me wrong, I'm extremely glad that Mith Marr has such a well developed one and I wouldn't have Sol Ro access without them). Without the PURs, there would be no way for me to get into Sol Ro, yet I can tank the mobs there with ease, and the mobs in BoT are a bore. It's not fair to only have the one way to progress into Sol Ro because there are people who deserve to advance beyong BoT, but just cannot due to time constraints. <br />
<br />
While I understand the importance of keeping higher end zones exclusive to those who earn the right, it just doesn't seem right that Player_99 can't advance because he has a full-time job and 2 children leaving him with 2 hours to play a night. He shouldn't be able to get there as fast as a powergaming raider, but he should be able to get there eventually, and as it works now, there is just no way for that to happen.<br />
<br />
Erm, I'm having trouble coming up with Warrior-only issues. To be honest, there's really nothing wrong with us from my point of view, it just sucks how huge of a discrepancy there is between a raiding warrior and a casual one, I mean it's like night and day between a 9k+ warrior and a 8.3k warrior like myself. You can't really make AAs easier to get for &quot;casual people&quot; and you can't make gear drop only for &quot;casual people&quot; but it would be nice to somehow block people with X amount of AAs or HP or /played time or something from a certain zone via some kind of trivial loot system to allow for mobs that drop loot that is somewhere between 760pt EF LDoN armor and Ornate/1492pt NRo armor in a certain zone that only people flagged for BoT but not flagged for EP can access.<br />
<br />
I know I have a lot more to say on this subject, but I'm drawing blanks atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutonius</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My issues are also mostly non Warrior specific. :(<br />
<br />
- I'm in a family guild that raids twice a week, not mandatory.  While we are trying to progress in PoP(we just beat TT on our first try couple weeks ago, yay hehe) it's very hard to find mobs up on the designated nights that we raid.  Instanced raid zones/mobs would be wonderful for guilds like ours, I know many people that have this problem.<br />
<br />
- This next issue goes pretty much hand in hand with the first one.  Rotations in my opinion are a big problem.  For guilds like mine that can only get a raid force going on set days of the week, mobs that are on rotation are completely unavailable to us, Ssra raid mobs for example.  I know rotations themselves are run by players but some sort of instancing of these mobs or more frequent spawn rates, perhaps even a random spawn time, would solve this problem.<br />
<br />
- I'd also like to see more raid mobs that don't require flags or keys to get to that would be good targets for low end PoP guilds.  Guardian of the Seal in the Hole, Inny in Nadox, and Korucust in Chardok B would be good examples of the type of mobs I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
- My final issue is with the LDoN armors.  I personally think that there should be different sets of armor for each class.  As it is now the top plate BP provides less HP for warriors than Ornate BP, this is not the case for the other classes.  Another higher tier of LDoN armor would also be nice.<br />
<br />
Other than what I've said I also agree with the other posts made here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More to say!<br />
<br />
First off, it's annoying how the price of our Ornate plate armor is so hugely inflated because its also wearable by Clerics. There's no reason why the boots should be 100k and the bracers 45k, but they are, because they have good effects for Clerics. If Clerics could get their own set of Ornate, or if it was divided in a more intelligent way (ie between Tanks(war,pal,shd), Priests(clr,dru,shm), Pure Casters(nec,wiz,mag,enc), and Melee(rog,brd,mnk,bst,ber) the prices would be a lot more fair, I think.<br />
<br />
Second, Brutonius mentioned instancing lower-end PoP content to give guilds with rare or unpredicatable raidability more access to named mobs. While a nice idea in theory, I disagree with this because it trivializes the content. Not only can the casual guild now get the mob whenever they need it, but so can the hardcore raid guild who can now farm the crap out of the mob without the previous spawntime burden. Instanced content, especially when good loot is involved, only has its place in the highest end of the game to avoid cockblocking. Their still has to be a &quot;spawn time&quot; on the mobs, but it should be by guild or by everyone-in-the-raid-must-not-have-raided-this-mob-in-the-past-72-hours before the instance can be started again. This would give everyone a fair shot, but still keep the amount of items entering the game to a minimum. Also, the loot would need to be no drop or else it would mudflate quickly.<br />
<br />
More to come I'm sure.<br />
<br />

The battle should be with the mob, not other guilds and time contraints. The warrior class in general seems to be ok since the last round of changes.<br />
<br />
edit: On instanced mobs just make sure the drops are no-drop and include some sort of trivial loot code to stop bottom feeding.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How's this idea: Every 10 missions (right?) in LDoN, you get a charm upgrade. If they also tied those 10 missions completed with a flag allowing that character to access a theme-specific optional new zone with a special challenge (harder mobs, better drops, more experience) that was between a normal and a hard mission in difficulty, there would be a progression reason to continue doing LDoNs. <br />
<br />
Ideally, those unlocked missions would have a special goal, or be some sort of bonus level ala Nintendo games. A bonus level could consist of getting 1 point per 3 mobs killed, or 1 point per item collected, or something along those lines. A special goal could be something like killing 2 lieutenants that spawn a boss. The zones could have a shorter or longer timer or no timer at all, depending on the challenge.<br />
<br />
Also, give bonus amount of points, or an AA for each LDoN flag recieved. I'd prefer the bonus points, personally. 2hp/mana on a charm is nothing. <br />
 <br />
Make the content progress in some fashion, like in MMC, after 50 missions your goal is to kill some evil ally of Mayong's. Maybe in Miragul’s, after 50, your goal is to destroy Miragul’s personal laboratory. I'm sure the LDoN lore would supply goals for each theme.<br />
<br />
Plan the upgrades from these LDoN goals to get a character reasonably close to succeeding in an LDoN hard mission, and perhaps make an entire tier 2 of this system with hard missions. Sure, the zones wouldn't change much, but there would be PROGRESSION. Maybe the hard missions could even directly include the major figures in each theme. Mayong, Miragul, some big mean sand elf, some big mean orc, and some big mean frog.<br />

<br />
I like the idea of specializations, like those that casters can get. What about one for defensive skills (including taunt) and one for offensive skills? Parry and dodge do virtually the same thing, and riposte does the same with the bonus of an added attack, while defense seems to affect mitigation. Increased parry/dodge would only be useful over riposte if it added more avoidance than a riposte specialization did, which would bring it back to DPS vs tanking better, this time in favor of parry/dodge over riposte. That would leave defense, riposte and taunt OR defense, parry/dodge and taunt as the most useful defensive specializations. <br />
<br />
For offensive skills, it seems pretty solid. Offense specialization would increase all weapon types equally, so should be weaker than the other specializations in overall DPS gain. Any of the individual weapon types would be more potent, but wouldn't affect the other weapon types so forces a prefered choice. Anyone sure of their weapons would probably go with that type, for example I would choose 2hs because I have my virtually impossible to upgrade without raiding BoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: grammarWe're trying to fix the game though, right? I don't know about you, but I enjoyed EQ a hell of a lot more when I was scared to run through some zones rather than the click-the-book transportation system we have now. I'd much rather see a trivial loot code implemented than a gamewide bossmob instancing &quot;solution.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fitemore, the only problem I see with that is creating a gap between those who LDoN alot and those who don't. Unless there is some way to raid in a member or two into those bonus LDoN zones, I see it being a big problem trying to find people who have X amount of wins in the same theme you're trying to do with 50-win bonus dungeon on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A possibility to help with game progression for those who don't have fixed and large playing time to face a raid mob once/twice a week (as Brutonius Mentionned), but that wouldn't allow hardcore gamer to farm them for loot with ease, would be to make two version of raid mob. the normal one on spawn timer with loot and flags, and another one that would be triggerable but that would give only flags. <br />
this would give the progression ability to casual gamers, but if they don't have the loot they will still have some problems to face the next big mob. so it would trivialise the progression since they would be block by their gears if they don't take the time to farm them on timers mob.<br />
<br />
and to help them to find a place in the rotation, the idee of random spawn time is interesting, or make something I said here. The main idee is to prevent roting loot and alt feeding. doing so a mob with nice loot would not be farmed more than its necessary.<br />
the best would be to keep track of the NoDrop and Lore items looted, not to allowed this given item to apear again on the corpse if all those who can use it have alrady pit it up once before (no rot). and removing the possibility to pick up a NoDrop Item if we can't use it cause of Class/Race/Deity restrictions (no alt feeding).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also feel that warriors are pretty well balanced currently. The biggest problems seem to be between the casual family type guilds and the raiding guilds and the content designed for each. But I know for me and my guild there are a lot of options for raid targets now when we feel like doing something. We generally average around 3 groups and lately we have been hitting a lot of Luclin bosses, escept for Ssraa cause thats still monopolized by a couple of late comming raiding guilds. Also been playing with PoP stuff like Vak the Shade, open tier one and 2 flagging raids, and some GoD stuff.<br />
<br />
   I agree a Medium type of LDoN with appropriate point and named rewards would be a good thing. We can do Hard LDoN's but sticking with just collects and even those we can barely win in the time limit most of the time.<br />
 <br />
   I think the biggest dissapointments I see from the guild these days stems from the fact most see GoD is an expansion for the Ubers and mostly a waste for us, and see OOW as going to be even worse and totally out of reach of the casual players. We dont have a single person in guild with a spell from GoD yet and we are just recently starting to see some loot from the GoD open zones now that things have been tuned down a bit and we are starting to explore over there. Also the fact we could easily do exp in the Elementals but there is no way for us to get flagged to go there. Lately it seems most of the open flagging raids are being sabotaged by a few raiding guilds that dont want the casuals getting Elemental access. Things like training bosses before raid is ready, Hailing PP early and causing it to despawn before anyone can get rezzed or flagged, Ninjaing loot from nameds seems to happen on almost every open raid the last few weeks<br />
<br />
  The only warrior specific thing I could see is maybe a better selection of midlevel aggro weapons. The Droga combo are great but seeing every warrior using the exact same thing sucks. A little variety would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're trying to fix the game though, right?

<br />
Both will work. As long as progression can be tied to skill, rather than raw hours played. <br />
<br />
The game morphed from a 6 person adventure to 4-5 groups, and finally needing an army of your 72 closest friends to accomplish anything. A large portion of the client base hasn't the time, nor desire to play in that atmosphere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder, what percentage of the EQ playerbase is Time flagged or EP flagged? Frodlin, is there any way you could ask? It would be nice to see a breakdown of what % of players are at what level, and what % of 65s are flagged for EPs.<br />
<br />
I'm still against instancing content, but mainly when its done for the purpose of loot. I could maybe see a instancing system where a version of a mob is being instanced that ONLY gave out flags but was the same as the regular version of the mob (that drops loot and flags) except that you could spawn it whenever you wanted. This would allow random-raiding guilds the ability to progress on their on timetables, but their gear won't advance any, and if they progressed to far on these mobs, they would end up in  EP with gear uncapable of surviving BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">None of my concenrs or &quot;problems&quot; with EQ stem from the class itself.<br />
<br />
There is progression for non raiding warriors to reach an &quot;end-game&quot; ac/hp for there needs.  We've seen it, we've read the posts, we may not like the jouney but its possible.<br />
<br />
FOOK LOOT!!!!!!!!!!!  This game used to be about more then getting new armor every other day.  I want to do things with my few circle of friends that when done we can talk about for days or weeks.  When we did the LoY scripts (minus that awful one on the boat) or the CT slime ring or CT walk the gnome.   Even Hedge is a blast first couple times.<br />
<br />
Maybe what it is is that &quot;casuals&quot; burn through content faster, we don't enjoy &quot;farming&quot; scripts.  My friends and I have done Inny and Broodmomma and Torgin events three times and we'll never do them again.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see for myself and my 1-3 groups of friends is instanced LDON raids.   Doable missions with a plot and a backbone.  Something that we can finish or try to finish and talk about for the next couple days at work on the phone.<br />
<br />
There is absolutley no reason for us to do any mob encouters because of fun vs reward.  We don't go kill mobs beacuse they are there.  We go out looking for something fun for a couple hours.  Killing Grieg or a BoT Tower boss for the hundredth bazallion time again is just so overwhelmingly mind numbing.  Maybe this is the difference gap between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;.  They don't mind doing Time again for the gabazzlionth time or back flagging mobs for new recruits again.  /yawn.  If I can do a really neat script/mob/encoutner 2 or 3 times then I know I can do it and there's no reason to go back, loot isn't that much fun vs mind numbing boring evening, fook, i'll go watch a re run on TV before doing that.<br />
<br />
My point being is that my friends and I log in each night, or 3-4 times a week, and we either go do a sewer / ldon / epic twink piece.   We never log on and say &quot;I still need to update this piece of armor, let's go farm &quot;that mob&quot; again&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp, give me something fun to do.  More LoY/CT/hedge scripts.<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />

&quot;casual player&quot; will stop playing EQ if they have to farm loot (so yes , they don't deserve the PoTime loot, neither EP, seeing the drop rate of them). they want to have fun, and they mainly have fun when trying to beat a script, not in trivialising it after 10+ time of success.</div></div><hr />

 Indeed, walking the gnome in CT was hella fun. It's too bad it only gives you one drop plus the occasional spider cap.</div></div><hr />

My wish is also same like others said, its not warrior specific and it is asking for more instanced events for casuals. Now don't make the loot quality like ntov saying its for casuals. It needs to be balanced to what High end players get so while grouping with those people there isn't a God awful difference in power.<br />
<br />
By these events i don't mean requiring a big force, heck even LDoN raids require a big force, something along the lines of 2-3 groups doable and the ability to choose a harder one in case more people decide to logon and need to accomodate them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
here are my problems<br />
<br />
1) I have to be a level of progression above my peers to be able to tank in the same content, this is most provalent in LDoN hard modes where 6500 plus happens to be the standard most healers require (this is my biggest one, if I am as far along as the cleric, why should I not be able to tank for them?)<br />
<br />
2) expantions allow some classes to skip content, a good example is it is great to be a cleric in PoP, not only do you have ornate, but alot of none visible slot upgrades drop for them prior to hitting elementals/sol ro. there needs to be more choices for none visible upgrades for everyone across the board.<br />
<br />
3) Sol Ro needs to be opened up, as a warrior with access it is of little use for me since I can not get a group there as most of the people already there are in the same guild and tend to keep to themselves, if a quest was added for non-progression sol ro access more people could fill out their ornate and get some none visible upgrades such as rings, belts, necks. By non-progressive I mean similer to the alternate flag for tactics, if you wanted to go to time you would still have to kill all the mobs required now.<br />
<br />
4) An in-game raid calander, this way everyone could avoid stepping on eachothers toes a little easyer, or gather people for a PU raid<br />
<br />
5) Up LDoN points, 50 points for 2 hours work in gathering, finishing and splitting means it is 40 hours per unaugmented upgrade, that is a work week, why do I have to spend MORE time in game than I do to earn my paycheck? that is not fun, its strangling like a straight jacket.<br />
<br />
6) ZEM needs to be improved for LDoN it takes me 2 to get an AA ding, that is 4 hours where as it takes me 3 in BoT, if they are going to base the AA costs on Sol Ro xp rate there needs to be more access to it or improve the ZEM of other zones so that we are not forced to overcrowd</div></div><hr />

<br />
i haven't given any of these ideas a few days to simmer, so criticism is welcomed and encouraged:<br />
<br />
-Alternative entry quests to higher planes in the PoP expansion. it might be an idea that could work. especially now that we're a few expansions past PoP being &quot;new&quot; content. that 18 person guild of dedicated players who don't want to run the progression treadmill wouldn't be knocking any big guilds who are gearing up for ele bosses out of the box. thinking quests that would flag a whole group, and would take people who are well-played and well-geared enough to handle the content they're aiming for in order to complete.<br />
<br />
-More unkeyed content!! Look at old expansions, and look at how many zones requied keyes. there were always a few. and there should ALWAYS be zones you can just walk into and have your ass promptly handed to you if you're not strong enough to be there. admittedly there is a higer percentage of people with their levels maxed out today than there were back then. Veksar was pretty cool, and offered several upgrades for non-raiding players. why not stick more zones like that of varying difficulties throughout the old (original, RoK, velious) world? make em challenging and rewarding.<br />
<br />
-higher teirs (past 1450) of LDoN armor, and better weapons? has it's drawbacks and advantages.<br />

Actually it would be easy to insert more granularity than the current 5 level increments.<br />
<br />
Maybe SOE should rethink the system that they base rewards on. Including a time factor in the risk/reward equation to finally acknowledge the huge time sinks that they put in the game. This game has never been simply about risk vs reward, but risk + time vs reward. SOE should acknowledge this fact, and quit acting like its not a factor.</div></div><hr />

Spawnable mobs for those mobs on really long timers. I can't see why this is an issue.They are on a long timer to prevent the loot they drop from being to common and to keep it rare and mysterious like it should be. Don't confuse catering to the casual gamer to changing a fundamental flaw in EQ's design. Like it or not, long, rare spawns are here to stay.<br />
Sony has repeatedly stated that OoW will have only one locked zone.You forgot to mention that you'll need to be at least 65 with 300 AAs to enjoy any of these zones.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you brought up OoW, because the notion of the level cap being increased again scares me. This can cause no good. I mean SERIOUSLY, how many people have ALL of their AAs? Like, 50? There's really no compelling reason to up the level cap at this point considering how many people aren't 65, aren't done with the original AAs, aren't done with PoP AAs, and most definitely aren't done with the GoD AAs. Making the new level cap will only further divide raiders from casual gamers and I really cannot come up with a valid reason for upping it now. If you have a reason why the new level 70 cap is good, please let me hear it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuddar Raddut</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still against instancing content, but mainly when its done for the purpose of loot. I could maybe see a instancing system where a version of a mob is being instanced that ONLY gave out flags but was the same as the regular version of the mob (that drops loot and flags) except that you could spawn it whenever you wanted. This would allow random-raiding guilds the ability to progress on their on timetables, but their gear won't advance any, and if they progressed to far on these mobs, they would end up in EP with gear uncapable of surviving BoT. <br />
<br />
This is exactly what needs to happen. Instanced mobs that give only flags, non-instanced mobs for loot. The problem usually isn't that a guild isn't geared for an encounter, but rather the encounter just isn't available. Speaking as someone who is in a &quot;casual&quot; guild, our biggest constraint is the flag mobs even being available.<br />
<br />
Make that one change, and lots of issues go away for a lot of people. Guilds can progress at a rate they are fully capable of. People can schedule raids for certain days and times. Backflagging becomes less of an issue. This would help casual guilds immensly, and all guilds in general. Mudflation is controlled by not having loot come into the game faster than it is now.<br />
<br />
The second thing I think affects casuals is the gap between the currently accessible casual content and the casual content in GoD. The casual warrior equipped with Bazaar, Luclin, BoT and LDoN items would hit a &quot;ceiling&quot; when it comes moving on to the next level of progression for him/her, GoD zones. I'd think a casual warrior would have a pretty tough time trying to get past Vxed/Tipt. I see a gap there that needs to be bridged. VP looks like a promising way to do so, however I am concerned with requiring a raid encounter in order to gain access, as this is a task the casual gamer who groups for a couple hours a day may not be able to overcome. People who only group and seldom raid have plenty of content open to them, but the content open to them in GoD is very difficult due to their not having access to EP/Time level loot. Now I'm not advocating that LDoN loot have EP/Time level loot, I'm advocating placing content and gear in the game that allows them to close that gap some. Again, VP looks like a promising way to do so, and perhaps if they added a level of gear to LDoN between the current top end LDoN gear and EP level gear, that might be enough to allow them to push into the GoD casual content that would allow them further upgrades.<br />
<br />
Offtopic:<br />
As far as instanced zones for looting, honestly I'd like to see places like VT and Time fully instanced, but when you think about it, it really is not an easy thing to do. If you instance the zone, it has to expire at some point. Zones like VT weren't built with &quot;expirations&quot; in mind. I can kill AHR the first day, and come back and clean up the rest of the zone the next. That's a pretty hard thing to &quot;instance&quot;, since the instance would have to &quot;live&quot; from one day to another. Not saying it couldn't be done, but would require a lot of resources to do. Not sure SOE has enough gerbils to run something like that. What I imagine is that people are going get an &quot;all you can eat&quot; instance of something like 12 hours after which you get booted. The GoD model of instancing would work best I think. Honestly though, I don't see them making any effort to instance current content with the exception of Time.<br />

<br />
I'd like to see another class specific armor set bridging the gap between  Kizraks/Royal Attendant (easily attainable by all) and Raexs (exclusively high-end raider).  The gap between those 2 tiers of armor is monumental and would be fun if there were a set in between that could be obtained in one-two group settings.  No droppable molds either to turn into a farmfest. You actually have to be there killing to get the pieces.  You could even model it similar to the way parchments were done for PoP spells. Required level of 63 or something.<br />
<br />
Another thing that would benefit non-raiders is a LDoN buyable weapon with an inate agro proc that you could throw Anger aug on to get a dual proccing decent agro weap.</div></div><hr />

I'm laughing because that's sarcasm.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what needs to happen. Instanced mobs that give only flags, non-instanced mobs for loot.  Make sure that reads, &quot;Instanced mobs that give only flags, non-instanced mobs for loot and flags.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something I have realized is that the definition between instanced content and triggered content is being blurred. Instanced content is like LDoN, where the ENTIRE zone which includes dozens of mobs and multiple named are ALL created to exist for a short time. When the instance ends, its ALL gone. Instanced also means that multiple forces can do the same content simultaneously. Triggered content is like Ragefire for the Cleric epic, nothing changes about SkyFire except that there's suddenly a new mob it kill. It would be feasible, I think, to add some drops to the loot table in, say, the Plane of Tactics that can be handed in to the gnome at the zin which would cause Vallon Zek (flags only) to spawn, ala Xanamech quest in PoI. This quest wouldn't work if the real VZ was already up. This way casual gamers could get the flags they need on their on timetable because no matter what, the mob they need will be up (unless someone is currently raiding, which should stop a second force from raiding the same mob no matter what).<br />
<br />
And just a quick point of contention, Frostpaw, I would argue that Kizrak's/Royal Attendant's armor is NOT &quot;easily attainable by all&quot; and is in fact the ceiling of a casual warrior. If you're Sol Ro flagged as a casual player, you're doing good. Once you bust into EPs, you're not really that casual anymore, even if you got there through PURs. However, I agree with everything else you said. A 14/20 weapon with Anger 3 and 75hp and a type 4 aug slot for like 3000 points would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming you are only repeating what you've heard, because I can't conceive of why this is true.  SoE, I'll add medium difficulty LDoNs for you.  I have 4 hours free this Thursday.<br />
<br />
<br />
This game has never been simply about risk vs reward, but risk + time vs reward. SOE should acknowledge this fact, and quit acting like its not a factor.<br />
Actually, the game is entirely Time vs Reward now.  I suppose technically, even original EQ had no true Risk, but now there is nothing close to what I would call risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
It takes more skill to beat RZTW with equal numbers at 65 than 70.Likely a lot of stuff that can't be zerged now will be then.<br />
I think the point is that casuals can't field &quot;equal numbers.&quot;  A higher level cap might lead to more zerging of certain mobs, but it can also lead to casuals (using the term loosely) dropping said mobs with fewer numbers than those who did it at 65 needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is exactly what needs to happen. Instanced mobs that give only flags, non-instanced mobs for loot<br />
Flags which then give access to loot dropping zones?  Which you can then use to go back and kill the non-instanced version for loot using gear obtained after said mob in the progression path?<br />

The first EQ had way more risk, sure you now have 4-5 times the hp of a warrior but go deep in to Guk with only level 50's and gear / spells from before Kunark and see what hard is all about.<br />
<br />
No one can even have there corpse root. True risk is almost non exsistant though often risk of failure os real high and loss of time spent on your currernt activity though that is minor as well compared to sitting at the zone in to PoFear as your corpse rots inside.<br />

<br />
Give us some content that is challenging for us to play in every day yet not challenging enough for the pop + guilds to want to be there. I get sick of xping in the same few spots over and over and over. LDON's are extremely easy and boring and when I am bored with them I don't want to trudge off to the same 5-10 xp holes.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cafard</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">casual warriors, please give some ideas of what you want/need to make your game more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
(not wanted nor needed, but ideas to enhance the game)<br />
<br />
<br />
Add some innate advantage for warriors : <br />
Pal have tanking capacity + rez + fast heals + stuns + root + group heals.<br />
Sk have tanking capacity + snare + FD (= pull ability) + lifetaps + group taps<br />
War only have tanking capacity. Make it so that wars will always be superior to SK/Pal in tanking even with worst equipment. Or give warrior some unique advantage not shared with any other class.<br />
<br />
Battle mounts :<br />
Would love to have a mount that will be usefull to me in battle (a War boar like in Drunder for my Troll !!)<br />
<br />
LDoN :<br />
More choice for difficulty levels for LDoN adventures. Choice for various duration for LDoN adventures. Choice for more missions with degressive reward for a given mission. 1 group, 2 groups or 3 groups missions.<br />
Currently, difficulty-levels are &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Hard&quot;. Add more plz.<br />
Currently, duration-level is 90minutes. Add more choice please (with partials rewards for longer missions)<br />
Currently, Size-levels are 1 group or raid-size. Add more options please.<br />
I would like to be able to start a 2 groups, moderate-hard adventure that will take 3 hours (with partial rewards attainable after 1 and 2 hours)<br />
also, I would like to see some new unique missions every week (dreaming ?).<br />
And I think it would be better to replace the points-based system of LDoN by a &quot;Roll a treasure reward&quot;. Think of d&amp;d here : if you complete some easy missions you get a mundane treasure roll (with a small chance of upgrading it to minor). If you complete some really-hard missions (ex : 1 boss + 1 recue + 1 collect) you get a major treasure roll.<br />
(I love the random aspect of treasure generation in d&amp;d).<br />
<br />
<br />
more random features for instanced zones :<br />
This can be Random maps, random connections between dungeon parts (like in Diablo), random encounters/mobs in a room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Encounters instead of single mobs :  <br />
Currently you fight a single mob and when you kill it you gain xp. Replace that single mob with a group of mobs (an encounter, as in d&amp;d) all linked in aggro. You gain xp only when you defeat the whole group of mobs. <br />
For example, I would like a encounter that looks like :<br />
1 Orc high-shaman, consider Even, will move within limited range of its altar and hide behind it if no target is in range. Will debuffs the party and cast dots but he will keep some mana to heals himself or his grunts.<br />
+ 4 orcs grunts, cons light blue. They protect the shaman, and will move farther from the altar. They can be recalled by the shaman.<br />
+ 1 war-dog, cons blue. It attacks the first char to hurt the Shaman and wont change target unless taunted.<br />
+ 4 orcs archers, cons green. They are on some higher ground, behind cover, and wont move.<br />
The orcs are linked in aggro and can't be single pulled. If player retreat too much the orcs will return to the altar and takes cover.<br />
(ok, this will requires alot of changes to EQ and so is the next point)<br />
Also : this kind of encounter can add some usefullness to AoE spell (burn those 4 archers to ashes with your fireball) and will provide work for offtanks ;)<br />
<br />
AI, scripts, Cover, Hide<br />
AI, scripts : implement scripts for encounter that will make mobs seems more intelligents. ex : mobs yelling for help (implemented in DAoC). Archers. spellcaster that manage their spells/mana smartly. Mobs taking advantage of a trap or taking advantage of some cover). Mobs with weakness,immunities, etc. Mobs with special AI scripts : mindless undeads aren't mezzable, they are immune to most DoTs and they attack the closer oppenent unless taunted.<br />
Hide : hide system based on proximity (like in DAoC) is nice. Implement it for mobs also, and have some scouting classes gain in usefullness.<br />
Climb, Jump, rough terrain : implement different movement abilities for differents classes (like the swimming skill, but with differents caps per class).<br />
Cover : implement differents levels of cover between &quot;cannot see your target&quot; and the full line of sight. Make mobs gain advantage of cover to protect themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />

More progressive quests would be good. A very small percentage of the quests in the game are still done; the rest are completely ignored. I'd start with the Langseax-level stuff, too, not just Loyalist Shield-level stuff.<br />
<br />
I'd also work on tradeskill stuff, particularly so that the best player-made tradeskill items do not eventually end up requiring drops from zones casual players effectively can't reach.<br />
<br />
These sound like general rather than class-specific points, but warriors are notoriously poor solo players and currently the fastest way to outfit a warrior is in the bazaar. The best LDoN armor, and, of course, raid armor is generally better than what you can easily buy, but up through Tribunal &amp; RZ armors and droga weapons most of the stuff a warrior can go kill is not especially apt to drop a useful item. I'd far rather kill challenging mobs or do a progressive quest for items I can use than I would buy them in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see a wider variety of &quot;hardness&quot; in instanced zones. For my warrior, hard LDoN on a practical level doesn't exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lochr</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to see two changes made to high risk LDoNs. First, the exp from them is far below what it should be. It's about half an AA per hour. BoT, which is much, much easier, is about a full AA per hour. I'd argue that high risk LDoNs are tougher then any of the EPs for an exp group, and many EP exp groups can get anywhere from 1.3 to 2 AAs per hour.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see high risk LDoNs give at least a full AA/hour (that's about 40 - 45 mobs for most of the groups I've been in).<br />
<br />
Second, I'd like to see the resist rate on pacify lowered in hard LDoNs. Right now, it's got something like a 1 in 5 chance of working, and mobs get aggroed by a pacify failure much more often then anywhere else. The result is enchanters and clerics can't effectively pull a hard LDoN. With a Fading Memories bard, I've won 5 hard LDoNs (5.2K unbuffed, 110 AAs, in a mix of LDoN armor, Kylong, and ornate). With anyone else, failure. It's not a tanking issue, or a cleric mana issue, it's a pulling issue - though I believe in the EC theme a monk or high end necromancer can be successful, there just aren't many monks on my server. <br />
<br />
Given the rarity of bards with Fading Memories willing to do high risk LDoNs, I don't do many hard LDoNs. If the pacify resist rate was lowered, more classes could be successful at pulling, letting me do more hard LDoNs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you beat a slaughter you can get extra credit by killing the rest of the monsters in the zone, for every 5 monsters you get another 5 points.<br />
<br />
If collect, go for a special item of note that drops off a named that spawns near by on winning (or use a smaller force like suggested with the orcs above, put the item on the alter and make it so there is more than 1 way to win, such as a SoS rogue)<br />
<br />
assassinate? go to collect more data in OT<br />
<br />
rescue? have the guy you save give you a potion to cure some of the people that are hurt (bitten people, cursed guktans, and all that people no longer bother with) and bring them out for a bonus<br />
<br />
How about being able to do a medium, or just a longer easy (say 4 hour adventure perhaps) that give a larger reward<br />

still, all LDoN points need to be increased</div></div><hr />

Alternate elemental access through single-groupable difficult quests or trials.  I'm thinking sewer similarity or the Torment, Tactics, BoT, Crypt of Decay, and Halls of Honor quests, scaled up to match rewarding higher-tier content.  Let the difficulty of the EQ content and who can &quot;hack&quot; it there decide what zone players are in, rather than an artificial flag barrier.   However, to make sure only those with the requisite determination achieve the reward.  <br />
<br />
2.  Increase experience % in non-flagged zones.  Content should be difficulty balanced. The trash mobs in the entrance areas to the elemental planes are worth way too much XP for their difficulty. This is a problem throughout PoP really.  As a result, there is a large difference in the number of zones that raiders versus nonraiders can experience in at high levels.  There is also the problem that older content, that didn't have the same exp bonuses, is barely worth visiting at all aside from the &quot;tourist&quot; value.  I anticipate that unless there are POE/POF equivalent experience spots in the new OoW release that are accessibly for non-raiders this problem will increase exponentially with the 70 level cap. <br />
<br />
3.  I like the instancing of flag mobs solely for purposes of acquiring flags (a la Arbitor event or hedge).  We know it can be done - Ikkinz - and with the new technology available I don't see a good reason to stop that.  This would definitely benefit fledgling guilds that are working on something extremely challenging for the guild that requires all of their manpower.  No guild should be able to suppress content just for the sheer joy of keeping other guilds from being able to rise to and meet the challenge. <br />
<br />
4.  The new VP has some fabulous non-raider quests and I think this could signifantly help decrease the mudflation gap between raid and nonraid gear.  It's disappointing and counter-productive, however, that access requires a raid.   I'd suggest more difficult quests without the raid necessity of killing a dragon to access them.</div></div><hr />

A bunch of casual players I know spend signficant portions of their play time on level 40-60 toons (including main characters in that range), and the risk/reward level in some zones for those levels has changed over time: it's not that they've become more risky (in fact, with bazaar gear, it's less risky) but there's frequently almost no reason to hunt old zones--not much in the way of upgrades to loot, not much to quest that results in a usable item.<br />
Need some mobs that folks would like to kill and that they need a warrior for.<br />
<br />
I'd be very surprised if on boards like this one these players weren't very much underrepresented compared to SONY's own customer base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I want to see to start EQ again is that there are challenging zones for me and my casual friends to do that do not have any pre-requisites. To accomplish that what I see being done is reduce the huge gap that currently exists between lvl 65 players that raid and that do not raid! When there can exist two level 65 character one of which is one third the man the other is something is wrong in my eyes. Basically grouping with my lesser equipped friends became like level 50 grouping with level 20 characters. It feels like I am powerleveling and they are totally useless. If you can address that I am sold.<br />
<br />
<br />
How to accomplish this? Well you could design more non-raid content, but that would be mighty stupid since then you have basically two totally different games existing in one and you have to support both as well as listen one side bitch at other. I suggest integrating non-raiders and raiders just like they were before into same content. YAY! That means no more locked out zones except for one or two per expansion. You do that and you are golden! Highly suggest at looking over existing content with a lot of locked zones and giving a thought to unlocking it since no single type of player is happy, because raiders have to back-flag, non-raiders can not enter period or do some painful quests, and people can not hang out with friends!!!! This is an online game and all about player interaction isnt it? Puting in fences to seperate your player base I think is a big no-no</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if I am allowed to post here since I would be listed under raiders, but I would like to suggest having weapon quests that are both rewarding and useful. Here's how:<br />
<br />
Back in Blackburrow, there was this quest to kill Lord Elgnub to save some child. In return you would get Gnoll Slayer Part 1. This quest was great, you had good lore tied in, the named mob's difficulty was on par with the reward, and you can actually use the reward in zone. Even better, later on you could even upgrade it to a more powerful version!<br />
<br />
So what I would suggest is having more quests like the Gnoll Slayer quest: Weapons that are useful for the level and zone they are made in. Here are some examples:<br />
<br />
1. Everfrost/Permafrost: The roaming barbarian and his bear Iceberg have encountered Ice Giants before. Why not allow him to create fire based weapons for use against them?<br />
<br />
2. Unrest: Lots of undead milling about. Have some holy order plan to clear the zone out, and by helping them against some named, make an undead bane weapon.<br />
<br />
Such weapons would help players exp in their favourite zone and once they have outgrown it, they would have a great souvenir to keep as a conversation piece. <br />
<br />
Actually, why bother with balance and all? We could have the weapons extremely powerful against specific mobs, much like how Thelin's Dagger was 9/19 normally, but becomes 16/19 against Terris Thule. Having a say 8/24 weapon become a 12/24 weapon against specific mobs like Ice Giants in Everfrost or Unrest undeads would be a great reward for the time invested and help reduce dependency over bazaar gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stuff I agree with:<br />
-Linked-mob-aggro encounter fight system, ala D&amp;D<br />
That type of thing would be a ton of fun.<br />
-More diffuculty/length choices in LDoN<br />
TWO new categories: Medium and Super Hard. You can't really get much shorter than they already are, but a LDoN that lasted forever and tacked on points forever would be cool. (ie, slaughter mission, kill 65, once that's done you get 1 point for every additional mob killed and all mobs will repop 5 minutes after the mission is complete, and then repop every 30 min after that)<br />
-Overtime rewards in LDoN<br />
Why give 30 more minutes after you win if there's nothing to do in that time? At 65, you really have to try to fail a normal ldon. A system like X points for every extra item collected, mob killed, or secondary rescue/ass NPC would be nice for those times you only have a small amount of time left to play (not enough to do another LDoN, but enough to stick around inside.) It also gives more incentive to utilize the entire zone (as most blaze straight to the named or just clear the frontal area depending on the type of mission) and alot of the content goes unused.<br />
<br />
Stuff I disagree with:<br />
-Higher rewards for normal and hard LDoNs<br />
I think more difficulty/length choices are a better answer here.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is exactly what needs to happen. Instanced mobs that give only flags, non-instanced mobs for lootFlags which then give access to loot dropping zones? Which you can then use to go back and kill the non-instanced version for loot using gear obtained after said mob in the progression path?Good observation, but how is that different from raiders who return to content waaay under their level to farm it for new members? It happens anyway and I don't really see the problem here. You can even work it into the storyline &quot;Billy and his friends discovered another way to get through the entrance to Solusek Ro's Tower and after equipping themselves with the treasures found within, they returned to Tallon and Vallon Zek and defeated them, earning the right to advance beyond Solusek Ro's Tower because they had now proven their worthiness by slaying the gods that guarded it rather than sneaking past their guard.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Alternate elemental access through single-groupable difficult quests or trials. I'm thinking sewer similarity or the Torment, Tactics, BoT, Crypt of Decay, and Halls of Honor quests, scaled up to match rewarding higher-tier content. Let the difficulty of the EQ content and who can &quot;hack&quot; it there decide what zone players are in, rather than an artificial flag barrier. However, to make sure only those with the requisite determination achieve the reward.At first I disagreed with this, because the exclusiveness of EP zones needs to be preserved as an achievement of those who put in a lot of time with a lot of other people to get there, but then I realized that if there were a trial that involved a group killing mobs that were clones of those in the zone they're trying to get access to, including a named-difficulty one, and they can succesfully kill them all, then let them have access to the EP zone. This should be done on a trial-per-zone basis and only exist for Sol Ro Tower, PoE, PoW, PoA, and PoF. A level limit of 65 should also be imposed for those gaining access via this method. I want to say that the EP zones should be restricted to those with SRT access from the real raids and not from the alt access.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Increase experience % in non-flagged zones. Content should be difficulty balanced. The trash mobs in the entrance areas to the elemental planes are worth way too much XP for their difficulty.These mobs give a seemingly unbalanced amount of exp as a reward for the work done to get there, and that's fine in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
I anticipate that unless there are POE/POF equivalent experience spots in the new OoW release that are accessible for non-raiders this problem will increase exponentially with the 70 level cap.I too dread the new level cap raise, I don't know what SoE was thinking with this, but I'm sure it won't cause anything but trouble, UNLESS you have to be Time flagged to level up, that would be cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. The new VP has some fabulous non-raider quests and I think this could signifantly help decrease the mudflation gap between raid and nonraid gear. It's disappointing and counter-productive, however, that access requires a raid. I'd suggest more difficult quests without the raid necessity of killing a dragon to access them.It is kinda of odd how easy the beginning of the quest is in relation to this part. Hopefully SoE will wise up and tune down this encounter to something more like Rydda'Dar-difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Immersion hasn't been important, nor mattered since velious. Don't sit there and be able to say with a strait face Luclin was jebus incarnate in terms of immersion.EverQuest hasn't been immersive since Velious, I agree. I'd like to have some of that back. It'd be nice if EQ was scary, risky, and intriguing again.<br />
<br />
Good ideas, Vilicontus and Cafard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I very much like Vilicontas's general notion about weapon quests, and that they should start early. One of my favorite quests was the Langseax.  I actually got the LoW, which I used for a few levels. <br />
One of the problems with quests in this game is that they have not changed in relationship to the rest of the game, specifically with respect to mudflation. So, cool and well-designed quests are not done because you can get a better reward if you sell two spider silks and buy a weapon in the bazaar. The casual warrior's life would be much more fun if he had some progressive quests whereby he could earn gear that was actually usable.<br />
I'd advocate that these quests should result in no-drop, non-MQable gear: the game is full of cheap dropable gear, and simply designing a quest so that the only people who do it are doing it to twink their alts is a waste of programmer resources. There would be easier ways of inserting twink gear into server economies. The issue here is not just twink gear, but something fun for casual players to do that progresses their characters but doesn't require a raid force to accomplish.<br />
For warriors, I'd like to see some of these quests designed with an eye toward warrior strengths. There are a variety of ways to do this, but for example: if at some point on a progressive quest there is a tradeskill element, make it smithing or fletching rather than tailoring or jewelcraft.<br />
****<br />
<br />
Oh, a comment about the level 70 cap: I think that it was driven by the fact that there is such huge variation in power and gear now among the &quot;same&quot; lvl 65 characters. They're making new levels because those levels effectively already exist. <br />
There are mobs now that were originally raid-force mobs but which are now killed by some two-boxers. The issue for casual players is that some of these mobs are still raid mobs for some casual guilds.<br />
The longer the game goes on, the longer some players will be raiding six hours a night while other players are playing 20 hours a week. Gear and power differences among players are apt to increase, not decrease over time. It's critical for casual players that we have places to hunt and fun things to do even as hardcore raiders do.<br />
*****<br />
<br />
As other posters have stated, a greater range in LDoN difficulties would be good. Many casual warriors in particular have a difficult time not only getting a hard LDoN adventure, but not being gimpy once they are there. The same issue exists for small casual guilds who might be able to field an 18-person raid but don't do LDoN raids now.<br />
Some people want to see the points increased for LDoN adventures. I'm not sure I agree with that for all levels of players. But for characters under lvl 40, the points they get for LDoNs really don't help them gear up. I would guess that very few pieces of lower-level adventrue armor are actually bought by players, and the reason is that they don't have enough points to buy it. The experience you get for winning a normal comes far faster than the points for gear upgrades.<br />
Again, that sounds like a general rather than warior-specific suggestion, but warriors are dramatically dependant on gear. For many warriors hitting their 50s, the game gets a bit discouraging: cost of even non uber gear jumps, but not the warrior's ability to farm plat or loot gear. In today's game, a warrior in his 50s needs good haste, droga-level weapons, and at least some armor in the cultural range. Basically, he's got 100K in expenses and he still can't solo a hill giant.<br />
LDoNs don't help this warrior much: I have an untwinked lvl 53 warrior I've been experimenting with and at level 52 he'd done 14 LDoNs, won them all, and had something like 230 adventure points. No anger aug for him!<br />
<br />
Hmmm. More as I think of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Rework or just add to some older zones such as Sebillis, Mistmoore etc. Would like to see the dungeon continue further in.<br />
<br />
2) Most of the casual 65 players top out zone for exp groups is BoT. How about increasing the size of BoT. Add another floor with 4 more wings. This might help with the overcrowding in the high end zones.<br />
<br />
3) A middle ground on LDoN's the normal's hit for 300 hards for 900. Put something in the middle of this.<br />
<br />
4) A exp only type quest for Temple of SolRo similiar to the Tactics quest for exp only. Not asking for EP's. <br />
<br />
5) Personal gripe I have is the nerfing of money camps. The two that come to mind are the bugs in Sebillis and the Ice Giants in Everfrost. Both these used to be very good PP camps and were camped alot. Both of these camps are now completly empty.

<br />
1. I want visible slot options past ornate, that I can attain with 1-2 groups. I'd like them to be class specific, too. Royal attendant could be that much better for warriors in particular if we could back off on the useless stats. I'd like a GoD version of ornate or something, maybe splitting the difference between elemental and ornate, or maybe a bit better.<br />
<br />
2. I want aggro weapon options. And I want them to be attainable with 1 group, and to have decent DPS. For raiders there is a multitude of solid aggro options. For non-raiders, there are about 4, and they top out with a GBoS. I have a GBoS now, and my options are to use a ChoS forever, buy somebody's farmed BoC, or just wield DPS in the offhand. At LEAST making anger 3 type 4 AND type 7 so we can aug a VGLS or VGGS with two EB procs would be a start.<br />
<br />
And don't say non-raiders don't need 4 eb procs. People are used to grouping with raiders in XP groups, you just come off like a gimp when you don't measure up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that there is a kind of bottleneck on weapons for casual warriors. I'd say it starts earlier than CHoS, however. Perhaps I'm missing something, but if you are a level 50 warrior, say, there's a pretty big jump between Veno-goranga club-black blade of tormenting-level of 1-handers and the droga weapons.<br />
Personally, I think any additional weapons dropped into the game that are supposed to help casual players not only have to be one-groupable, but the mobs that drop them have to be protected from very powerful two-box farmers.<br />
In other words, adding dropable weapons that are effectively impossible for most casuals to fight for won't change anything: we can already buy a BoC.<br />
I think SONY has long attempted to prevent rampant flooding of overpowered weapons/gear in the game by putting gear that any given level of character needs on mobs that the character isn't ready to kill yet, often on mobs that are rare, have long respawn times, or simply don't drop the gear very often. In the career of the warrior I play now, I've had I think only five weapons that I've looted/made myself: a cracked staff at level 3 or so, a forged hammer and spear I smithed at level 9 or so, the Langseax of the Wolves that I quested at 18, and a goranga club I looted while doing some gimp dps in an ME group that generously let me tag along when this character was in his 40s.<br />
Even when I got these weapons, I wouldn't have used them if this character were at all twinked (nowadays, even if you weren't twinked you wouldn't use any of the first four if you had access to the bazaar, lol).<br />
Why can't this game be designed so that a casual player can go with a group and have a chance to kill something that drops a useable weapon? EQ would be so much more fun if the weapon upgrade path for warriors didn't involve hundreds of hours of farming spiders in EK, lol.</div></div><hr />

IMO, this is one of the ways they've really failed to take advantage of the possibilities with instanced content.  They've already got most/all of the mechanics in the game to provide class specific progressive quests that give rewards that are usable, attainable, require a suitable level of effort, and are neither farmable by others nor easily made trivial by higher level &quot;helpers&quot;.<br />
<br />
As an example, they could have a quest that required a series of successes in specific LDoN missions, say an MMC assassinate, a Tak collect, a Mir rescue, &amp; etc. with a character's quest progression preserved in the same way as the series of conversations you go through to get your LDoN aug.  Once you'd completed the list of prerequisites you could get the final test mission from the quest NPC, perhaps the equivalent of an LDoN hard for your group.  Specific reward would be determined by the level of the final mission and your character class, possibly with multiple quests available for each class.<br />
<br />
Tuning options:<br />
- if multiple quests are available only one may be active at a time,<br />
- # of prereq missions,<br />
- level range allowed for prereq missions (i.e. L20 missions don't count as prereqs to get the L55 test),<br />
- additional prereq missions or a one step lower reward if you haven't earned a lower level version of the same reward (gotta pay your dues, as it were),<br />
- to minimize outside influences, strip buffs on entry to test missions (not sure about this, might be unfair to melees and to casters lacking self mana regen abilities),<br />
- 24 hour (real-time) delay before you can retry a failed test mission after a failure, OR<br />
- an abbreviated list of &quot;remedial&quot; prereqs to requalify for the test<br />
<br />
Prereqs would count for everybody participating (assuming they were working a quest and the mission completed was on their list of requirements), test missions count only for the group leader who is assigned the test.<br />
<br />
Rewards would have to be designed to be both level appropriate and worthwhile upgrades to easily affordable bazaar gear (i.e. IMO, a L50 Warrior weapon reward should clearly but not spectacularly outclass what you can buy for &lt; 2k).  The prereq list (=paying your dues, aka timesink, let's face it that's the primary currency of EQ and raiders have been dealing with them for a long time) and test difficulty would need to be tuned so that the reward is neither overly quick and easy to attain nor an exercise in boredom and/or futility.<br />
<br />
One of the benefits to putting in a series of quests like this would be to give players reason to do the less popular LDoN missions (and doubtless result in a lot of screaming to fix the pathing issues in some rescues, they could make Paladin prereq lists rescue heavy to give them something besides Defensive to complain about).<br />

Boost points for rescue and assassinate or increase their timer.<br />
<br />
Fix epic 1.0: <br />
Add a 0.0 stun to the one that procs hate and add 41% haste to the other (and mebe drop delay a point or two) - at least make it viable option to the droga set!<br />
Make it scaleble so you at least have some kind of useable weapon at mid levels while you work on it (ala pally epic) instead of just parts taking up bank space.<br />
<br />
Quests:<br />
Add scalable quests for armor and weapons that you can pursue from lvl 1 all the way to 65 that are completeable by or occasionally two grps. Newbie quest armor is great! Redo the crafted armor for lvl 20-ish requiring coresponding newbie piece, then add progressive sets for 35, 50 and 60+ or somesuch! Give us a progressive reward for staying with the game for 65 (soon to be 70) levels!<br />
<br />
Add more instanced zones like LDoNs with faction-based lead in quests (you can even use alot of the existing rooms and mobs). Add &quot;Sewer Epeditions&quot; to each of the main cities. Add &quot;vault raids&quot; or &quot;inner temple raids&quot; against opposing religious factions, etc.  <br />
<br />
Make some kind of &quot;gladatorial challenge&quot; in the various arenas (Qeynos, Freeport, Bazzar). Make it like PoJ trial but have it take place in the arena where outsiders can watch but not are still locked out. <br />

AMEN! 3 of the 4 weapon's I'm wielding now are no-drop, and I actually dropped the mob that killed them, with 1 group. They're WAY more rewarding than the CHoS/SoTB I bought in the bazaar. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my idea for a casual player friendly armor upgrade path.  This is a logical next step based on the LDoN charm augment concept but it scales a lot more.<br />
<br />
My idea is to have LDoN armor with stats scaled depending on the total number of LDoN wins you have.  You would get credit for past adventures and hard adventures would count triple as wins for these items.  Each item would start out with some base stats and upgrade incrimentally.<br />
<br />
These class specific armor pieces could cost something like 3000 adventurre points each to buy initially.  I use LDoN as an example but this could be implemented anywhere really, as long as it was single group, instanced zones.  The numbers I have could be changed too but they are here to show how it would work.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Warrior wearing Improved Warrior LDoN armor would get the following armor upgrades:<br />
<br />
BP     ---&gt; Base 50 HP + 50 AC.  5 HP + 3 AC every 20 wins.  Max 550 HP + 350 AC after 2000 total wins.<br />
<br />
Legs ---&gt; Base 40 HP + 40 AC.  4 HP + 2 AC every 20 wins.  Max 440 HP + 240 AC after 2000 total wins<br />
<br />
Arms, Boots ---&gt; Base 30 HP + 30 AC.  3 HP + 1 AC every 20 wins.  Max 330 HP + 130 AC each after 2000 total wins<br />
<br />
Bracers ---&gt;Base 20 HP + 20 AC.  2 HP + 1 AC every 20 wins.  Max 220 HP + 120 AC each after 2000 total wins.<br />
<br />
The result would be a full set of warrior specific armor that gives 2090 HP and 1090 AC after 2000 LDoN wins.  That is somewhere between 1000 and 4000 hours of total play time on the part of the player and would be a virtually continuous upgrade from pre-velious quality to Post Plane of Time quality.  4000 hours is 167 days straight so it would take a very long time to max out one of these armor pieces but significant progress could be made every 20 missions and the end result would be awesome.  <br />
<br />
The armor could also have base secondary stats (stamina, dex, resists, endurance etc.) and effects that would not neccesarily scale the same way but the secondary stats and effects would be elemental level or so and in line with the 3000 point cost.  Each set could scale in a class specific way (SK and Pal have different stat increases etc. than warrior).<br />
<br />
Flags and quests could be made to count as adventure points also and perhaps by getting flags or doing quests you could max out the armor faster.  This would be in line with the total time needed -- ie. a Grummus raid flag might count as 60 LDoN wins and Fennin Ro might count as 200 LDoN wins since he is harder to get to and kill.<br />
<br />
Winning 400, 800, 1200, 1600, and 2000 adventures could give keys to access bonus single group experience zones which get progressivly better.  Raids and quests would not count towards bonus zone access.<br />
<br />
Additionally, there might be scalable weapons where the DPS, number of augment slots, stats, and agro capacity increases every 20 adventures or so.  Imagine a weapon that starts out as something like a Defiance and ends up like a DBoW.   Scalable agro proc augments would be nice also.<br />
<br />
<br />
In an alternate way, related to how AA works, you could also make weapons and armor that scale with use based on the number of experience giving mobs that you kill while you wear/use it.  Basically, your weapon and armor can level just like you do and take a small fraction of total experience (1% or so per item).  You could have a toggle on your weapon and or armor item that allows each piece to siphon off 0% to 4% of your regular experience in 1% increments.  The end result would be the same but only special items would have this property, perhaps tradeskill made or quested items that everyone has access to the components for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I like this idea. That really attacks gear progression from a new angle. Ofcourse, the specifics would have to be tuned. But more time in, better gear. Rare drops could be used to give special bonuses or effects, but the base gear progresses normally as everyone elses at the same progression level.<br />
<br />
Raiders could have a similar progression that coincides, but raid drops would give more powerful effects/focuses, better looks, and unique bonuses. Raid gear could have a noticable bonus out of raid, but most would only apply during raids when its needed. Raid progression would still have a leg up, but not anything too overpowering in single group or solo content.<br />
<br />
It'll never happen, though its a wondeful idea. I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">An idea just popped in at work. It's aimed at drops and farming in general.<br />
<br />
Let's say a good weapon was designed to be won by a group of certain levels. This mob would ideally be quite a distance in the zone. Now, to avoid mad farming, create some new AI that allows such named mobs to detect when a player which are very powerful is approaching and do some special things that add to the difficulty of obtaining the drops.<br />
<br />
For example, let's say we have a level 30 dungeon. Mob X drops Ninja Sword Zero (haha just playing with names here). It has good stats for level 30s, and as such, it has high desirability. In comes a level 65. Mob X detects this player in the zone (various lore can be made to facilitate such skills), and promptly runs its Farmer AI. In this example, perhaps Mob X can summon mobs that protects him, and he himself would run away to other corners of the zone.<br />
<br />
In summary, should someone wish to make money off a drop, don't deny them. It would not be fair since even higher level players need to make some plat, raider or not. However, make these higher levels EARN the drops, by putting extra challenges that would normally not appear if the target level players hunted them.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just to add, if such an idea was implemented, don't do it to ALL the mobs. Just certain select mobs that have particularly desirable loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see some class specific augments in LDoN or GoD. Maybe lesser focus effects of what's available on current raid level gear, such as a watered-down effect of the Time BP or Qvic guants. Maybe an ac augment that could be placed in more slots than the sro augs, or maybe a hybrid ac/hp augment.<br />
<br />
Longer range on taunt, and no blackout time if the enemy is OOR or whatnot.<br />
<br />
Raise cap on 2hp.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a general idea, I'd like to see augments that can totally transform the piece of gear you place them on. Put these augments on the targets of a hard-level ldon assassination, or maybe as a reward for rescuing those pathetically directionally challenged wayfayers. By transform, I mean make it into a new piece of gear with new, empty augment slots. Perhaps this would require a combination of a few different types of already-placed augments. It's sketchy but I bet this general idea could give birth to a really interesting future system for gear upgrading.</div></div><hr />

Let them go, pull them out of your bag for show and put them back and remember they are kunark weapons.<br />
<br />
The idea of the LDoN armor scaling with wins is craziness, they've already handed us a tremendous chunk of stats via the stone.  It would throw off the balance of raid -&gt; mindless grind reward completely.<br />
<br />
A guild raids time and nets a 220hp + aug breastplate but the lunatic who sits there all day doing LDoN's is going to be rewarded with items that dwarf that of PoTime and GoD?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I have problems with the concept of killing 400000000000 orc's at Orc1 in EC should inevitably net someone with a full set of uber gear.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't see there being much of an issue in regards to gear.  LDoN armor handles the gap quite nicely.  Anger 3 auging any number of weapons turns them into very nice aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
In my opinion upgrades via single group content should coincide with the progression in the game, which is something I think GoD does quite well.  Kodtaz, Ikkinz, etc all have incredible 1 groupable, farmable gear and augments.  <br />
<br />
Now before you say well yea that's ikkinz a group geared in full 1492 point LDoN Aug'd armor would have no trouble whatsoever farming in KodTaz or Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
I personally think the answer here is to put another LDoN level in, so you have Easy. Medium and Hard.   The current HARD level would become MEDIUM and the new HARD level would be even harder and would net rewards of equal value.<br />
<br />
I won't argue that there needs to be adjustments in regards to obtainable gear. armor and weapons.  However the idea that the quality of the loot reward should solely be determined by how much mindless time is wasted grinding in some stupid zone over and over again is crazy.<br />
<br />
The reward should equal the risk.  I'd much rather someone get an incredibly nice item by just winning one instanced dungeon, one that required skill, teamwork and tremendous effort, one that was not basically a guaranteed win upon zoning in then rewarding mindless grinding.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think there should be more done with LDoN raids, the reward for the risk and time involved and the difficulty is just stupid.<br />
<br />
Put in more 1,2,3,4 group instanced content with selectable difficulty levels that determine the quality of the loot rewards within.<br />
<br />
Just don't turn the game into mindless grinding LDoN's for adventure points to replace the high end raid gear that currently exists.  We already have to grind enough to max our stones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
takeing a raid into bot towers to grind out  bp is no differnt then doing it with one group now.<br />
<br />
seriously fighting a non aoe mob very few people are at risk. or if a cleric has time to camp there is no risk.<br />
<br />
there is no rvr anymore it's just x time or x people to kill.<br />
<br />
granted getting 30+ opinions together to do it deserves some greater reward, but not to the extent it has become.<br />
<br />
many of us just want to see something beyond what we have. for many thats god. for others who depend on pick up only we want to do god but are in the &quot;how many hp you got&quot; catagory and only get a group if someone takes pitty or just wants to fill 6th slot.<br />
<br />
otherwise it's more point farming random loseing. with odd chance and a pu raid you allready have the flag from so you can random on the loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would it really be so hard to rework the original zones? Even if it meant building them from scratch using new code and new tricks? Surely something can be done. The mobs can be updated, given better and more appropriate loot. There can be many more progression quests, stuff to help out the mid-levels (20-50) and prepare them for the harder (and far more expensive) upper levels.<br />
<br />
Sony just keeps cranking out new zones with odd-sounding (and presumably &quot;exotic&quot;) names, but they've been neglecting, IMO, the places and stories that made EQ so much fun and so interesting back when it first started. It's just a damned shame, IMO.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but I have problems with the concept of killing 400000000000 orc's at Orc1 in EC should inevitably net someone with a full set of uber gear.Why is one's time spent to get Time flagged more special than one's time spent killing 400000000000 orcs at Orc1 in EC? Sure, it's &quot;easier&quot; to kill all those orcs, but when you're spending THAT much time doing that ONE thing, some kind of reward is justified. Obviously it wouldn't be as easy as level 6 orcs, but I fail to see the harm in letting someone who has amassed a 1000 wins in LDoN win a badass set of armor.<br />
<br />
In my opinion upgrades via single group content should coincide with the progression in the game, which is something I think GoD does quite well.  Kodtaz, Ikkinz, etc all have incredible 1 groupable, farmable gear and augments.  Kod'Taz and Ikkinz are not casual player zones.<br />
<br />
Now before you say well yea that's ikkinz a group geared in full 1492 point LDoN Aug'd armor would have no trouble whatsoever farming in KodTaz or Ikkinz.Too late, I already did. And that's because any person with 21136 points (415 regular wins, 202 hard wins) which gives them all 8 Royal Sand peices with 40hp augs is not a casually playing person.<br />
<br />
I personally think the answer here is to put another LDoN level in, so you have Easy. Medium and Hard.   The current HARD level would become MEDIUM and the new HARD level would be even harder and would net rewards of equal value.To be succesful in Hard 65 LDoNs, a warrior needs to be top-of-the-line casual. If you're curious what that is, think Kizrak with 1 or 2 pieces of 1492 or 760 pt gear, Bloodmetal Ears, Valorium Rings, GSoT/GBoS/CHoS/CHSD, Stonewood, and the like. Mostly expensive bazaar stuff with some Teir 1 named drops. That means that making the current Hard  the medium difficulty and adding an even harder version is a bad idea. What needs to be done is to add a Medium between the current Normal and Hard and add a 4th difficulty that is Super Hard.<br />
<br />
I won't argue that there needs to be adjustments in regards to obtainable gear. armor and weapons.  However the idea that the quality of the loot reward should solely be determined by how much mindless time is wasted grinding in some stupid zone over and over again is crazy.Again, explain how your time raiding is more important than my time in LDoN. I don't care that you're killing something that quads for 3600, I care that we both play for the same amount of time every day and I don't have as much to show for it as far as the quality of my gear goes.<br />
<br />
The reward should equal the risk.  I'd much rather someone get an incredibly nice item by just winning one instanced dungeon, one that required skill, teamwork and tremendous effort, one that was not basically a guaranteed win upon zoning in then rewarding mindless grinding.That's why Orc1 can't be a serious example. However, take winning a ton of LDoNs (which I don't support, but its a valid way to help casual players) which DO require skill and strategy, and you have a great way to help casuals make their time worth as much as a raider's.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think there should be more done with LDoN raids, the reward for the risk and time involved and the difficulty is just stupid.I agree!<br />
<br />

<br />
Just don't turn the game into mindless grinding LDoN's for adventure points to replace the high end raid gear that currently exists.  We already have to grind enough to max our stones.I agree a third time! However, you really need to watch calling LDoN's &quot;mindless grinding&quot; because, for me, that's a treasured means of EXP, loot, and fun.</div></div><hr />

things i dont like ;)<br />

- Try to &quot;balance&quot; the non Raiding war by Ldon - i hate Ldon and i will ever hate it and if they put in Raex gear for 1000points i still will hate it- its the most worst Expansion ever. - but thats my personal positon ;)<br />
<br />
- Open Elementals/ Time for non flagged People. This are higher end zones - so you have to work to get flagged for it. Maybe add a 2nd way for 65+ (after OoW) to get the flaggs with ~2 groups<br />
<br />
- offline Traders -this will complete ruin the market<br />

This tells me that most of the casual players see things similarly with some differences in how to implement those ideas. <br />
<br />
My background is a player that has been on EQ since it's first week out. I have raided for a long time and I enjoy both types of play style. About 2 years ago, I got a new job and I work 3pm-11pm and typically only get one weekend day off. Now, I am sure you all see that is prime time raiding and peek hours for EQ.  I even quit a great guild becuase I felt they could use someone that would be there regularly, which lead me to quit EQ for awhile. I returned to the game and love a lot of the changes but as a raider stuck on a casual gaming schedule (I also have to make time for family) I find myself playing before work for 2-4 hours and some off days. I can honestly say that I typically have nothing to do but LDON and some PoP groups. Fortunately, I am EP flagged but because I am not in that circle anymore, I cannot get a group there. I am probably able to do lower GoD but cannot get a group for the same reason. Sadly, I find myself bored with EQ simply because the people that are like me cannot go where I am fortunate enough to go. That to me, clearly illustrates an issue that needs to be looked at. This thread contains lots of great ideas and I hope SONY reads this and actually listens. I have been on both sides of the fence and I can declare without doubt; the grass is greener on the other side.<br />
<br />
A couple other non-game issues I would like to see added are an in game email (like Star Wars has) and a Flag/Key page to the UI. I wish I could go to a screen and see a check box of the flags and keys I have all consolidated for me and it have a list of which I still need to get. Obviously, this would have to omit somethings for questable keys (don't want the list to say kill so-and-so when nobody knew he was even a target). <br />
<br />
OoW talks about a new quest system that will be friendly to casuals. Guess we will get to wait and see but I will be withholding my dollars until I know it is not just a lame lure to get me to buy an expansion built for the ubers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is good because it gets people into old zones, but bad because it hurts the 1 newbie actually trying to level up there, but with smart implementation, the fabled can be placed so that it doesn't interfere with most newbie fighting spots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
e.g. Fabled Zlandicar?  What's he going to be like, Mithaniel Marr maybe?  How's Joe the 59th lvl Warrior going to quest for his Harla Dar haste cloak when Fabled Zlandicar spawns instead of normal Zlandicar?<br />

and if there is a Fabled spot, then there will be two kind of campers at the same spot. the one for the normal version, and the one for the fabled version. The fabled hunters don't care about the normal, right, so they should let them to the normal hunters, and the normal hunters are glad that the fabled hunters are here to take down the fabled version so that they can go on farming the normal version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has the following benefits:<br />
1. Potential raid mob content for lower-middle end guilds with good rewards (like Fabled Mithril BP).<br />
2. No mad queues of level 20s booking a fabled spawn and begging capable players to kill FOR them. This was the case in Stromm, not sure on other servers.<br />
3. Exping people are not bummed when they want to hunt something appropriate for their level (like FBSS for example).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me that the vast majority of Fabled spawns on my server were killed by players for whom the mob was trivial, with the obvious goal of twinking an alt (or alt of a friend). <br />
<br />
In my view, this game is not crying out for new ways to twink.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, my baby 26 SK troll tanked the fable evil eye and it was an interesting and difficult fight for him that resulted in loot he could use and loot that others in his party could use. Adly, it's extremely rare at that level for a character to be able to fight something that drops usable loot, and that's not just true for lvl 26 players, either. If fabled mobs are re-introduced to this game, the loot should be twink-proof. The mobs should spawn in zones or portions of zones which are almost always empty now (and such places are not hard to find), and the mobs should, like Vox and Naggy, banish anyone who exceeds a given level in relation to the mob, or who can't get exp from killing the mob. The mobs should also drop only no-drop gear.<br />
<br />
Fabled mobs in any other form would really just be crowded exercises in twinkage. While to some extent twinkage helps the casual player, what would really help a lot more would be tough mobs that drop loot the players can use if they can kill the mob.<br />
<br />
The reason that so many zones in this game are empty is that the mobs, drop rates, and loot tables have not acknowledged changes in the game: the bazaar economy, more powerful dropable gear in newer expansions, mudflation, and so forth. <br />
<br />
For the casual warrior, this is particularly painful, for two reasons: the warrior solos poorly, and the warrior is heavily dependent on gear. There are a number of mobs that drop usable, level appropriate gear for warriors at various points in the warrior's career, but generally the drop rates are so low, and the drop tables are so unlikely to fill the needs of more than one or two classes, that a warrior can scarcely ask with a straight face that his friends form a group to fight its way in to these mobs: &quot;Hey guys, let's go kill this tough mob 10 or 20 times because he might possibly drop a warrior thingy that is almost as good as something I could buy in the bazaar for the same price as I could sell a stack of spiderling silks for. It wouldn't take any more time than doing four LDoNs would!&quot; <br />
<br />
In the case of many more zones, the situation is even worse: a group of players who would gain experience from killing the mob are already better geared than anything the mob drops, unless those players take extraodinary and indeed perverse action to fail to gear themselves up.<br />
<br />
And no, not sure why I'm so grumpy today.</div></div><hr />

Everquest has always been designed around RvR, that's Risk Vs Reward.<br />
<br />
What you and others are talking about is, TvR, Time Vs Reward.<br />
<br />
And I simply do not support that system, it turns EQ into a hack and slash game rather than an online adventure game, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
My time does not mean more than your time, not in the slightest but we are both choosing what to do with our own time and it's those personal choices that are going to dictate the type of EQ experience one has.<br />
<br />
SoE definately needs to do things to accomodate the casual guild, player and so on but the upgrades should be coming through risks, killing a difficulty mob, looting an item equal to the difficulty of the encounter.<br />
<br />
If you said to me what is the difference between me doing something in 1 group that is as difficult as a raid and netting equal loot rewards, I would say nothing is.<br />
<br />
The original post was suggesting that new gear should be scalable to up to 550hp on items due to the grinding of adventures.<br />
<br />
How one can justify gear with double+ the hit points of elemental raid gear from doing LDoN's over and over makes no sense.<br />
<br />
You made a comment:<br />
<br />
&quot;but I fail to see the harm in letting someone who has amassed a 1000 wins in LDoN win a badass set of armor.&quot;<br />
<br />
And your totally right, however LDoN is already doing that, right click the merchant and scroll down to the 1492 set of armor.<br />
<br />
If your telling me they should net an item that dwarfs the highest end game raiding items through this method then I will strongly disagree.<br />

I think Vikken's comment concerning you posting your objections was driven by the parameters set forth in the first post in this thread, in which Frodlin, as class rep, asked for casuals to post their ideas, and for &quot;raiders&quot; to refrain *in this thread* from debating the merits of those suggestions.<br />
No one's suggestion you can post objections to ideas, but that's not the purpose of this thread.<br />
And, it's not like developers are going to auto-accept ideas that will break the game, or that Frodlin himself will pass all ideas along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noctix</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a &quot;casual player&quot; (I play 5 nights a week, 2-3 hours per night, and never raid), I love LDoN.  I've been playing EQ since 1999 and I have quit several times because I would get to the point where all I could do was grind exp in boring outdoor zones or farm pp for upgrades because I couldn't kill anything that provided me with upgrades.  LDoN gives me something productive to do every single night.  I can earn my own gear fighting challanging content.  I can complete an adventure in my normal playtime, something that meshes well with my RL schedule.  Instanced content allows me to find hunting places and named mobs without competing with some uber necro who is perma-camping everything I could possibly kill for an upgrade.  And, most importantly, instanced, timed adventures are FAR more fun than grinding outdoor mobs in DL or BoT or whatever.<br />
<br />
I am nearing the end of what LDoN can do for me (I'm currently farming 65 hards for gear and points).  My current plan is to move on to single group GoD content.  Since it's instanced and geared to single groups, I'm hoping that it will be as good a fit for me as LDoN, although I haven't tried it yet so I don't know how it will turn out.<br />
<br />
All I really want from SOE as far as &quot;casual content&quot; is a continuation of what they started with LDoN (and possibly GoD).  More instanced single group progression.  The new content should be harder and give better gear than LDoN or single group GoD.  It should also be instanced and I should be able to get to the nameds (or whatever the goal is) in a &quot;casual&quot; amount of playtime (2-3 hours).<br />
<br />
I could care less what gear raiders are getting, I just want to be able to fight new, interesting content and get gear that is an upgrade to what I currently have.  This means both better ac/hp/stats and also better focus effects.  I would like to see more single groupable gear with regen, vengeance, cleave, shielding, caster focus effects, etc.  Maybe not as good as raider gear but definately better than what I can get in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Finally, I would like to see upgrades for a wider variety of slots.  Looking through the LDoN hard and GoD loot tables, there seems to be a ton of masks, earrings, rings, etc.  However, there are almost zero visible slot upgrades beyond Tak armor (the Jhiru bracers being the exception).  Additionally, there aren't enough weapons available from single group content and the charm options are even worse.  I think charm variety is a problem for everyone but the PoP charm is pretty easy for raiders to do; casuals are left with half-stats on their PoP charm even if they can manage to grind out the 5 or so single groupable alternative flagging quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crathsor Gnawbones</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Triggered content would be a godsend for the casual players.  Currently I'm the raid leader for my guild.  We are a casual playing guild that raids Friday and Saturday nite.  It gets very frustrating when you want to kill mob01, and find out a higher Tier guild is farming him.  I applaud those who have progress onwards to Plane of Time for the effort put into it.  The most my guild can hope to achieve is Sol Ro Tower flagged, and that's a pretty huge jump for us.<br />
<br />
We live in a day and age where if you are not a raiding guild...people are not interested in joining.  Its all about the race to Plane of Time.  People only have 2-3 hours to play sometimes during the workweek.  So they have to spend that time LFG in PoK until their time runs out?<br />
<br />
Its rather funny if you look at these 2 expansions -<br />
<br />
LDoN and GoD.  Uber raiding guilds think LDoN was a worthless expansion, wheras the casual gamer says its a blessing.  The same goes vice versa.  So here we are approacing another expansion OoW.  So if we are not a raiding guild...is there any sense to get this expansion, for the casual player?  I've seen that a lot of the suggestions came about into fine tuning the expansion, and it was shelved for a temporary amount of time.<br />
<br />
Now the pop-up's begin, Pre-Order OoW and we'll have a dancing gnome on your screen..blah, blah, blah.  So now we have to grind out five more levels...probably insane amount's of more AA's to deal with.<br />
<br />
My thoughts, so I can make this a bit more constructive before its moved to another thread is the triggered content.  For those casual players that have to trigger mobs, make the loot No Drop.<br />
<br />
This may prevent persay Uber Guild 03 farming Avatar of War, so their enchanter loots the BoC and sells it for 500k in the bazaar.  Nothing more to frustrate ya when you see a Lvl 32 twink standing in OT killing yardtrash with a BoC, cuz their guild has the mob locked down so no one else can have it.<br />
<br />
Maybe expanding LDoN's as it was posted earlier.  After so many wins you go into a bonus area.  Secret passage opens up to reveal Miragul's Laboratory, maybe can do something with all this faction we seem to get in killing mobs in LDoN's.   Random thought as well on this, what is the sense in doing an Assassin mission (65 Norm) if the end guy has nothing on him?<br />
<br />
I'll end my thoughts here, cuz I'll probably start rambling.<br />
<br />
Oh, on a last note.  Glad I'm not the only troll that thought of having a war boar from Tactics as as battle mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
During my guild's climb to elementals, I have noticed that some PoP zones have two versions, Type A and Type B. Some examples include HoHb and PoNb. Type B zones are typically locked, and their keys are sometimes impossible to achieve unless you are of a raider background.<br />
<br />

There isn't any opportunity for intermediate guilds to pass the BoCs between their own players if/when one upgrades their BoC if it becomes no-drop. In your proposed change, the supply of BoCs to the casual guilds and their Warriors who want one is likely to get even more out of whack. Moreover, Warriors in small guilds that can't kill AoW won't be able to buy one or raid for one.<br />
<br />
AoW is not a highly contested kill anymore, bottom-feeding on him happens from higher end players mostly just for fun and the chance to profit some. If a casual guild is AoW capable and dilligently watches the Statue spawn, nothing is stopping them from farming their own BoC drops...a loosely organized bottom feeding run at AoW is fairly slow to mobilize compared to a guild that is focused on farming that spawn.</div></div><hr />

I've often suggested that the game would be improved for casual warriors if there were mobs in place that casual warriors could kill for useable loot; I've also suggested that a fair portion of this should be protected against bottom feeders.<br />
However, making AoW's loot no-drop would, I think, actually decrease the availability of weapons for casual players. <br />
And, even though some aspects of bottom feeding bother me, it's also obvious that many higher-level warriors still need sources of income.<br />
<br />
Right now in the game there is almost no stage in a warrior's career pre-65 when he can actually loot a weapon that will make him &quot;decently&quot; geared. Even at 65 a non-raider's options for looting better-than-droga weapons are not exceptionally numerous. Casual warriors don't need to be able to loot uber weapons, but something should be out there that is questable/lootable that doesn't make him noticably gimped at each stage of the game.<br />
<br />
There are ways to do this: progressive quests, instanced content, no-drop rewards, and so forth. No doubt there are benefits and drawbacks to each, but in whatever outward form the path to the weapon takes, the ideal characteristics of that path would be that the content would be challenging yet possible for casual warriors in, say, a group or two (at any rate, not require a raid). The insertion of an aggro weapon or six for X number of LDoN points, for example, would be okay, but I'd much prefer a challenging mob in a zone as well-designed as Veksar to the idea of doing 53 easy LDoNs. It's not that easy LDoNs aren't handy, it's just that I'd much rather face more risk for my reward.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if you couldn't design a mix and match system for LDoNs. Suppose, for example, that you could select not just a normal (or even better a hard or medium or normal) collect, but doing so would also produce one of a set of challenging named mobs whose spawn would be triggered by the successful completion of the &quot;collect&quot; portion of the adventure. The triggered named would of course be harder than the &quot;level&quot; of the LDoN (perhaps significantly harder) and harder than the &quot;named&quot; that are often in the LDON mix. The triggered named, and its possible no-drop loot, would be designed around one of the classes in that specific LDoN. So, if the warrior-specific triggered named spawned, then it might drop a level-appropriate aggro weapon; if the cleric-specific mob spawned, it might drop a nice cleric thingy. The group would have the rest of the mission time to find and kill the triggered named, or they could pass on it.<br />
Okay, hmmm. I just thought of this so perhaps there are some obvious holes in it.</div></div><hr />

That's actually pretty good.   I would definitely support that idea.  Having a group-style zone, while also having a raid-style that requires access somehow (maybe require being in a raid or something, I dunno) that connects and is related (lore and style) to the group version.  It's a good plan, the only problem is actually getting the developers to make something like that, and give enough consideration to both play styles instead of just one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, explain how your time raiding is more important than my time in LDoN. I don't care that you're killing something that quads for 3600, I care that we both play for the same amount of time every day and I don't have as much to show for it as far as the quality of my gear goes. <br />
<br />
My friend Joe works at the local BP servo, he makes $8 an hour.  E Neville Isdell is the CEO of Coca-Cola, and makes probably a few million a year at least. Why is this so?! Theyre both in the same &quot;game&quot;, they both sell Coke to people for a living?<br />
<br />
The fact is that doing something that is complex, difficult, tiresome and strategically/logistically demanding is going to be more rewarding then something that is easy and mundane. This concept remains true in nearly all aspects of life. <br />
<br />
Keeping a guild going in EQ today requires constant sacrifices not only in time spent but in frustrations, both with the game and your fellow guildmates. You put up with your fellow guildmates being stupid, saying stupid things, making mistakes that cost 50 people hours of their life. You put up with people you cant stand, people whos values and outlook vary greatly from your own. Even as a common &quot;pleb&quot; you make sacrifices every day for the guild, because you wish to succeed and advance. People often have to set their RL commitments up around the time needed to help the guild advance, people sacrifice other activities in order to go the extra yard demanded. You put up with FAR more buggy content and outright broken crap. You often dont even know that something is buggy/broken or is working as intended unless it happens to crash the zone or depop the event. Learning events (espescially broken ones in the middle of being tuned) can waste thousands of manhours with no reward other then a pile of corpses.<br />
<br />
The leadership of a guild has to face so much more. I wont go into the amount of blood, sweat and tears you pour into a topend raiding guild as an officer because its truly mind numbing. If a person were responsible for keeping a workforce of 70+ people happy, cohesive and productive 7 days a week for 5 years then theyd probably be earning a hefty paypacket. <br />
<br />
If you are simply grinding out LDON mission after LDON mission you are blessed with a wonderful thing, choice. You can choose who you group with, if someone is an asshole it costs you nothing to leave the group. If you want to go watch a movie, you arent leaving 40-50 people waiting. You dont need to worry about the wellbeing of anyone but yourself if you dont want to, and the only logistics you need puzzle out is for your own personal benefit.<br />
<br />
You may not care at all about the difference between spending 200 hours dozing through LDON as opposed to spending 200 hours learning every nuance of Uqua, step by painful step. Thankfully the designers of EQ and every other game out there do.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to start this out by saying that if you're a raider and disagree with some things being asked, please refrain from commenting, this is NOT a debate thread, this is an inquiry thread.<br />
This isn't just directed at Zotha, he's just the most recent poster to violate Frodlin's request.  There are TONS of other threads for casuals and raiders to whine about their views toward one another.  Try not to do it here.</div></div><hr />

Not really the system but the numbers needed to aquire access. I really felt they should have made them more like trials and used raid forces of 20-30 so that you did not have to be in such a large guild to get access. It puts you in bind when you have friends in larger guilds but you like your small/casual guild, no one ever seems to have access to the same places so you end up setteling for a lesser zone or you find new friends. LDON is great until about the millionth time you've done them and there is only so much BoT type places a person can take. I took the path of least resistance and bailed to find more in RL. If not the flagged zones they should really look at revamping some of the old areas to give as good of exp. as some of the elemental planes with some of the locked up trade skill items and minor loot also thrown in. With more people being in the upper levels now it just seems like the zones have not kept up.</div></div><hr />

Most groups can do LDoN normals quite easily but switch to a hard and the regular pickup groups fail a lot.  Go from getting hit for 350's to 900's is a lot different.  <br />
<br />
I would like to also see LDoN normal medium and hard raids.  <br />
<br />
I dont have a problem with droppable loot, but I do have a problem when X guild is PoTime/GoD level comes in and walks right past our luclin era guild and kills the target we are after when we did all the clearing of mobs and worked our way to the boss.  It happens a lot, especially when X guild's newest member needs a new item.  Make it to where Mobs as spawned such as a turn in of components.<br />
<br />
If you remember back in the old days EQ was designed for 2000 players per server max.  they exceeded that number so they took off the number of people signed in to that server display on server select screen.  I am sure we now have more than 5000-7000 players but mobs still spawn the same rate as before when there were much fewer people.<br />
<br />
I am EP flagged but most of my guild buddies are not.  Its hard to dedicate 4-6 hours per raid when you have a full time job, 2-3 children and a life besides EQ.  I recently read a guild application where if you couldnt spend 6+ hours a night 5 nights a week on raids you were not addmited in to the guild.  I laughed and thought to myself the only people who can spend 6+ hours a night or more on EQ are un-employeed welfare recipients or school age kids.  Give me a break, my marrirage would end if I spent 50+ hours a week on EQ 40-50 hours a week working and 50 hours a week sleeping.  I am lucky though that my wife plays EQ so I get to spend more time online than I would if she didnt.</div></div><hr />

Would casual players support such an idea?<br />
<br />
Calling some zones &quot;A&quot; and some &quot;B&quot; disguises a major problem with it. It would mean at least one half of the game is off limits and proably more since the last few zones are not likely to have A and B zones.<br />
<br />
In GoD there are 10 zones that casuals can reach out of 20 total and 12 if you count Tipt and Vexd and if they can get through Vexd and Tipt (hard but doable)then there are 15 zones out of 20 that they can get to, and that is percived to not be enough.<br />
<br />
An intersting idea is to have an LDoN that would totaly repop all rooms but the one the last mob is in after said named mob is killed. The mobs would get progressively harder as well as the loot and the points.<br />
<br />
As a side note it would be nice if the augs that drop would give some points even if it is a small amount like 5-10 points makes them worth something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh... it's fairly simple as far as what casual tanks in general need.  They need a game with less gear dependency!  We as tanks are by far the most gear dependent classes in EQ.  As a pre elemental warrior, before I could tank ldon hards I routinely watched casters and dps meleers in my guild with far fewer AA and far worse gear than me do ldon hards.  Now I can tank ldon hards, but instead I get to watch casters and dps meleers get mountain trials groups (which I can only group with guildies on and then we have to follow a charmed pet through, totally gimping the purpose of my class for most of the trial... I sit in the back and jump in when Pooka gets low).  Then I get to watch them get Kod'Taz groups.  I'm even Kod'Taz flagged now, but it's not like I can run in there and get a pickup group.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because as a warrior I'm totally gear dependent and without the AC levels in particular (plus hit points of course) of elemental+ gear, I can't tank well enough.  Casters have far less need for the gear and the AA.  It's nice to have, but often not required.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't see this ever changing in EQ.  So I guess I'm just ranting. :p</div></div><hr />

Any tank worth a hill of beans is gonna have scratched out every bit of AC/HP he can from the bazaar because he needs 'em to do his job, but casters/bards/dps melees easily get into their late 50s wearing crap that a L30 tank wouldn't even take the time to spit on, and then of course they claim to &quot;need&quot; any dropped loot.</div></div><hr />

Hey, that's fun stuff. :p  I've been trying to farm a couple drops in Vxed and Ferubi groups lately.  Too bad the earring I could use in vxed and the shoulders I could use in Ferubi have both proved very rare and are both useable and good for all meleer classes.  I end up with 3-4 people rolling on them and they're too rare to just go get one for everyone, plus ya don't have the same group there every time.  <br />
<br />
I maxed out on bazaar gear awhile ago and only go for no drop gear now.  It cost me quite a few hundred k plat, of course.</div></div><hr />

Gear dependancy is huge for a WAR.  AA's are disproportionally important. A 25 AA SHM is a lot less powerful than a 50AA SHM. But to be a WAR one needs more like 1 or 2 hundred AA's.  <br />
<br />
My solution (since AAs were the oringinal solution to gear deficiencies) Give WAR's a break on AA xp. Since our AA's must be bought in larger quantities to acheive the same lvl of power, then our AA's should take Less mobs to get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
thats a horrible idea, no offense Macenion, if I paid for velius, i expect to be able to go back and 1 group, god forbid solo, some of the old content if for no other purpose but to have fun and remember. Ssraa, and VT, are still very much gold mines for gearing people up and getting people up to speed, and theres nothing wrong with guilds backtracking. In all honesty If you look at most true high end guilds, they no longer visit these zones as they dont have enough people to benefit from getting on a rotation, or if your server doesnt have a rotation, they just dont want to waste time on old content. Lets not forget until you actually start killing raid mobs in the EP's, the loot along the way is pretty much crap imo. VT is still needed by many guilds during PoP progression, it wouldnt be fair to cut them out.<br />
<br />
having to raid to progress has been a fact of life since what, kunark? in all honesty i dont think its a bad thing, and i think the game has improved a lot with the release of OoW for us casual warriors, with attunable gear, even raid loot, trickling down as ubers dont need it, and with the teir1 armor being easier to get than ornate.<br />
<br />
No, honestly i dont think we have a whole lot to complain about, but if anything could be improved i'd have to agree with your idea of old world revamps. It's cool that VP was revamped but most of us will again, never see it. not because its not a nice spot with upgrades, but because most guilds capable of breaking into VP have moved on to bigger things. The difficulty of breaking into VP should be revised/nerfed/whatever.<br />
<br />
There should also be more old world revamps, if its a ldon zone, for gods sake make the XP worthwhile, im sick to death of turning down ldon invites because quite frankly the XP is crap.<br />
<br />
Listen up devs, you can either open the EP's so everyone can xp at the same rate, or you can give us more places to grind. A lot of people that dont have EP flags are quitting EQ because after 65 there are no good places to xp except in OoW. We dont want to be all hurded into the same few tiny zones and fight over the same camps and nameds. Give us variaty, damnit!</div></div><hr />

...<br />
I'm tired of needing another 100 AA's just to be able to go places others can go with 0 AA's.<br />
<br />
<br />
A partial solution to this problem,  in my opinion, lies in ourselves. Just because a 0AA rog can get away with hanging out in MPG doesn't mean they contribute like they should. We as warriors need to hold other classes accountable for their own gear and aa, instead of being willing to buffer their deficiencies. I'm not sure how to do this without being an ass about it, but the fact is you CAN tank in places people think you shouldn't, they just have to pick up more slack, and they SHOULD, rather than expecting you to invest all the time on gear and AA so they can ride through easily.<br />
<br />
I've had the privilege to group with several of the top characters on the server doing stuff that was seriously out of my league because they needed a tank and were willing to make up for my deficiency. Unfortunately, that attitude isn't prevalent, and most other classes think WE should be hauling THEM along instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes it is a little disturbing to have players of other classes, in far worse gear (by bazaar/ldon value), turn you down as you are not good enough for what they are doing.<br />
<br />
I guess the flipside is that once a tank get good gear, you really do seem to make a huge difference to the group - while some other classes may feel there is less of a progression.</div></div><hr />

The last thing I want is to be funneled into a zone with four million fucking other people!  I refrained from even entering Kod`Taz for, despite being flagged, for TWO MONTHS because I knew it was packed to the brim.  I avoid the KC 2.0's, 3.0's, 4.0's with a fucking passion because, goddamnit, they're just not any fun when you're dodging people's trains, fighting for spawns, and waiting around for shit to spawn because the conglomerate &quot;Red Army&quot; is slaughtering the zone.  Riftseeker's is, and I don't mean this in a derrogatory way, the &quot;elitists&quot; zone.  Shit is just freakin' hard, and while I enjoy being able to zone into RS now, enjoy current content, and expect maybe only 20 people at most, I do feel badly for the poor casual saps (most specifically tanks in general) who won't be able to tank in RS, and experience just how awesome the zone really is, for another 2-3 expansions, because unless you're Time level equivalent geared sporting 10k hp and 2000+ ac, you're just a goddamn speedbump.<br />
<br />
Also, the single target 1 minute mez that goes off every 30 seconds from mobs in the basement of Riftseekers is just goddamn retarded.  Why design a zone that's only going to effectively see 30% utilization?  /sigh<br />
<br />
Getting back on track, I've really enjoyed being able to explore GoD content now that it's pretty much a barren wasteland (but not quite).  Farming single group Ikkinz trials has been a blast for me, but I don't see it being a tangible option for the nonraiding Warrior considering just how freaking hard that stuff hits for.  I have no problem tanking it, sure, but not everyone has a full set of Raex, either.  Zoning into KT and exping with maybe only one other group is simply just wonderful.  Hell, I even went to Yxxta the other day with my friends and did the golem camp (Mastered Destroyer) by the Uqua zoneline.  Did you know it only takes one person to request and Uqua expedition?  Hahaha.   The AE does a number to your mana, but it sure as hell is a nice &quot;Oh fuck, zone!&quot; option. :D  <br />
<br />
To comment on the gear dependancy thing, here's pretty much what I'm finding:  If you're not sporting a full set of Raex and some killer agro options, you're fucked.  Raiders are beginning to move well beyond the &quot;Raex level&quot;, but the casuals aren't even approaching anywhere near it.  Bitch and moan all they might, but I think the casuals have a damn good argument when they say the &quot;Raid vs Casual&quot; warrior discrepancy is simply too large.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I parse 99% of xp / single group content that  I do and I certainly feel there is a progression path for other classes just like there is for us. Gimpy silk wearers die the first time they get aggro and enchanters won't use CoD because of it. Gimpy slowers slow late because they're afraid of aggro and they haven't got any spell haste. The list goes on and on.<br />
<br />
I outdps half my 'dps' classes while I'm tanking because they don't have enough ft or the right spells, are lazy or just have crappy weapons and focii.<br />
<br />
The difference is that theres no easy way for a seat of the pants dps measurement like there is for tanks. 'That tank is a gimp, he takes 4 ch's per fight'.</div></div><hr />

Why should they also have an area that is single group content that drops stuff they can use as well, that insists on a player being raid-geared...<br />
<br />
Show me all the places that the non-raider can loot stuff that he will actually use.<br />
<br />
So far, OoW is mostly caster gear (sucky ac),...and the stuff that drops off single groupable mobs is mostly worse than what I already have thru quests or the bazaar if you consider both hp and ac which is almost all that really matters for a tank.<br />
<br />
Warriors (tanks in general really) feel this more than any other class, because we are much more 'measurable' than the other classes, based on damage being taken<br />
<br />
Frankly, in my opinion, the game is broken.  I have about as good quality gear as a warrior can get without raiding, and there are damn cloth wearers in the game that have more unbuffed hp than I do...<br />
<br />
so to be blunt, no, I dont feel the game NEEDS any exp zones that also drop gear that caters to the raiding population...EQ is one huge damn effort at catering to raiders</div></div><hr />

Not all raiders are EP flagged, ya know. have you even looked at &quot;GoD for the non raiding warrior&quot; they build an 8khp warrior with NO raid content. Maybe you should look into it as an upgrade roadmap. <br />
<br />
 If you're not EP flagged, you don't qualify as a 'high end raider'. Therefore, my words don't apply to you. Capisce ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you even read my post? GoD and OoW have quite nice xp/loot camps, most all of the drops are comparable to if not post velius, some even post luclin raid gear. Have a look at the cape/shoulders/boots on my magelo. I'm not going to dig up raid loot to compair it too. <br />
<br />
Reminding you about the 'high end' thing again. You obviously didn't read my post when you commented on it. You might try it sometime. Oh yeah, and we know all about OoW gear.<br />

Sounds to me like you're kinda upset about somethin. I'm the leader of a casual/family guild, far, far from walking the uber upper-ground. What i'm saying is true and sensable, so i chose to upgrade my kit instead of complaining about not being able to attain upgrades, which are in fact quite easy to get. <br />
<br />
 Yeah, I am a bit upset. Mostly at the lack of comprehension of what I wrote that you're showing. High end raiders have told us en masse that the best XP spots (Fire tables, etc.) are a reward they get for progression. Now here comes Mr. High Ender (since you can't read my posts, I'll remind you that that's not you I'm talking about), commenting that he wants challenging XP content. Sorry, that's something he gave up when he decided that he wanted to raid the biggest and baddest targets. He gets the best XP, there's no reason it should drop great gear (he gets his gear from raids), and there's no reason they should design XP content specifically to challenge him. (that's a waste of developer resources.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Atm Riftseekers is great...haven't been back to POF tables since GOD came out except running thru to kill Fennin.EP's suck compared to OOW and GOD for xp groups imo.Sure if you got POF tables to yourself or you want a kite group it can be good xp.Still it sucks.For tanks GOD and OOW have upgrades,good xp and lots of elbow room, or, instancing.Like always things can be made better.Part of the problem is the droppable gear that people bazaar up on from folks killing stuff they never see.Forms a bad expectation imo.There are grouping warriors making huge strides with OOW and GOD,it's certainly doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marckus</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weighing in a bit late in the discussion, probably don't have anything radically new or different to add.<br />
<br />
Gear gap is far less of an issue now with OoW. OoW seems to have addressed the problem in GoD of having high quality one group gear, but no bridge for the non-raiding player to get to it. OoW has not only provided a higher tier of non-raid gear than ever, it's also gone back and closed the bridge from top end bazaar gear to nodrop, one groupable gear. A+ for the idea and effort, although EQ itemization as a whole is wildly out of whack and has been for years, but that's a different discussion.<br />
<br />
Two things, I think, for me stand out.<br />
<br />
#1: Raid-only access should be limited to raid-only zones. Kunark, Velious, and Luclin all had locked zones or locked portions of zones. However, none of the zones blocked by raid content (VP, ST, VT) held anything particularly of interest for non-raiders. Locked zones with single group content (OS, HS, ToFS floors, etc) were accessible by single group (or less) efforts. PoP changed that by blocking initially, Tier 2+ from non-raiders. Alternate flag quests and then level-based access opened most applicable zones, but Sol Ro Tower could definitely use an alternate flag quest (should involve all the other alternate flag zones, and prob require the other flag quests as a preflag), and some would argue EPs as well (I don't particularly, but some do). Don't know about having single group GoD progression go all the way through Qvic; just don't know enough about the zone to have a valid opinion.<br />
<br />
#2: Progression. Not just gear progression, actually give non-raiders a reason to keep pushing through expansions and getting that gear. Raiders get a central storyline, progression to an end zone, and ultimately an expansion boss to conquer. Give non-raiders some of that too. Make LDoN progression lead to unlocking a new theme, with dungeons that have a couple of mini named and a boss; like LDoN raids for one group. Or a final dungeon in each theme, unlocked by so many points, or maxing your charm for that theme (Mayong as MMC boss?). Make completing all 3 Ikkinz group trials + some single group quests in KT/Yxtta unlock a single-group Uqua instance for a GoD non-raider &quot;end zone&quot;. Make completing all 6 single group MPG trials + a side quest give you a key to . . . something. Make us think we're playing for something other than loot, even if we're really not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niclet</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Trials - Give me more! Make them 1 groupable with tactics and not gear (as much).  I LOVED PoJ trials, the first time I saw them I thought...WOW this is what EQ should be about.  These things actually took skill and tactics when they first came out and gear wasn't good enough to compensate for poor play.  Some of the worst players I have ever played with were the /afk raider types who could have been getting a sandwich afk while the raid killed the mob for their DKP.<br />
<br />
2) Attunable gear contributes to the problem - Mudflation will continue and people like me will have to buy upgrades from the bazaar.  I don't want my progression to be tied to how much pp I farm.  I say make ALL gear no-drop AND make it only lootable by the group/raid that killed the mob, else it rots.  I want to work for my gear.  Attuneable gear just encourages more PP farming.  I'm sick of PP farming.  <br />
<br />
3) Revamp the consider system - The other side of the coin requires a means of limiting *who* can engage a given mob.  Make mobs run away from ubers if the encounter is trivial.  Or make the mob drop nothing and repop very very soon.  Make the consider system work off a relative power formula and not off of level.<br />
<br />
4) Get rid of PHs - Make named spawns tied to number of kills or completely random ala LoY/Vxed.  Timed named spawns are fine if it is random.<br />
<br />
5) Flagging - Give EVERYONE a means of getting flagged.  Make a one or two group tactical encounter with some questing that allows everyone to get flagged somehow ala Smith Rondo/Sewers...  That INCLUDES some Time-like instanced end-game zone for casuals.<br />
<br />
Everyone wants to *win* the game.  I'm suggesting providing a path to win for single groups as well as raids for ALL content.  We all pay for it, why can't we be given an equally (or even more challenging) way to see the game.<br />
<br />
Things have certainly improved, but I still havent even seen half the game: non-EP, non-KT, VT key but no raid to go, 65 warrior (no MPG, Riftseekers).  I can't even get a group in WOS most of the time because I'm too stubborn to leave level 65 and lose my ability to get AAs outside of KC-fest zones like WoS.<br />
<br />
Anyone try doing an LFG at 65 lately?  It SUCKS.  Thank god I two box and can grind AAs in bloodfields in silence....</div></div><hr />

Those are personal choices you are making in regards to YOUR style of gameplay.<br />
<br />
Noone if forcing you not to join a guild or alliance.  Hell most servers have had open raids down RZ by now.<br />
<br />
i won't argue that the game needs more 1 group content but justifying that because of your own choices of not doing what is needed to gain access to those zones like EP, KT, etc.<br />
<br />
You even state you are refusing to level to 70... and blame eq for the problems? It's your choice, your choosing your own path.<br />
<br />
It's like bitching that your out of pepsi and then refusing to go to the store to buy some more.<br />
<br />
If you choose to not join a raiding guild or an alliance or whatever, i respect that and more power to you but live with that choice.  You also have the benefits of less stress and more free time in game, it's a trade off that you chose to make.<br />
<br />
If you want access to elementals that bad, get into a guild or alliance that is in elementals or start running your own raids to get there.<br />
<br />
As for KT.. come on.., anyone with bazaar gear and an enchanter/cleric friend can get KT flagged in a matter of hours.<br />
<br />
Vex Thal at level 70 can be basically 2 grouped, it's hardly even raid content anymore, get some friends together and go try it.<br />
<br />
I'll gladly sign your petition to add more 1 group content, although I think they already have done a pretty good job of thast in OOW and even in GoD with lots of 1 groupable items.<br />
<br />
Hell, The Tier 1 Ornate style OOW quests are basically elemental quality gear, go do them and get some experience and level 70 in the process.</div></div><hr />

This thread wasn't an argument thread, but for those of us with jobs and lives it really would be nice to be considered in a game that is paid for.  I didn't ask to be flamed by some asshole who obviously spends a good portion of his life in eq.<br />
<br />
This is a dead horse, so I think I'll beat it some more and see if it whinnies.<br />
<br />
I agree that OOW is an improvement, but not a solution to the issue of uber vs casual.  The purpose of this thread was to *suggest* improvements to eq that could accomodate that.<br />
<br />
The main point I was making is that as an &quot;uber&quot; there are goals to strive for.  The game is just designed for raiding.  <br />
<br />
I can tell you have never been a casual player Panazule.  I have indeed been in raiding guilds (albeit not on this character), but being in a raiding guild is a bloody picnic in terms of upgrading, progression.  It requires next to no individual skill.  It does require a time commitment, which I cannot make.<br />
<br />
Pickup raids = 4 hr corpse recovery in my experience.  And no pickup raid has ever killed RZ on my server.  I've been pre-elemental for over a year, hell pre-Sol Ro.  I can't keep up with the pace of content, and thus any goal I have withers on the vine.  It is mostly about time.<br />
<br />
So I'm left to go lfg in WoS until I can eek out the pp and aas to maybe get an mpg group.  That said I did BoT key, PoJ and a number of other things in a few extremely painful pickup raid experiences.  My server is unfortunately void of guilds working on elemental access.  I was in 2 guilds that broke due to political bullshit, so I'm still stuck pre-EP.  3 times being knocked back to pre-SSRA has me going mad.<br />
<br />
If I choose not to devote all my personal time to eq I should still be given an interesting goal to strive for beyond loot and aas.  I want storyline, progression, I want challenge, I want a fucking carrot.  A well-balanced game would accomodate this.<br />
<br />
On another note, Try levelling a warrior to 70 now going lfg, NO powerleveling.  Just try it.  I'll see you next frickin year with tears in your eyes. Try going LFG at 65!  Just try!  I can't even get the FUCK out of 65!  I was LFG for 4 hours tonight.  Yes F O U R hours. Even if I get to 70, try getting a gimp tank without 100+ aas a group in MPG where I will need to be to get any reasonable xp lol.<br />
<br />
Thats a clear sign that the game is unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Many of my casual friends lost interest long ago and bailed on eq.  Is this game just for uberarse 16 year old kids on summer vacation?  God I hope not...<br />

First, all 70 warriors got thru 65 to get to 70.  We have all been there, all know the frustration, and we all got past it.  Count your blessings that you are trying to exp in EQ now, cuz at one point in time, 4 days was not uncommon for warriors to be LFG, as we simply where notwanted in groups.<br />
<br />
Second, MPG is A) not the best place to exp at 70, and B) harder to tank at 70 than at least one exp spot, namely the RCoD instince zones.  mobs do not hit as hard or as fast as MPG, are much faster pulls, and give good exp, and some nice drops.  Also, WoS is about the last place I would exp to 70...it is boring, slow paced, and not that good exp.  Before throwing a hissy fit about inbalance, go explore a bit, and see the other zones, and maybe, just maybe, alot of your issues will go away...<br />
<br />
The fact that you will have a hard time geting groups in one zone(MPG) does in no way indicate that the game is unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tooby</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to be honest, if you are non-raiding, casual, without the kind of guild, friends list or regular group that will more or less guarantee you a group when you log on  - roll another class (or get one of the above).<br />
<br />
seriously<br />
<br />
tanks will always be very gear dependent and if you are casual, you will continue to slip further behind. <br />
<br />
You cant solo. You only have 2-3 hours, so lfg may not be an option if it takes can take you several hours, and while im all for building groups, i realize lots of people find the group-building experience to be frustrating and boring - simply not the relaxation you logged on for.<br />
<br />
Make a non-melee, put lfg up, go solo some names or just for xp and as an added bonus you will sometimes get asked into groups after a while.<br />
<br />
level up to 65, get a bit of ft, and enjoy game and the sound of no-one questioning your ability to go where you want to based on gear.<br />

just a thought</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Some of Niclet's issues might go away, and I'm not sure four hours of lfg mean the game is borked, but certain problems for the casual warrior are stubbornly systemic in this game, and I don't see any easy solution to those problems.<br />
The primary issue revolves around a simple fact about how people play this game: some of them play an average of eight hours a day, every day, and they've been doing that for five years, and they've been doing it in large groups. Other people play in one to four hour slices, a few times a week, and they tend to do it with smaller groups of people. <br />
The result is an extreme variety in warrior character development, and that variation is greater than differences in level would make it appear.<br />
The problem here is that the game cannot simply stop giving the 8-hour-a-day folks something to do, since obviously they'd quit if they didn't have something to do. But the construction of sufficient challenges to amuse folks with that much game time and who are in large guilds creates a cycle where the rewards are greater for greater and greater challenges, which provides these folks with more power, which generates a need for yet greater challenges.<br />
Eventually, some of these challenges become significant enough that a good many casual players will never be able to meet them. <br />
An associated problem for casual warriors in casual guilds is the disparity between how fast they can get things done as opposed to how fast warriors in raiding guilds can get the same thing done. If one of the barriers to getting a drop is the rarity of the drop, for example, many guilds simply hit the mob night after night until the drops come. For casual guilds, however, it may take many days or even weeks to make a second attempt. <br />
I don't see these issues going away, because I think they are systemic. <br />
They don't mean that casual warriors have nothing to do. They do mean that casual warriors thrash around a good bit at various points attempting to get inferior gear to that available in much less time to raiding warriors. <br />
Personally, the relative efficiency of raiding warriors and their access to better gear bothers me not at all as long as when I get into, say, a pick-up group, I can do a good job tanking. I often get tells from people I've previously done pick-up groups with. Even if I'm not lfg, sometimes they'll ask me to join them, and a good many of them are raiding folks (often playing an alt). As long as folks in raiding guilds are taking the trouble to seek me out when they do pick-up groups, I figure my warrior is able to do his job. <br />
I know for sure that he is modestly geared, but I figure it doesn't matter as long as people who have seen me tank want me to tank for them. But at some point, I think, my lack of access to all but the marginal end of gear available to warriors will result in a steady decline in my relative tanking ability. At some point, I either have to change my real life, or be gimp, or stop playing the warrior. The first two choices are not acceptable, and I'm not looking forward to the third. I could, as another poster has suggested, play a necro or some damn thing that can solo. But nothing beats playing a warrior. And all of you know why: when you're not playing one, or on one but not fighting, warriors are frustrating odd little toons. But when you're tanking, all that other stuff just falls away.<br />
That's the carrot: maintanking a tough mob, and doing it well.<br />
It's the only carrot. <br />
All other non-player aspects of the game are merely sticks and the illusions of carrots.<br />
If the real carrot goes away because I can't gear my warrior well enough to do his job well, then no more game for me. And that's the central issue for me as a casual warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the biggest challenge in EQ is the social one.Friends and a network of folks to play with at whatever level change one's play experience far more than any innate skill as a tank,or,even playtime.<br />
<br />
I remember as we were leveling up on Stromm and they made the grouping xp changes.Suddenly,duoing with my wife for xp seemed silly next to getting groups.Before those changes we could xp together competively with the player base excepting only very serious organzied groups.Being that we had little down time and played with common interest we leveled at least as quickly as the majority of players.After the grouping xp bonus the differance between even casual group xp and duoing became vast.At that point I felt forced into seeking groups even when we just felt like trucking off as a twosome when we wanted to level.Prieviously,I had just accepted that we wouldn't be able to bring down loot mobs the way a group could(made sense to me),but, we could at least xp at a similiar rate over time as there was more challenge to killing a mob with 2 ppl instead of 6.At that point on Stromm kite groups(tanks had crap gear) went thru the ceiling and many friends who had been several levels under me went to 65 in the time i went from 50 or so to 55.Duoing just didn't cut it anymore for xpin.<br />
<br />
A lot of character progression and fun in EQ is based upon your social network.I had never played a game like EQ before and found it a little disagreeable until after just bouncing into enough nice people I began to lighten up and enjoy grouping for its own sake.Still,although I had some regular friends who we often were able to group with,groups were often hard to find at times.Being in a guild with a fairly active membership is a big help in connecting the dots and forming groups,building new friendships etc.The thing about a guild is you want to make sure you find one that suits you and who you enjoy belonging to.Joining a guild only to progress is a surefire way to misery imo.Besides,although I know some hardcore players approach it from a differant perspective it just feels wrong to me.Unfortunately,finding the right guild can take some luck and at the very least exposure time to other players.I never thought,or, really cared at the time about how far my guild would go.I just had friends who asked me along on raids and joined because I liked the folks I met and had some fun.So my wife and I got lucky.Of course the world turns.Now I find I'm guildleader/raidleader and busy.I'm tuckered a lot of the time in EQ and out of time for much grouping these days.I do get to raid 4 days a week with a great bunch of folks and helping make them happy makes me happy.It's not free,easy,or simple tho.<br />
<br />
EQ is a pretty demanding game.Not in terms of leet fast twitch skills,or great intelligence,but,demanding all the same.It'll sound strange.I'm retired military and spent a lot of time in erm ...socially dense environment.However,EQ has actually taught me a bit about people and myself.I have  had to move out of my normal comfort zone dealing with people in game.I've never compromised myself in anything I felt was important,but,I still learned new things and have grown a little.It sounds geeky /shrug.Of course anyone who devotes many hours a week to playing a game like this and gets caught up to the point of posting here should understand.<br />
<br />
EQ is desinged to encourage(I still don't agree with group  xp bonus omg!) players to work together.Although feeling like I have to do stuff with other folks is sometimes uncomfortable it has yielded the greatest rewards to me in this game.By reward I don't mean gearing Gunnar.I mean that the best moments I have had,the fun times that will linger long past EQ,were ones I shared with other players.Overcoming tough stuff with friends that have stuck with you through hard times can be pretty neat.Laughing along side them in moments of pause when the shared experience seems downright silly is kinda kewl too.EQ can give you a lot for a game,but, like most things it asks for a lot in return.<br />
<br />
There are non raiders doing quite well in EQ.Some that post here a lot can tank most stuff any raider can given a little more support.They have to have that social network though.A group of friends they can draw upon to fight their way through content,grind with  and enjoy it.A guild isn't always an easy social mechanism to keep healthy and happy ,but, it can help maintain that kind of play.<br />
<br />
The biggest frustrations and the greatest challenges in EQ are due to it's social demands.The greatest rewards and most meaningful gameplay result from the same challenges.Games are much simpler when you play by yourself.I believe now, they are less rewarding too.</div></div><hr />

I can tell you have never been a casual player Panazule. I have indeed been in raiding guilds (albeit not on this character), but being in a raiding guild is a bloody picnic in terms of upgrading, progression. It requires next to no individual skill. It does require a time commitment, which I cannot make.<br />
<br />
Pickup raids = 4 hr corpse recovery in my experience. And no pickup raid has ever killed RZ on my server. I've been pre-elemental for over a year, hell pre-Sol Ro. I can't keep up with the pace of content, and thus any goal I have withers on the vine. It is mostly about time.<br />
<br />
So I'm left to go lfg in WoS until I can eek out the pp and aas to maybe get an mpg group. That said I did BoT key, PoJ and a number of other things in a few extremely painful pickup raid experiences. My server is unfortunately void of guilds working on elemental access. I was in 2 guilds that broke due to political bullshit, so I'm still stuck pre-EP. 3 times being knocked back to pre-SSRA has me going mad.<br />
<br />
If I choose not to devote all my personal time to eq I should still be given an interesting goal to strive for beyond loot and aas. I want storyline, progression, I want challenge, I want a fucking carrot. A well-balanced game would accomodate this.<br />
<br />
On another note, Try levelling a warrior to 70 now going lfg, NO powerleveling. Just try it. I'll see you next frickin year with tears in your eyes. Try going LFG at 65! Just try! I can't even get the FUCK out of 65! I was LFG for 4 hours tonight. Yes F O U R hours. Even if I get to 70, try getting a gimp tank without 100+ aas a group in MPG where I will need to be to get any reasonable xp lol.<br />
<br />
Thats a clear sign that the game is unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Many of my casual friends lost interest long ago and bailed on eq. Is this game just for uberarse 16 year old kids on summer vacation? God I hope not...<br />
<br />
I'm stubborn enough (and still find enough amusement) that I'm still playing...<br />
<br />
Oh.... boo-HOO!  I'm level 65 and nobody will group with me.  Frankly, if this post is representative of how you conduct yourself in game, I'm not too surprised you have difficulty getting groups.<br />
<br />
You sound like you're one of those anti-'uber' people with a chip on your shoulder about it.  First of all, you indicate that being in a raid guild requires no skill -- well here's a newsflash champ -- neither does being a whiney casual player.  EQ is an _easy_ game.  It's not about skill 95% of the time.  Like most things, you get out of it what you put into it.  If you can only play 4 hours a week, it shouldn't come as a surprise that you can't keep up with the people who put in 20 or 30.<br />
<br />
Panazule is on my server, and yes he's in a raiding guild.  However, his guild has always been fairly laid back (from what I know) and yet they still do quite well for themselves.  It's not like you have to be a 18 year old kid with a trust-fund to be in a guild that manages to progress in raid content.<br />
<br />
A level 65 tank should be able to get a group in WoS _no problem_.  The mobs there are sub-BoT in strength.  I've grouped with rangers (and before you go there, no they weren't 'uber') who tanked just fine there.  Make some friends and schedule a group if you don't want to sit around LFG.  Heck man, 99% of the time I group with people in my guild -- even if you don't raid, that's the best way to get a group of people to hang out with.  When I _do_ go LFG I sometimes sit around for hours waiting for a /tell too -- and that's coming from someone with level 70, nearly 600AA, and full Time/Qvic+ gear.<br />
<br />
Here's another friendly tip:  Don't worry about getting elemental access.  It's a waste of time at this point.  You can get better and more frequent upgrades in OoW exp groups than you'll be able to get in the elemental planes.  You'll also get more experience while you're doing so.  It's a sad fact that the new expansion has all but obsoleted PoP, in a similar way that PoP obsoleted Kunark and Velious.<br />

<br />
Here's another one of those knocks on people who raid -- we're all a bunch of acne-ridden losers who do nothing but play EQ, afterall... right?!  I'm in a raid guild and 95% of us are adults with full time jobs, families, friends, and a social life to boot.<br />
<br />
If you want storyline and progression in a single-group context, I'd like to introduce you to LDoN and all of GoD pre-ikkinz raid 1.  It's all single-group stuff (if you don't go the Rondo route).  Want challenge?  Then go tank Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru in Tipt and live to tell about it.  Or go win an Ikkinz 1 group trial.  Or just grow some balls and get level 66, then go to MPG.<br />
<br />
You make it sound like you can't do anything without 15k hit points and 2500ac.  That's simply not the case.  I was grouped in RSS last night with some guildies, and a full group of &quot;casual&quot; people zoned in and did quite well at another camp for several hours before they packed up and left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikotine</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casual players are people with a casual take on life style.  They always use the contribed, &quot;i have work and have a social life.&quot; or make some derrogatory comment about how hardcore games are 12 or anti social losers, etc...well, i know its been said, but for some reason its not understood.  I play for 5 hrs a day on average and I have many friends, which also play EQ or are some sort of gamer.  I also hold down fulltime job which isnt in fast food mind you, when i refer to my job i should say profession in the computer industry. Damn its realy amazing how people bring their reality into a virtual reality....reality is what you make of it bro, work harder and smarter in anything you do, now relate that philosophy in any virtual reality.  Dont fault the people who do cuz you have some excuse that you can not.<br />
<br />
Learn what a &quot;twitch game&quot; is bro, those are for casual gamers.  Bet you people who wine about your inability to do this or that cuz of this or that will get pwnd in any twitch game....awwww...shit I give up, i thought there was a place for you. There isnt, in the game world or IRL.  Delete ur characters plzthx.  Then wine how its so much tougher for casual players to delete characters then hardcore gamers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niclet</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If any of you who flamed me had actually taken the time to read my posts, I clearly stated that I was playing DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (do I need to spell this for you?), but that I still have real concerns about the 60-65 grouping game.  I didn't start the fire here kiddies, plaz flamed me outta the blue after I posted suggestions for improving the casual game.<br />
<br />
My main point in the replies was that the LFG game SUCKS at the moment.  BoT is empty, PoV is empty.  Regardless of what you say LFG at 65 in OoW is pointless.  I get a group if I have friends on, if I don't I will always lose to the 5 other lfg warriors.  That's all, I'm not on some freakin' anti-uber rant.<br />
<br />
As for EP access, the reply was don't bother, OoW has better gear...Imagine abandoning your GoD progress just as you get to Uqua because your guild folds and having someone say, &quot;blow it off, there is better gear in OoW!&quot;.  I spent 6 frickin months getting all the flags etc., now I'm clear that was a waste of time.  Maybe I should just sit in the bazaar, maybe that's progression... Kinda misses the point of progression doesn't it?<br />
<br />
I'm not anti-uber in the least.  I am interested in seeing good game balance for casuals, which is what this thread was about.  It is clear that improvements to the casual game are threatening to some...<br />
<br />
It reminds me of when I asked sarcastically what &quot;poor&quot; meant to a rich friend of mine and he said poor people make $70,000 a year...This wasn't a joke, he really believed it!  Games are a mirror of society, and clearly there is a perception gap in terms of game experience....<br />
<br />
Now stop with the flames and get back on topic.</div></div><hr />
