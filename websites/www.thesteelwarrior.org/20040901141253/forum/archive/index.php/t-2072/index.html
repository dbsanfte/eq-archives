<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Please tell me this is a joke!!  Good Mithaniel, if that had been available while I was an undergrad I would have either aced it or flunked out of college all together, depending on if I bothered to show up to classes after I was addicted to EQ!!  It was hard enough doing a masters degree while addicted to EQ :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The price is very high though. Notice they all started as halfling druids.. that dirt will never fall off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Which campus is that?  It says redwood but I cant recall any towns named redwood around Seattle.  Anyway, It apprears to to be legit U of Dub class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seen this on the FoH boards <br />
<br />
um was gonna post a link but i just checked the actual content of the thread again <br />
<br />
Mebbe not :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure which campus that is either will have to do some checking hehe.<br />
<br />
well it says the office is in Office: 218 Raitt Hall<br />
<br />
So I would assume redwood is just some sort of distinction for hte course as raitt hall is on the main camps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, me too...I'm glad EQ wasn't around when I was in college, it wouldn't have been good for my GPA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>elfdragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe... it's a joke... or maybe even a web page someone did for a class on how to set up a web page on a college course.  The person just used EQ, or set it up for fun.  Looks like a whole lot of work for fun... I'm hoping they did it as a project for school.  You'll notice their are no links for the school as there would be on a real college site.  On real college sites there would be links for all kinds of information on the college, classes, and navigating the overall college site.  This site is on a college server, obviously because it was done by a college student.  Colleges usually give email and web space to their students, and work is done and displayed on the net (especially for html classes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have taught college courses.  Look at the Syllabus.  Look at the student pictures.  Look at the reading assignments.  Look at the links to students and their diaries.  It is all very real.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Looks like a real course folks.  Here's the description out of the course catalog.  Redwood is apparently the machine name/username of the prof.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good lord that's scary.  Our educational systems are worse than I thought.  Let that be a lesson to you kids, if you want to get a good education, study history, science, mathematics, and philosophy on your own time.  If you want a degree, go to college and play EQ. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Evergreen college.<br />
<br />
I can actually see a lot of value in studing EQ--but it sounds as if the course does not go nearly deep enough. The socialogical and psycological studies themselves would be quite interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, there's a class on the Simpsons, so hey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would have loved to take this class.  The sociology class I took in college was the biggest waste of 2 hours a week in history.  At least in this class you get to play video games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Since Norrath has an Economy that is greater than a lot of third world countries; it really is a rather interesting experiment to dissect it and see how the economic, social, and history of it has come to pass.<br />
<br />
you really can't have a more perfect test subject where everything is categorized, labelled, and kept up to date.<br />
<br />
Lucky I never went to a real college though or i'd definately have flunked if they had EQ as a class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just can't believe academics are wasting their time studying such things as the economics of EQ.  I mean please, who really cares?  There are much more important things that need to be studied.  What a waste of a Ph.D.  Of course my 2 masters degrees are in biology and epidemiology, so might be my own personal bias /shrug.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and I told my husband about this, and he said if our daughter ever takes a course like this in college.  He's yanking her ass out of college.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Haha I talked to my parents about this also...<br />
<br />
Me: Say, I heard about a college course that lets me play Everquest.<br />
Parents: You're not going to be taking any Mickey classes this year....<br />
<br />
O well, I tried...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Evergreen College is not a typical college.  I am originally from Washington State and saw some of their programs.  They are very liberal with their ideas on academia.  You basically can make up your own majors, class schedules, etc.  Very free-wheeling school.<br />
<br />
For PE credit, how about swinging on a swingset for 30 minutes a day?  This happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow...and these are the people that are representing America? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There is a wide-range of univeristies in the United States.  Many of them appeal to not just US students but students worldwide.  It is much more expensive for foreign students (in most cases) to attend American universities, but they do in droves.<br />
<br />
Reed College, Evergreen University, and others use very non-traditional course matter, teaching techniques, etc. to get the most out of their students.  Many of their students go on to graduate schools and acheive quite well.<br />
<br />
While I don't agree with some of their techniques, they do get some results that are very positive.<br />
<br />
The idea of using Evequest to study the future way in which humans may interact with each other socially (and some currently do, i.e. us) is an interesting way to make the material real to the students.<br />
<br />
I see no reason to disparage Evergreen based on the presentation of this class.  It looks to be both fun and challenging.<br />
<br />
As somebody who sometimes has fun assignments at work, I know that work+fun and education+fun can be useful, build morale, and encourage greater efficiency.<br />
<br />
So yeah -- these are the people that are representing America...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love LOVE LOVE the journal entries ... &quot;so a bixbee killed me today and yesterday I drown!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's good to know there are still real newbies in Everquest.<br />
<br />
But in terms of academia, I think this is a fascinating class, all joking aside.  The internet is now where our cultural growth is heading and if I were a socialogist, I'd be very interested and somewhat concerned about what that means as a society.  Personally, I think its fabulous that I can log on and be in a group of guildmates that consist of a highschool student, a lawyer, a housewife and her 13 year old son, and an unemployed computer wiz.  The interaction alone (aside from Incoming [ %T ]) is so unique.  Also, it looks to me like they are studying some of the effects of gaming, like addiction.  Since so many people now play online games....its a somewhat-worthy research area. <br />
<br />
P.S. Hi all! I'm new here, but I religiously trolled the old TSW ezboards.  There is no real introduction area so ... this is mine hah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">:eek:  your sig scares the hell out of me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">=(  No love for the Linsner chik-a?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">sure...what the hey<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">There are other courses around online gaming. Georgia Tech has one that covers &quot;Virtual Communities&quot;. While we are all playing a game here, think about it a moment. You are working side by side with guildmates, groupmates, etc, to accomplish a goal. Someone in rural Georgia can interact with someone from New York, London, or even Sydney, Australia, like they were sitting right next to each other. <br />
<br />
Sure, this is just a game now, but what possibilities does this hold for the future? What can be learned about our experiences that may later be applied to Doctors mapping out a plan to treat a rare disease, or researchers solving some great mystery, or even diplomats discussing issues to prevent war?<br />
<br />
I know it sounds like a stretch, but it really isn't that far away.<br />
<br />
20 years ago, it would take about an hour of effort to send a picture from one person to another over the internet. Now it takes a moment. What will things be like in another 20 years?<br />
<br />
Ultima Online used to show how many player-hours had been spent. The numbers were staggering. If all those people spent that same time trying to solve the problem of world hunger, the world would be a much happier place for many.<br />
<br />
Think about it.. by playing online games like this, you really are a pioneer of sorts. <br />
<br />
I know.. it sounds hokey. But we are defining the world we live in.<br />
