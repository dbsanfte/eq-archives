I got the whirlwind weapon at 39 (as soon as i could kill those fire elementals) but it got outdated quickly. I'm still using it at lvl 45. I see 30 dps 1handers. I see Blight (lvl 45) that is a polearm and my specialization is in swords. The only other option I see here is to go for Sword of Serenity (SM reward) and Thrash Blade (Maraudon reward). Are there any other options? Or do I have to wait for Truesilver Champion that will cost a lot of money and requires lvl 47.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">01-23-2005, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets face it, as warriors, green weapons are not acceptable.  You want to have blue or purple ^^<br />
<br />
Sword of serenity is a real nice weapon if you can get it around 40ish, I still use mine for the offhand.  At 45, it's an easy money quest, and if its an upgrade you should probably go get it.<br />
<br />
Thrash Blade is an excellent sword, but is a fun one to get pre 50.  Princess is a real monster, and has some of the most annoying attacks to beat down melee ever.  Tip: Bring nature protection potions<br />
<br />
The TS champ is an expensive sword yes, but most of it's expense comes from the breath of wind drops.  They come off of wind elementals in tanaris.  It takes 4, you can probably knock 20g off the price of the weapon if you farm them yourself.<br />
<br />
Other than those, there are no real &quot;good&quot; swords in that level range that aren't random drops off of mobs,  expect to be camping the AH if you can't get your hands on any of the above.</div></div><hr />

Let us use this man as an example.  Don't pigeonhole your weapon selection because you spent your points in Arms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya sword spec and arms is pigeoned hole. Don't get it.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, not gonna solo herod. ^^  Or into him for that matter.<br />
<br />
I've got sword spec atm, it's not too bad, you just have to be aware there is a lot of other good weapons out there that aren't swords.</div></div><hr />

Its an awsome farm tool plus you get rage for the AoE hits.  Builds lotsa rage fast.<br />
<br />
Now if we just new what determins proc rates /drool</div></div><hr />

Stoneslayer from Archaedas in Uldaman ( I still use this for trash clearing despite having 2handers with far more dps - as a whirlwind weapon it's hard to beat, I probably won't replace it til the emp coughs up a dreadforge retaliator ).<br />
<br />
The viking sword from Baelog just inside Uldaman is also a decent 1hander ( plus you can farm for a horned viking helmet at the same time, amazingly useful things those )<br />
<br />
Sword spec has kind of pigeonholed you, there are a few nice polearms, hammers and axes about.</div></div><hr />

Very nice blue weapon with the ability to disarm for 10 secs.  Its smithed, so you could check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
As for sword spec, my warrior is human and they get +5 sword and mace skill as a racial ability. Just wanted to build up on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Truesilver Champ is a nice way to go until you can get a drop or a crafted weapon that's better, and honestly until mid to late 50s in quests or instances there are not many that beat it.   (the 2h Blunt sceptar from the Princess in Mauradon is really nice)  The breath are kind of a pain, but there are two or three static spawn Air Elementals in Tanaris that you can farm.  The rock guys are their PHs.  I actually farmed 8 of them for a friend and I.  Haven't gone back since though!  Got me real sick of farming real fast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I game with a group of RL friends 90% of my time.  One is a hunter who went smithing and weapon smith.  He is now a weapon smith and made me a phantom blade(I am going armor smith).  It's a good 35 DPS one hand slasher, that procs a armor debuff.    SInce I can't use it for a couple more lvl's, my question is this....will this proc stack with Sunder?  If so, since sunder is one of our main aggro abilites, will the weapon be a good aggro weapon when tanking with Sword and board?<br />
<br />
I'm primarily gearing my warrior for high end instance tanking.  Alot of protection build with some arms (some of the &quot;bang for your buck&quot; ones) and and planning on only taking cruelty in fury.  So,  aggro, HP, AC and the mitigation/stunning skill's are my primary concerns and since I play primarily in a group, my solo ability is secondary ... as long as I can preserve it to some extent, that's all I care about.<br />
<br />
So is this a good sword for my purposes?  Right now I'm lvl 39, and I know there are better swords out there, but I can't use them yet, nor will I have the ability to get them untill I start I eitehr raiding in earnest Once I acheive a higher lvl, or become a higher lvl and get into some of these zones.<br />
<br />
The AC debuff that it procs is a 100 AC debuff.<br />
<br />
Any input any higher lvl warriror has would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to metoo what Haass said. While the +skill and spec is nice, don't let that limit your weapon choice. As an undead I don't have any weapon bonuses, I will use the best weapon I have at hand. I have gone 2 weapons, 2 handed weapons and sword and shield. Use the best gear at hand and don't let the fact that it doesn't match your current build perfectly weigh so heavily.<br />
<br />
Blight is actaully the easiest of the 45ish weapons to make--if you have high level friends or guildmates. Ichor of Undeath is rare at the 45ish level, but once you break into the Plaguelands its common. The Truesilver Champion, and Phantom Blade both require Truesilver and Breath of Air.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it stacks with sunder.<br />
<br />
And it looks downright fucking badass as well.  Took me 3 days farming Breath to make mine, and it was completely worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um .. how did ya get that to show up on your back there hass since Phantom Blade isn't a 2her or is there some Photosop luv going on there ot is that a different sword with the same graphic...just a 2hs(similiar to DBoW / BoW in EQ)?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, my NEXT question is this.  Can a sword have 2 procs on it?  The reason I'm asking is that I was told of a quest ... somewhere...(I'll have to ask the guy about it again) that gives ya a fire proc you can add to a weapon (as a mod).   If so, this sword woudl be so bad ass at lvl 44 that it's mind blowing.  A High DPS 1h weapon with a debuffer AND a DD proc.<br />
<br />
Sorry if these questions seem sorta noobish, but the transitin from EQ to WoW, while ensuring you are not a total clusterfuck (for most heh) still don't get ya any game knwledge as you gome up through the ranks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes.  However the badlands enchant is an ae, which makes it a lot less useful, and its for a really small amount of dmg.  Enchanters have the ability to enchant w/ procs that don't suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Phantom Blade is a one-hander and shows up on your back.  There's no magic/photoshopping there.  Look around tonight and (if your server is anything like mine) you'll see about 4-5 billion level 45ish rogues wearing it.<br />
