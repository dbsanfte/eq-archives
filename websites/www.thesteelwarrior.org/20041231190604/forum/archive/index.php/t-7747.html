So if my answers I am looking for are in obvious places, please don't flame me. I have been putting effort into it  :) <br />
<br />
Now, I have 2 questions:<br />
<br />
1) Is there a listing anywhere of the warrior tomes that we have available? Not just the merchant ones but I think I read somewhere that there are GoD tomes you can get and others... so has anyone compiles this info and published it?<br />
<br />
2) What happened to the big Malee update.. it seems after they implimented the 1st update with all the tomes and everything, the whole craze kinda died and it was left alone... wasnt there supposed to be more updates and changes to melee? What did I miss?<br />
<br />
Thanks all, in advance, for your constructive feedback :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a quick sumqry would be :<br />
1) I don't know. lucy listes the skills, from which we can go to the tomes but the source is not always listed (and you have to check if it comes from test server or not). thus it's not an easy/quick way.<br />
<br />
2) the opening system, while fantastic in idee, was horific to balance and make it useable. thus it has gone that way :<br />
a. abandon of opening system<br />
b. move all the nice skills liked to it to an standard skill system (like kick,...)<br />
c. because it would have unbalance warrior prior to other melee dps it hasn't been given to them.<br />
d. they created a new class based on the warrior and gave it all theese skills, gimped its defence, tryed to pump up its offence and called it a Berzerker.<br />
e. according to the berzerber board, this class is broken (like BST at its creation) and need to have an increase in dps ... is it justifyed or just whinnig because they aren't the first/second best melee dps, I don't know and don't care.</div></div><hr />

The tome information you are looking for is located in the libray. Apprpriate thread is here - Warrior disciplines and the Incite line (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6784)<br />
<br />
As far as I know about the melee update phase 2 was that the opening system was eventually scrapped and since phase 2 was depandant on the opening system, that whole thing was scrapped.<br />
<br />
That might also explain why berzerkers are so utterly pointless, I think a lot of their abilities were dependant on the new system. I wish we had a definitive answer myself as I was looking forward to doing something else than press taunt and grabbing a cup of coffee while the group killed the mob.</div></div><hr />
