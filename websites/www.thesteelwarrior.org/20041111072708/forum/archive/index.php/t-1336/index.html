<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lets me start I've been playing warrior since June 99. Back then crafted was not invented bronze was uber and only ubers ever hear of yekeshas and yet warriors taunted just fine... with their fine steel weapons and whatever else. They got the job done.<br />
<br />
Kunark came out everyone was wielding yekeshas and still taunt was fine. Velious still no EB weapons cause no one could best AoW but everyone had a primal and taunt was fine...Luclin some got eb weapons others good ratios agro still fine.... Now its not uncommon people to have weapons that procs some  kind of hate, ratios on weapons we use skyrocketed, caster's spell agro has been reduced and now warrior bitch about agro...<br />
<br />
Somehow I dont buy it. I also do not belive that ANYONE here was told that the group had a spot for a tank and they didnt want warrior cause they need a pally or sk. So what the fuck is all this bitching and moaning about? Yes palladins and SKs have a great advantage in this department I agree, but that does not mean we cant do our job. We did it for all these years and with all the supperior tools that available now we do it worse? No we dont. What you are talking about is class envy. Get it into your heads warriors do not have trouble with agro.... We never did. Its the knights who are out of balance now, but it is not breaking the class balance as far as I can tell. A tank is a tank all 3 war/sk/pal should be able to tank just fine in xp groups and they do. Everyone has their place on raids now too. All classes have downsides too I am sure not many if any of you play(ed) pally or SK to 65 with enough AA and gear to really talk about them beeing overpowered. Stop this class envy shit I am sick of it. Lets talk constructive. Make sugestions dont drool about what some over class has and if you really think paladins so powerfull go play 1. We wont miss ya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, I was playing my 57 mage today(nice to take a break from tanking once in awhile), got a group invite to RCY in PoD, got there and pally was tanking.  After about an hour, pally says he has to go, would look for a replacement.  The enchanter days &quot;Sk or pally, I die when I group with warrriors&quot;.  Sorry to burst your bubble, but when I play my mage, that comment is not one that is uncommon to hear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This happened to me yesterday.  My guild Leader was in a group (not a guild group) said they needed a tank had to be pally and SK.  Group was in RCY in PoD and as those mobs still con yellow and red to me that makes my taunt useless even though I have the AC and HP to do the job.<br />
<br />
And guess what.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont for 1 second blame them.<br />

Krag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And yes, as a matter of fact we do indeed have aggro problems.  Because this game has become casterquest, and casters have become so overpowered in relation to us it makes it even harder to keep aggro.  Also, because the game has been dumbed down so much that lazy players that dont know or care how to play their class and work with us on aggro management have become the norm.  Is it sad that actions that used to get people booted from groups have become accepted to the point that they are now reasons not to have a warrior tank? Yes it is.  But that doesn't mean it hasnt happened.   A few expansions ago, a high DPS class or slowing/debuffing/snaring class that consistently pulled aggro off the tank was either educated on what to do to avoid it or kicked out of the group. These days the whole damn group just says &quot;warriors suck, this doesnt happen with a knight tanking&quot; instead.<br />

Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>warrior2003</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">most people dont want warriors, they will wait for sk or pally.  generally speaking, only my friends will take me into a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well maybe the 50-59 warriors need to be looked at then. Since this seems to be where the issues arise. You are right before pop warriors did not need to taunt mobs above their level very often if any at all. Everyone was fighting &lt;51 mobs for xp mostly and I cant coment on that since when pop came out I was 60. So the problem really is warrior 50-59 cant do their job right now. I know 60-65 we are definatley not broken I've leveled in pop just fine and never had issues you speak off and my gear was and still is far from anything to drool over.<br />
<br />
Are all those who posted here about agro sub 60?<br />
<br />
As for Donnel what is you play time? Come back when you have something to contribute. You previous post didnt not contribute anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I contribute anything I see fit.<br />
<br />
This issue has been hashed and rehashed and spoken about, and shouted about so many times already.<br />
<br />
How can you honestly come in here and say that people DONT get passed up in xp groups when so many DO every single day?<br />
<br />
I posted my OPINION of your post.<br />
<br />
And I stick by it.<br />
<br />
Like you said... One Troll's view on aggro issues.<br />
<br />
Edit: Decided to actually contribute an opinion and feed the Troll (Hey, everyone else is doing it :D)<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't broken. Gimp Ebayed, players are broken. The same group that can't play past level 5 without getting a KEI (Yay for that being gone) can't play in PoP without a Knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The other day I was watching a Level 65 SK tank normal mobs in BoT , had class aa , good gear , and good guild , If I didn't know better I would say that the sk was an enchanter , kept needing CH's like once every 3 hits , watching the hp bar made me nauseous lol... If I was a cleric I wouldn't care no matter what the agro difference was , Id want a warrior who only need 1 ch per fight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A lvl 65 SHD with good gear and good AA will have little problem tanking in BoT.  If you saw a SHD not tank well in there, then he was probably not geared well at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know 60-65 we are definatley not broken I've leveled in pop just fine and never had issues you speak off and my gear was and still is far from anything to drool over. <br />
<br />
As I sit her lfg, and browsing message boards for something to do(most of my guild will not be on for a couple hours yet, I am on earlier than usual), I am watching the people listed on the lfg tool.  Been 4 65 warriors lfg for the last hour.  In that time, 2 pallies and 3 sk's have came on the lfg list, and all gone off it in short order.<br />
<br />
It is my contention that in fact you are partialy right tho.  Warriors are not broken, as we can do well, given a group of resonable competent people.  Warriors are only broken in relation to knights, who bring nearly the same tankability, utility, and far superior agro control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bingo. If people are willing to pull their heads out of their asses and work with a warrior to let him keep aggro, all usually goes well.  There are still instances where something resists too many times, taunt doesn't work too many times in a row, and someone dies.  However, those are still relatively rare.  The biggest problem is that too many people have gotten too used to knights getting aggro lock (or near enough as to make it almost 100% reliable) and gotten lazy.   And yes, I am not yet 60 (56 atm), but I do see alot of post 60 warriors on this board talking about having the same problems.  A change needs to be made, and it doesn't need to be just a endgame item/high level/AA change.  Like it or not, retards that either can't or won't control their aggro seem to be here to stay.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Like it or not, retards that either can't or won't control their aggro seem to be here to stay.<br />
<br />
And my question would be, why should they control their aggro?  They can do more, participate more, feel like they've contributed and accomplished more, with a Knight tanking.  And they don't even have to think as hard.  Why would anyone really want the Warrior if given a choice?<br />
<br />
An example of what I mean.  You have a ditch to dig.  You can use a backhoe and get it done in 20 minutes.  You can use a shovel and get it done in a day.  Both will dig you a nice ditch.  Yet one is a hell of a lot faster and easier.  I get the impression some people think using the backhoe is retarded, because you don't have to work and think as hard as you do with a shovel.   My response is, huh?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dont go LFG much since I 3box  a 65 chanter and 65 cleric with my warrior, but when I do I usually find one in about 10minutes.  I generally dont loose aggro, but if I were to I could care less.  The mob dies in about 30seconds and on to the next mind numbing xp mob.   When I play just my clerc in a grp with a warrior who can hold aggro, even if his/her life depended on it, I still am FM after every fight.  I've just learned to deal with it and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Guys, you can taunt mobs above your level now  (pre-60).<br />
<br />
I don't know when this was changed, but it was, I can post screenshots of it if you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>biggpudge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Let the knight tank and then I get to pull.  I never have trouble getting a group and often get tells when I’m lfg in a raids.  Knights are not the instant agro machine people make them out to be either.  When playing my shaman I often group with a pally with good gear, a lot AA and know how to play his toon.  Resist or two or landing a dot to soon and I’m one dead shaman.</div></div><hr />
