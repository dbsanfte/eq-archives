Best thing to raid VP for are the BPs IMO, there's an elemental god level BP for each armor type there along with a buttload of weapons and some other cool toys.  Sadly I don't know of any guild that has bothered to raid there, and most of the people that got keys did the quests and don't want to wreck their faction.  It's too bad though, because killing dragons is a hell of a lot of fun, there are some pretty unique fights (lots of unusual adds and AE's) and some nice loot for elemental level guilds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been kinda following your magelo for a while now to check and see what kind of goodies come out of VP.  The near-naked picture of Arnold also makes it relatively easy to remember (kinda like how you'll never forget Brael's magelo background either...ha!).  =P<br />

As an officer of my guild, I sorta wish the revamped VP had been introduced earlier when my guild was growing in the elementals.  It seems like you can get some pretty nice stuff out of there, not to mention it's something fun, interesting, and different to break the tedium of elemental farming.  As much as I enjoy a good Fire clear, it takes the average guild a good 6-8 months nowadays to progress through this stage in the PoP expansion.  It's not that there is a lack of elemental gear to be found, but it is moreso to the extreme competition the goes along with it.  <br />
<br />
Now, with the introduction of GoD, SoE seemed to give non-elemental guilds access to elemental quality loot from the 3 major bosses in Ferubi - Zun`Muram Votal, Packmaster, and Weaponmaster.  Zun`Muram, while easy, has a fuckton of hitpoints for a non-elemental guild.  Weaponmaster isn't hard as long as you know what to expect.  I'd like to see any non-elemental guild even get Packmaster to 50%, rofl.  With the exception of Zun`Muram, the only redeeming model in all of GoD, Ferubi is a waste of fucking time once past the &quot;done flagging&quot; stage. <br />
<br />
Enjoy VP, cause I wish I could have.  With my guild working on Time/Ikkinz primarily now, I doubt I could ever convince anyone to do VP with what little spare time anyone has it seems.<br />
