<br />
I honestly don't either.  Anywhere I need to beat multiple mobs=to or higher than my level is a group situation.  Beating one mob my level or even a level higher is trivial to me.  In instances sure I'm expected to tank multiple mobs.  But in WoW the non-elite quests are 90% soloable for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sure other classes are gonna have an edge on us, especially at lower levels, but folks talk like every class but the Warrior can mow down 3 level 60 mobs when they are level 58 solo.  There are players who can do this , but they're gonna be at the edge of death when they finish.  They're gonna have to be very well geared and propely spec'd for it as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted, a lot of people seem to even forget how to solo in a group setting.  You'll see casters perfectly willing to tank a mob that no one else is on to the death without even trying to run (not that it'd help, but it'd at least slow down the inevitable).</div></div><hr />

Warrior soloing is not one of our finer aspects.  I find it generally annoying that any other class can pretty much blow through whatever we're doing in half the time, and typically has less downtime to boot. (Possible exception of priests and druids.)  A little more damage in this reguard would be nice, but then I'm protection specc'd so I really can't griep.<br />
<br />
No class however, is strengthened as much in a group setting as warriors are.  Their soloing ability helps, but war w/wo groups isn't even a worthwhile comparison in our effectiveness between the 2.</div></div><hr />

I did the Kodo Caravan quest in Desolace when it was orange to me.  I was 36 or 37 I think, and it spawned mobs that were 38-40.<br />
<br />
It took me a couple of tries to figure it out, but I did it.</div></div><hr />

So everybody else can solo easier than a warrior.  None of em can truely take the hits we can.  Its a trade off.  Sounds like they got it right to me frankly.<br />

I'm very happy they made their &quot;awesome&quot; changes.  The warrior in closed beta didnt sound like any kind of mmo warrior.  Sounded more like a first person shooter than a dice game.  I love all the resentment folks in general harbor for this change.  Like its their game and the people who design/code it are morons who hate the class (not picking on you in particular seveirn).  Blizzard went from being the percieved saviour of the mmo world to being the devil in one change.  Folks didnt even try it out, they just bitched.  Yea, I'm glad they're willing to do unpopular things that benifit the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
We did get a bit of a buff last time around. Even though they botched it somewhat with the client side bug with intercept, we still got buffed with the bloodrage &amp; intercept changes.  All the Mortal Strike little Conan's bleed like a stuck pig over the MS &quot;nerf&quot; (even though only a few weapons truely got nerfed) and barely acknowledged the buff we got.  Actually, I think MS got buffed in that round too by making it so if you missed a MS you only got charged 5 rage instead of the full 30.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, most of these lil pricks seem to be giving up and rerolling as a combat rogue or a paladin.  Just fine by me.</div></div><hr />

Its not just the solo part.  How many of you folks play on a pvp server?  Being able to handle multible mobs is a testament on how you handle being ganked.  When you are roaming the country side as your warrior, are there classes you do NOT go near, because you are sure it would entitle death?  For me the priest class and shamens seem to do the trick, I usually don't attack them first.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Its because they have multiple lives, have utility enough to handle me and whatever they are fighting, and woop my butt in good time.  I'm only lvl 50 so I haven't seen the end end game yet.  I ganked an undead priest in darkshire the other day and he didn't put up a fight.  When he did fight back, he landed 2 spells on me (instants mind you) that did close to 600 damage after the ticks.  Btw, he's lvl 34.<br />
<br />
If he was anywhere near my lvl, I would have been dead.  Warriors in pvp are pretty horrible and the lack of being able to solo multiple mobs just proves this.  We have only one life, and you had better reduce their life to zero in 10-20 secs or else its over.  The other classes have utilities and healing powers that grant them many lives.  For our lack of healing, we should definately be tougher or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, warriors get their asses handed to them 1v1 and if you play on a PvP server I suggest you hunt in packs, not solo.  In PvP I've found the warrior class most effective as a spoiler type, charging in and screwing up the other teams game plan, than some kind of walking nuclear bomb that folks thought they we're entilted to.  <br />
<br />
We die a lot in PvE.  We die alot in PvP.  We drink and we die and continue to drink.  Ahh, such is the way of the warrior.</div></div><hr />

Mind Control hurts when attacking a Priest...they're evil.  Everything about attacking a Shadow Spec hurts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with making warriors solo 2-3 mobs at once is balancing them in grouping and raid situations.<br />
<br />
If you make it so a mob does less than 1/6 of a warrior's HP's in the time it takes to kill said mob, then there has to be a drastic scaling in things that are meant to be raid or group targets, otherwise it wouldn't even be fun.  It would just be a straight mow down of everything in sight with a warrior and anyone who could cast a heal spell.<br />
<br />
Unless you've got any bright ideas on how you can change this simple fact without completely redesigning every instance and elite encounter in the game in a manner that you really don't want them to change them in, then I suggest you either decide to be a warrior, or decide to be a shaman or a paladin.</div></div><hr />
