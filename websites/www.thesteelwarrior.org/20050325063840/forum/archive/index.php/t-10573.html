<br />
In EQ2 there is a general feeling of smallness - the characters, trees, buildings, etc. Everything feels small and ya don't feel any connection with your character like in EQ1. <br />
<br />
Is WoW the same way as EQ2 as far as that goes? Or is it more like EQ1? I've looked at the screenshots n such, but ya can't tell much from screenshots. I've seen EQ2 screenshots, but they didn't make me realize the world would be tiny and i wouldn't feel like i am actually in it :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only played EQ2 for about 2 weeks in beta before it irritated me enough to stop, but WoW &quot;feels&quot; much more like EQ1 dd in the beginning.  It is very immersive, and feels much more &quot;alive&quot; than EQ2 did for me.  The look is a lot more cartoony, but overall the effect is MORE immersiveness, because you really get the impression of being part of the world.<br />
<br />
Does that answer the question?<br />

Of course I have been playing this char for 3 months versus over 4 years in EQ1.<br />
<br />
For me, EQ1 was my first MMO, and I developed that feeling of familiarity without having any expectations of doing so.  Coming in to WoW, its more like &quot;damn is this familiar yet? blech&quot;.  Sort of a feeling of impatience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Wow, with the &quot;seemless zoning&quot;, and HUGE zones, the world actually feel's a lil too big at times.  It can be overwhelming to try to figure out where to go next to lvl.  Now, as far as &quot;feeling connected&quot; with your character, I'm not sure as of yet.  Keep in mind, most of the EQ players who went to wow had long time EQ characters (years in the making) and that kind of time hasn't passed yet.  So I don't think that kind of connection can be had in either game as of yet.  <br />
<br />
Do I forsee that kind of connection?  Well... alot of that depend's on Blizzard.  If they vastly increase raid content (As I know the plan is to do that) and make the end game just a &quot;lil bit more&quot; progression oriented, then I can forsee it happening.  As of now the game is just too new, and as much content as there is, little has been done for raiding yet.  Sure there are a few zones, a few mobs to target but nothing like the amount of raid content that EQ has as of yet.   As soon as  battlegrounds is out, blizzard need's to get to work on an  expansion that is 100% about the lvl 45+ game as there is enough content for the lower lvl's to be able to lvl up numerous alt's and still have more to see on the way up for the next alt.<br />
<br />
SoE are expert's at keeping that next &quot;carrot&quot; out in front of you ... although the carrot is sometimes broken when they place it in front of you, it was still there.   If Blizzard can get a few expansion's out, with alot of high mid to end game content, then I will say yes to that.  If the expansions come too slow, and there is nothing but stagnation in the end game then my answer will be that no ... you cannot get that kind of connection.   <br />
<br />
Only time will tell.</div></div><hr />

Kunark was more than One year after (or was it just one), and from that point expensions shipped at around 6 month delay between them (might be more variable but I have much difficulty to date accurately some of them, especially Ykesha ;)).<br />
so don't expect lots of end game content before at least one year. It's a borning game/world, give them more time to compare current EQ1 with current WoW.<br />

<br />
Agreed.  EQ1 was not exactly a huge world when I started playing it (at release).<br />
<br />
I'm all about the rose colored glasses, and it's never like the first time, but I think it is unrealistic to expect the amount of content that came out of 5 years of EQ development to be in WoW 3 months after launch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only that, but we were all MMO noobs back then.  It took us a long time to figure out what class we wanted to play, and then actually get to 50 with all the various bullshit like anti kite rules and hybrid XP penalties being distributed to the group.<br />
<br />
Now, there's a lot less of that, at least for most of the people in this community.  We know what to do more or less, changing the world and the buttons doesn't alter that fact too much.<br />
<br />
I do feel a sense of relief tho that I wasn't in Closed Beta.  I have a feeling that the game would be a lot more dull right now waiting for an expansion.  As it stands, even if I hit 60 and can only do 3 instances, there's still so much of the game to do and see that I'm not concerned about it quite yet.  I'll give Blizzard time, but if they're smart, they've already got a team working on an expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been a hardcore Warcraft2 player. I still remember some of its missions I played many years ago (like having group of paladins and no gold yet winning the mission, etc). I avoid strategy games eversince I started EQ and my friends stopped playing Starcraft so I didn't play War3 too much. Only played the campaigns and played a lot of its &quot;Three Corridors&quot; mods in multiplayer. I played EQ on PvE servers since Kunark. So in WoW I started off in december with my human warrior on a PvP server, the feel when you enter Stormwind for the first time, explore the city, gryphon ride, it was all new and unique. Lots of fun things are there in the game. The content is nice. Quests are actually rewarding and easy. There's always something new, and when if my character reaches 60 (51 now), I'll roll another class and play it. <br />
<br />
I started an undead on another server just to see Undercity and its exactly the same as shown in War3's movies (where Arthas comes home). It made me interested in the lore of Warcraft and I'm replaying War3 to learn more of the story. Blizzard has done an amazing job building this game. They are known for quality. I'm sure they will uphold their tradition. When WoW and EQ2 were in beta there was a lot of talk as to which game will be better. A couple of my friends pre-ordered EQ2. I picked WoW as soon as I could without any second thoughts. They say they are now going to get WoW. ;)<br />
<br />
Ok, enough fanboi talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta realize that leveling is also faster in WoW, so there is a bit more pressure to get high end content out sooner.<br />
<br />
EQ1 had more time to pump out Kunark because of the fact that leveling was slower. So while Kunark may have come out a year after initial release, it can't be the same for WoW if they want to keep their subscribers.<br />
You can only level so many alts before the same shit get's boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, both EQ2 and WoW don't have much high-end content yet. And in both games people level very very fast. I'm 40 in EQ2 atm. People who were in beta, don't tradeskill at all, or simply with more time on their hands are 50 and have seen pretty much everything there is in the high end. And it doesn't seem like that's alot. I'm sure WoW doesn't have too much high end content either yet.<br />
<br />
It kinda sucks that they made leveling so fast in both games. Not only are they stuck with people grumbling about lack of high-end content, they're also going to have to release those expansions FAST. Maybe they make more money that way /shrug.<br />
<br />
But anyway, sorry, i went completely off topic.<br />
<br />
When i said EQ2 feels small, i didn't mean that the world doesn't have enough stuff to explore or kill. Raiding and high end content isn't what i'm looking for atm. What i am concerned is the general feel of the game. <br />
<br />
For example, EQ1 Qeynos was small in actual size compared to EQ2 Qeynos. However, EQ2 Qeynos feels tiny. Your character is small, trees are small, furniture is small...hell, the clouds are small. It feels in a way like Warcraft 3. The map could go on for miles, but a footman would still be tiny! And so would your castle! And when 6 footmen pummel 6 enemy orcs, it looks like a big mess, and ya sure don't feel like you're part of it. And who the hell felt connection with a footman in Warcraft 3, or a marine in Starcraft :P<br />
<br />
EQ1 Qeynos actually felt as if *you* were going through an actual city. <br />
<br />
Sorry, i'm not very good at explaining :(<br />
If anyone can understand what the heck i'm rambling about, which is probably not too easy...does WoW feel like EQ1 or EQ2 in this sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tinuvas</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems like immersiveness is what you're asking about, in which case I gave my opinions earlier in the thread.<br />
<br />
If that's NOT what you're asking about, I have no clue what it is :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel like there is a definately large aspect to WoW. There is plenty of room to explore, you can stand next to saplings or run past these massive giants you could drive a kodo through. The roads go everywhere and the scenery rolls by. Its a complete world, only thing missing is an artic tundra. You have lush rainforests, creepy regular forests, just plain normal forests. You have an african savannah, a grassy plain, you have a desert with rocky mesas spread out. There are oceans and islands to explore, deep underground caverns and cities. Mountanious regions with roaming mobs around every corner. Flowing rivers teeming with schools of fish and monsters to fight. The dungeons range from being straight up caves like splitpaw, to haunted manor houses and castles, to mines, to a creepy monastary taken over by some nasty humans, and there are probably other types too but I havent gotten to them yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
There is a ton of variety in a vast and full world, and we havent even begun to see all the potential areas yet. There is still the entire continent of northrend, (the velious of WoW) there is the ruins of the PLANET draenor, the emerald dream, and who knows what else that can be added on. There are zones in the game right now that you cant get at yet because they havent implemented it yet. You can see it on the map as a large unexplored portion of a continent you have crossed a dozen times or more. There is just so much potential to this game to back up the crazy content already in it. Yes, the leveling is MUCH faster than eq, but thats all to the good! You get that faster leveling because you can do a crapload of quests that give you large rewards of exp and you get even more exp while doing those quests! Every zone has a storyline in it, wether its fighting off the ogre renegades, repelling the centaurs or quillboars, infiltrating the Searing Blade headquarters to find out what their plans are, or just clearing out troublesome nonintelligent animals that keep raiding your bases food supply! lol My only real complaint is a lack of a MAIN storyline. I was so happy when Thrall gave me a quest to track down the seraing blade cultists. I thought, FINALLY! Now the real story can begin! But after finishing an instance dungeon, the first instanced dungeon, there was nothing else to do. That was 25 levels ago and I havent gotten anything new regarding them beyond some small quest arc in another zone. Aside from that, I think the game is excellent. I continue to have fun, even though I can no longer bring myself to pull the old fashoined 24 hour play sessions like I did when I started eq lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does seem like the WoW world and quests had more work put into them. In EQ2 i often notice things that seem like they didn't have much work put into them or weren't well thought through. <br />
<br />
However...that is still not the concern i had. But i think i figured it out! We were playing around in feerrott today, and i was thinking...hmm...in first person, looking up at a tree right next to me...seems pretty big. The big evil looking thing biting my arse look pretty big. The jungle type plants in front of me seem decent sized. So what the hell am i complaining about?<br />
<br />
But then, the same mobs and trees and people looked TINY when i was 10 meters away from them. I zoomed all the way out in 3rd person, and me and the mob and the stuff around be instantly became tiny. And the zoom doesn't go far in this game. So i think the problem may be distances changes the size far too much. Something 10 meters away in EQ2 looks as if it's a loooong ways away. Things are only a decent size close up, and with the fast run speed, fast zooming, and drastic changes in distance on objects far away...you can see how stuff can seem 'small'.<br />
<br />
Is it this way in WoW too?<br />
<br />
(PS: i am definetely *not* talking about how big/small the world itself is and how much stuff there is do explore, but i do appreciate the info :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW doesn't feel small to me.  Just go to Ironforge or Black Rock Mountain and you will feel puny and the world will feel huge.  There are some great sites you can get from on top of mountains and hills.  And fighting giants and larger monsters your tiny in comparison to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference is PvP on normal/RP servers.  Blizzard did an outstanding job on the PvP system.  Its amazing to me how much PvP happens on normal servers, the zone alarm stuff, NPCs being killable..  I really missed that in eq2, when I saw that the Qeynos guards simply &quot;knock out&quot; a Freeport citizen (auto zone them out of the city) I was completely discusted.  Lame.<br />
<br />
On WoW, even though I am low level, I buff the NPCs being attacked by Alliance scum, I help in the fight, its truly immersive, I am horde and I defend my cities.  Oh and they show blood *gasp*.  Never zoning, umm hello?  Immersive?  uhh ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me the biggest change in play is, that I used to play eq1 through the eyes of my gnomes. In WoW I normally use the shoulderview. Thats a real other form of playing and feeling. <br />
<br />
Maybe a part of your tiny view is a part of this change.</div></div><hr />

Sounds to me like you are talking about the aspect ratio that the game uses. If so there may be a distributed hack out to change that sort of thing. Not sure though. Sometime when Im bored Ill look for one.</div></div><hr />
