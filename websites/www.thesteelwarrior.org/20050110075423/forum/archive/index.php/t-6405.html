Used to be ya just kill all the turkey-bees twice and he'd spawn targetable.</div></div><hr />

Neffekin is the forest giant lord.  It's been several months since we tried Neffekin, but he did not become targetable after killing all other forest giants and forest giant minibosses at that time.</div></div><hr />

Btw aren't there like 500000 better uses of time than that dude?<br />
<br />
(Like trying to get all 6 PoJ trials and kill the 7th hammer with all level 49 characters?)<br />
<br />
Sorta fun if bored, I suppose...  :p <br />

<br />
RvR is tragic: lots of work for one frickin drop.  Their loot table isn't bad, but they only drop ONE item from it.... spend an hour gettin wasted by the sand giant lord, only to have him drop a 12/18 no proc scimitar with 50 mana and 0 hps... ARGH.</div></div><hr />

Above are the reasons why these giants are worth doing... there not that hard, just clear  a fort - good way to get your guildies their BoT access, good way for easy loot saying as they are almost always up.  24 hour respawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those loot screenshots are outdated.  Bulwark of Storms, for example, has been 100 hp/100 mana for the past year.  I think the loot was upgraded across the board.<br />
<br />
No, the risk/reward is not worthwhile if you have access to named mobs in higher POP zones (these guys are more difficult than SolRo minis, for example).  But for a guild that can't enter SolRo or elementals, these giants are probably the next best thing to BOT towers.<br />
<br />
They are also very good training grounds for later flag encounters like Mith Marr and RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of their stuff is pretty decent, like that Idol of the Tempest Storm.  Some of it, however, is crap, especially since they only drop one thing.  If they dropped two, then they may be a viable alternative raid target for some.  <br />
<br />
Are they harder than BoT lords?  Umm, yah... just a bit.  =)  Expect 550 to 650dps to the MT plus about 100-200dps in Rampage damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look if you out of raid targets, be my guest...Just not sure with something with AOW difficulty should drop ONE item that is sub-par to AoW loot.<br />
<br />
honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they are harder then AoW by my books, but then again you can throw charmed dps on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I agree completely there.  They should each drop 2 items, AND a rune (which they don't), and none of their loot should have less than 100 hp/mana.<br />
<br />
But still... for a guild that can kill AOW but has not flagged up for Tactics or beyond, there isn't much in the way of POP minibosses available to them, beyond BOT towers and these guys.<br />
<br />
It's easy to forget what life was like before Drunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back before the planes were opened, limiting the loot tables on these guys at least made sense.  You worked to get your flags, you got mobs available to you with much, much greater RvR.  <br />
<br />
However, now that any jackass can waltz into BoT and claim sanctuary, the shitty loot tables on the PoS Lords really doesn't make any sense anymore.  You put Lord Niffeken up against Eindride and Niffeken, however you spell his name, will splatter him in a matter of seconds without blinking an eye.  I mean, they're no joke.  They all quad for 1400s and rampage.  While still not elemental difficulty (You could argue that as some Air Avatars don't even put out Vindi dps...), they'll put any BoT Tower Lord (Eindride, Brynju, Kunabyr, and Auliffe) to shame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neffiken would be summoned at the very bottom of the zone and somehow agro Agnarr.  At that point, Agnarr and his Mafia crew of a doze quad 1k hitting elemental &quot;gangsters&quot; would warp to the bottom as well, leaving no choice for Neffiken to bend over and give it up.<br />
<br />
Neffiken then petitions for a week and, as you all know, nothing ever happens.   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
So start working on advancement, rather than pissing around in pathetic tier one zones.  Yeah, it's training, but you get plenty of training on your fights up to the harder ones.<br />
<br />
If you can't enter SolRo or elementals, but you can kill these giants, you need to wake the hell up an get to Solro.  These guys, with their adds, and weird effects, are just as hard (if not harder) than most lower tier gods, and the decent  loot that they drop once in a while is nowhere near as good as the rewards will be if you actually put forth a little effort and get somewhere useful.</div></div><hr />
