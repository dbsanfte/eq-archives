<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pagobak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, Im a rather new warrior to everquest and i was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this question that has been bugging me for awhile. I was in a few groups were the person who was pulling had a very catching INC message, Were the name of the mob seemed to be highlighted, Kinda like when you link a weapon or piece of gear, Was just wondering if anyone could tell me how to do it,  Id like to have it so my group clearly see's what to assist me on or what im bringing back to camp....Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In chat &quot;%t&quot; will reflect the name of a mob sooo for example:<br />
<br />
1)&quot; /g Be ready &lt;&lt;&lt; %t &gt;&gt;&gt; is incoming!<br />
<br />
2)&quot; /rs SLAY  &lt;&lt;&lt; %t &gt;&gt;&gt;!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Can get inventive and combine other other placeholders for race etc. when your goofing around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pagobak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah i know about the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;%T&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but these guys had the name of the target in Bold, Pink lettering, Not just the plain black. It was much more eye catching. And the people iv talked to told me to come to this site. But thanks for the sugestion.</div></div><hr />

See Dima's post on the Sekrits!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pagobak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Awsome! Thanks alot Ninja. Hope i can get it to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">mr.ninja is a very evil man :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">THat said, keep the raid part of your inc message SIMPLE and CLEAR. With the amount of spam flying in chat, you want brackets and the name and the command.. (IE kill) and that is about it.<br />
<br />
My rogues Inc message is &quot;Incoming %t! What is the rogue doing pulling??!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anakun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">See Dima's post on the Sekrits!<br />
 Can you link this thread please? I am doing search now but can not locate it. thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">mr.ninja is a very evil man :(<br />
<br />
I didn't post them!<br />
<br />
Some dude tried to claim them on a website, so TSW crew had to clean up and say it was us who made it. <br />
<br />
(Well, not me, per se. I didn't think of it.)</div></div><hr />

edit: forgot to say if your on Xev I'm probably the one who sent you here:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd second the thought that incoming messages should be short &amp; clear. A cute incoming message is often pretty old the 15th time you see it. And you might see it 60 to 200 more times before the night is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mine is Toe Tagging &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; %T &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Assist ****REKCUFREHTOM EID *****</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I try to use a funny message for group play but in raids it is simply<br />
<br />
INC &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;%T&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
KILL &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;%t&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOW!<br />
<br />
in groups I use<br />
<br />
Save the Women and Rangers %T Incoming!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KronnikBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My hotkey is short and to the point:<br />
<br />
/g INCOMING %t ! Stand ready.<br />
/pause 10<br />
/g ASSIST me with %t NOW!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I eventually got lazy and unoriginal and just typed &quot;inc %T&quot;, often followed by &quot;lots&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've gotten dispelled by people in my groups for my message =( <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot; Incoming  %T,  looks pretty weak, must be a ranger. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And from time to time I replace 'a ranger' with peoples name, or my own fake link</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I set up an incoming message using the Sekrit Code that's linked in post 10 of this thread. The pink highlight of the mob's name was really useful doing PoJ trials last night!<br />
<br />
Since I'm a true noob, I experimented with cute incoming messages for a while (thank gawd I abandoned them by about level 25). <br />
<br />
I still have one I trot out if things are going slow:<br />
<br />
/g Warrior Pulling! INC &gt;&gt;&gt; all of them &lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
/g Let's kill %T first, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I usually have the cute inc message. %t is about to die by the hands of the The Baby Tank, or *groupmember* can't handle it on their own, The Baby Tank is here to assist.<br />
<br />
<br />
but after a while even I get annoyed with it. It's fun to kinda break the ice in group when you're first getting all togther, but after that its INC &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;~~~~%T~~~~~&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the assist hotkey is just /assist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">arf arf<br />
<br />
*yada yada %T blah blah*, and then *&gt;&gt;&gt;%T&lt;&lt;&lt;* (with a side of Sekrits sauce).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Okay you all can call me a tard if you want but I can't seem to find the right .INI file on my PC. All of the files I looked at are old and don't match up to what my toon currently has set for buttons. Hell they even have stuff from my old guild in there. Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
I run win 98 btw<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and I would have posted in the Sekrets thread but since it is in the library I can't post there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When I'm in an adventure, it's usually:<br />
<br />
/g inc %t....and %t2, and %t3, let's not forget %t4 too.<br />
/wait 10<br />
/g ADDS, BLAME THE MONK!<br />
<br />
But when I'm doing actual XP, it's usually a simple inc message or a sekrits link if I feel like it.<br />
<br />
WRU augmentation sekrit =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Darn it Ninja I thought your post was an answer to my dillema.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Adzar, I recommend running a search from the topmost Sony directory for files named *.ini. They may have moved them to a directory you don't expect them to be hiding in?<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion for things I try when I lose dll's at work.</div></div><hr />
