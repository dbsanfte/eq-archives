<br />
I had edit just 3 hours ago, now i dont, why? because i pissed off a cry baby paladin in the warrior armory, so the little bitch used the find all posts ability and 1 starred all my posts, the basic effect is by doing this ( and probibly being so vindictive to log in his other accounts ) he has basically fucked me over for not pandering to his sorry ass :/<br />
<br />
The sony boards are ass.<br />

Hey frod, hate to bug you but did you apply as class rep yet? you would have my support :P</div></div><hr />

People star for disliking or disagreeing with you regardless of how informative or well written the thread is. They really need a limit on how many 1 stars a person can give another in a given time frame. It's just stupid.</div></div><hr />

Everquestlive has way too many assclowns that post there to have posters rating each other anyway. :p</div></div><hr />

Goddamn you're juvenille sometimes. And you wonder why people do this kinda shit to you.  Maturity = Acting your age and not your urge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey let me vent damnit!<br />
<br />
partha has 400 posts and is still rated as &quot;newbie&quot; which is a step under the bull i am ranked as now, yet there are people with 40 posts that kiss everyones ass and have an edit key before partha, that shows how ass up this system is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol all these &quot;rep&quot; stars on boards are such a waste of time and frankly who gives a rats ass. if your  a good and informative poster, then people will respect you for that, regardless of how many bad marks you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but it is like having a fishing hok in your eyelid when you cant edit &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is there isnt a limit of how long a post can be voted on, so someone who sees you say &quot;If you have your spell book, and all the warrior abilitys you would be playing in god mode, this game isnt about god mode&quot; could go back and rate all your old posts, people are not mature enough to keep it to the post and subject at hand.<br />
<br />
hell, the little bitch went back and 1 starred a congrats posted to someone who made 65 3 months ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Posted this on the EQ live boards.<br />
<br />
Actually, I find the one starring hilarious anymore. As probably the newbie with the most posts on the board by a long shot, I've accepted the fact that I'll never see the edit button, so I just type it right the first time. I know who's doing it, and I find it simultaneously sad AND funny that they're so irritated with me that I could probably post Happy Birthday greetings and get a one star. <br />
<br />
 Yes, and they're easy for the casual board lurker to spot, as well. Makes for a fun game.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather my fellow TSWs be well spoken and grammaticly correct at the least, even while pissing people off. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, thanks man :P<br />
<br />
I bumped up the rating on a few of partha's post that were getting unfairly raped, now i am locked from that to :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the system itself is retarded, might as well make the most of it, eh? I star people because it's just idiotic to not have an edit button because some nerd decided to be cute. An edit button is just common decency and should not be an award for patting other people on the back and stating the staus quo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
except here a lower rating would give us edit priveledges :)<br />
<br />
... which i would no doubt get after my tirade on the hp thread ... yet i wouldnt edit because im too lazy to figure out how. heck im too lazy to figure out how to work the quote thing. and dont tell me how. im too dumb to understand what you are telling me ok?<br />
<br />
and gerrick link us the board so that volunteers from here can 5star all your posts and get your edit back.<br />
<br />
not like you deserve it or anything :)<br />
<br />
but id still 5star you :)</div></div><hr />

Stupid system, and childish behavior on the troll's part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is correct. <br />
<br />
On a side note, having 2 accounts means the worse rating you can have is a 2 star. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i taged a few 5's on ya deamonwynd as well as parth and gerick and frod.<br />
