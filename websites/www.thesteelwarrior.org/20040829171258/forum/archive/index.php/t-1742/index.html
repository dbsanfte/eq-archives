<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How about making Berserk more meaningful? Besides a STR boost and a better chance to land crippling blows, it should do more. <br />
<br />
Here's the proposal: <br />
<br />
[] Form of Implimentation: AA Skill with three levels<br />
<br />
[] Name: &quot;Taunt of the Berserker&quot;<br />
<br />
[] Conditions for Activation: Can ONLY be activated when the warrior is &quot;Berserk&quot; (below 40% health) and the skill refresh time has elapsed. Activated by hitting the &quot;Taunt of the Berserker&quot; hotkey which refreshes at the same rate as the regular Taunt hotkey and works as a regular tuant whe a warrior is NOT berserk.<br />
<br />
[] Prerequisites: This should be a PoP or Class ability. <br />
<br />
[] Effect level 1: add 250 hate to warrior's hate level per successful taunt while Berserk<br />
[] Effect level 2: add 500 hate to warrior's hate level per successful taunt while Berserk<br />
[] Effect level 3: add 800 hate to warrior's hate level per successful taunt while Berserk<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Comments<br />
<br />
1. It updates the now out-dated and nearly meaningless &quot;Berserk&quot; skill. <br />
<br />
2. It addresses the XP warrior's shortcomings vs. knights. It would be meaningful in EXP groups where a warrior can be kept berserk for longer -- improving a warrior's balance vs. knights in XP group settings. <br />
<br />
3. It is meaningful in raid settings but the difficulty of using it rises in proportion to the DPS of the adversary. That is, it scales with encounters. <br />
<br />
4. It comes with RISK and TRADEOFF: To use this skill, a warrior will need to make a judgement call about the use of taunt. If a warrior does a poor job of timing his hitpoint fluctuations or if healers are overzealous, he ends up with a regular old taunt and may have just created an issue if someone steals aggro right after his regular old taunt. People will get eaten for 6 seconds. If he manages to get a tuant off at below 40% health, he gets a nice hate bonus. <br />
<br />
5. It increases interaction between classes on a raid. In order to use this skill MORE, heal rotations would need to be designed with more care on some mobs so that the warrior isn't simply fluctuating between 90% and 100% health. On other mobs (Reparm, for instance) it'll simply be a matter of luck. Besides the repercussions for clerics, it'll also add value to the AETaunt skill, making &quot;Top of the List +1 hate&quot; a bit more meaningful. <br />
<br />
6. It should be tied to AA because 800 hate is a number of entirely different scale when applied to a level 35 warrior vs. a level 60 warrior.<br />
<br />
7. It's a boon for everyone who creates aggro on a raid. It's not JUST a boost to warriors, it's a boost for everyone who relies on a warrior to get and hold aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This proposal is a non-starter. Anything that can only be triggered when a warrior reaches berserk mode (which is actually like 30-35%) is going nowhere. I'm either dead or not berserk in a matter of a very few seconds. Even in exp groups, no one keeps a warrior in berserk mode. A 50% shot to add 200 hate that can only be triggered while I'm in berserk mode? Hard to see warriors getting excited about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Questions: <br />
<br />
(1) What's to lose? Berserk sucks now. Would an upgrade hurt it?<br />
<br />
(2) I can keep a warrior in berserk for 30 seconds at a time as primary healer in PoV groups ... it's not difficult. Of course, now that I do 99% of my xp in fire it's not feasible for me to do this, but with defensive maxxed any warrior is an easy heal on fire XP mobs. <br />
<br />
(3) I know everyone's gunning for the big idea that will fix the class once and for all, but if it were that easy I think we'd have seen some movement already. The game is complex and huge changes are likely to require weeks of debate by the design team, tons of technical changes, and so on. As someone who has to prioritize development requests on software projects, I know that the smaller projects that tweak issues with existing systems are often more attractive prospects for development than hastily devised and far-reaching changes. <br />
<br />
IN other words, I think it's important to be realistic about requests and win one battle at a time. <br />
<br />
Druids have been remarkably effective whiners, and I think it's mostly because they concentrate on asking for one small change at a time. Bigger heals. Bigger nukes. <br />
<br />
Anyways, the process that Raaj has put together in this forum is the right way to go. Ultimately I think some great ideas will be selected and presented in an organized fashion and that will greatly increase the likelihood that SOMETHING will get done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've not really checked the idea thoroughly but I share tugoroks skeptiscism. Plus the idea of requiring more AA's to get something which should be available to anyone as a basic class ability will always suck as a balancing method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also share the skepticism of the other two respondants. <br />
<br />
I know that making a change to our class to help bring us inline with the hybrids will have to be minimal to not throw the game even further out of balance, but to make it require AA's to get?<br />
<br />
Currently hybrids can aggro lock mobs with little or no effort. Most exp groups chose them over us for that very reason. Your proposal would require that healers walk the fine line of keeping the tank alive only to get an increase in taunt. Seems like alot to ask of a cleric if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Also, wouldn't low health aggro be kicking in at 30% anyways?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am not one who looks for a knight over a warrior currently.  If I started grouping with warriors who expected me to keep them berserk against PoP mobs that would change very quickly.  I honestly think this would be a BAD thing for the warrior class.<br />
<br />
This wouldn't help you with initial agro at all because any cleric who allowed an unslowed PoP mob into camp with a under half health tank is asking to die really quickly from heal agro.  It might help with agro by the end of a fight but is that when you have a problem? <br />
<br />
First thing I would do if a warrior told me I had to keep him berserk is start looking for a replacement cleric for the group and then forever after get a knight tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also, wouldn't low health aggro be kicking in at 30% anyways?<br />
<br />
<br />
LHA is a temporary aggro lock. It creates no permanent residual hate. In fact, healing someone in LHA may actually create more hate than a heal that lands on someone who is NOT in LHA range. <br />

This wouldn't help you with initial agro at all because any cleric who allowed an unslowed PoP mob into camp with a under half health tank is asking to die really quickly from heal agro. <br />

Only idiots play like this. =) If that tank were elixired before he had the mob's attention, however, it wouldn't be a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What's to lose? Nothing I guess, aside from the time which could be spent considering ideas that are actually useful. The idea that warriors could be kept dancing in berserk mode makes me wonder if you actually ever even group with warriors. This is like those &quot;purple club&quot; clerics with a kind of faux min-maxing that sounds good on paper, but is worse than useless in practice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Supernal Elixir  <br />
1:  Increase Hitpoints v2 by 500 per tick <br />
Mana: 400 (same as Complete Heal)<br />
Duration: 4 ticks (with AA can be 5 or 6 ticks)<br />
<br />
Supernal Elixir is great for making sure you have time to CH.  It is not good enough to rely on for keeping a tank alive that starts a fight at 30-40% health because he wants to be berserk.  <br />
<br />
I'm not quite sure what you meant when you said &quot;play like this&quot; but the point of my post was that very few clerics are going to agree to leaving a tank under half health for the next pull.  It will work but it won't be easy and honestly I'm not willing to work that hard.  Why play that game when a knight can tank?  The point was that right NOW I don't look for a knight over a warrior for xp groups.  I like warriors.  But the first time I heard I had to keep him berserk would change that completely.</div></div><hr />

I also agree that doing this is ridiculous. It's stupid and neglectful. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is so then how does your idea fit into the equation?  I just don't see the benefit of such a skill at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If this is so then how does your idea fit into the equation? <br />
<br />
Very simple. It's more taunt. Most of the suggestions have to do with taunt. This is one way to give warriors MORE of it but also impose trade-offs that will be attractive to designers from a balance perspective. <br />
<br />
I believe that this would be a very sizable amount of added taunt. <br />
<br />
AT the low end, in your average xp-group mob in PoV, a warrior's going into berserk about one or twice a minute. With the right AAs and good timing, he's going to be able to add the equivalent of one extra EB proc per minute on average, a significant boost to the aggro of the average non-EP warrior. <br />
<br />
At the high-end XP group setting in a camp in PoEarth of PoFire, warriors hit berserk more often and therefore have more chances to add an extra 750 hate. He needs it because his xp group partners are also much more capable of dishing out damage. <br />
<br />
In raid settings, the new skill scales with the difficulty of the encounter and adds value to the skilled warrior who uses taunt judiciously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Utterly stupid idea. <br />
<br />
Why should taunt only work well when berserk? I cant imagine any warrior that want to play in perma berserk mode during exp groups, that would be too stressful, and it would be hell for the cleric as well. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that with this idea you cannot use the single most effective heal for a warrior(CH) and would be forced into wasting mana in an ineffective healing pattern using SE's and SR's. <br />
<br />
Typically by the time I am in berzerk mode is the time I least need extra taunt, because by then agro is firmly on me.<br />
<br />
It is very obvious this suggestion is made by a non-warrior (troll?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On reflection, the minute the mob pongs off you before you reached berserk you're back at square one cause without the mob knocking off your hp's you can't use it for aggro - doesn't really address the problem i'm afraid -  far too situational.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On reflection, the minute the mob pongs off you before you reached berserk you're back at square one cause without the mob knocking off your hp's you can't use it for aggro <br />
<br />
Exactly the point of the trade-off. It's a regular taunt if a mob ain't beating on you. It's a super taunt if a mob is actively beating on you. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that with this idea you cannot use the single most effective heal for a warrior(CH) <br />
<br />
Really? I play a cleric now and then too and I can use CH so that every heal rescues a warrior from berserk. It's a simple matter of timing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Really? I play a cleric now and then too and I can use CH so that every heal rescues a warrior from berserk. It's a simple matter of timing. <br />
<br />
The point is if you CH the warrior he will cease to be in berzerk mode and thus your silly berserker taunt idea wont help him on the next incoming mob which is where he would need the taunt in the first place(at initial engagement).. <br />
<br />
Thus your idea does nothing for any standard warrior/cleric group, UNLESS the group wishes to switch to a less efficient form of healing(SEs with SRs sprinkled in) while trying to keep the warrior in berserk mode(30ish%).<br />
<br />
Not to mention the loss in efficiency when the inevitable death occurs because of a resisted slow/bad pull, which will give the maintank a much higher fatality rate when his/her hp at initial engagement is 30ish% instead of 80%+<br />
<br />
Understand now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This idea is not even worth discussing. Stupidity of implementation is not a basis for a &quot;trade-off&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aamean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, after a cheal lands you can still be in berserker mode.<br />
There isn't much of a risk factor here, with decent buffs I can be chealed at 20% and still live (Although no clerics do that - usually at about 60, even though they can heal much earlier~) in many of the pop zones (no, not tier 1 zones im talking about). After that cheal I am still often berserk. You wouldn't even really have to keep someone at berserker mode, a cheal is almost enough time for 2 taunts. 2 800 hate taunts = damn that's a lot of hate yo~<br />
oh yeah and I don't think this idea would work well~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It might help the lesser equipped folks who cannot maintain aggro i'll give you that, but the time you most need push button hate is at the start of a fight to offset slow aggro or when the mob turns from you and is thus NOT hitting you, simple really :)</div></div><hr />

Heh. Intelligent discussion at its best. :)</div></div><hr />
