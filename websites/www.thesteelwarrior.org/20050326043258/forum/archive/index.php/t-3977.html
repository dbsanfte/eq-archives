<br />
If you haven't done this event, you really should try it.<br />
<br />
99% of people havent even heard about it, and there is enough wiggle room even when you read the spoilers that you will need to iron your strat out.<br />
<br />
Try it, you will like it. especially good if you need more hps in the back slot. All together, takes max of 2 hours to complete and a really fun encounter.<br />
<br />
Yah, I failed, next time = win though hehe.<br />

If you're lucky, all your groups may even start in the same event like they're supposed to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then just kite the mounted dudes while you kill mujaki!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like a blast :).</div></div><hr />

In that event, do you just holler &quot;Blue Warrior is about to die!&quot; (or whatever you personally holler when Mark Spitz hits a fan) and camp/quit the event, or is there way to regroup?</div></div><hr />

It would always port the groups to different ones.  Even the head GM came out and said it's Perma Broken /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It works fine, it just gets in a permanent screwed up cycle.<br />
<br />
Once less than 24 people zone in at the same time, you will always get an uneven number of groups able to complete it.<br />
<br />
You have to set in a group to reset the thingy, then have them gate out and rejoin the raid at Garg city.<br />

Mujaki was there, but the mobs never popped out of the gravestones.  We petitioned it, a GM got back to me 8 hours later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">P.S. they actually fixed this on November 5th. You can have 4 of these running at a time, so Go nuts.<br />
<br />
Did it last night :) Brought 24 this time. Just spanked the whole thing. No deaths.<br />
<br />
Held agro on Mujaki the entire time.<br />
<br />
We parked one group at each grave with a wanderer group.<br />
<br />
The pops went:<br />
<br />
1-1-1<br />
1-1-1<br />
1-1-1<br />
2-2-2<br />
2-2-2<br />
2-2-2<br />
2-2-2<br />
1-1-1<br />
<br />
No problems at all, we pulled with Tash, Slowed and Malo'd on inc, and I popped AE taunt to save the Enchanter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varf</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how many people it takes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do it easily with 18 people if you bring level 65's.<br />
<br />
You could conceivably do it with around 9 if you have Plane of Time/EP level people.<br />
<br />
Two tanks and a shaman on each grave.<br />
<br />
Or tank, Shaman, Cleric on each grave might be a little better.<br />
<br />
They do have a fair number of hit points though, and you have to deal with some little adds at the beginning.<br />
<br />
So I would say 18 is the right number if all 65.<br />
<br />
24 if you want to be super safe.<br />
<br />
9 if you want to set a record of some sort :p<br />
