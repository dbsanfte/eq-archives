<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all  :) <br />
<br />
Tried doing a few searches before but couldnt find anything, so Im gonna ask.<br />
<br />
I need some info about LDoN raids.<br />
<br />
What is the minimun amount of groups for them?<br />
Is the lvl of the mobs and raid adjustable just like the normal adventures?<br />
What kind of missions can I expect to get for the raid?<br />
What is the general lvl (as in difficulty) of these raids? What kind of guild are they made for? Would you say a family guild (we are mostly all 65 and Im kind of the MT, 8k+ buffed) can make a succesful raid?<br />
<br />
Im asking this because the idea of a on-demand instanced raid will help us to sharpen our assembly times (and its kinda faster I guess), and make us a bit more solid. I thought that we could give it a try to these raids to have an option in case our targets have been already taken or something like that comes up.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've never done one myself, but when they entered the game i think the easier type of raid was considered &quot;elemental planes level&quot; and the harder &quot;time level&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I've heard, they're pretty merciless.  Most high-end guilds sat around after farming time instead of raiding LDoN.  Very, very unforgiving.  If you screw up, it takes a couple of days before you get another shot at it.  3 hours to clear trash and then you get a chance at working out a strategy, only to wipe, reformulate your plan and just *hope* that people are around a few days later to try it again.  An EP guild doing the easy (or is it normal) setting got crushed.  Sounds like fun~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are said to be 3 levels of L65ish raids.  The first is VT difficulty, the 2nd is elemental, and the 3rd is Time.  Most guilds never found the raids worth it though.<br />
<br />
You notice Sony makes the instanced content very unforgiving now?  That seems to be their answer to keep successes down.  You don't have to fight for content with anyone, but the content you get is a pain in the butt.  Or maybe I'm just bitter.  I'm still trying to get through the first damn sewers trial in GoD.  I had a great group last night.  We fought for close to 2 hours, nearly flawlessly.  Then our puller made one bad pull, training 3-4 mobs into us in one big, nasty pack.  The cleric went down instantly.  We wiped soon after that, and our night was over.  Most of the zone behind us had respawned and no one felt like fighting for 90 minutes or so to get back to where we were.  GoD sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">pacify, invis, and itu are your friends.  we usually kill a few in the big room to get warmed up and then invis.  pacify the cubes/ghosts and keep going through the 2nd room.  Kill the roamer in the next hallway.  pacify the stuff that's NOT undead in the third room and then go to the Asha-whatever npc.  Kill the roaming ghost, hail the npc, re-pacify/itu into the next hall.  one static in the hall and one roamer, can be either a ghost or golem for either one.  pacify/invis/itu to the bottom and kill roamer.  Do the same thing to the room before you drop down into the water.  From there, invis can take you all the way to the stonemite room.  Just watch for roaming cubes in the room before the hallway that leads to the stonemite room.  Grats LDoN raid derailment, sorry : /</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Back to the original subject line ---<br />
<br />
The LDoN raids sound brutal. What sorts of rewards are at the end of them? Is there a higher drop rate of augments along the way?<br />
<br />
I ask because my guild plus one of our allies is getting close enough in level to try one sometime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klumhru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, imho there are just two reasons anyone would want to do LDoN raids. Both reasons are shielding augs. There is a shielding 1 aug in elemental (ruj?) raid and a shielding 2 aug in time (nro?) raid. At this time the tipt/vxed augs are better than the rest of the augs from ele ldon raids, and the ikkinz augs beat the time level ldon augs. And the gear is not worth going there for. You're better served just farming your respective planes or freeing guild up to farm xp. That's my opinion though, none other is mine to offer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe your mistaken on both counts. I'm pretty sure there are NO shielding augs outside of Time raids, and further, the only one that I know of for sure is the 3% shielding aug from the Miragul time raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klumhru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wasn't so sure on the locations sorry, valdoon aug is the shielding 2 I was talking about http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68019<br />
<br />
And from Mira (Trelsa McKindle):<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68028 the 3%<br />
<br />
Pretty sure there is a 1% also from normal diff, but not 100% sure on that one. Can't search on alla since my account is expired hrrm.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LDoN raids are extremely painful for folks.  My guild has tried 2 so far.  We understood that we were underequipped but then again, we've been able to do alot of what the naysayer's say you can't do w/o x, y or z.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on the raids we've done, we figured out we needed basically 6 self sufficient groups that are able to handle a hard ldon or better.  Since we don't have that capability we were not able to finish it. However, we did do much better on the second attempt.  We did run into problems when we pulled the named and got 11 of his buddies that were attached to him.  <br />
<br />
The RvR is not that great even for the folks it was designed for : elemental/VT/Time guilds.  A few of our guilds on the server attempted them and then headed back to POP until GoD came out.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, these are too hard for the casual types that would actually do them and not worth the effort for those that they are set up for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What makes you think you need 6 self sufficient groups? At the most you need to be able to split up 3 ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for all the replies! :D<br />
<br />
I guess we wont be trying them anytime soon by the sounds of it :(<br />
<br />
Too bad... the idea of an instanced raid was pretty tempting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After we had issues with the Capt and his 11 buddies, a few of us checked with friends in more &quot;uber&quot; guilds that had attempted some of the raids and their advice was to shoot for 6 self sufficient groups.  One thing to point out is when we last attempted this we had 1 ench and 2 bards for CC so our raid makeup was part of the factor for this assumption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tanise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">if you can form up 6 self sufficient groups you'd be better off farming tipt.<br />
<br />
Ldon raids were stupid from the word go. Excellent chance to give smaller and more casual guilds a chance to raid but sony once again failed.</div></div><hr />
