Holy crap.  I don't think anyone would have guessed when they bought their first EQ box that it would be possible to walk away from the game with that kind of cash in the bank.</div></div><hr />

If you buy a $9000 fishing boat it can be used as an investment. <br />
buying $9000 on intangible Items like  Platnium Pieces ?<br />

I am somewhat hypocritical(sp) though  I did think about buying a cleric account from an ex guildie once ( bad me ) but my wife drop kicked me in the head for thinking about it and that was that.<br />

Its just not normal for a huge corporation like Sony to look the other way when hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stuff they make is being sold by third parties and they are not getting a cut.  Then again, perhaps IGE is Sony but what do I know...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I am to believe they sold in the order of 10 million dollors..the first question I would ask is...is that Hong Kong Dollors?<br />
<br />
It says that the customer support is opperated out of Hong Kong. (ie just accross the boarder in Shenzhen.) Hong Kong to US dollors is in the order of 10 to 1. ie 10 million HK$ = 1million USD.<br />
<br />
That is a number I could believe..but still it is massive ammounts of cash. <br />
<br />
That guy who estimates there is an annual turnover of 400 million USD per year in virtual goods in all MMORPGs.....he is talking out his @$$.<br />
<br />
if the above is true, then wow...Yantis did a nice sell up just before WOW starts to hit the shelves.<br />

<br />
SOE may not be directly making money in this regard, but certainly more people are playing EQ, as opposed to those who have retired, because of IGE/Yantis. Also, as others have said, SoE may be instituting its own similar market.</div></div><hr />

Using the 100k pp for 99 bucks as the most popular (I just plucked that out of thin air).<br />
<br />
It would take about 1 thousand customers per server over a year to generate 4.8 Million in cash.<br />

After all those sleepless nights and missed meals I'm sure he looks like hell in his tailored Armani suits.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A  joke: <br />
<br />
A man and woman are sitting in a bar talking about what they would or wouldn't do for enough money. <br />
<br />
The man asks, &quot;would you sleep with a total stranger for a million dollars?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman thinks about it and says, &quot;Yes, I guess I would.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man asks, &quot;would you sleep with me tonight for 100 dollars?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman says, &quot;of course not!  What do you think I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man says, &quot;we've already established that;  now we're just haggling over the price.&quot; <br />
<br />
So, how many of you would sell your uber time-equipped accounts for 1,000 dollars?  Not very many, I suspect, since you could probably do that and haven't.<br />
<br />
How many of you WOULDN'T sell the same account for one million dollars?   Show of hands?  Anyone?   <br />
<br />
So now we're just haggling over price. <br />
<br />
So, I actually went and looked at the IGE site today for the first time and checked the prices.   hmmm.   Let me think about this for a minute.  If I devote my limited playing time to just buying and selling in the bazaar, even with my (relatively) limited bank roll, I can easily make 20 - 30 K a week - probably more - maybe even a lot more.  <br />
<br />
So, what if I had 6 computers with 2 accounts per computer and just worked the bazaar on 12 servers, AND did it full time, AND had a much bigger bankroll to start with.  Could I make a million plat total in a week?  Yeah - I think could; I think that's actually conservative.  So now I'm making a thousand DOLLARS a week with an ongoing cost of something like $160 a month to pay for the accounts. <br />
<br />
Are there smarter and faster ways to make money with the game?  I think there are - PL'ing chars to 65 and selling the accounts, farming expensive drops, etc. etc.  As long as you had the initial resources in terms of characters and plat, it wouldn't be hard.   Throw in friends and family members and it probably gets a lot easier.   And keep in mind, this is all without any cheating whatsoever. <br />
<br />
So, could I possibly make $2,000 a week by playing the game full time?  It's probably doable.  That's more money than I make in my full time job.  I have 4 kids.  I have bills.  <br />
<br />
Let's see - integrity of the game vs. my real life family.  Guess which one wins.  <br />
<br />
I consider myself a pretty decent and honest person, but if I thought I could increase my income by 30 percent or more by playing this game and selling in-game resources, I would do it in a heartbeat.  How many of you would not? <br />
<br />
I'm not enough of  a risk taker to actually do this.  I don't have the in-game resources to do it now and I'm not willing to risk investing real life money to try it; plus I don't know if the market will actually hold up (i.e. Sony might go into the business themselves). <br />
<br />
But if I thought it had a decent chance of success I would, with no moral qualms whatsoever. <br />
<br />
So, as much as I, as a player, tend to dislike Yantis and the whole idea of buying and selling in-game stuff, I can't cast any stones. <br />
<br />
Gotta admire the guy; Wish it was me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;So, could I possibly make $2,000 a week by playing the game full time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your numbers escalated extremely quickly. You went from making 20 to 30k in plat per week to making 1,000 dollars per week to making 2,000 dollars per week.<br />
<br />
It'd be hard to debate any of this with you as your data changes far too fast.<br />
<br />
I will say this however:<br />
<br />
1- This is not a full-time job. This game has a lifespan. And will run out.<br />
2- If you did set up a business at home to compete with IGE and mysupersales ... you'd need to be prepared to, you know, COMPETE with them. <br />
3- You're already on the slippery slope. Your anecdote about the prostitution at the beginning of your post foreshadowed this. You can make far more money per week participating in some other shady or completely illegal activity (like theft, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, prostitution, or murder for hire). So why bother with piddly little bank like this? Go for the GUSTO!<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's see - integrity of the game vs. my real life family. Guess which one wins. &quot;<br />
<br />
Using that guideline, there should be nothing holding you back from becoming a heroin dealer. The pay is better, so your family would benefit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go for the GUSTO!<br />
<br />
<br />
With yearly profit numbers i've heard (that means they're rumors, but who knows) - he would be going for the gusto. I've heard 7 figures profit for yantis alone last year...for doing something barely even related to drug trafficking or murder for hire.<br />
<br />
The law just isn't black and white. One is worse than the other, and when you weigh it all out these guys are simply raking in the cash at little to no risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well he was quoting $2,000 a week, in a home grown, run out of his den type of operation. Not Yantis' site, which has much more overhead than the $160 per month overhead he was quoting.<br />
<br />
And thus, the far riskier ventures, that are sadly a bit lower down the slippery slope, will net him far more money than 2k per week.<br />
<br />
&quot;The law just isn't black and white.&quot;<br />
<br />
Correct. That wasn't where I was going. He was the one that started it all off with the tongue in cheek prostitution joke. I'm merely following his own line of reasoning. Integrity isn't an issue. Money for his family is paramount. Then there's far more money to be made doing something other than selling plat online.<br />
<br />
EDIT: You know there's another side to this too. Disregarding legality, as it's not even been an issue yet since no one has ever taken them to court to argue the legality of their business ... Yantis' and IGE's business isn't the most profitable &quot;business&quot; out there. If the person wanted to, he could launch his own completely legal business and make far more money and far more security for his family.<br />
<br />
He wouldn't have to be the prostitute in his anecdote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not at all unreasonable to think that you could make a comfortable living playing EQ full time. I have a RL friend who does it. He's not getting Yantis rich, but he pays the bills and has some money to spend. If you put some effort in to it, you can make a pretty good amount of $$$ selling plat and rare or high end drops. I won't divulge how my buddy does it, but I would venture a guess that most people in high end guild could do the same if they thought about it a little while.<br />
<br />
I don't like Yantis or IGE, but I am certainly envious. They are making a killing, even if it has a limited lifespan, who cares? There will be more MMORPGs in the future. Even if they choose to get out of the business, they are already millionaires.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) My numbers escalated quickly because I started with playing one character 5 to 10 hours a week, which is what I do.  And also started with limited resources, which is what I have.  And also from the perspective of someone who doesn't know all the best tricks for making money, which is what I am. <br />
<br />
I wasn't trying to lay out a business plan, just doing some blue sky thinking on what I think might be possible - I still think it's not unreasonable, given enough beginning resources. <br />
<br />
2) The point of the joke wasn't to compare selling Platinum to Prostitution; it had to do with what people are willing to do for money.  Would you sell your account for a million dollars? I still haven't seen a no to that one.   <br />
<br />
3) Comparing selling platinum to selling Heroin is beyond ludicrous.  I would not murder, steal, sell drugs, etc. etc. for any amount of money.  I would not in fact do anything that caused any real harm to another human being for any amount of money, and I very definitely mean ANY amount of money.   But selling in-game resources is not in that venue. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I'm not talking about macroing, plat duping or cheating of any kind - just playing the game as it is designed/allowed to be played to generate platinum.  Doing the former could cause someone to lose real world money (that they spent buying the plat);  I wouldn't do that. <br />
<br />
As to legality - the various press releases referenced in this thread list a corporate headquarters for IGE in Boca Raton Florida.  Why are they still in business?  Too hard to find?  Where are the lawsuits?  I read the threads on Sony's sites and they say they are determined to stop the plat duping / macroing in game.  I have yet to see one mention of their determination to stop the selling of plat.  Quite honestly, I think there is nothing they can do about it legally.  i.e. it is not illegal. <br />
<br />
I'm not thinking about going into the Everquest business: I never really was.  I was trying to demonstrate the thought process that might lead a fairly ordinary, decent person to decide to do it (and still sleep well at night).  I don't know Yantis;  I might not like him if I did.  All I'm trying to say is that on the evidence I have, he's not Pablo Escobar or a child pornographer.  I don't like being in the position of defending him - I don't want to defend him, but some of the moral outrage I see directed at him strikes me as silly.  There's Wrong and there's wrong.  I'm not sure this even qualifies as the second one; it sure doesn't get a capital letter. <br />
<br />
Now, if you want to jump on me about the 'Wrong' vs. 'wrong' distinction, go right ahead.  Circling all the way back around, prostitution is, I guess, wrong.  But before you walk up to some prostitute on the street and tell her she's wrong, you better know the story, my friend.  Otherwise may God grant you an interesting life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Except he DOES do that. Or, if you'd rather be insanely technical, he hires people to do that for him. There's not enough ways to pull in millions of plat quickly without them, and in his business, he needs sizeable amounts of plat quickly.<br />
<br />
 And of course, if you define breaking a contract as not even wrong with a small w, please make sure you identify yourself well before I buy a car from you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what are you willing to do for money? As Parth pointed out, you're willing to go that TINY step towards doing so by breaking a contract. Your morals have cracks in their foundations. So were just haggling over how far you'd go at this point. See ... it's just like the joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would not in fact do anything that caused any real harm to another human being for any amount of money, and I very definitely mean ANY amount of money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Define HARM. Because there can be quite a few instances where mysupersales.com has &quot;harmed&quot; people. Not physically, but that's why I ask for your definition of harm.<br />
<br />
It also seems quite ludicrous that you would draw a line in the sand in a discussion you began about how morals have little value when the ends totally justifies the means. If you're willing to take one step, the selling of platinum, why not take others, which have a bigger payoff? As your joke implies, there's no difference between doing it for a million dollars and doing it for 100 dollars.<br />
<br />
You see, you can't jump between the two moral ends of this. As Raaj said, the law isn't black and white. But MORALS are. And you're the one that brought morals into this with the prostitution joke. From the standpoint of the law, you will pay a much higher price, or consequence, for murdering someone for money than you would selling platinum or accounts for money. The latter, you may pay no consequence whatsoever.<br />
<br />
But, just like the prostitute in your joke, we're merely haggling over DEGREES of your morality right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep in mind that I'm not talking about macroing, plat duping or cheating of any kind - just playing the game as it is designed/allowed to be played to generate platinum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, your business idea wouldn't last, because your competitors DO macro, dupe and cheat.<br />
<br />
&quot;the various press releases referenced in this thread list a corporate headquarters for IGE in Boca Raton Florida.&quot;<br />
<br />
IGE is headquartered in Hong Kong I thought?<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite honestly, I think there is nothing they can do about it legally. i.e. it is not illegal. &quot;<br />
<br />
Ebay thought differently. No case has been filed of this nature, yet. So it's completely uncharted legal territory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, if you want to jump on me about the 'Wrong' vs. 'wrong' distinction, go right ahead. Circling all the way back around, prostitution is, I guess, wrong. But before you walk up to some prostitute on the street and tell her she's wrong, you better know the story, my friend. Otherwise may God grant you an interesting life.&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem is, YOU'RE the one that brought it up. Not me. I won't be going to a prostitute up on the street to tell her she's wrong. You're the one that felt the need to use them a measuring stick against morality versus money making power.<br />
<br />
As you can see, I think your moral direction really shouldn't be based on a joke. And I really don't think you should use that as an example to others to justify the money for plat business. It's got some faulty philosophy lurking behind it.</div></div><hr />

In fact no one has ever been fined for it.  In fact, SoE doesn't even bother to ban accounts for it, which would be extremely easy to do.  I don't think you can say this is illegal, although the courts could come out and say that it is, which would be a major blow to IGE of course.  <br />
<br />
I think some of you are going a little too far with the self-righteous indignation over these guys.  They are entrepreneurs.  It's a little shady, kinda like scalpers at a football game.  It's technically against the rules, but it doesn't really hurt anybody and the authorities don't really care, so people are doing it.  I think calling them evil dirty scumbags is going a bit far personally.  <br />
<br />
If SoE wanted to put a stop to it, they could roll out the team of lawyers, an operation as big and out in the open as Yantis or IGE wouldn't be hard to find.  If nothing else ban a bunch of accounts.  They haven't though, and if they don't care then why should we?  I'm not saying it's a good thing.  I have never bought or sold plat, but at the same time it doesn't really upset me until something like the big plat dupe fiasco that screwed up the economy.  Of course Sony did fix that.</div></div><hr />

Ah, but see, I'm not trying to be self-righteous or indignant about this. However, the prostitution joke is hanging over the subject.<br />
<br />
That's my beef. He brought the morality issue into it. And then he back-pedalled by saying comparing it to drug dealins or murder for hire is ludicrous. How is it any more ludicrious than framing one's whole outlook on the subject with a silly joke about prostitution?<br />

There are some posts floating around right now about how the dupes and the macros are still being exploited and some server economies are still inflated and messed up because of that. Except now the culprit being looked at is mysupersales.</div></div><hr />
