<br />
<br />
A few questions.<br />
<br />
1. Would you hit it if your 0/4 on BoWs, and half the time people ninjalog when you call otm?<br />
<br />
2. If you had to order Anathema, SEWS, BoW, in the order of greatest aggro to least, what would it be?<br />
<br />
3. $$?<br />
<br />
Some infoz on my guild and I<br />
we're elemental for about 2 months now<br />
I'm guilds MT, and have 936X HP.<br />
We don't equip anyone first<br />
some in guild are saying bow&gt;anathema&gt;sews (?!)<br />
we generally have around 50 people per raid<br />
personally, i have a disdain for anathema just because of the ratio, it would feel too much like a low damage weapon<br />
<br />
thoughts are teh appreciated ! <br />
Sekrits! $$</div></div><hr />

Unless it had a tweaked proc rate (see BF / BBoE) i would prefer Sews.</div></div><hr />

However, I'm not an elemental warrior, I'm a pre-VT SK. I'd keep Anathema in a bag as an 'OhfuckI'mmanadrainedandneedaggrolikemad' back up, like I do my Black Bastard Sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BoW or SeW with Anger III far away better.<br />
<br />
I just picked up Anger III for the BOW and its nice aggro to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with getting anger3 or anger2 on Sews i have anger2 on my Sews it owns. The reason i went with Anger 2 is due to using raiding so much i dont have alot of time and i dont like waiting (haha) i choose to go with Anger 2 and very happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anathema cant be that bad.<br />
It is similar to the Great Staff of Four Winds in Ratio ( GSo4W is awesome agro IMHO )and has a very nice proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are much better ratio 2 handers out there that you can put Anger on.  Unless you can get Anathema for dirt cheap, I wouldn't bother.  EB is nice, but that 36 30 ratio is going to have a hell of a time holding aggro in a lot of circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Has anyone that has spoken out against Anathema ever actually used one??  If not it's impossible to say that SEWs is indefinately better.<br />
<br />
From what I hear the proc rate on Anathema is pretty high, you can also aug it with Anger 3....  Not to mention, Inny has some great drops aside from this weapon.  Constricting Cuirass as well as some really nice caster stuff.<br />
<br />
BTW, we got our first BoW on our 8th or 9th kill, so I wouldn't give up yet.  We've recently made RZ raids worth two raid points rather than the regular one just to encourage attendance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mahulk Keras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">3 warriors use Anathema in my guild and they dont have problems holding agro when they are told to tank. Of course BoW is better and SEWS is most likely better also due to much better ratio. I would rate them BoW &gt; SEWS &gt; Anathema. Still a top5 two-hander IMO (for a warrior).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">my guildmate ( who sometimes comes by here, Drazyn ) has I think the first anathema on Terris Thule ( shameless plug ).<br />
<br />
so far he ain't complaining about it; he's tanked into elementals with it and he holds aggro well enough.<br />
<br />
( btw it looks retarded; like one of those zxrathxil sabre things..it's got a wavy blade and a small hilt...so i'll never get one :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So the advice is to augment one of the superior weapons with a hate proc.<br />
<br />
But the person who was asking was hinting that they are having trouble getting one of those superior weapons in the first place.<br />
<br />
LOL, wonderful advice.<br />
<br />
You know Anger III can just as easily go into Anathema as it can the Blade of War the person is not able to get.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have Anathema and I luv it.  Got it before we were able to kill RZtW for first time, therefore I am fairly low on the list for a BoW and never seen a SeWS yet.  I have no problem holding aggro DPS is ok and I clerics lub me for taking less dmg.   I would never regret getting Anathema (cept on hps/ac).  I have had warriors in my guild tell me there is nothign they could do to try to get aggro off me once I got it with Anathema unless I am trying to give it back.  Our first RZtW kill I tanked with Anathema and was flawless. It is up to you but I love it And yes I have first and only Anathema on my server too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wish someone would parse the proc rate on anathema.  I guess we have to assume it's a normal rate (2/min) until shown otherwise.<br />
<br />
I used an obsidian greatblade (40/35 with taunting blow) before getting a BoW.  I really didn't have any problems with aggro except vs. other warriors that chose to also use their aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
This discussion should be moot though. . .if you are the first tank in your guild, then you should get the first BoW.  Hopefully someone else in your guild will champion that cause instead of you, for the greater good of your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I personally know Dima has passed or at least had the opportunity to go in on at least a few SEWSs. I'd definately grab one of those and forget about Anathema.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you can find it up, mud ring is easier than PoHb inny anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Probably hard to get parses, as the number of Anathema's is rather low, likely a 10 to 1 ratio BoW to Anathema.<br />
I only know of the one Drazyn has on Terris.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Drasek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mudring is not the problem - the point is &quot;if he is up&quot;, SolRo has 6? Guilds atm in the EPs ? So everything is down pretty fast and Mud is one of the nice targets outside Fire/Water for every guild i guess.<br />
<br />
Dima go and kick some of our lazy bastards who use a Anathema - they should parse the proc and decide later if you want to grab one, wait for the BoW or struggle with our ca. 42 Hybrids about a SEWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kaledan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">According to the formula from the arena thread, the weapons _should_ stack up as follows:<br />
<br />
Anathema 36/30 (36 db) = 26.6 swing hate per second.<br />
BoW          48/32 (37 db) = 27.1 swing hate per second<br />
SEWS        45/30 (36 db) = 28.6 swing hate per second<br />
twin BoC   15/20 (13/0 db) = 25.3 swing hate per second<br />
<br />
80% dual wield rate assumed for BoC.<br />
<br />
700  proc hate twice every minute averages 23 hate per second, so you should get the order BoW &gt; Anathema &gt; twin BoC &gt; SEWS, with the BoW only being &lt; 5% higher aggro than anathema.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, an augmented SEWS is probably better than either other weapon unaugmented, and is the best aggro in the case you get no procs.<br />
<br />
Well, thats a lot of theory, interesting to see if it matches real world experiences.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>draz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I got the anathema about a month ago and im very happy with it sofar. From what i can tell it has pretty much the same proc rate as a bow has, average around 2 per min. <br />
While it can take some time to get solid agro in expgroups due to the kinda low ratio i usually havent had any big trouble holding agro on raid mobs where i get a lill headstart. <br />
To make it short, its a great agro weapon thats lacking a bit due to lower hp/ac and ratio when compared to bow/sews.<br />
If you think that you have a shot at getting a bow or a sews+anger aug that might be a better option cause of the stats. <br />
Up to each and everyone what you want really :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I used BBB pre BoW even ni EPs with no augment and had 0 problems. SEWS with anger 3 is good enough imo. BoW is nice but i miss that Rune proc, especially when i used to duo with my shammy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Krauth Isuber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I got an Anathema just the other day, (First on Fennin Ro I belive ), and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.<br />
<br />
I was duel-wielding a BoC (main-handed), and a GBoS.  I've never cared too much for LDoN due to the fact that it pretty much destroyed my former guild, so I never really planned on going for Anger III and whatnot.  I still do LDoN, just very seldomly (bought LDoN the day it came out, only done like 15-20 missions).<br />
<br />
Yea...back to the Anathema....too early (late?) to rant.<br />
This thing absolutely rocks.  I havn't parsed the proc rate or anything, but it feels as if it has a really strong proc rate.  It feels as if it procs 2-4 times per minute with 305 dex.  I know I lost some HP from duel-wielding, but I feel as if the less ripostes that I'm taking is far more than enough to lose 60~ish HP.  If you EVER get a chance to get one of these (and have no chance of getting a BoWar in the near future) and pass on the Anathema, may Brell have mercy on your soul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i'm MT for my guild, currently wielding BoC + SotBS<br />
<br />
my guild is far far far away from the EP and so i am (as my woody fig can proove you, on my magelo :p).<br />
<br />
nevertheless, i may have the chance to grab an anathema (if it drops)...<br />
<br />
what would you advise ?<br />
should i grab it, or should i stick with my DW combo and let another warrior loot anathema ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">hate doesnt require any flagging, just wizards to get you there. any 60+ guild with around 50-60 people can learn the encounter. i read some thread, maybe on this board, where 1 group was down to doing inny with 30 people. pre-elemental, inny has some of the better loots around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why in the hell would someone with access to BoW/SEWS get a weapon that's inferior to both?  I bring this up cause my guild killed inny tonight and anathema dropped, and none of the warriors wanted it since we'll probably get into elementals within a week or two.</div></div><hr />
