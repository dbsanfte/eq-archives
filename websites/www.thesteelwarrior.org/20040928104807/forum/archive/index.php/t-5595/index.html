<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sevius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello there. <br />
<br />
I'm new here. Just wanted to drop in. Lol<br />
<br />
I was just curious, I have a Paladin of the 48th level, and I wanted to make a Warrior... Well I don't know why... Just felt like it.<br />
<br />
Now problem is I like my Paladin, and I like the Warrior. I'm forming a guild soon and I'll be the main tank. I might want to play my Warrior one day, and maybe one day play my Paladin. I was wondering if making a Warrior would make my Paladin useless to play? I mean, whats the benifits of having a Warrior over a Paladin, or a Paladin over a warrior. From what I understand...<br />
<br />
Warriors are better at tanking hard hitting mobs. They can take the damage better than a Paladin.<br />
<br />
A Paladin is a good offtank, for adds and such.<br />
<br />
Am I correct here? I might just whip out the Warrior when I need something to tank a big mob, and whip out the Paladin when we have enough Warriors. :)<br />
<br />
AND! One last question. Do you really have THAT hard of a time holding agro? Just curious, lots of people say Warriors suck at it. What I was planning on doing was getting 2 weapons, both with procs, and then adding proc augments to them. Might work, I have no idea. Lol<br />
<br />
Just help me out, I'm new to this.<br />
<br />
Thanks! And don't flame me.. Rofl :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">warriors = one role, one duty.HIGH upkeep cost<br />
<br />
paladins = many roles, many duties. Low to MODERATE upkeep cost.<br />
<br />
Honestly; I wouldn't recommend anyone who hasn't made 65 to play another class because you really haven't seen the entire spectrum of the class.<br />
<br />
unless<br />
<br />
you're already a warrior and delving elsewhere into the class pool.<br />
<br />
Your pally is just starting to come into age. In all honesty; keep your pally active and get them levels. In the long run you'll be better off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sevius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, the Paladin isn't my first. My mage is level 65 already. :)<br />
<br />
I really don't plan on leveling the Warrior just yet. I want to get the Paladin a little more twinked out before doing so, and getting him to level 51.<br />
<br />
I will say the Paladin has been more usefull. He makes a good patch healer. But I just want to be pure melee for once. But I'll take your advice and level the Paladin a bit more.<br />
<br />
Might get the War in his 30s first though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Compared to the paladin, the warriors aggro holding ability is less.  It used to be alot less before the berate/incite line of abilities came to the live servers.  Youll want stun or anger procs on the warriors weapons.  Miraguls is your warriors friend.  <br />
<br />
Up until recently, my guild has had a SK main tank, but after these changes came in, I have slowly been main tanking more boss mobs.  We have just finished tier 1 in PoP.   The SK basically tanked all through the Velious content, minus AoW and Aary.  After our 2nd run on the North wing of Temple of Veeshan, i have started to tank most of the mobs in there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depends what you want to be. I could never see myself as a paladin really, regardless of class balance. Too snooty and stuff. I prefer to be seen as a mellee monster that relies on his honed skills to advance.<br />
<br />
Everyone has something they would like to be, I guess at the end thats really what you have to ask yourself, because if you choose a class on pure numbers you will probably get burnt out soon anyway if its not what you want to be. I will probably quit EQ before I ever rerolled to anything else (well beserkers could change that, we will see).<br />
<br />
For raid roles, if you have your heart set on being a leader by example and always being the centre of the fighting, pick the warrior. They have much better means of getting aggro these days, but you will still have to work for it.  If you want very good utility for a hybrid, near aggro lock from a few store bought spells, and love being a good support tank class, pick paladin.</div></div><hr />

See, thats the thing. I'd like to be both. Sometimes I would like to be the main tank. And sometimes the one that dosn't tank mainly. Thats why I want to play both classes, so I would have a choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can be one with a warrior. <br />
<br />
both with a paladin.<br />
<br />
the versatility is there with a plate hybrid.<br />
<br />
in the end; if you're gonna make a warrior i can say this: 'you'll see where i'm coming from' where you have exprienced it.<br />
<br />
but the pally; as much as it pains me to say it; will get you much further in EQ than a wariror ever will in terms of all-around usage.<br />
<br />
remember; this is HybridQuest these days. the days of single sole usability is gone forever.</div></div><hr />
