Now my warrior is my main, but I spend 10 times as much time reading other class forums so that I can understand their skills and viewpoints so I can work with them better.  But I am starting to believe that Graffe's is nothing but a stinking cesspool of idiocy.  Case in point :<br />

First one started out as a reference to GUComics but the conversation they held on it just made my head spin. Second was on raid tactics for wizzies.  Do other classes really have no clue how hard they are making our jobs?  or that they really ARE causing problems?  Wizzies seem to be the worst of the lot.  I see statements all the time like, &quot;I start nuking at 99%&quot;, etc.., etc..  I can gurantee you 90% of the time when I lose aggro its to a nuker....  And don't even get me started on how many ping ponging raid mobs I've seen because of wizards...</div></div><hr />
