<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oarokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well it seems that SOE has once again decided to screw things up....<br />
<br />
Here is Bernlo's Q&amp;E ( Question and Evasion)<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of these have a wizard focus, but there are enough general questions that I thought I'd post it here. Except for two or three questions, these were all submitted by players on Graffe's.<br />
<br />
1) Any eta on adding new elemental level LDoN armor? I am trying to<br />
decide whether to save points or continue purchasing upgrades.<br />
<br />
Hehe this is a nasty rumor going around. We do want to look at adding<br />
more items to the adventure merchants, but if/when we do it will not be<br />
elemental armor.<br />
<br />
2) Any more information on when we will see GoD legs/chests looked at<br />
for possible retuning?<br />
<br />
I would imagine this could happen after Omens<br />
<br />
3) Any plans to implement a guild alliance tool in order to improve<br />
comunication and coordination between allied guilds?<br />
<br />
Something I will pass along to the team.<br />
<br />
4) Will Research tradeskill ever see a trophy?<br />
<br />
Probably will not happen as it is a skill you can use training points to<br />
max the skill out. The team would like to have some reward though and<br />
will evaluate what that may be.<br />
<br />
5) Will Resarch ever be updated to research current spells?<br />
<br />
Completely depends on the spells, and if we see a need for them to be<br />
more common. This probably won't apply to no-drop and ancient spells.<br />
(Per Maddoc)<br />
<br />
6) Will we receive new pillar spells in Omens? (They have<br />
been on our wish list since Kunark - you can find our old<br />
wish list from then on caster's Realm asking for some)<br />
<br />
Spell lists are not final for Omens so I really cannot say just yet.<br />
<br />
7) Why does AA work on right clicks for shaman, necros ( ie thier dot<br />
pants can crit each tick), and every buff class in the game (ie their<br />
right click buffs, maelins methodical mind, maelins meditation, form of<br />
endurance and the like from time) lasting nearly twice as long. Yet when<br />
wizards right click a robe, we can not crit.<br />
<br />
I am not sure why this would be. I will pass it along to QA as it may<br />
be a bug.<br />
<br />
8) Would like to know the possibility of having the buff<br />
timer on pet buffs. Would like to know the possibility of<br />
the ability to click off buffs at will (for pets).<br />
<br />
Buff timer is a possibility and I will forward it over to our coders.<br />
It might be something tied to leadership or an AA though (that is just<br />
me supposing)<br />
Removing pet buffs, I do not see happening soon.<br />
<br />
9) Any chance of having voice graft added to our familiar?<br />
<br />
As it would require some code changes (familiars are treated differently<br />
in code than standard pets) it will not be happening anytime soon.<br />
<br />
10) What other zones are in the pipe for revamping (not in appearance,<br />
but for content), and will the majority be done similar to VP (raising<br />
the level of the zone) or simply changing the content around a bit?<br />
<br />
For now we are turning our focus to Omens of War. I would look for<br />
revamp announcemens after it ships. I think you will see a varied<br />
approach, some levels will be beefed up while others are changed to be<br />
more appealing.<br />
<br />
11) Any plans to instance any old content? The emp in Sraa<br />
is quite annoying for smaller guilds trying to get into VT.<br />
His loots are decent enough larger quilds kill him alot for loot and<br />
smaller guilds have a difficult time getting people the rifts they need<br />
for VT.<br />
<br />
No plans at this time. It would be a massive undertaking though.<br />
<br />
12) Any plans to reduce spawn time on older content?<br />
<br />
Not currently.<br />
<br />
13) Any plans to change wizard resists in GoD? (Our only big nuke is<br />
fire but all the major bosses have high FR with low<br />
CR/MR)<br />
<br />
Not currently but it is something the team can re-evaluate after Omens.<br />
<br />
14) Can they add a ceiling to zones they felt were exploited<br />
by Grav Flux and un-nerf it? (Grav Flux no longer fluxes you<br />
- it was nerfed to stop people jumping over walls in PoTime)<br />
<br />
That would require re-building the zones. We may do this when the zones<br />
are eventually updated to the new graphics engine, but it's not going to<br />
happen anytime soon.<br />
<br />
15) Is it possible to add a raid option to the LFG tool, so that if you<br />
are waiting for a raid invite you can put /lfg on, and click the raid<br />
button in the LFG tool, This would allow you to keep the /lfg tag above<br />
your head but would not include you in the LFG list when other players<br />
use the LFG tool?<br />
<br />
Interesting idea. I will see what the guys here think.<br />
<br />
17) What is the status of single player LDoN or similar type adventures<br />
<br />
None coming anytime soon. I think the task system in Omens may fill<br />
this role though.<br />
<br />
18) Where does the Plane of Sky stand on your &quot;list&quot; of<br />
zones in need of a revamp?<br />
<br />
We have not plotted out revamps just yet so please stay tuned.<br />
<br />
19) can you reveal any information about the Omens Task<br />
system?<br />
<br />
Not yet, but I think you will be pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
20) Would it be possible to add a tradeskill path to the solvents?<br />
<br />
This is something under discussion.<br />
<br />
21) Does Firiona Vie have any regrets over her breast<br />
reduction surgery? =D<br />
<br />
She had surgery?<br />
<br />
23) How does the team (i.e. Rytan) feel about some form of Group<br />
Harvest?<br />
<br />
No idea, but I will ask him.<br />
<br />
24) What is the possibility of seeing Portals added to some<br />
GoD zones - particularly Barindu and Qvic (Reminder that<br />
Nexus was the only port at beginning of luclin and then more were added)<br />
<br />
It is always a possibility =)<br />
<br />
25) Lately there has been a lot of threads about<br />
solo-content. What sort of plans are there in the next 4-5 months for<br />
some sort of alternative for progression than grouping?<br />
<br />
The Task system! The system will be a fun alternative to grouping for<br />
players with short play times. The task system initially will be for players<br />
of 1st to 50th level, but wil be expanded to all levels after launch.<br />
<br />
Thanks again Brenlo!<br />

Laughing at something that many people were told was going to happen (See the link below for sites that have stated they were told about the armor at the GUILD SUMMIT) certainly does not seem like someone who cares about the community very much. I along with a number of people feel that LDON was one of the best things SOE had ever created.  New high end armor would have filled the need for those of us that do not have the time or desire to spend hours raiding. This game was made to play in groups, that is why there were only two targets in the game Nagafen and Vox that were setup to be raids, mudflation lead to increaseing bigger targets and the Vision TM truly died..Well I rambled enough. What it comes down to is I am very disapointed in SOE. <br />

There are new armor sets coming to ldon which will be elemental-calibre. The price cap at 1452 will be raised, to what I don't know.<br />
<br />
http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18413&amp;referrerid=0<br />
On the subject of LdoN’s, a couple more things came up. I suggested and am continuing to push for an uber-level difficulty which has double the points, drops 170/170ish loot off rares and is considerably harder (basically Ikkinz single group trials). They will also be adding some elemental/time quality gear to the ldon vendors allowing anyone casual players who do ldons to have access to some of the same level equipment as raiding players.<br />
<br />
http://mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1863105531<br />
- New high-end high-cost items will be available on LDON adventure merchants.</div></div><hr />

EP quality gear can be gotten in single groupable encounters already (GoD trials) but the content involved in getting this armor is much more balanced than the risk/reward of LDoN ... no matter how tedious.<br />

I applaud Sony and their decision regarding this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you trying for humor cuz mostly you sound like a prick. I note from your magelo that you never bothered to even get the tier3 LDON armor. Pansied out with the Malevolent, instead.  Probably because you already had 1100 from the Anger aug in EF so figured why put in the &quot;fraction of the work&quot; it might take to work up Nro.  <br />
<br />
Until you can bother to at least aim for tier 3 LDON gear you have no fucking leg to stand on when it comes to &quot;whining&quot; about the &quot;fraction of the work&quot; necessary to obtain good LDON gear.  The idea, after all, was for EP-level gear to require even more points (with even more points needed for the augs for the gear, probably).  Total time spent getting that would have easily justified the reward.  If you wanna cry because nonraiders could spend literally hundreds of hours in LDONs to get armor your zergfest guild picked up from the frog in POF in half an hour, take it somewhere else. <br />
<br />
The real shame here is that no one addresses or seems to care about another example of SONY NOT COMMUNICATING WITH THE PLAYERBASE OR WITH THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT STAFF.   Not but three months ago several class correspondents went to a weekend schmoozefest on SoE's dime so SoE could convince the players that they truly cared about their game and about their customers, were dedicated to more open lines of communication, and determined to break down internal barriers so that the devs and the mouths were on the same page.  Those class correspondents all came back and posted SoE's stated game improvements.  One of those improvements, as stated on several forums including this one by Raaj, was plans for new EP armor available in LDON.  <br />
<br />
Now we are told it's a nasty rumor!  Who started this rumor?  It sure as shit wasn't Bumfuck McBoober, from Bertox.  Sony can't even own up.  Newflash:  it's not a &quot;rumor&quot; when there are verified reports of statements coming out of your own mouthpeices at the schmoozefest.  This whole thing is exactly the sort of shit that got the players upset at Sony in the first place and it was the stated reason for the fest in the first place.  Great way to convince us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a huge gap between current Tak armor and Raex armor.  You should not assume that a new tier of LDON armor will be of Raex quality (i.e. 160+ hp per piece for warriors).  The existing tiers of LDON armor are each separated by 10 hp.  I would expect any new LDON armor to have at most an extra 20 hp and 5 AC per piece.  That is definitely not elemental quality.  You might call it VT quality.  And that's probably what Brenlo was getting at.</div></div><hr />

You cant expect to be able to get EP quality gear from doing mindless easy ldons over and over no more than you can expect to get to level 65 killing moss snakes in EC over and over.<br />
<br />
I dont care how much time you spend doing it ... the risk/reward for the content doesnt match up.  Period.<br />
<br />
The only solution would be to add another tier of ldon (harder) whose points are different and can be used to buy higher lv of equipment.  The reward must line up with the difficulty of content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont care how much time you spend doing it ... the risk/reward for the content doesnt match up. Period.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are the one who made this the necessity.  Personally, I just camped in ChardokB for three days with my boyfriend and a druid bot and once I have killed the the dragon to enter VP I will be wearing a 135 hp mask as a result.  That assuredly did not require high risk but I view the reward as better than any other I could have obtained in Tier3 or GoD.   Clearly, then, SoE's reward concept is not the same as yours.<br />
<br />
In any event, if one were to ascribe to your arbitrary reward system, why not impliment a system whereby Sony raised the quality of LDoN armor but made that armor only buyable with points acquired from High Risk missions.   This would increase the incentive to do hard LDoNs.  In addition, since it was noted several times in other threads that hard LDoN is in essence the equivalent stepping stone to difficult GoD trials, I should think the risk/reward would match up, especially given the risk is also coupled with a monstrous time grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Total time spent getting that would have easily justified the reward.So I suppose it would be ok with you if we could turn in 10000 snake fangs for elem level armor? I mean, it would take hundreds of hours to farm that many snake fangs. That would certainly justify the reward right?<br />
<br />
Bullshit.<br />
<br />
LDoN armor is already damn good as it is. You think it's a coincidence that many Time level warriors are wearing an LDoN BP until they get a Time BP? If you want better shit, you kill harder stuff. That is the way it has always been, and the way it should be. As it is, SOE has done an excellent job at giving non-raiders a path for upgrading. Take a look at the GoD for the non-raider thread. That is pretty damn good gear for a single group.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Translation - We'd like to look at adding more items to the adventure merchants, someday, down the road, eventually, once our desks are all cleared of everything else, every door is opening in the proper direction, we've maxed our score on solitare, and after we're all done milking the player base for as many expansions as we can.  Of course we'll leave in the fall 2 feet for 10k damage bugs and such, beause those are just good fun.   And if we should add anything to the merchants at some undetermined future date, don't expect it to actually be anything good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to give you a benefit of the doubt and assume you were posting this vitriol while I posted my reply.  Take a look at the reply then get back to me.  On both counts. And while you do that, just for clarity's sake, lets assume we are both on the same page and talking about LDON and not moss snakes, k?  It makes rational discourse so much easier to attain. <br />
<br />
Close brutul ... try retarded versus rational thread.<br />
<br />
Now as for you, I KNOW you had time to read my reply because you were posting this half-assed comment in response to something that came after.  Do you even bother to think or do you just carry the party line?<br />
<br />
In my opinion?  Retarded is having 188AAs but lacking AET.  That alone establishes that we take a different view of the universe and playing in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No Glat the new items are already planned ... they said there was new armor coming out and people got all excited when random asshats claimed that it would be EP quality.  Sony never claimed it would be EP quality ... and yes they did say that new armor will be available.<br />
<br />

As well both are using 1150point 40hp type 2 augs, and 1150 point type 3 augs on the legs. So yeah, that's a crapload of points cost, it was also mindnumingly easy. <br />
<br />
So i've put in the time to obtain said LDoN top armor pieces, and have elemental armor as well. I can say that the trouble of getting to ele's and then getting molds to drop, let alone win - cannot even be compared to hard ldon's, let alone normals which are in contrast absudly easy, and actually overall less time consuming to obtain. So no, elemental quality armor from current ldon normal / hard setups is a stupid idea - and as such was shot down.</div></div><hr />

The fact of the matter is, the MOST you will be able to do is get flagged for KT with single groupable LDoN EP gear.<br />

Thats a small progression with a little bit more HP in it,  if every warrior has 8k unbuffed hp avail to them, then KT is their goal.<br />

With LDoN, GoD, and various buyables out there, these numbers are not at all impossible to reach. We are relatively full on our tanks, but are always on the look out for especially talented and beefy individuals who play there class well. With less than the afformentioned hps your role on raids would be limited to nothing but dps.<br />

So we can see right here that all your guild is about is raiding. That is fine but the game was build back in the day for groups..not raids.<br />

I love the idea of LDON, but I am unable to go to the ultimate end of LDON a LDON raid because you have to be elemental or even Time geared. I want to get to that aspect of LDON but again I choose not to or cant raid to get the gear. I am asking for us to be able to simply be given the ability to explore all of LDON in its grouping glory.</div></div><hr />

Lets look at some of the things in the post section there ...<br />
<br />
-The Customer service system is being improved (And has improved) quite a bit<br />
-There are new armor sets coming to ldon which will be elemental-calibre. The price cap at 1452 will be raised, to what I don't know<br />
-The majority of EQ players are between levels 30- 50<br />
-Brenlo wants a halfling bard<br />
... and a few others<br />

<br />
Now, where did sony promise you your EP armor ... thats right they didnt.  This is hearsay about things &quot;talked about&quot; and &quot;discussed&quot;.  Now some of these (not all mind you) have been added, whereas some are clearly horseshit (better CS?  yeah right).  The majority of eq players are over 50 by this point ... all characters under that ... 80+% of them can be assumed to be low level alts ... but sony doesnt account for that.<br />
<br />
Point being it was a rumor in which too many people invested too much faith.  Period.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I can say that the trouble of getting to ele's and then getting molds to drop, let alone win - cannot even be compared to hard ldon's, let alone normals which are in contrast absudly easy, and actually overall less time consuming to obtain. So no, elemental quality armor from current ldon normal / hard setups is a stupid idea - and as such was shot down.<br />
<br />
I call bullshit.  I am IN a raiding guild so its going to be hard to pull one over on me.  My enchanter is (mostly) in full Elemental.  The time in which it took her to get those peices versus Vig's hording of LDON points for tak armor is incomparable.  But it's incomparable in the other direction.  We farm fire and walk away with, what, 16 EP loots from pre-Fennin-encounter mobs?  I'd say we can take these mobs down with 18-40 people.  At this point the drops are going to alts. Yes, I understand that raid targets require more drops because the loot has to be spread around.  I also understand that raiding in the Elementals with a raid is _really_ damn easy.  It takes more concentration and more effort for me to run a Hard LDoN than it does to kill any single elemental mob, sans gods.  <br />
<br />
I'd say the trade off works.  More, for raiders to now suggest that hard LDoNs are &quot;easy&quot; shows that you are elitist and hypocritical.  In the other uber v. casual thread I read several times raider suggest that Hard LDoNs were the equivalent to GoD mountain trials.  Those trials, no matter how many times you run them, require some modicum of skill even from Time-geared players. <br />
<br />
<br />
To Vigdis though, chill.<br />
<br />
I know Bigcehst, and hes a nice guy, certainly not... how did you put it, bumfuck McBobbyhein, am I close?<br />
<br />
<br />
It was McBoober.  You may know him, Sor, and you may even be right.  But he was being an ass here and that is all I know of him so that is how I view him.  Name calling very well may not prove my point, but neither will snide asshole comments, like the one your friendly friend made in this thread.  <br />
<br />
<br />
In addition, complaining FIX THIS FIX THIS over and over again like some mantra to get you through playing is stupid, you want a fix, think of one.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, I am thinking of a solution.  You just aren't listening.  My solution is to allow EP or slightly less equivalent in exchange for points spent on Hard LDoNs.  I've listed other solutions in the casual thread.  In the meantime I am completing all the VP quests I can in the hopes that I'll eventually be able to kill the raid-dragon holding my VP key. <br />
<br />
Secondly, The issue isn't whether I have 5k 6k or 10khp, it's whether anything is being done in EverQuest for people who aren't in a large raiding guild. I believe there are some good things in GoD for players who aren't in large guilds.<br />
<br />
However, raiding shouldn't be the vast majority of what's being discussed for the future of EverQuest and I think that's what a lot of people are saying is the problem right now.  When things are BROKEN, as they have been in this game for a while, one needs to keep up the mantra to &quot;FIX THIS FIX THIS.&quot;  How strange that you mention it is inappropriate here when this is the only thing that seemed to work for the entire EQ community prior to the summit.  Had Woody not cried FIX THIS, we may not ever have had an EQ summit. <br />
<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is, the MOST you will be able to do is get flagged for KT with single groupable LDoN EP gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
So? It seems to me that the raiders here in this thread are begruding me even that!  Why?  Are they so threatened that I might be able to upgrade my gear through hours spent on Hard LDoNs and *gasp* exp in KT?   What you don't get, however, is that I'd like to use that gear to help my casual friends progress through Velious and Luclin and maybe PoP.  <br />
<br />
The fact that even with the gear that everyone here is scoffing about us getting you believe we still cannot progress past a rather large glass ceiling is both frustrating and ridiculous.   If it's true, then why all the upset from raiders?</div></div><hr />

No, Apol, again you are wrong.  According to Raaj's post, during the development meetings, the developers said that &quot;There are new armor sets coming to ldon which will be elemental-calibre.&quot;  Raaj was very careful in his post to differentiate between ideas, jokes, and clear statements about about the future of the game.  This LDoN statement was one such statement.  You can re-read his post again and see for yourself.  As for your quote, I don't see it in his post and I've glanced through the remaining 16 pages to try and find it in vain.  Should you have a direct link or at least a page number, I'll take a look.  For the time being, however, it doesn't at all jive with what was said in the original write-up.  I note that it also does not jive with the several other class-correspondent summit write-ups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi, i've got no EP gear and all but 4 items on my person were got from single groupable encounters ... yet i've managed to get myself KT flagged.  Point being 95% of what i've got on my body can be obtained without a guild or a raid at all ... the only exception being my Dain ring which requires 4 groups and 3 hours of time.<br />
<br />
The glass ceiling you all are complaining about is imaginary ... the real &quot;glass ceiling&quot; for non raiders is right around 8k hps unbuffed ...  with anything prior to that, you still have lots of improvements you can make via 1-groupable gears and augments (both dropped and bought).<br />
<br />
I rest my case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Look, you want to make it out to be some epic struggle to obtain LDoN points, then go for it. As for comparing my hp's to others, exactly what point does that make? Holy shit, i'm an egotistical uber now? Lol, i'm anything but uber - and it has taken 5 years of work to obtain the gear on my warrior, not 2 months like it takes someone to get better then what I have now days.<br />
<br />
Sorry tho, when my ldon comments were made they are in regards to my ranger (read: not my warrior) for her bp / legs. It also is no miracle that I obtained both long before I even set foot in VT, let alone EP's. If you'd notice I still don't have anything better then that incorp bp / legs, and I was able to kill for upgrades to both. So sorry to burst your bubble, but as it stands, 1492 point armor is still GREAT for those that get it, and aug it out. Yep it takes time to get, but so does building a guild over 4 years to be able to obtain EP molds with. It's not like I just pickup group'd my way to Raex arms &amp; gloves, or Askr's boots &amp; gloves.</div></div><hr />

Amen ... people take 1 look at your magelo and assume they know everything about you ... who you are, where you've been, whether or not you're a pompus prick ... blah.  It goes both ways though.  People with beefy stats call out people without nice raid gear (or at least talking to them/treating them) like they are newbs.  On the flip side, people with lesser gear accusing those who have nice gear of being borish, arrogant, and hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
I'm a fairly casual gamer.  I do raid, but only 3-6 hours a week depending on if my family-centered guild has the forte to support a raiding squad for more than 2 hours at a time.  People with lesser equipment, however, look at my magelo and where my guild is as per progression and lump me in the hard-core raider basket.  Sorry, guys, but as i've mentioned before ... 95% of what i'm wearing can be gotten from single-groupable encounters and/or purchased in the bazaar if you're willing to do a bit of farming.  You are more than welcome to go and get them for yourselves at your own &quot;casual&quot; leisure.<br />
<br />

What is your problem, Apol?  Seriously, who pissed in your cornflakes that you have to be such an asshole all the time?  I wish if you were going to tell me to &quot;whine piss and moan&quot; myself that you'd at least know what you are talking about.  Take another look at Raaj's thread.  On that thread, you will see two lists.  <br />
<br />
The first list is the one handed out to summit members by the Sony staff &quot;after the EQ team met to discuss what they'd heard in our individual meetings.&quot;  This is the list that Grabbit later referenced as being written after 30 minutes of discussion at the end of the day.  <br />
<br />
The second list is &quot;A few other things not mentioned&quot; in that formal list that Raaj was told during the summit and felt probably should have been included.  In THAT list Raaj notes that during the developers meetings the devs told him and others that there would be EP equivalent LDoN gear.  In other words, Raaj's list was in effect promises made (or jokes made, as you reference and as I originally referenced in my initial post here) that were not later identified on the &quot;hasty&quot; 30-minute list. <br />
<br />
Get it?  It involves some reading comprehension and thinking but I'm going to bet you can figure out what I'm talking about.  There are two lists.  Your fucking side comments and your quoted words are in regards to the second list and not the one created by Raaj from things he was told during the summit.  Raaj even clarified later in that thread:<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=111148&amp;postcount=47<br />
<br />
<br />
crystalmatrix: We didn't get many details about removing augments, just that it would be possible in the very near future. I DID bring up the fact that a level 20 gets like 2 pts for an LDON and that buys jack. They said it was something they'd look at. There was really a ton of LDON suggestions that mostly centralized around the casual players and the fact that they use ldon to gear up, while we used elementals/time. THere will be elemental-calibre armor/item slots coming to LDON vendors soon...the bad news is they said they're raising the max item cost from 1492 to something higher.<br />
<br />
I think that they realize now that the hardcore gamers really don't utilize ldon much, and it's mostly casual/smaller guilds - the feel I got was that they're going to look at expanding on that a bit more.<br />
<br />
<br />
So quit being so uptight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">So what you are saying is that the 2nd list was all &quot;hearsay&quot; anyways that was never even formally written down.  Now i do trust Raaj heard this at the summit, but i would hardly trust it as more than hearsay without any formal confirmation of it from sony.<br />
<br />
Hence why they referred to it as a &quot;nasty rumor&quot;.  All it takes is one over-zealous fan/player or one sony rep who doesnt have a clue what he's talking about (they have lots of these) to leak false information in an attempt to make people happy.  With no formal statement adressing the topic, it's much easier to believe that these were false rumors rather than a 180 pulled my the everquest team.  Use your noggin bro ... i know you have one.<br />
<br />
As to casuals using LDoN more than raiders, i would beg to differ.  All that raid quality loot has room for 10ac, 40hp, focus effect, and Stat/save augs, not to mention that raiding warriors are pretty much required to have anger3 augments.  I'd venture to say that most raiders (at least serious ones) do far more LDoN than you'd expect.  For a warrior to get all the augs out of LDoN to perk up his raid armor/weapons, it takes ~10k points.<br />
<br />
That said, i'm sorry that people got their hopes up for nothing, but adding in EP quality gear which you can get from killing mobs with a max hit of 300 is a bad bad bad idea.  Sony knows this and it's why they've stated they have no intention of implementing such a system.  The reward must balance the risk, and frankly there is no risk in LDoN ... just a fuckton of time you have to invest.  If you want to look at a way they could make such a system fair, go to tipt/vxed ... if ldon was that hard, then i could see them adding in EP quality loot on a points system you have to save up for.  Loot must reflect the difficulty of content or everything goes to pot.  I would think that someone with your content experience would understand this.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

Well, you understood half of what I was saying so I'll consider that progress given how long it took you.  Yes, you and your quotes were wrong.  Raaj's list is not the one to which you referred several times in your snide posts above.   No, Raaj did not &quot;hear&quot; this as rumor.  That doesn't quite do it justice.  Raaj was told this during developers meetings - meetings intended to open the line of communication between the community and the developer staff.  He then reported it to his class members and he specifically did it in words meant to convey fact, not rumor.  You've read them several times as I've now had to quote them several times to foster your comprehension.  Seriously, take a look at what Raaj wrote and then clarified in his later post.  It is extremely clear that Raaj was certain Sony would be releasing additional LDoN content for non-raiders and that such content would contain EP-equivalent gear with higher cost.  Other summit members were told the same thing during developers meetings and reported the same thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm as much interested in avenues to better the game for those in my situation as I am for those who can afford to raid 10hrs a day 7 days a week. Lambasting me because of what I have, and not having one bit of knowledge about my current position is pretty shallow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fine.  Assuming all you just said as truth, how would you recommend non-raiders acquire EP-equivalent armor?  Lets say I'd like to progress through Ikkinz1-3, but in order to do that I require EP-equivalent armor.  Lets also assume that unlike Tipt or Vxed, I cannot ride on the coattails of a charm-pet group and must actually be able to tank the named - which I read on these forums will not allow me to defensive or go furious without eating group members.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
What gear do you mean?  If you are referring to GoD armor acquired from Gates and discussed in This Thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8214), you are wrong.  There are eight EP armor slots (breastplate, legs, boots, helm, arms, bracers, gloves).  The sole EP-equivalent peice of armor that one can acquire in GoDs is the bracer, from the named in Tipt.  None of the other armor even comes close.  Take a look at the Max Magelo Created (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1071587) to show what is available in GoD.  <br />
<br />
I do agree, GoD armor fills some needed slots.  The eight slots acquired with GoD armor are also nice.  But they are NOT EP-equivilent.  To argue such is simply wrong.  If, however, you still feel you are right about this, I would be happy to see links of EP-equivalent armor for those eight slots that can be acquired in single-groupable GoD content.<br />
<br />
*edit* Ah, I see what you meant now. You were not referring to EP armor being available through GoD content, you were referring to your disdain for acquiring EP equivalent armor through normal LDoNs.  Please note that I already conceded that I'd be fine permitting EP LDoN armor to be purchasable only with Hard LDoN points.  So that argument holds no merit.  I noted that earlier you agreed that such armor might be okay if purchased through an even harder setting.  I'm not sure why you make that difference.  I believe Hard LDoN to be difficlut enough for the nonraider.  Again, from my own experience, I was able to breeze through Hard LDoNs with my EP-geared friends.  But the casual guild Vig raids with actually sets up Hard LDoN nights and they try to beat them.  So far, they've only suceeded once.*/edit*</div></div><hr />

I personally don't see how it really effects anythign adding higher calibre armor to LDoN merchants.   <br />

I know.  Here is the basic problem, though.  During one of the most momentus occassions in the EQ player community history, Sony developers told players in scheduled developer meetings that they would be implimenting EP-equivalent LDoN armor.  This statement came at the same time that Sony was trying to convince us and all the summit members that they had turned over a new leaf, that the lines of communication were open.  It makes me especially skeptical about Sony's &quot;new leaf&quot; promise when one of the most important (for non raiders) promises made during the scheduled developers meetings at the summit was later dismissed as &quot;rumor&quot;. <br />
<br />
Moreoever, despite the 180 degree turn Sony has made on this point, I believe it to be valid.  I understand that many raiders appear possessive over their EP-level gear and feel non raiders have somehow not &quot;earned&quot; it, despite how difficult it might be for non raiders to obtain it (both in terms of time and in terms of sheer ability difficulty).  But I don't really understand the reason why.  Hard LDoN points are earned, much like DKP, so to say that we &quot;haven't earned it&quot; is not exactly accurate.  I dont' think its about earning, at this point.  I believe that EP-raiders believe non raiders do not have a &quot;right&quot; to such gear because they didn't make the &quot;sacrifices&quot; that raiders made.  This kind of belief, in my opinion, just perpetuates the problem with the current EQ model.  It should be something that everyone wants to move away from.</div></div><hr />

Raaj probably heard these things, but they are not set in stone and I can't count the number of times I've been told something in life just to have it change &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.<br />
<br />
That having been said, I do think that eventually there is a need for new armors in LDoN, there is currently quite a gap between EP armor and Tak armor.  I think that gap leaves plenty of room to add some armors into the middle area.  Factor that in with the fact that expansions are going to keep coming and gear is going to keep getting better and eventually LDoN armor is going to be far out-dated, so it will be necessary to add more or LDoN becomes obsolete.<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;That said, i'm sorry that people got their hopes up for nothing, but adding in EP quality gear which you can get from killing mobs with a max hit of 300 is a bad bad bad idea. Sony knows this and it's why they've stated they have no intention of implementing such a system.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
What gear do you mean? If you are referring to GoD armor acquired from Gates and discussed in This Thread, you are wrong. There are eight EP armor slots (breastplate, legs, boots, helm, arms, bracers, gloves). The sole EP-equivalent peice of armor that one can acquire in GoDs is the bracer, from the named in Tipt. None of the other armor even comes close. Take a look at the Max Magelo Created to show what is available in GoD.&quot;<br />

<br />
Here i was referring to Regular ldon easies ... max hit of 300.  Where did i mention GoD?  If they added EP quality gear you could get by running endless easies (no matter how long it takes you) then yes it would fuck up risk/reward.  Pardon me for giving you credit where credit was not due ... i assumed you could infer this given the context of my post and the fact that this thread is about LDoN armor ... not GoD armor.  I wont make that mistake next time.   Next time i'll use small words and talk nice and slow.</div></div><hr />

Not to get too technical, but you edited your reply above to refer to my reply...that had already been edited in recognition of the error.  More to the point, however, your entire argument here is worthless.  It assumes that I'm suggesting we should get EP-equivalent gear for doing easy LDoNs and I specifically stated in my second post in this thread that I am NOT suggesting that.  In other words, the point you are trying to make is rendered irrelevant.  Had you read and comprehended my earlier posts you would have known that.  Keke.

Because I never attempted to retract the &quot;whine piss moan&quot; ... this thread WAS a whine, piss, moan ... as are a great deal of the posts here supporting the compaint.

<br />
Vigdis, you and I see more or less eye to eye on this issue of risk/reward ... i dont see why we're even arguing about this anymore ... The fact is that without a formal writeup from sony, any arbitrary list you find on the interent or you hear by word of mouth should be given as much street-credit as the &quot;ghetto crowd&quot; gave Vanilla Ice back in the day.  Instead people hung your hat on it and then .... whined pissed and moaned when it didnt come true.  There are 1000 different explanations as why things could have gone wrong ... but chances are (given the developers current state) that Raaj was mislead as to think that what is just a &quot;it might happen&quot; or a &quot;wouldnt it be nice if ...&quot; or a &quot;we might think about ..&quot; was actually a &quot;we're gonna do this for sure&quot;.<br />

Watch your snide tone, there.  Is that how little you respect Raaj's words?  He is not &quot;ghetto crowd.&quot;  He is the administrator of these forums and he was invited to attend the summit on behalf of the warrior community.  His words were neither arbitrary nor misconstrued. They were as plain as day:<br />
<br />
<br />
THere will be elemental-calibre armor/item slots coming to LDON vendors soon...the bad news is they said they're raising the max item cost from 1492 to something higher.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can bullshit whoever you want with your various arguments, but lets try to at least pretend we belong to the same community, and that we respect our community leaders.  I understand that in this instance it doesn't exactly mesh with your agenda because what Raaj said (and the fact that it was Raaj who said it) directly contradicts what you'd like the world to be now.  But I didn't get these statements from random people on random pages on the internet.  I got them from our board administrator and the warrior representative at the summit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">No ... i am simply saying that perhaps Raaj invested too much of his trust/faith in some &quot;hearsay&quot; that was floating around at the summit, or that perhaps he was fed a straight out and out lie.

Vanilla ice back in the early 90's came into fame blah blah.   He had 0 street credit with the ghetto crowd to whom he was trying to cater to due to his former teeny-bop music career which was aimed at 14 year old schoolgirls.

Oh, I see.  You weren't comparing Raaj to a ghetto crowd, you were comparing him to Vanilla Ice, who had zero credit with the crowd to whom he was trying to cater to!  Thanks for the clarification! <br />
<br />
The bottom line is this:  I don't take everything I see and hear at face value.  As an example, I believe almost nothing that you say.  However, I should think the warrior community ought to feel that we can trust our representatives, like Raaj and Frodlin, when they tell us something.  We ought to be able to take our representatives at face value on issues related to their representation of the class at the Sony summit.  It follows that if those two representatives have been fed an &quot;out and out lie,&quot; we might also be justified in our subsequent &quot;whine piss and moan&quot; ... <br />

Granted it will get you close in the visible slot, but thats not really much of issue, its the non-visible slots which are difficult. LDoN doesn'thelp much there. Hell, even by the time you get a complete set fully auged, OoW and the mudflation it brings will be what makes up for the slack.<br />

Oh, and on the main topic of the thread, I'm not suprised at all. Higher level armor without increasing the point rewards makes this a grindfest at best. Filling out weak spots is one thing, but fully gearing is LDoN is very unpractical, even by the most dedicated, hardcore standpoint.<br />

there was a lot going on that weekend where i'm sure a lot of things were brought up on the table that looked good at the time, but after a bit of consideration, turned out to not be worthwhile. Solo LDoN were mentioned too, but those have been put off till well after OoW.</div></div><hr />

Its a game! People should be able to go at the end game in different ways that is all.

You call it impractical, Vikken, and I do agree that outfitting completely in LDoN gaer would be extremely difficult.  You may view it as impractical, but certain casual players might view the grindfest as reasonable in order to obtain that level of equipment.  The practicality or impracticaility of subjecting yourself to this grind is opinion, but it doesn't address why the choice  was removed.</div></div><hr />

maybe there is another expansion on the horizon which may address the issue...<br />
<br />
Speculation, I know, but the Devs haven't done a horrible job with this game. its much better than anything else on the market IMO. I'll trust them to have the forsight to see when current limitations are become impractical, such as grinding these upgrades, and plan appropriate compensation in the future to address the issue.<br />
<br />
The devs seem to have an idea of how to address progression for various playstyle in mind, whether that idea fits with the player ideas is subjest to debate, though that doesn't make either the players or the devs right or wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
With 10k hps buffed you can tank anything/everything leading up to time.  The single most intensive DPS mob in the EPs is Reparm, and i have personally tanked him with 9500 and no real problems (Granted i got lucky as Reparm can 1round any tank presently in this game ... double proc + 3k quad = 18k dmg in 1 round). Before sturdiness and ldon augments, tanks entered time with roughly 7500-8k hps unbuffed.  Granted, at the time there were no 40hp augs ... 10ac augs ... <br />
<br />
And yeah LDoN hard has some very decent offslot items (nice rings/earings for sure + a decent cloak, necklace, mask).<br />
<br />
Tank hps/ac are important but no so centrally that tanks with only 10ks hps will keep a guild out of Time.  More important than the raw hps/ac of the tank is the ability of the entire raid to work together and multi-task to complete the encounters you find in EPs.<br />

People reference a report that Raaj made a while ago about some potential upcomping changes and quoted it like it was the bible.  There was no formal writeup or statement from sony, so it can be assumed that Raaj missinterpretted a few things or was unclear as to what was &quot;for sure&quot; and what were ideas that were just simply being discussed as possibilities.<br />
<br />
When sony came out with its recent official statement, some people referenced said thread as proof that sony said it would do something that it never claimed it would do ... and this is where the more recent posts came from.  I suggested that Raaj simply put too much trust in false information ... not that he was ghetto or vanilla-fuckin-ice ... or that he was even someone to be mistrusted.  Perhaps he simply put too much faith in something not solid.</div></div><hr />

Raid.<br />
If you don't want to raid, or you don't have the time, you don't get the gear.<br />

Do you see a Janitor making millions of dollars sweeping floors all day? Nope. Just like you shouldn't see casual players  LDoNing all day to get = elemental gear. The Janitor is in a guild of 17 that can't clear fear, while (let's say Tiger Woods) Tiger Woods is in the top guild on the server.<br />

If you want want the gear, money, boobies, whatever, then you need to put the time in doing challenging encounters, not some gimp ass ldons. <br />
<br />
You can get pretty nice stuff in LDoN as it is, and it doesn't need to be better. If you want to venture into GoD, then you're going to most likely need a raiding guild to get past KT.  It's a fact of the game and, unless you live in a communist country, it's the same in real life. <br />

I have to call you out on this one, I guess your statement rubbed me the wrong why because the more post I read from you, the more it comes across that you are just comlaining to be complaining. While there may be some issue with the balance between casuals, non-raiders, pre-EP raiders, and hardcore raiders, and whatever other designation people want to give themselves, do you really expect SOE to just stop everything and address your, and your constituent's, concerns.<br />
<br />
The issues if they really do exist took time to show up in the game, it will take time to adjust the game back to a more ideal disparity between these casts. The devs have a full load on there plate of coming changes that are already in the pipe, some which you may benefit by, other which you will not. Just because we are all here discussing our likes and dislikes, and even if everyone here came to an agreement on a solution, it will take time to get these solutions in the game. The game is very raid heavy at the moment, however, after LoY, LDoN, and the single group GoD progressions, you can't say they haven't been making an effort, but these things come in time. The devs can't shut the game down, stop all development, and rewrite the code in a month, hell 3 months time.<br />
<br />
Have patience, friend. The devs know you love the game as much as I and toehr here on this forum, however, they can't just wave a magic wand and make things all better. i don't mean to come off condesending either, I know I love this game and want to see it continue you be the best game that it can be many years in the future. I have my issues with the game, and certain play decisions, and lord knows I can get pretty aggrivated about the way some of the things in this game are.<br />
<br />
All, I'm saying is just try to calm down and rest assured that your concerns are not going unheard. however threatning to cancel accounts, boycotting expansions, or jump ship (all of which, yes, you are entitled to do if you so choose) with every little minute detail and peeve you have with the game is a pretty sure fire way to get ignored.<br />

Vikken, for the most part you'll see me comment in counter to someone who comes along and says, in essence, &quot;everything is fine, if you want better gear go raid, if you can't raid or don't want to raid, you don't need or deserve better gear and you don't need or deserve new or better content.  Go live in LDoN and stfu, you whiny ass cry baby casual/non-raiders.&quot;  I find this attitude offensive.  I feel the need to comment against it.

Not every casual can reach 7k unbuffed as warriors.<br />
<br />
You have to relise that your the high end of casuals and not the norm, the reason is you are almost an uber with 7k unbuffed, a low end uber but still uber. if they are going to make &quot;content for casuals&quot; like you assert GoD is then they need to go with the average, not the very best or bare minimum.<br />
<br />
I've worked out the math for you already, getting all of your gear (from the megalo that was made up) and the augments needed to match you from LDoN only would take a year. a year is bullshit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I realize that i am on the high-end of the spectrum.  I also work at it a good bit harder than your average casual.<br />
<br />
I started tanking vxed at 8500hps buffed in average xp groups (8700 was my tops) which equates to about 6.2k unbuffed.  It is doable with considerably less than 7k unbuffed, but you need strong groupmates to make it happen.<br />
<br />
GoD isnt limited to the trials, friend.  Nice xp content and loot can be found in Natimbi (named only really), Ferubi, Barindu, and Riwwi ... all of which are considerably easier than trials 1-6 and beyond.<br />
<br />
Were you aware that a 100hp earring can drop off any trash mob in barindu??  These mobs are just a step up from your average BoT xp group ... yet they drop low-EP quality earings off any random mobs in the zone.  The sky is the limit as to how you get your leg-ups into the trials, and lots of people have done just that.<br />
<br />
Ps- I dare say that no EP warriors will make 10k unbuffed.  I know lots of Time equipped warriors that still havent even winked at 10k hps unbuffed.  If i got all the EP loot i could possibly dream of upgrading to i would have maybe 8400 hps and 18/1900 ac.  EP loot is damn nice, but it LDoN/GoD gear is close enough that you could probably hop into Time without ever seeing a piece of raex or other EP gear.  People have done more in the past with less.<br />
<br />
As i've already stated, it is very possible to tank even the nastiest mobs in EP with the gear i'm wearing now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Fair enough, context is everything, but you do realize that you arguement isn't the most effective. I mearly wanted to point out that those types of post detract from a contructive discussion. I will, however, leave it at that, you have your own &quot;style&quot; as do I.<br />
<br />
Look Vikken, chastice me if you want, but there a number of people who's input to this discussion has significantly less value.  You and I both know that the time investment in gaining an LDoN armor set it prohibitively high, otherwise a large portion of the non-raider player base would be geared up in LDoN armor already.  And they're not.  It certainly can't be because they're all lazy, stupid, unwilling to take on a challenge, or what have you.  <br />
<br />
We know that a full set of LDoN armor with a full range of augments would probably get you in the door of GoD, but wouldn't have you sitting pretty there.  You'd still be struggling pretty hard and many clerics might not want to take you on.  While there are drops in GoD, there isn't a full range of drops for every slot that are approachable by the majority of the player base.<br />
<br />
Yet, when additional armor from LDoN is purposed, people go, oh no, that can't happen.  So where are people supposed to gear up those slots that aren't covered by the common one groupable drops in GoD?  Apparently they're not supposed to.  Which means that GoD isn't for the majority of the player base at all. <br />
<br />
Now, I understand that raiders have objections to having their efforts trivialized.  But most of them haven't worked half as hard for their raid loot as they would have us believe.  I've been in a raiding guild, I have a pretty good first hand knowledge of what it entails, and it's not as &quot;hard&quot; as they would make it out to be.  It has its difficulty, certainly.  But most people in a raiding guild aren't working that hard most of the time.<br />
<br />
And if the expansions continue to exclude a major portion of the player base because they can't or won't raid and therefore can't experience the vast majority of the content, then you really give them no incentive to continue to purchase expansions.  This is all very basic and very easily applied logic.  But seemingly something that gets past a lot of people who raid, because they are obviously more preoccupied with protecting their little chunk of turf rather than thinking logically about the viability of the game and its life span.  I think that you and I can both agree that if a major portion of the non-raider player base is chased away, EQ will come to a slow grinding halt, because the money just won't be there for SoE to see continued investment worth their time and resources.<br />
<br />
We for the most part aren't having a discussion on the topic, we're having a contest of wills.  Some of the raiders have good points, this I don't deny.  Some of the non-raiders/casuals also have some good points.  I think there is probably a compromise position that could be worked out, except you have a set of people who have to repeatedly, over and over again, attempt to disparage, belittle, run down, and work at trying to undermine any valid point made by anyone who isn't a raider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Your right, on all points. i thinm the hardest part of all this is that noone really KNOWS what is available to the other playstyle and what it entails. Hardcore raiders that have been in it so long and have worked really hard, but have lost touch of what is going on with the other aspects of the game. on the other hand, you have casuals, I'm not saying you are one, but a large portion that come here and vent and really have no clue what kind of effort goes into the really awesome magelos they see here. They simply look at it an say, hey why is that I can't get that.<br />
<br />
Compounding the problem is the fact that tanks have to geared a tier higher than the rest of their party, yet roll and earn DKP/LDoN points at the same rate as non-tanks. I haven't the slightest idea of where to begin to address this, so I've decided to do something that I can help with.<br />
<br />
I've already made out a magelo with full, nothing but, LDoN gear, I scrapped that version simply as I see it very unlikey for someone to work so hard for very little reward as what LDoN gives. So, I'm reworking a casual profile that I think is readily attainable. I'm doing that as I write this.<br />
<br />
I've also made up a Hardcore pre-EP, single group/unflagged raid proflile. I've already got some feedback on it already, some saying its unrealistic, but thats not the point. The point is that I'm trying to find, in quantitive term (ie a magelo you can look at an inspect) what the differences between MAX effort at the various styles of play.<br />
<br />
Will it do any good? I haven't the slightest idea, but maybe if we can a semi-agreeable baseline, we'll have something to start with. Maybe then, we can all look at see instead of spouting off speculative numbers at each other. Maybe thats half the battle...we'll see. :0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I think your Magelos are somewhat useful.

For a very long time Warriors have MT'd cutting edge mobs with the previous expansion's armor sets with some pieces from the current set. Defensive allows us to do that. We do not and never have required an expansion beyond the rest of our guild to do our job. However, it does generally take the previous expansion's raid armor or better to do well in the current expansion. Crafted won't get you very far into ToV. That's progression.

1. no improvment except bug fix<br />
2. dear raiders, OoW will be great for you with all the big mob we are putting inside.<br />
3. dear casuals, all your issues with the gap between you and top raiders will be solve with the task sytem. it's what you are waiting for. it's the solution we are making to solve all your pb, you will love it. but we won't give it to you if you don't buy OoW, we could have update LDoN to put the task system inside by then we will have no need of OoW cause it's again a raid expension for a larger part.<br />
<br />
so all in all, Brenlo say that they don't plan to help lower guilds and casuals in the current world (no instence, no spawn time reduction, no trival loot system in old world) but it will be corrected in the next expension, but not for you : task sytem for lvl 1-50!!  wtf, the casuals can reach lvl 65 and with bazard/LoDN they can have ~7000HP/1500AC unbuffed. way helping lvl 1-50 when the world is flooded with twink (PL to lvl 60+) and bazard (lesser PL to lvl 50+). the true gap we are pointing out is for lvl 50+ not lvl 1-50.<br />

Ah, I misunderstood. I've looked at your Magelo, but I haven't seen the Magelo's of your groupmates. Depending on how poorly they are equipped, you could be right - but the two things are totally unrelated.<br />
<br />
You have to be equipped appropriately for the content you tank. The top Cleric in the game could not keep you alive if you a MTing a mini boss in Kod'Taz.<br />
<br />
LDoN Difficult is a misnomer. For a Warrior, it isn't difficult. The burden falls on everyone else in your group. It's not even necessary to use a discipline even in an Assassinate. I've lost some LDoN &quot;Difficults&quot;, but I assure you in only one case was it the tanking and even then it was NOT my ability to survive the damage.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say you need to be equipped one tier better than your groupmates, I'd leave it as you have to be equipped to handle the content you face. Craigbeast Rager doesn't look at what your Cleric is wearing before he hits you bud.<br />
<br />
Before asserting stuff that might be true in your little corner of EQ, think a little. No MT needs to be an entire tier better equipped than the rest of his group unless he's equipped like a level 60. If his stuff doesn't all say Level 65 Required, I assure you level 60's wear it. If that's the case, there's the reason - not because his group is wearing X, Y, or Z.<br />
<br />
Zones don't say No Poorly Equipped Warriors beyond this point. My goodness, yer a Warrior - don't you think it behooves you to have the AC, HP's, Avoidance, and Aggro capabiliteis any groupmember would rightfully expect of a level 65 representative of our class? Would you group with a Cleric that said &quot;Holy Light? Naw, I that's uber, I don't have it yet, how about a Greater Heal?&quot;<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">That's content that's been nerfed so hard it's not even of interest to a level 65 equipped like a level 65.<br />
<br />
/nod A common perception of the raider set.  If you haven't raided and don't have that tier of gear, you're not really a level 65 at all.  And therefore shouldn't really expect to have any content targetted towards you.  Silly casual, go back to LDoN!  How long are people going to have to hear that before they start saying, wtf, I pay good money for this kind of abuse?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">How much longer before you gear up and are a level 65 beyond just having put experiance into your Level indicator?

<br />
Seriously, none of this stuff is that hard. Just look at the next step in the progression, post an open public raid on your server and do it. There's not a raid that can't be done in under 5 hours in the entire game and most can be done in 3 hours or less.<br />
<br />
Some of this reminds me of Knights posts in GoD debates. Well, the content has been adjusted and it's player level and intended progression level appropriate. If you are a Warrior and can't MT a Vxed or Tipt group it's not because the mobs are too tough - the content has been adjusted. It's because you are not properly equipped.<br />

However if it's supposed to be marketed at casual players that dont raid then the cost really needs to be lowered considerably. At present the only people walking around povar with a full set of the stuff are those who have heavy playtimes, and for one reason or another choose not to raid.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the elemental quality items remain the domain of raiders, but at least halve the costs of the ldon armor sets. It would make sense to me for casual ppl to earn armor at approximately the same rate as a raider who has to spend dkp on raex pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">BB be sure you looked at my post in the other forum, thats out of date and I spelled out what all my new gear was in it.<br />
<br />
5k unbuffed and about 1400 ac unbuffed should be enough for a hard mode, I buff up 300 hp short of 8k unbuffed, 3 levels of stur and I would have 8k unbuffed so I dont see why they are being such pussys, but the players i refer to are casual pick up groups.<br />
<br />
Most players I deal with have 2 or 3 ornate (like me) a few bought none visible slots and a bit of PU raid PoP gear, their gear does sort of matter since focus effects can make spells land alot quicker and save mana, as well as have a larger range.<br />
<br />
Of course most clerics would rather send me back a smart assed reply than admit they are just as shitty and need an elemental tank to babysit them.<br />
<br />
A good example to prove your's about the cleric wrong is the blizzard raid with the AoE mana drain, with an extended range 4 or better the healers can avoid the AoE all togeather, this is an example of being geared up as a caster.<br />
<br />
By a tier above I mean why should I not be able to do a LDoN hard with, lets say 5 ornate items and the better mid range bazaar items, and quite a few raid items not be able to do the same adventure and content that a 65 cleric/wiz/necro can do with their visisble slots being worse than ornate, the non-visible slots being poop and maybe 1 or 2 raid items?<br />

GoD all the way to KT is one groupable content, again without elemental gear, again more a factor of defensive AA (for warriors).  Obviously if you have Kael / Thurg quested armor at this point you're probably not ready for it.  But you can farm the trials for loot for a long long time.<br />
<br />
I hear a lot of whining in here, well listen to this, it's the world's smallest violin playing &quot;my heart bleeds for you&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the awareness of the content around you, or the skill / competency to take advantage of it, that's your fault, not anyone elses.  Clearly a lot of the whiners in here haven't even investigated the content that already exists, but you cry for More, Easier, Faster.   <br />
<br />
Well it's called Everquest, not Giveittomeallnowquest.  <br />
<br />
Plenty is in reach of the &quot;Non-raider&quot;.  Can you get it all in 3 months playing 6 hours a week?  Hell no. <br />
<br />
I'm not hearing that you want to enjoy the content when you haven't even gotten through the non-raid content that's been around for years.   I'm not seeing the warriors who are patient and enjoy the process of playing complaining in this thread, I'm seeing people who sound like spoiled 11 year olds going:<br />
<br />
&quot;why should I ever have to go to ToV, that's OLD content, it has nothing for me and I'd have to like KNOW WHAT I'M DOING if I went there in one group wouldn't it be safer raiding with 60 people, I hate raiding you people on raids don't let me have all the loot I have to share and wait for loot and I don't have the time anyway who wants to spend hours setting up and killing one mob and what for......&quot; <br />
<br />
oh yeah, I forgot.  for the loot.  that you whine about  that you want.  but don't want to have to work for, or experience content for.  <br />
<br />
Why do you play this GAME if you don't want to experience what is out there, if you don't want to use the content you already have, if you don't want to do the quests and take the time to gather the resources the game has put in front of you.<br />
<br />
For those few of you who are criticizing Brenlo and his responses more than bitching about actual content, you have my sympathy.  It's rare that the leopard will change his spots, and regardless of the quality (or lack thereof) of current content, claiming that OOW is Your Answer Here In the New Millenium to All Your Problems is just so much jive talk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I personally see nothing wrong with adding a higher tier of armor to LDoN, but i would like to see Sony implement a newer system of obtaining them other than the inane grind that is LDoN. Spice it up a little, make it more than just a series of boring ass groups. <br />
<br />
I would love to see the implementation of a new level of LDoN that would be a tad more difficult than hard that gives a different kind of points. After enough are amassed, you gain access to an adv that is more like a trial, with maybe a boss mob at the end. Make it challenging but not impossible. Make it more entertaining to do than a grind to add a sense of accomplishment, and when its completed you receive an armor piece, or a mold to make it, then off you go to the next LDoN camp to do the next piece. Spread them around, keep it interesting. That's what LDoN is missing. <br />
<br />
The gap between Raex and Tak armor is a pretty sizable jump that could be narrowed a bit and that would help with some of the difficulty that casual players are having with the GoD trials and such. I would just like to see a boost in risk for the boost in reward.</div></div><hr />

On the subject of LdoN’s, a couple more things came up. I suggested and am continuing to push for an uber-level difficulty which has double the points, drops 170/170ish loot off rares and is considerably harder (basically Ikkinz single group trials). They will also be adding some elemental/time quality gear to the ldon vendors allowing anyone casual players who do ldons to have access to some of the same level equipment as raiding players.<br />

I believe elemental-calibre is the term here... meaning that the intent is to make higher level equipment available through LDoN equipment equivalent to elemental/time gear but not the exact same things you can get in the elemental zones or time.<br />

<br />
Let's say that Sony did add armor to ldons that was ~ elemental calibre within the next month or so.  Is that around 2 years since PoP was first launched, to which we subsequently had LoY LDoN GoD and now OoW? <br />
<br />
Just keeping that in mind, does it really hurt you all in any drastic way that casual players could have a chance at literally the &quot;last fall's line up&quot; of gear? I mean...I understand that many people have arguments they truly and firmly believe in. But when you step back from it all...does it honestly, in truly, effect, or hurt, or make your time in everquest less enjoyable, that some other set of gear might exist that is obtainable through a different means than what you took to get there?<br />
<br />
<br />
To the casuals: don't sarcastically answer this question from the viewpoint of the raiders. I really and honestly just want this one question answered. I don't want people jumping on top of eachother in the process.</div></div><hr />

You're still not paying attention.  It's one groupable.  If you don't know 5 other people who can cooperate enough to go farm the place for loot for awhile with something other than /random for your loot drops that is not SoE's or anyone else's fault.  The point is that it is there, it is accessible to non-raiders.<br />
<br />
While I'm at it, non-raider, raider, and &quot;casual&quot; aren't necessarily on the same measuring stick.  I know casual raiders and hardcore non-raiders.   How many hours a week is &quot;casual&quot;?  No, I'm not asking for an inane discussion on how many hours a week is &quot;reasonable&quot;.  I'm just pointing out that someone who plays 7 hours a week can't expect to get the same rewards over the same time that someone who plays 14 can on anything but a &quot;gimme gimme&quot; basis.  It's always been that way.<br />
<br />
For the game to remain reasonable there has to be a trade off somewhere.  Time.  #s of People.  Effort.  Risk.  You might as well go back to arguing that everything should be soloable and that if you can't get endgame gear without soloing you're being cheated.  Oh deary me why aren't LDONs soloable?  Why can't I start with a level 65 character with top notch gear, all that leveling ugh why would anyone want to waste all that time doing that?  What are all these level restrictions and requirements?  Why can't I have level 65 spells at level 20?<br />
<br />
I hear that Diablo II works well for folks who want to lone it through the game while being able to wave their virtual manhoods around bragging about their loot.  Apparently they have an open version of the game where you can just code your gear right onto your character or something...</div></div><hr />

I don't want to fall too deep into this thread, but this is true.  My &quot;Next few months&quot; profile is what I hope to wear into time.  In reality I probably won't get all of those items, but that would be my ideal.  Now it isn't maxed out totally for an EP tank, but based on the VP stuff I already have it's all the items that I would consider a significant upgrade from my current gear and LDoN vendor-bought augments.  It has me at 8400ish hps and a little under 2k AC.  So no raid tanks aren't entering time with 10k hps unbuffed.  Virtually impossible I think, without a ton of GoD/LDoN raid augments or something.<br />

<br />
Actually, I'd like to see lots more groupable stuff and small raid targets for everyone without gy's,too much instancing,or other dumbing down techniques.If it takes a decent raid of folks to drop ep gear now then it should be extremely rare for people geared at a lower level to get similiar quality loot in a group...if ever.However,balanced rewards on par with the rest of the game should allow for more avenues of progression then presently exist.</div></div><hr />

This arguement is getting old Gunnar.  Casuals say the SAME THING about Raiders.<br />
<br />
&quot;The idea that someone could simply make it to 65, get into a raiding guild and buy stuff with DK points and just live in raids until fully ep geared is sad.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is no difference between spending 8 hours raiding a target for 400 DK points or grouping in LDoN hards for 8 hours for 400 LDoN points.  Time is time no matter what setting you are in.  The risk is the same, possibly loose 8 hours for no points.<br />
<br />
You find it mind numbing to do LDoN's more then once I find it mind numbing to raid the same target more than once.<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">One question.  Has anyone bought and fully augmented a suit of tak armor yet?  Is there one warrior that any of you guys know that ground out that many points and bought all the gear/augments?  We're talking months and months of nightly LDoN grinding just to get Tak armor.  Is 2000 point EP armor really an option that anyone would buy?  Honestly I don't see how it would be a problem to put it in now because it will be at least a year before anyone would save the points to buy all that stuff and augment it to EP level, and by then there will be at least 2 more expansions and raiders will be several levels beyond elemental planes gear.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I would never, ever, do that much LDoN, but anyone willing to grind 16000 LDoN points (2000 points times 8 visible armor slots = 160 hards or 320 normals, and then you don't have any augments or non-visible gear yet) can certainly have elemental planes armor if they want it IMO.  Frankly though I can't see many people ever doing that much LDoN.  Certainly not a &quot;casual&quot; player.  LDoN has been out for a year and a half now?  And most servers top person on the leaderboard is somewhere around 500 wins (just going by the tarew stats).  Everyone on the top of the leaderboard that I've seen were also time geared when LDoN came out and thus able to rip through LDoNs easily from day 1.  In the time it takes to do that you could create a new character, level him to 65 with a couple hundred AA, join a guild and get far better than elemental gear easily.  <br />
<br />
I don't see why any raider would be threatened by this, but at the same time, I can't see why any casual/non raider would want to do that much LDoN hehe.</div></div><hr />

My guild had an applicant in a mixture of LDoN armor and Kizrak (the Ornate mold stuff). He was fully LDoN augged and had a smattering of items he acquired in backflagging toward PoTime events (not many). As I recall he Magelo'd at around 9k HP's unbuffed, but my memory might be faulty.<br />
<br />
Frankly the sensible path is LDoN BP and legs ('cause the Ornate molds are harder to acquire and ridiculously expensive to buy), Ornate or near in the rest of the visable armor slots, Steel Rings, Bloodmetal ears, Loyalist Sheild, Lcea Katta's visor, etc. With a full set of augments including both LDoN and pre-Kod'Taz augs, etc.<br />
<br />
I believe this could be accomplished by a player that is in a small raiding guild capable of fielding 3-4 groups.<br />

I think people just need to forget about LDoN and look for another advancement path.  Hopefully that path will become evident in a couple months when OOW comes out with new levels, new AA, and only one locked zone (or so the rumor says).  There is also already another option to casuals that can get past one relatively easy mob to get their VP key.  You can get 6 elemental level items with 1 group from the quests in VP, and when you're done with them, you have access to an elemental level exp zone where 100 hp+ loot drops from 1-group nameds.  Judging from the fact that VP level stuff drops from exp groups in GoD, I would expect elemental level loot in the level 70 dungeons in OoW.  <br />
<br />
LDoN is not the end all be all for casual players, and if I was a non-raider I would be thanking the SOE gods for not making the standard path for casuals just doing LDoN for the rest of eternity.</div></div><hr />

Once again you prove you know jack-fuckin-squat about raiding these days.  If you had ever bothered to get past BoT towers and Xanamech, you'd see content where everyone has a job they have to play flawlessly in order to win ... rallos zek comes to mind ...  now, some of these jobs are as simple as blowing every offensive disc you have at the right times or emptying your manabar nuking, but the average player on serious encounters has a potential alternate job which is crucial to the success of the raid.   Rangers and the mud ring .... practically everyone and add kiting in RZ script ... Offtanks and enchanter mini-raid teams and the rathe ... blah.<br />
<br />
Instead, you casually assume that every encounter is an autoattack, heal one or 2 tank zerg-fest. <br />

<br />
You fight TZ at range, take down the adds that come with VZ first before killing the real one, and you take down RZ twice, the second time kiting the adds with bards and AoE taunt warriors or any other non damage AoE ability while the enchanters pick a few of them up for pets.<br />

Brutul, it might be PC to call it Elemental Armor, but it's Raex Armor, the armor set that drops in PoTime/EP's. Take a look at the flagging requirements I met to acquire that set some time - easily 20 flags killing numerous VERY hard (in some cases 8 ettempts before a success * 72 players * 3 hours) EP boss mobs to say nothing at being at every raid needed to farm a guild into as much EP/PoTime armor as necessary.<br />
<br />
I believe my effort was 1 year at 3-7 raids at week at 4 hours per raid to get my set of Raex. And that's just quantity of effort, it says nothing about the quality of effort.<br />
<br />
I think &quot;asking&quot; for PoTime/EP armor in exchange for killing Nillipus 10,000 times is terribly presumptuous.<br />
<br />
Interesingly, I have no real problem with opening up Tower of South Ro with a non-progression flag quest and seeing casuals EARN a set of Kizrak's by killing something a bit harder than the trivial mobs found in LDoN Normal Collect 25's.<br />
<br />
You bet I would be upset if you could turn in 1000 Orc Pawn Scalps for a Darkblade of the Warlord. That goes for the BP I got by getting all the way to PoTime and participating in killing Quarm too. This is the BP and gauntlets I'm wearing right now that I have been thus far unable to replace with Vadd's.<br />
<br />
I really really wish Furor still played and saw things like this - casual players wanting to sell back LDoN BP's and buy a Raex BP with Adventure Points gained killing mobs in LDoN Normal Collect 25's. I really really would like to read his reply - it would be a classic and probably read by gameplayers playing every game until the last 20 sided-die came to rest as the universe went cold.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>xwraithx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">One question.  Has anyone bought and fully augmented a suit of tak armor yet?  Is there one warrior that any of you guys know that ground out that many points and bought all the gear/augments?  We're talking months and months of nightly LDoN grinding just to get Tak armor.  Is 2000 point EP armor really an option that anyone would buy?  Honestly I don't see how it would be a problem to put it in now because it will be at least a year before anyone would save the points to buy all that stuff and augment it to EP level, and by then there will be at least 2 more expansions and raiders will be several levels beyond elemental planes gear.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I would never, ever, do that much LDoN, but anyone willing to grind 16000 LDoN points (2000 points times 8 visible armor slots = 160 hards or 320 normals, and then you don't have any augments or non-visible gear yet) can certainly have elemental planes armor if they want it IMO.  Frankly though I can't see many people ever doing that much LDoN.  Certainly not a &quot;casual&quot; player.  LDoN has been out for a year and a half now?  And most servers top person on the leaderboard is somewhere around 500 wins (just going by the tarew stats).  Everyone on the top of the leaderboard that I've seen were also time geared when LDoN came out and thus able to rip through LDoNs easily from day 1.  In the time it takes to do that you could create a new character, level him to 65 with a couple hundred AA, join a guild and get far better than elemental gear easily.  <br />
<br />
I don't see why any raider would be threatened by this, but at the same time, I can't see why any casual/non raider would want to do that much LDoN hehe.<br />
<br />
Here is a magelo of my friend's warrior that I recreated in order to keep him anon (I don't think he knows that I am using him as reference....if he allows, I will post his name and server after I ask).<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1075311<br />
<br />
He has a few weak spots (neck, back), but other than that, what else do you suppose him do to progress if he doesn't raid?  We do LDoN because we don't want to break up our small 'family' type guilds.  But once you hit this cap, there's not much in the game anymore, at least until the next expansion comes out, given that it doesn't cater to raiding only.<br />
<br />
A set of armor better than LDoN Tak but below Elemental quality would suit our needs perfectly.  We wouldn't be overshadowed by elemental/time tanks in terms of doing current content.   I mean, if it's hard for those types of tanks, how would tanks below that tier do in the content?</div></div><hr />

EP quality to non-raider means better than Tak but likely not as good as Raex, that is how I read it. I NEVER expected to be wearing Raex equiv boots in my feet slot. Now that would be out of balance till at least an expansion past OoW (mudflation you know). But then I would be Lvl 80 :)<br />

I am still the LDON leader on CT, even though I have not done an ldon in a month, and could have had a full set of LDON armor augmented if I had wanted it with the amount of points I have earned I Have well over 700 wins.<br />
<br />
That being said I think the armor while nice is a bit behind.  Elemental armor is no longer current so having LDON's give armor that is close to Elemental in stats should not be a problem.<br />
<br />
In fact it would even help raiders as it is very hard to get plate drops in elementals and time zones.  Thats why I am still wearing LDON arms, BP, and Helm.<br />
<br />
As I posted earlier Kytherea is saying there will be some close to elemental gear added to LDON<br />
<br />
 believe elemental-calibre is the term here... meaning that the intent is to make higher level equipment available through LDoN equipment equivalent to elemental/time gear but not the exact same things you can get in the elemental zones or time.<br />

One quesiton Apo, if you are a &quot;casual&quot; raider and all raiders (not just casuals) could benefit from updated LDoN equipment, and LDoN pt gathering is so easy relative to raiding, THEN WHY ARE YOU BITCHING?  RAIDERS COULD GET IT TOO. <br />
<br />
You would think those raiders who are waiting for their time bp (I should have done tak but once I stuck 150K - never had luck farming it - in Kiz I felt horrible wasting it) would be happy, but wait the only people bitching already have better than the proposed new armor and couldnt benefit in the gearing up phase for Ep/GoD armor.<br />
<br />
Ahh now all is clear, except for you of course, whom I still dont understand.<br />
<br />
For those of you who think this game is risk/reward I think you are fooling yourself. This game is risk vs reward vs time spent. ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS APPEARS TO BE IN THE FUTURE. Half the stuff people wear has little or no risk, the bazaar weeded out the true risk takers. And dont tell me farming Time for the bazilllionth time is risky. Not with graveyards. IN EQ RISK = RISK OF TIME WASTED not risk of real loss. LDoN is by definition a waste of time for all but the pts as I can get an AA in the same time I get 0.4 in LDoN while getting better cash sellable drops in several Tier 2-3 zones. Even without PEM in GoD, Barindu and Ferubi are better. Hard LDoNs are better but there the risk is loss of time for no (or 1/4) pts not risk of anything real happening.<br />

Raex armor is not only current, but the number of Warriors having better than a Raex BP I'm fairly certain is fewer than 150. The Quarm dropped Raex BP is arguably better than a Vadd BP unless you also have Vadd's gauntlets. The Quarm dropped Raex BP is near the pinacle of achievement for the Wariror Class and perhaps only owned by 300 or so Warriors game-wide.<br />

1)-  It all started with a complaint that sony went back on it's word<br />

3)-  Things got back to the topic of whether or not sony officially said it was going to happen<br />
4)-  A few people said that Raaj relayed a msg saying it was definitely going to happen.<br />
5)-  Myself (primarily) and a few others asserted that it was just hearsay and possibility to be discussed rather than a promise of things to come.<br />
6)-  The afformentioned people insisted that Raaj would not lie to them as he had clearly stated that it is what sony told him.<br />
7)-  I proposed that Raaj perhaps invested too much confidence in hearsay and word of mouth if that, indeed, was the message that he conveyed to the community<br />
8)-  Finally it all came to a head when Raaj came here and explained that he never stated the things on the list he presented to us was nothign more than works in progress that would be decided and voted on later ... which takes us back to point 4.<br />

From level 1 forward players aren't able to get the same mobs killed and don't reap the same rewards. LDoN (unfortunately) has allowed players to grind out 1,000 trivial Collect 25 Normals and acquire good gear. They are not however killing Quarm and Quarm loot should never drop off an Orc Pawn or be acquireable for killing 1000 of them and turning in their scalps.<br />

Ain't this the truth. While there are some exceptional leaders and contributors in raid guilds / heavy duty pick-up raid organizations, at least 1/2 of them are just along for the ride. I'm sure many or all of you who feel raiding is &quot;hard&quot; are in the first half, and I applaud you for it. I'd love to be there, but I just don't have the time to build up and maintain a guild, and I haven't found someone elses that I'm really excited about. EQ has some bizzare sense of equality, in that &quot;I was on the raid, and we did something hard, so I must have contributed as much as everone else&quot;.  I've lead my share of pickup raids, and it ain't easy, but I can assure you everyone in attendance thinks they need a shot at any drops.<br />
<br />
I've also attended my share of raids. In my opinion, difficult 1-group content is FAR more difficult, engaging and FUN than half-afking for 3 hours during a zerg raid on non-cutting edge content. Note, I don't consider easy ldon's to be FUN or remotely challenging, nor do I think anyone should be able to do 1000 easy ldons and get elemental level pieces. However, I know lots of elemental geared players that won't do hard ldons. Doing 1000 easy ldons is about as hard as half-afking through a few hundred elemental raids with a zerg guild or PUR, so why not let people pick their poison? Elemental quality pieces buyable only with hard ldon points makes solid sense to me.<br />
<br />
Don't kid yourself that you're doing the same trailblazing in elementals and time that was happening 2 years ago when PoP came out. When time was cutting edge content, I'd wager top-end tanks were barely buffing to 9k when they broke into time. To boot, they didn't have augged weapons, sturdiness, wa5, or DI-1 to make their lives easier. Now, I get snears from people thinking I should have 10khp to tank in hard LDoN's and GoD sewers. Mudflation has made elementals/time somewhat trivial content, but yet those of us that aren't interested in raiding with 72 of our best friends get screwed out of  the progression.<br />
<br />
I don't think anybody is saying we should be able to buy Raex from ldon, but at this point, EVEN CONSIDERING GoD, there are NO VIABLE VISIBLE SLOT UPGRADES available to non-raiders. Ornate / RA is as good as they get. Thats BS, given that we can get non-visible slots from GoD/VP with double the hp of the best visible slot pieces we have available. I'd REALLY prefer the top end armor be class specific, too. RA for clerics is a stupidly good deal, vs for warriors it's only so/so when compared to ornate.<br />
<br />
The same goes for weapons. If I want to kill or quest for my weapons, and I prefer to play with a 6 man group, my best weapon combo possiblity at this point is a GBoS+CHoS or so. Thats a far cry from the quality of weapons available to other classes without raiding, or to the weapons available to raiders of my calibre.<br />
<br />
My other complaint: GoD drops are great, but they're mostly all/all or all melee and have shite for ac. Are we supposed to just win all the AC augs or something?</div></div><hr />

However it's out of control and has been for awhile now, it's the rule rather than the exception. I think it would be cool as hell if people could progress through the game in certain orders (not strictly, but a general path) experiencing the same things older players did. Don't misunderstand me --  It's not because I think they should have to, I just think they would enjoy it and have a lot more to do with their time.<br />

Mudflation might help 'casual' players, but it hurts them just as much imo. If you couldn't buy Ntov quality items in the Bazaar, you would be grinding out Ntov instead of boring ass ldon. It's cyclic.</div></div><hr />

AC wise, tak gear is NOTHING in comparison to Raex. For other classes (particularly cleric, imo) tak is a GREAT option. For warriors, especially those more interested in tankability instead of e-penis hp count, it's nigh unto worthless. My ornate gear has the same and better AC than the tak gear does, and was much faster to acquire.<br />

<br />
Brutul's observation that you can PL a Warrior to 65, bazaar equip him and end up duplicating my first 2 1/2 years of hardcore raiding effort in 2 months is actually a sad commentary. This is why there are less than 100 days played Warriors clammoring for loot they can not earn. Does Yantis sell 65 Warriors with 400 AA's in full Kizrak? - shucks why even play a toon - just buy one. &quot;All that effort to do well in current content is toooo hard! We should be able to buy a toon ready to do Qvic and beyond. Come on - OoW's coming out - GoD is OLD content.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is a progession path. And the good news for newer player is that they don't have to kill Trak, or VT/Ssra/Seru. They can skip 2 1/2 years of EQ, do the flags to get into PoTime, gear up, and be right exactly where hardcore raiders are after four years of effort. That's more than plenty of mudflation. Up up down down left right left right Start cheat codes aren't necessary.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">EP quality gear (and better) already drops off 1 groupable encounters in GoD ... and Tak armor is pretty damn close to weak EP gear as is.  The only difference is that this time the gear isnt sellable in the bazaar, and you still need to do the content (tuned slightly more appropriately in the case of GoD) to get the rewards.<br />
<br />
The progression path is already there to take a person to EP quality without raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where?  I have gone as far as tipt and haven't seen any elemental level gear drop yet.  I'm not talking about the smith, that's a raid encounter.  The best 1-groupable item for a warrior that I know of is the Tipt bracer, which is 4 ac 10 hps below an elemental bracer.  If you're saying casual players should go to Kod'Taz and do ikkinz trials for gear you're not being realistic.  I am in almost full elemental gear and Tipt is still freaking hardcore for me to get through, haven't beaten it yet in fact.<br />
<br />
I happen to agree that elemental level LDoN vendor gear isn't a good idea.  Not because it would be too powerful at this stage of the game, but because putting better gear in an expansion that has been out for a year doesn't make sense.  It's like saying if you kill Vyemm 3 times for no loot he will drop a Talisman of Vah Kerrath instead of his normal loot.  I do think hardcore non-raiders should have a way to get elemental-level gear with OOW though, and they shouldn't have to be able to kill rallos zek to get it either.<br />
<br />
If you make old progression a requirement, then it is virtually impossible for a player starting today to every reach the top end level.  I see no reason why this should be the way things are.  The fact that you started playing before someone else entitles you to be superior to them in perpetuity?  That's just not the way the game works.  In three more expansions should you still have to go to Plane of Time to get past Ikkinz trials?  When the ubers are killing things 10x harder?</div></div><hr />

GoD one man group drops up to Tipt are equivalent to Cazic Thule, plane of fear god drops, with slight exceptions here and there (cudgel of oppressor and  polished garnet loop in vxed, heartstriker bracer in tipt) that are just slightly below elemental quality.  They are nowhere close to elemental, unless you mean the 1 groupable named in elementals that drop stuff nobody really wants at that progression level.<br />
<br />
The problem with casuals who want some sort of progression is that the drops do not give enough of an upgrade to get through some of the harder one man group events.  If people are telling me that Tipt and above is brutal for even elemental/early time toons, imagine how difficult it would be for someone in LDoN armor to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">Elemental quality pieces buyable only with hard ldon points makes solid sense to me.<br />
<br />
Here, here!  It should either be in hards or in some new type of expedition that has its own points system and presents a suitable challenge for the upper end of non elem geared tanks.  The tipt bracer is great if you can get it, but a non elem geared tank will have a really rough time doing so.  <br />
<br />
As has been pointed out, the AC is a huge issue for tanks who aren't hardcore raiders.  Nothing we can get begins to approach elem armor AC.  Our lack of AC kills us in GoD.  The mountain trials in particular are brutal on non-elem geared tanks while they're similarly geared caster brethren are just fine there.  It's the high ATK on the mobs.  Buffed AC in the 1600s like mine just sucks against those mobs.  And I have the loyalist shield, four +10 AC augs from ldon, a rallos zek helm, an ldon nro bp, etc. etc.  I've buffed AC up about every way I can without elem gear.  I haven't reached Kod'Taz yet even though I just gimped a Tipt win by watching a charmed pet do most of the tanking (still have 3 sewers to do), but I assume Kod'Taz mobs are similarly brutal against a non elem geared tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how would you recommend non-raiders acquire EP-equivalent armor? <br />
Raid.<br />
If you don't want to raid, or you don't have the time, you don't get the gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Binn, I know you have your own agenda but my question very specifically asked what non-raiders should do.  The question also specifically asked that you assume that the non-raiders in question would like to progress through Ikkinz one-group trials 1-3 (i.e. we are not talking about casual players who don't have the time, we are talking about driven and determined nonraiders).  <br />
<br />
Again, I ask you, how would you recommend non-raiders who have a desire to progress into extremely difficult content, acquire EP-equivalent armor?  If your answer is, they cannot and should not, I'll accept that.  It means essentially that your worldview cannot accept such a alternative and so you cannot meaningfully contribute to the discussion. <br />
<br />
As an aside, I find it strange that the most adamant detractors from the LDoN model are those warriors who it appears have just broken into the elemental planes and often times have not taken the effort to even better themselves individually.  Binnamar, you compare non-raiders to Janitors...yet you are wearing a solstice earring, but wielding an edge of eternity.  You see, to me it looks like you can't get anything or you have chosen not to get anything unless your guild gets it for you.  Whereas all the non-raiders are asking for is an avenue, difficult and time-intensive, to acquire upgrades all for themselves and by themselves.  <br />
<br />
If they did happen to implement this elemental armor, I'd at least hope you'd need like 20 hard adventures to unlock it, not 40 normal. Don't bitch at the numbers, they were just random.<br />
<br />
Binn, I agree.  That is in fact exactly what I proposed in my second post on the very first page.  As I said before, nonraiders are not interested in getting something for free.  They are interested in &quot;earning&quot; their DKP, but doing it in a group setting rather than a 72-man raid setting. <br />
<br />
<br />
The game is very raid heavy at the moment, however, after LoY, LDoN, and the single group GoD progressions, you can't say they haven't been making an effort, but these things come in time. The devs can't shut the game down, stop all development, and rewrite the code in a month, hell 3 months time<br />
<br />
<br />
Vikken, I disagree.  LDoN was undoubtedly a non-raider expansion.  It was the first of its kind in two expansions.  I do not, however, consider LoY a non-raider expansion.  Actually, I consider it completely worthless sans the map and dye tool.  The experience in LoY is miserable comparatively speaking, and after spending a month crawling through the zones I wouldn't say there is great progression available there either (both content-wise and gear-wise).   I also do not consider GoD a non-raider expansion, although I do understand that there is some non-raider content available. <br />
<br />
Basically, as I posted a few pages back, I fear that raiding is the vast majority of what is being discussed for the future of EQ.  OoW looks at the moment to be a variation on GoD and that means I expect another artificial flag-like barrier to decide what zones players can &quot;hack&quot; it in, rather than the difficulty of the content.  This has been the model in effect since Luclin and it is slowly killing the game.  Yes, EQ is still popular, but you cannot tell me that you haven't personally seen people leaving in droves.  Being in a raiding guild, I believe it actually effects raiders hardest as they tend to burn out from the need to sacrifice RL in order to comply with the playstyle needed to progress.   But having played with non-raiders during my entire EQ existence, I also know that this burn-out effects casuals as well, just in a different way.  Rather than burning out, casuals give up because they understand that under the current model a large portion of the content will never be available to them.  You can argue about the &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; of that feeling, but the fact is the feeling exists.  My conclusion is that both raiders and nonraiders are wilting under this unhealthy gaming model.  The model needs to change, but I don't see much momentum over in EQ headquarters to change it...</div></div><hr />

Thanks, sass...I will post this info to our boards to help our warriors out.<br />
<br />
There is still a bit of a problem.  Half the stuff you posted is dropped really rarely from Sewers or Vxed or Ferubi off trash mobs.  In all our time (I am talking at least 100 hours guild-wide) in Sewers, Vxed, Ferubi, and Barindu we have gotten one Turepta Ring, one Chanting Mask, and one Mantle of Ferociousness (which my friend got...forgot to update his Magelo I guess).  The 2 drops from Kod'Taz also, as I understand it, are rare drops from trash mobs.<br />
<br />
I'll pass the idea of 2 velium weapons to him, but riposte on GoD mobs is very very painful.<br />
<br />
As for VP, I'm afraid our server has no pickup raids going for this atm, or if there is, I haven't heard of it.  I'd love to get into VP to do some of these quests, but again for now we are blocked by the raid event.  Maybe I can talk some people into leading one or something.<br />
<br />
As for Seru, yep we are currently working towards him by farming some seru bane weapons (not enough distance dpsers atm).  We already have the key, so hopefully we can field 18ish people against him and win.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the ideas, but again, a lot of those upgrades you posted are just not reliable or are comparable to what he has (IE kizrak greaves vs burnished antique - kizrak = 5 more ac, burnished has 20 more hp...basically the same).</div></div><hr />

Well BB there are two problems with your scenario.<br />
<br />
1. While some of us would like to go ahead and &quot;do the progression&quot;, finding a guild thats doing it that will stay together is nigh unto impossible. Most people use such guilds as a stepping stone to jump into elemental/time guilds as soon as they can get away with it. For warriors, that tends to be later than most other classes on my server. This generally sucks, for bunches of reasons, and I'm not of the opinion I want to have anything to do with it, and I just don't have the time to start my own guild and recruit people carefully.<br />
<br />
2. Afaic, in the case of warrior visible slot armor, assuming a guild isn't an option, a solid two levels of &quot;non top of the line&quot; progression gear (for visible slots) is unavailable. SSRA/VT/SSeru gear isn't 1-groupable by non-time+ geared people yet, and elementals are obviously out of reach. That means we're stuck with Ornate/RA gear which (at least AC wise) just doesn't compare with VT/Seru/Elemental.<br />
<br />
BTW. Like it or not, Raex, time gear or not, isn't top of the line anymore. Vadd's is the new king, and Raex is the progression path.<br />
<br />
The fact is, assuming warrior gear is high ac, we get screwed pretty hard for 1-groupable upgrades compared to just about every other class.<br />
<br />
All I can say is I'm hopeing to hell level 70 brings SSRA/Seru into 1-group range for me and my friends.</div></div><hr />

Zejeer on the SOE boards was amenable to the idea of adding quests to raise this faction, so perhaps he would be amenable to an alternate entry quest too.

Your progression path would demand several hundred hours of work be spent on relatively useless and out-of-date gear before a player should be granted the opportunity to be in top-of-the-line gear.  In my opinion, this is akin to Frat houses arguing that Rush Week, no matter how dangerous or abusive, must remain the same as it was becasue, after all, the current order had to go through it.  Or my grandpa complaining that I had it easy because I got to take a bus to school but he had to walk through the snow...for two miles...uphill...both ways.  EQ is a malleable game.  There are people coming and people going; people who raid all the time and people who group all the time; people who play 100 hours a week and people who play 10.  The game concept has to be able to embrace all these players.  I think EQ started out right but got off on the wrong foot somewhere along the way. <br />
<br />
There has got to be a safer and healthier model.  A model that does not require people to live a certain lifestyle in order to incorporate a progression playstyle.   What you are advocating, BB, is unreasonable and it is why EQ loses so many players every month.   Should a player wish to experience old content, they absolutely should have that right.  Should a player wish to experience new content instead, I think they should have that right as well.  Whether or not the player can HACK the new content (which ought to be the underlying basis for whether or not he uses the content) is another question entirely.   Essentially, the reason why the LDoN progression means so much to me and some other non raiders is that I view this progression as one of the few ways that I can outfit myself TO hack the new content.  And the reason why I think the raiders disagree with the proposal is either because they do not want to compete with non-raiders in their zones for content or because they simply feel obliged to uphold the &quot;old values,&quot; which in essence required them to make sacrifices to earn gear.  And it follows, then, that they find their sacrifices more worthy than the time and effort it might take non-raiders to acquire equivalent gear in Hard LDons. <br />
<br />
I don't necessarily have the answer, I'm not a game designer genius, but I truly and honestly believe that requiring players to drudge through 4-year-old content in order to have &quot;earned their stripes&quot; is skewed.  It underscores a sense of entitlement that I do not think exists.</div></div><hr />

To reach the pinnacle of any game demands a heavy investment. I played with a chess tutor from about age 12 on, getting serious from 15 to 17. Beating a German Master, losing to an Expert in the very next round and burning out my feeble run at age 22. I played M:TG and traveled to find sanctioned tournaments. I studied and analyed decks.

The reality is it takes guys equipped essentially to that level (or VERY VERY good, but most of us dont fit that bill, or a grp with some Time+ help) to get it so its almost self-defeating. I have yet to see someone put up this GoD 1grpable infamous magelo profile and its because its not feasible for an even above average person who is not EP flagged to do. Just because in theory the equipment is available to a single grp doesnt mean that a single grp can do it (a Time grp maybe, maybe an EP grp not for example). And by the way, Tak is NOT sellable as u semi imply above. Ornate is pretty much as good as gets for buyable with minor situation specific exceptions.  GD<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u158"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p158">I disagree totally.One group stuff is nothing compared to taking a raiding guild to time as a dedicated member or leader what not.Hard LDON and Ferubi etc test very basic skills and game mechanics.You can only heal so fast with one cleric ,one shammy and a particular tank so gear is the determining factor for a tank in say hard LDON.The puller needs a little skill,everyone else needs stuff so basic to any decent raider that has worked up to the ep's it's completely trivial.Raids are a lot more challenging for the people who are working hard because the variables are greater and the targets often more complicated with attrition to the raid force. <br />
<br />
The challenges to a progressive raiding guild are many and test it's worthwhile individuals much more than any LDON.If it's so easy then form your guild and raid through the content,yeh ,yeh,lots of excuses and personal qualms.Wth, in one group stuff I tank anything that comes to the group that doesn't get cc'd 1-5 mobs usually.I can do that in my sleep.If the dps is attentive to my aggro it's usually smooth and if not they die or i pick it back up fast.In many raids we can have the force to easily win and still fail while working hard because of things way beyond any one persons control.The raid has to sync well and people often have to act quickly on their own with inititive to win.Just prioritizing on raids for a lot of folks can be a difficult task that makes or breaks the encounter.I almost never have that problem in a group and if I do its easy to fix.<br />
<br />
Some people have obviously had bad experiences on raids and I will never convince them that raiding &gt;grouping for skill and gaming challenge/shrug.I do those same LDONs you're talking about while goofing off chatting and relaxing.They don't compare to me at clearing at 90+kph through robe eating reds and confronting difficult encounters that strong guilds wipe to over and over.Never mind that working as part of a team that size requires you to exercise character that just isn't tested with a group of your friends .It's not the same at all.The eq game evolved long time to make raiding the premier effort with the best rewards.You start out soloing when you begin playing.You progress to casual grouping then skilled grouping.Then you raid...the biggest challenge with the biggest rewards.If you only want to solo thats fine,but, it doesn't pay out like a good group will.If you want to group that's fine too.It also will not yield the same rewards garnered by equal content raid mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyways I've met lots of people who seem to have spent all their playtime in LDON.That's fine if it's fun for them,but, generally without more exposure their game awareness and skills are really lacking.EQ is a big world with a lot of rich old content to explore.All of that content should not be replaced by LDON because everyone finds it the easiest path for upgrades that's unbalancing.If everyone gets ep drops from endlessly LDONing it will make Velious and Luclin worthless and that content is great eq experience.A lot more interesting than LDON.<br />
<br />
In the end things in our eq world should make some sense.When it takes 50-72 determined  ep raiders to drop ep molds the same stuff should not be dropped by presently one groupable mobs or by beating trivial LDON's over and over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">Gunnar there is really no reason to expound upon the difficulties of raiding.  Most people know that raiding isn't &quot;easy&quot;.  But they also know that not every single person in a guild is necessarily working hard at every raid all the time.  You have your pull team, they're usually working pretty hard.  You have your Cleric healing team, they at least have to have their timing down pat which isn't always a given.   You have a few debuffers and buffers who get hasseled.  You have your main tank.  You have a hand full of off tanks and add tanks.  And you have your people who are planning strats and tactics, who are also typically in the pull team or in close communication with it.<br />
<br />
Of the 72 people in a full blown raid, you have maybe 20 or 25 of those who are actually actively thinking and struggling.  The rest, for the most part, are using their assist key and either hitting auto attack or punching spell buttons.  Hell, I'm willing to wager that the majority of people being so vocal about raiding being so hard don't even fall into the 20 to 25 catagory of people who actually do work hard on a raid.</div></div><hr />

No. This is wrong.  This is the propoganda that raiders choose to believe.  It has been posted by Apolyon 20 times in this thread, by BB just before, by Aidya in some blathering tirade earlier, and by several other well-meaning but disillusioned raiders. <br />
<br />
This debate is not about casuals versus raiders.  This debate is about non-raiders versus raiders.  I think Brutul established a few pages back that casual players (and most raiders) will not put in the effort required to obtain current LDoN armor much less any future upgraded armor.  The time-investment is enormous. <br />
<br />
So that our definitions match, lets discuss what I mean by &quot;non-raider.&quot;  I mean an individual who dedicates his or her non-work time to playing Everquest, invests in upgrading his or her character with gear and new content experiences, and plans for the future.  <br />
<br />
It may not be kosher to identify a player who posts on this form but because I was so impressed, I'll do it anyway and hope he doesn't mind.  Brutonius is a warrior on Povar who is guilded with Heroes Unlimited, an very small guild.  When I first started replaying Vigdis three weeks ago and I looked at the eqrankings for Povar I saw his Magelo above several EP-guild warriors and I saw the tag after his name and I assumed he had created a faux magelo with EP gear.  To my surprise he had not.  <br />
<br />
Brutonius has 7264 HP unbuffed.  If you look at his magelo you'll see that he has max auged the Tak BP and arms, and has a number of other Hard LDoN peices.  He also has the Tipt bracer, and several other GoD farmed peices.  He has maxxed his HP AA.  I patterned my own dream profile after his, once I had confirmed it through my own Ally's searches of course.  When the new VP quests were released I immediately updated my own dream profile to reflect that and was not at all surprised that Brutonius had done likewise with his dream profile. <br />
<br />
This is a profile of a non-raider (or at least a non &quot;hard core EP raider&quot;) http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=217047&amp;alt=0.  His HPs beat out the raiding Apolyon's and several other half-raiders on this thread. <br />
<br />
So don't tell me that non raiders don't wisht o put in the effort.  I have stated on countless occassions that it simply isn't true.  Non raiding players put in hours of effort into this game and would put in yet still more difficult hours pounding out Hard LDON's for the opportunity to acquire EP-equivalent LDoN armor purchasable only with hard points.  <br />
<br />
How can you possibly suggest that &quot;they dont want to invest the time into either raiding or bettering themsevles&quot; when we the starting place for this discussion is a proposal that players be permitted to purchase EP-equivalent armor through thousands of points spent on ONLY Hard LDoNs?  I say once again, we ARE earning our DKP, we are just doing it with a group and not 72 other people.  There is not presently another alternative path for acquiring the equivalent in the 8 main visible armor peices.  The GoD thread proved it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u162"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p162">Well Glatius that runs contrary to my experience.At any given moent a few people can usually afford to slack,but,that kinda attitude will get you wiped often.All of our tanks run around at mach 9 throughout raids with stuff to do.When one person not playing at full speed makes an error it can often cause a wipe.A large pct of your raid force can only slack if what you are doing has become trivial and even then it will get you into trouble.Btw for 99+pct of my raid time in this guild I have been MA or SA.There's no challenge to LDON for me I get a target to tank or maybe a cpl in hard and decide where i want aggro focused and switch tank with slower assisting me to debuff,produce enough aggro for heals on all un cc'd adds,then focus on a target and positioning.Honestly ,if you do that on our  raids every day it's far more challenging.Things happen way faster and the other tanks have often to pick up raid destroying aggro.Being situationally aware and fast to act on your own iniitive with care is far more important on raids.<br />
<br />
Besides.Tougher stuff should drop better stuff.You can kill tougher stuff with more people,skill and coordination.That makes sense ...thats the payoff.</div></div><hr />

Noone is trying to tell you that ldon is hard. I'm nowhere near overpowered for hard ldons, but I haven't lost one yet and my cleric friend and I gave up on stacking our groups long ago. I'm bored of doing them already, and I don't have 1/4 of the drops I have on my upgrade wishlist. However, for me doing hard ldons is about like you doing tipt. Were you not referring to how hard tipt is in another thread? Thats single group content, friend.<br />
<br />
I've hit tipt a few times, and generally when we wipe it's because someone isn't paying attention for a split second. With a raid force, thats a non-issue. That enc can afk at the wrong second and someone else can pick up the slack.<br />
<br />
I agree that the coordination of a raid force is difficult, but otoh, you can also overpower the encounter with 72 people when you should only need 36. That makes it a lot less necessary for people to pay attention. I'm not saying thats what you do, but I am saying thats all thats required to get that gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">Nah tipt is hard in strictly a mob hits me really hard type way.It is the hardest of the stuff I group and I expend no where near the focus or energy I do raiding.If I take a group of our raiders into Tipt with a pet and pulls don't get botched it's simple(stupid pookas).It is THE hardest one group stuff that I've done.If i tank without a pet and low dps healing is a real challenge.But, thats just one person focusing on one tank....simple stuff.You may or may not have the strength to out heal the mobs dps...no skill there.Certainly,tactics in tipt and the penalty for doing something silly is way higher than LDON.Still it is absolutely nothing compared to Corinav or even clearing to fro hehe.<br />

PS.I play eq for fun and being with a guild of people trying to always overcome new stuff(despite my very limited playtime and horrible rl schedule) is great stuff. :) I don't respect anyone because they raid or do not.Means nothing to me in terms of respect.Lotta crass people raid fine though drama often accompanys them.</div></div><hr />

You should note that there are key differences in terms of raiding difficulty depending on the restrictions in place. Places you can bring 100 people are obviously more open to slacking. Even 10/100 people slacking means nothing. When you have a cap of 72 though it hurts a bit more. Caps of 54 or even 36 (ldon) push people a lot harder.<br />

Ask your wizards how much attention they pay during raids. Or rogues? Or your fifth in line warrior? I'm not going to argue that you're not on the ball the whole time. Thats great for you. However if I attempt to join a raid guild, I WILL be relegated to sixth assist or something equally lame, and sit there doing nothing. If I'm lucky they'll give me some drops and one day I'll be ubah.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that you're on the 2nd newest server, and because of it it probably isn't nearly as top-heavy as the other servers. You got to do a nice clean progressoin because of a clean server.<br />
<br />
Note you also made qualifications about tipt being easy. Group of raiders (EP+ geared?). Using a pet? Pulls not getting botched? Thats like saying coirnav is easy when you take a group of 72 Time+ geared people who have done it before and everything goes well. Of course it is.</div></div><hr />

Agreed 100%. Down with the zerg. Capped enounters are where it's at. I'd love to be able to do some of them but my shots at getting KT flagged and into a guild doing them are basically limited to getting ELE/Time geared first.

Brutul, thats a hard ldon profile. The alternate one is a GoD profile, but I'm skeptical some of the stuff in it is doable with the gear he'd have prior to getting there. I'll know in a few months, I guess.<br />
<br />
And yes. A lot of that stuff sucks compared to VT. GoD drops just don't give us worthwhile AC, and he's still relying on RA armor at 35AC a slot after a huge amount of effort put into farming ikkinz and kt named. I'm not in KT yet, but judging by how bad I get eaten up in tipt, that 1677 AC (barely as high as a decent elemental tank) is gonna get chewed.</div></div><hr />

And hence the complaint. TONS of EP level tanks complain about not being able to beat tipt. Yet the drops that are equivalent to their gear requires better than their gear to get to? The pre-KT GoD drops absolutely pale in comparison to the post KT stuff and EP gear.</div></div><hr />

If I die in a raid the 2nd tank picks it up, I get a rez, and things go on.  If I die in Tipt the whole group wipes and we start over.  I MT'd the whole Fennin ring except for the big guy himself a couple weeks ago while talking on the phone.  Not to say I had my best night as MT, but there's no way I could get through tipt playing the way I did that night, and that was my guild's 2nd kill on Fennin.

I beg to disagree. On drinal there is an open raiding organization that nails EP's every night from midnight until about 4 est. They have a dkp system, and I could join them if I had an RZ flag. I would get EP drops for my time. I would be low on the tanking totem pole, and I assure you my level of concentration would be nothing like it is in a hard ldon or GoD trial. Sorry, but your experience is not that of the average EP raider nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">Get over yourself with your intense concentration to be a raider.  I am MA 40-50% of the time on our elemental planes raids, and Tipt is as intense for me as anything we raid, probably more so.  If I die in a raid the 2nd tank picks it up, I get a rez, and things go on.  If I die in Tipt the whole group wipes and we start over.  I MT'd the whole Fennin ring except for the big guy himself a couple weeks ago while talking on the phone.  Not to say I had my best night as MT, but there's no way I could get through tipt playing the way I did that night, and that was my guild's 2nd kill on Fennin.  Now from what my friends tell me about Uqua and Txevu there are definitely some intense fights where everything has to go right, but for the most part raiding isn't much different from exp group dungeon crawling as far as difficulty and concentration goes.<br />
<br />
Pushing the envelope with single groups is pretty challenging actually -- as long as you're challenging yourself. Many players don't, which leads to them being bored. Some of my best memories are in single groups getting someplace we really had no business being.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think this question has been answered, but no this is not an example of EP level gear.<br />
<br />
This profile is an example of an extremely dedicated non-raiding player.  I pointed it out to refute Apolyon's and others' comments that non-raiders refuse to put in the effort to acquire gear.  This player has close to top-of-the-line gear available for someone who does not raid and his profile indicates that he has spent countless hours farming both GoD and Hard LDoN.  He has more HP than the GoD test profile in the bunker thread and more HP than many of the &quot;raiding&quot; warriors who have posted in this thread, including Apolyon, who continues to argue that non-raiders are too lazy to acquire their gear. <br />
<br />
Yet, as you note, the magelo is worse than unaugmented VT gear.  And THAT is my point.  The very best non-raiding profile that I have seen - one that shows the player's dedication to grinding in new content and old boring LDoNs - pales in comparison to raid content four expansions old.   In essence you have made my point for me, Brutul (and, yes, I know you weren't arguing against it in the first place).  A new level of gear is for dedicated non-raiders is needed.<br />

He already made it through Tipt.  He's wearing the bracer.  <br />

Groups comprised solely of my guildmates have wiped the floor with trials 1-6 several times, and we arent EP flagged yet.  Nor did we spend the month + of key farming to play around in VT.  You dont need Time or even EP gear to break into KT.  As to this magelo &quot;paling in comparison to VT gear&quot; ...

VT gear is grossly over-rated for the most part.  There are a few isolated pieces which are abolutely amazing, but by-in-large that entire zone is 100% bypassable.</div></div><hr />

I agree, but I think we will see it in a couple months or so when OOW comes out.  The rumor I heard was that OOW will only have one keyed/flagged zone, and the rest you will be able to zone into from day 1 (although you probably won't want to if you're in bazaar gear hehe).  If I was a non-raider I would far rather see my upgrade path through new content than through another 800 trips through the same 5 dungeons I've been doing over and over for the last year.</div></div><hr />

Of course you didn't.  They couldn't put 40HP augs in half their armor slots and 20HP augs in the other half.  They didn't have AA's that yielded 700HP. <br />
<br />
But if you look at the gear itself, rather than at the overall profile of a nonraider who HAS acquired all of his HP AAs and many of the HP augs, you'll note that several peices of VT gear would be upgrades and that content was available four expansions ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that's your opinion.  Try doing an LDON hard wearing Bardeil or Vigdis's equipment. <br />
<br />
Remember when LDON hards came out you had 250+ aa's and EP equipment, they didn't.  Of course LDON was &quot;easier&quot; then doing Time and GoD.  But now that you have GoD go back and look how easy EP is.  <br />
<br />
I feel like im throwing a ball against a brick wall.  Time spent is time spent, wether I die 20 times trying to kill Inny in Nadox with 6 people or you die 20 times trying to kill Inny in Time with 60 people.  We died the same amount and spent the same amount of time.  You need to compare similar things.   <br />
<br />
The thread simply started as LDON people who enjoy LDON are now at a road block because no new LDON gear will be introduced allowing new warriors to join into Uber guilds like ALe.  ALe will not take a LDoN geared warrior, so were does that warrior go?  Another guild to mooch off of flags / drops?  This is a vicious cycle and quiet repulsive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention, all the LDoN gear in that profile costs 20702 points, which amounts to 405 normal LDoNs or 198 hards.<br />
<br />
At 30 minutes minimum (i'm being generous....remember people who do ldons to get Tak armor will not have uber gear to get thru these ldons in 15-20 minutes) for each, that's 202 hours of time spent ONLY in the dungeons.  At say 5 normals a day (255 points), this will take 81 days of time in LDoN dungeons.  I did not take into account the time putting groups together or things like that.<br />
<br />
Then you will get a set of equipment that is inferior to VT stuff.<br />
<br />
Tell me....anyone here raid VT for 81 days straight for gear?<br />
<br />
It will get shorter if you do more hards, but the time investment, as you can see is still pretty high for inferior items.  Despite that fact, some of us nonraiders have taken this path.  For my warrior friend, he has maxxed out ldon at 550+ wins.  I myself am nearing 200.<br />
<br />
All I want is for zones to drop appropriate equipment for their progression level.  How do I tank Tipt, that is supposedly geared towards an elemental tank, when Vxed only drops items that are comparable to VT, a zone several expansions old?  Not to mention, it only drops items for a FEW slots.  That just compounds the problem.<br />

See, and I think the same thing with respect to tanking mobs in EP or Time.  Brutul confirmed this with respect to Fennin.  Hell, my guild has had my fellow enchanters tanking certain EP mobs, as well as P3 named, just for the hell of it.  I understand that there are a few difficult encounters that require strategy in EP.  Most of them do not.  In particular, the minis in the various EP zones that drop Raex armor are basically just a really big, mean LDoN mob.  You stand the tank in front of it, he goes furious or doesn't, he goes defensive or he doesn't, and he taunts and positions himself accordingly.  The Time Gods are the same way.  Oh, except for VZ because the tank also has to hit his &quot;Stand&quot; key occassionally.  <br />
<br />
Maybe learning the encounters takes more concentration that I'm factoring in, but the tank skill involved is basically the same.</div></div><hr />

Group content surely isn't the Holy Grail in a massively multiplayer game. It's just one party size. A party of one is equally valid. Where's the progression path for the soloing Warrior? You people that need groups to achieve stuff sux0rs. Why I'll bet half your group is AFK. SoE better cater to the needs of us soloing players!!<br />
<br />
Sounded ridiculous didn't it? That's how ridiculous some of you sound to me. Feel like playing a 6 player game in a massively multiplayer setting. Fine and dandy. But like the guy who only wants to solo and doesn't have the gear or flag progression path that leads to Qvic, he MAY have to decide if he wants to bend a bit and deal with EQ or if he's willing to do lesser content for a lesser reward and perhaps not be able to see a lot of content. 6 person guilds seldom see the content 100 player guilds see nor do they get equivilant equipment.<br />
<br />
EQ is not TV. Sitting logged in for 6 hours doesn't mean jack. EQ is not pasive entertainment, it's PvE - player vs. environment. For y'all that haven't encountered this concept before it means you do what you have to do to beat the environment. Can't do it or won't do it? Well bucko, it's a game - not everybody &quot;wins&quot;. Some of you have lost sight of the fact that it's a game and believe it's supposed to be an alternate reality where you are always happy and &quot;winning&quot; or SoE is ruining it for you.<br />

<br />
Your analogy is tired, BB.  I'll explain why.  We aren't talking about moss snakes and we arent' talking about a moss snake equivalent.  Despite how simple you may believe hard LDoNs to be, I recall when LDoN was first released and there were serious discussions by warriors of all types about how challenging and difficult the content was.  That content is still as difficult and challenging for me now as it was for those warriors then.  I am a GOOD warrior and I was a skilled warrior when I set Vigdis aside 18 months ago.  But gear has far out-paced me and those who group with me.  When we enter a hard LDoN it is not at all clear that we will succeed.  <br />
<br />
But aside from the assanine and repetitive moss snake comment, I actually agree with your underlying point.  Every player should be able to decide how they wish to spend their time.  But for those who wish to seriously dedicate their spare time playing this game, there ought to be a path of progression.  In your universe, there is only one such path and that is joining a raiding guild.  I find that concept fundamentally flawed, particularly as it applies to a consumer product. <br />

Moss snakes kill plenty of level 1's. On the other hand they don't kill Warriors with 12300HP's buffed. From my point of view the mobs that give you a tough time are NOT tough mobs.<br />
<br />
Only because EQ has a silly experiance system that allows grinding out trivial mobs to push the level indicator forward are we the same level. A better system for Warriors might be to divide the number of HP's by 100. That way achieving critical Warrior stats would be rewarded by a level increase, not time grinding out trivial mobs.<br />
<br />
In that system you're level 66 and I'm level 100 - far more accurate. I don't meant to diss you about content that's a challange to you at level 66. If I were that level rather than level 100, it would be tough for me too.<br />

The clearing from trigger to fro always has deaths.We usually go very fast though,non stop plow.As the last mobs drop the new fiend and adds are normally pulled.If people are properly  repositioned usually aggro on the fiend for me is np and he gos down without mishap.When I break mezzes after the most 2 taunts(and im always on the next target while the last is at about 10-20 pct unless it enrages)I hope the tanks moving with me have good aggro if I don't,but, some robes always die.Perhaps Brutul wasn't ma'n all the clearing or they have the time to do this stuff slower I don't know.We operate on very limited timeframes normally and these type of clearings are very fast paced.There is no way I ,or, any other tank would have time to relax the way we do it /shrug.For us it is very dynamic far more than any single group stuff and I remember one day with very limited numbers the raid almost wiping otw through to Fennin.Even Tipt though I can easily die is relaxing by comparison because there is only so much I can do.My choices are limited and I only have to be aware of 5 other people  and their input to the encounter.I dunno what to say...I've told the truth as it is for me.</div></div><hr />

BB I thought that the general consensus was that only dumbass casters picked tanks based on HP alone?<br />

Lets quit this bullshit about ldon. We all agree easy ldon is just a grind. I HATE grinds. I think hard ldon would weed out a lot of the wankers, or hell a HARDER ldon for the &quot;EP Gear&quot;, but I'm not married to the idea of LDON, and I sure as hell don't wanna grind out another 200 of them for a full set of gear.<br />
<br />
Ok, so how about some alternative ideas. Casters get some new kickass spells in GoD from runes that drop in sewers, mountain trials, and kt+. They also get all/all or chain/silk/plate/leather specific drops. We, otoh, get 2 semi-usefull disciplines for the runes, vs. their 4 spells, and have to compete with them for the runes to boot.<br />
<br />
Why don't we get something like that? Maybe molds like ornate, but with class specific rewards. Stuff that drops deep in vxed and tipt outta be DAMN close to elemental quality IMO. And it needs to be tuned per class, damnit. I don't give a flip if my gear has +10 wis on it. But it sure as hell oughta have better hp/ac on it than pally/sk equivalents. Maybe you collect 5 runes from tipt, and combine them, and you get a legs mold, or something? BP mold would require 5 runes from KT. Hands, arms and heads from sewers, and boots/bracers from vxed.<br />
<br />
Lets not get caught up on ldons. We may or may not disagree that raiding is easier or harder than single group play, but STOP saying all single group play is easy ldon. I know I do stuff with a single group regularly that most of the &quot;raiders&quot; I know won't even touch without double the people.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt for a moment and pretend like you wanted to have a serious discussion.  The statement quoted above tells me that you feel that raiding is the be all end all to EQ, casual players should thank their lucky stars they have LDoN, an expansion that is now two, almost three, expansions old, and should be satisfied with endlessly grinding out the same content over and over again until the end of time, unless of course they're willing to join a raiding guild.<br />

You did not grind to level 100.  You may not even have earned the gear you got through working through the difficulty of the 50-70 man events.  You may have just lucked into a backflagging frenzy or be chatting on severwide.thesteelwarrior while other people tanked and add-tanked mobs in those events.  But because you put intime with 70 other people, you were awarded those items.  <br />
<br />
In REALITY, however, and as noted in your post, Sony has developed a different system for character advancement.  Sony is an equal opportunity grinder.  Levels were once the progression tools used for character advancement.  More and more, gear is the progression tool at least if I look at your analogy.  Although the method is altering, the underlying concept that advancement be equally available for all classes ought to remain the same. <br />
<br />
If you feel your progression chain is valid, then that is your perogative.  I and many others like me do not feel that raiding in the elemental planes and Time takes any greater skill or effort than our single-group kills.   I can't say for sure why others think this way, but I can tell you from my own experience, which is having played a Time-flagged enchanter, that I don't feel it takes skill.  Sure, the mobs are more difficult.  But the difficulty is spread out amonst 75 other people.  In my single-group events the difficulty of an encounter divisble only by 6.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, I'm not sure if there is a point arguing with you, BB.  I don't mind continuing the discussion but when the posts I reply to start out with &quot;I am level 100 in reality and you are level 66,&quot; I can't see that we have a reasonable middle ground to reach.  You are wed to the idea that you are entitled to more (content and gear) because you raid.  You first you state that nonraiders refuse to work for their rewards.  When I present evidence that we are willing to put forth the effort and dedication for those upgrades, you reply that the work that non-raiders put forth is the equivalent of moss snake farming.  When I express my disagreement from my own experience, that the Hard LDoN-equivalent farming is challenging and difficult for my phase in the game, you snear that it's not for you, so it doesn't count.  <br />
<br />
Well, where do we go from here?  What WOULD be acceptable effort for EP-equivalent armor given the necessary assumption that I am a hard core &quot;non-raider&quot; player?</div></div><hr />

I prefer the raid game as kind of the exception rather than the rule,although, it may be late in the day for that with eq 1.<br />

When he first entered the BoT, the TR MT in his previous expansion best eguipment got his head handed to him a bit by the tower mini's too. A month or so later hemoved on to harder mobs and Timmah, the #3 MT in the Famly Hugs guild equipped in the previous expansion's second best equipment tried his hand - it was harder and it took some time, but Timmah mastered it and progressed as well.<br />
<br />
Timmah however didn't do the flag progression, he didn't get Ornate molds, reach the EP's or see PoTime. Oh, Timmah bought 2 pieces of Ornate, added Valorium Rings, but the TR MT is past QVic now at 11k HP's unbuffed.<br />

Timmah woke up, looked at his stats and said &quot;UNFAIR! I can't do the harder GoD content!!&quot;<br />

Celes, This shows that you have not read this thread.  On page three of this thread I responded to the exact points made in your post:<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are referring to GoD armor acquired from Gates and discussed in This Thread, you are wrong. There are eight EP armor slots (breastplate, legs, boots, helm, arms, bracers, gloves). The sole EP-equivalent peice of armor that one can acquire in GoDs is the bracer, from the named in Tipt. None of the other armor even comes close. Take a look at the Max Magelo Created to show what is available in GoD. <br />
<br />
I do agree, GoD armor fills some needed slots. The eight slots acquired with GoD armor are also nice. But they are NOT EP-equivilent. To argue such is simply wrong. If, however, you still feel you are right about this, I would be happy to see links of EP-equivalent armor for those eight slots that can be acquired in single-groupable GoD content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quit talking about things you don't know as if they were true.   They are not.  Look a little closer.  GoD armor is not even close the equivalent of EP.  The gloves are 75HP, helm is 75HP, bracer 90HP, boots 85HP, arms 85HP, greaves are 110HP and BP is 110HP. <br />
<br />
How is that the equivalent?  How is that even CLOSE to being the equivalent?  LDoN gear is better.  Hell, as Brutul noted a few pages back in response to my posting a top-of-the-line non-rader profile, VT gear is superior.</div></div><hr />

I was not referring to elemental quality in main slots like BP/legs/arms.  I ment in jewlry slots, accessories, belt, shoulders.  Much equivilency can be found in GoD non-raid zones, or LDoN.  I dont think LDoN should give the SAME quality loot as elementals, but good substitutes for making up that 40-50hp difference at times is to look at your accessories in other zones and augging them or augging your LdoN equipment so that it is almost to the quality of Elemental armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, if you can get groups to xp in GoD to begin with, you have the opportunity to gather some decent non-visible drops that are of excellent quality.  Except that a number of these drops are pretty rare indeed, most are pretty light on AC, something that is extremely valueable for a tank, and you'd have to have a group willing to do GoD with you as the tank to begin with.  From what I've heard, pick up groups don't appear to be very viable in GoD.  And those few that are out there want, go figure, elemental geared or better tanks.<br />
<br />
The LDoN hards have some decent no drop equipment, if you seek out the best equipment you can possibly get in zones like Sewer trials, Vxed, Barindu, Ferubi etc. off random named and even random on some trash, you would be suprised to know that the casual tank is as best off as they ever were in this day and age of EQ.<br />
<br />
Again, it's a which came first, the chicken or the egg, deal.  If you're well enough geared to do LDoN hards reliably, you don't really need the gear that it drops.  If you need the gear, you can't tank there reliably and a pick up group probably isn't going to be willing to take you on.  You're too much risk.  If people are going to take on a LDoN hard, they usually want to feel confident they have a good chance at success.  Maybe not 100%, but solid.  Otherwise, they're just better off grinding out 2 or 3 easys in the same amount of time.<br />
<br />
Is there good stuff out there?  Yes there is.  But notice that there are far more characters walking around sporting Elemental or PoTime gear than top of the line LDoN gear.  There's a reason for that.  And it isn't because all non-raiders are lazy slackers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No BB, we aren't looking looking for a bus ride. But we want a trail instead of a jungle to walk through. Besides, did you really start back on day 1 of EQ, and follow the progression the entire time? By your line of reasoning, only those that started on day 1 should be in inktuta, and the rest of us should be slogging along somewhere in between.<br />
<br />
If you think that old content guild progression is still viable with mudflation, i'm sorry but I patently disagree. PoP completely blew out the curve. People ditch SSRA/VT guilds so fast only very few manage to stick out the grind. The way it's done now is with single groups. Very few guilds can stay together long enough to do the progression, so it needs to be made available to single groups, and there's a HUGE hole in that progression for warriors in particular.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok great idea. Except people with elemental armor aug it as well, and ldon's don't yield AC augs for visible slots. Saying augs are the progression is a total cop-out. Raiders have access to the same ones, and are expected to have them. Maybe if they actually bothered to farm the ldon raid ones, you'd have a point, but nobody does. <br />
<br />
Bear also in mind that the primary loss is not in HP, but AC. Raex just utterly destroys anything else on my &quot;upgrade path&quot; when you factor AC/stats into the equation. HP is not the ultimate yardstick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u221"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p221">What is your fixation on visible slots, bardeil?  When it comes to relative values of upgrades, all slots are equal.  <br />
<br />
If nothing else, GoD gives you the opportunity to put +HP augments into type 2,3 slots on your existing visible LDON slots.  That is an effective upgrade of those slots.  It's also nice to be able to put augments better than 12/15hp into the other slots not covered by Solid/Radiant Coal of Prowess.<br />
<br />
I agree that it would be nice if there was a full suit of &quot;Tipt bracer&quot; quality armor.  But when you can get things like 140hp masks and 145hp range items off of trash mobs, who cares which slots they're in?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it's nice that the weakest LDON slots are the ones best upgraded by GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">My fixation with visible slots is that they tend to carry the highest AC, and we've got a big AC problem with LDoN/GoD gear. I have a GoD gear profile, and a version of that profile with raex on (- the bp), and it's a 250ac improvement. Thats huge, and a far bigger AC jump than I get by getting all the 1 groupable tipt/kt+ drops.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Perhaps I should just say &quot;Give us more AC on GoD/LDoN gear&quot;, but in all reality that isn't the problem. Visible slots are where eq has traditionall had quested, class specific gear which catered to our needs. Post ornate, pre elemental is where we don't have it, and are feeling the pain, IMO.</div></div><hr />

Farming my Black Iron Bastard Sword in a group of 3 at level 21 in banded armor was hard, too.  In fact, I remember us dying and eating XP deaths doing it.  And if you said &quot;if you were well enough geared to get a BIBS reliably, then you didn't really need the gear that drops there&quot;, you'd be right.  It was a challenge, and it was not reliable, and that was what was required to get an upgrade.<br />
<br />
That was still true when the Silvery 2-Handed Axe dropped in Permafrost when I was level 29 and we could barely kill the ice giant diplomat.  It was particularly true when I camped the Mithril 2 Handed Sword at level 41, still wearing the same crafted armor and using the same axe.  It was also true when I got a Jade Reaver in City Of Mist at 52 in partial indicolite (yes, people actually equipped Jade Reavers once).  And I also recall how difficult it was earning Velium weapons in Dragon Necropolis early on, when the gating rats could summon.  God, the deaths and risk was ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Not everything was always so hard.  Going back to the Froglok King at level 52 was a lesson in mudflation.  So was going back to kill Black Reavers at level 57 - what a difference some levels made.  And the last time I went to DN, I simply couldn't believe how weak the rats had become.  Those are certainly &quot;reliable&quot; conditions, and it would be accurate to say that I didn't need the equipment that drops in those places anymore.<br />
<br />
I'm really not sure why you'd expect equipment upgrades to come out of &quot;reliable&quot; situations today, when they were never available through such situations in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe we are talking about different things. I was referring to the GoD Bunker thread.  If you mean something else, I'm going to need a reference.  Aside from the Tipt bracer, point me to any non-raider obtainable 140HP item, much less one that falls off of trash mobs.  The best item there comes from the involved BiC quest.  The item itself is from the 9th encounter in a single-group ring event.  In this encounter, there are three mobs, unmezzable, that hit for 1347 and proc 600 + a dot component.  This may not be impossible for a non-raider, but it comes really close.  More directly, however, this is not a trash mob.  Neither are the other 100+ HP items on that magelo acquired from trash mobs.<br />

Sassinak, you're ignoring the point.  The point isn't whether the tank is willing to take the risks and perhaps the deaths.  The point is, is the rest of the group willing to take the same risks?  Generally the answer is NO.  So, if you're trying to say that the tank being unwilling to take risks in LDoN hard is his problem, then I'd agree with you.  But the point is, other people aren't willing to take the risk he entails, and that's not anything he has any control over.   He can be willing all day long and twice as long on Sunday and that won't necessarily mean jack to his actually getting a group to do it with.</div></div><hr />

Are you trying for humor cuz mostly you sound like a prick. I note from your magelo that you never bothered to even get the tier3 LDON armor. Pansied out with the Malevolent, instead.  Probably because you already had 1100 from the Anger aug in EF so figured why put in the &quot;fraction of the work&quot; it might take to work up Nro.  <br />
<br />
yes it was humor vidg, i dont think it is good to have EP level armor farmed by doing such easy things that you dont even require a healer for. back when ldon first came out i did an adventure with a pally, a necro, a bard, me, a rogue, and a beast lord. i think if you can get elemental level gear with that group when the stuff that actually drops elemental armor is incredibly signifigantly harder then something is wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Until you can bother to at least aim for tier 3 LDON gear you have no fucking leg to stand on when it comes to &quot;whining&quot; about the &quot;fraction of the work&quot; necessary to obtain good LDON gear.  The idea, after all, was for EP-level gear to require even more points (with even more points needed for the augs for the gear, probably).  <br />
<br />
i could easily get tier 3 ldon gear if i wanted it that bad, i just hate doing ldons so its not worth it to me. i have every theme unlocked just bought stupid stuff with it, still have anger 3 on a greatstaff of the 4 winds because ive been too lazy to de aug it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Total time spent getting that would have easily justified the reward.  If you wanna cry because nonraiders could spend literally hundreds of hours in LDONs to get armor your zergfest guild picked up from the frog in POF in half an hour, take it somewhere else.  .<br />
<br />
why do the LDoNers need elemental level armor? current ldon armor is already quite a good deal. and thanks for the personal attack on my guild vidg, i never figuired you to be so immature as to try stuff like that and p.s. reparm with 45 doesnt = zerg!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  I am proposing Hard LDoN points for higher LDoN gear.  You need a healer.  The fact that you are too lazy to complete more LDoN's for better gear makes my point for me.  Many non-raiders are committed enough to their toon that they will do this, even though it sucks.  Luckily for you, you are able to ride on the coattails of your guild and acquire Raex instead eventually.  All you have to do is show up.<br />
<br />
2.  We want the armor because GoD trash quads for 900s.  If we wish to see things like Ikkinz1-3 we require this armor.  If we wish to try and break into arbitrarily locked zones like VP and PoP with low numbers, we require this armor.  More to the point, however,  if I wish to progress with a small guild but I spend most my waking hours playing this game, I feel that there ought to be alternative progression path available to me.<br />
<br />
3.  Oh, you get me wrong, Big.  I didn't call your guild zerg without looking at the roster first. No need to thank me for the personal attack.  It was a little tit for tat in exchange your snide initial remark.  You want to debate intelligently?  Don't condescend with that retarded flame material in your first post.  I won't then feel the necessity of pointing out that Vigdis chooses to progress with about 12 skilled friends.  You choose to progress with, according to that roster, 200.

1.  I am proposing Hard LDoN points for higher LDoN gear.  You need a healer.  The fact that you are too lazy to complete more LDoN's for better gear makes my point for me.  Many non-raiders are committed enough to their toon that they will do this, even though it sucks.  Luckily for you, you are able to ride on the coattails of your guild and acquire Raex instead eventually.  All you have to do is show up. <br />
<br />
this is the funny part, ive been in my guild for about a year and a half. back when we were doing epics and HoT in ToV. about a year ago i became an officer and the MA. i lead about half of our raids, but yeah ive definately ridden the coattails and just shown up! <br />
<br />
<br />
2.  We want the armor because GoD trash quads for 900s.  If we wish to see things like Ikkinz1-3 we require this armor.  If we wish to try and break into arbitrarily locked zones like VP and PoP with low numbers, we require this armor.  More to the point, however,  if I wish to progress with a small guild but I spend most my waking hours playing this game, I feel that there ought to be alternative progression path available to me. <br />
<br />
no fucking way! quads 900?!?! you definately cant tank that when you have armor with over 100hp in every slot! /sarcasm off. with 40hp augs in all the ldon takish armor youlle have over 100hp on every peice of visible armor, yeah thats enough to be tanking mobs that quad 900. which is essentially the same as hard ldons, and if youre tanking hard ldons fine in the status quo you NEED better stuff why?<br />
<br />
<br />
3.  Oh, you get me wrong, Big.  I didn't call your guild zerg without looking at the roster first. No need to thank me for the personal attack.  It was a little tit for tat in exchange your snide initial remark.  You want to debate intelligently?  Don't condescend with that retarded flame material in your first post.  I won't then feel the necessity of pointing out that Vigdis chooses to progress with about 12 skilled friends.  You choose to progress with, according to that roster, 200.  I don't believe that either path is more inherently worthy of better loot.<br />
<br />
youre being completely condescending in the fact that you are stating &quot;facts&quot; that you know shit about. did you know that our webmaster quit EQ and the roster hasnt been pruned in about a year? that everyone whos come and gone within a year is on that roster because it hasnt been changed? of course you didnt know that but that didnt stop your mouth from spewing things you know absolutely nothing about! you know whats even funnier??? go here (http://www.releaseteam.com/bol/points/listmembers.php) and scroll to the bottom of the page. yes viggy, thats your roster with the final count of......220! now i dont know if those are all active but reguardless you are a hypocrit for implying that we were zergish because our roster has 200. <br />
<br />
going to the store now so i expect at least 3 more pages of facts based on things that havent been updated in a while and which you have no knowledge about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u236"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p236">Vig by &quot;meaningful&quot; I did not mean raid absolutely.It's a massive MULTI player online game with an emphasis on banding togeather people of various skills to defeat content.More content for everyone is a good thing.Making a solo player able to be more successful on his own than with a group long term woudl be bad.Making a group able to be more successful than a guild longterm would be bad.The power base is built on the pooling of effort of pc's against content.The &quot;meaning&quot; would go if these simple truths were  rendered no longer true.The idea is to have fun with other folks.The rewards are greater the stronger the group is simple.<br />
<br />
You are making a couple wrong assumptions in this post.  First, I never said that groups should be more successful than raids.  I never even said they should be AS successful as raids.  I said that group progression ought not have the presently wide power differential that it has.  <br />
<br />
Second, several different people are misunderstanding the label &quot;massively multiplayer game.&quot;  That term, MMORPG, is a label to describe the type of game, not the progression path.  The label defines a type of computer game that enables hundreds or thousands of players to simultaneously interact in a game world.  In other words, the term is used to describe the degree to which the game can host large number of players in a single game world.  <br />
<br />
The term is not intended to definte for the playerbase or for the Sony developers what type of progression strategies are preferred.  Several MMORPGs host content that specifically rewards individuals or groups of individuals or raids of individuals equally.  City of Heroes is one such MMORPG.  To make use of this label in the way you and sevearl others have used it is simply ludicrous and ignores the gaming history from which the label was created.  So stop it, please.  Using an old label that defines COH as much as it does EQ does not in any way further your argument. <br />
<br />
In response to your actual points, however, the game is about PvE.  Player versus Environment.  Not MASSIVE NUMBERS OF PLAYERS versus Environment.  The game does not emphasize a 72-person game play to the exclusion of 6-person game play.  Each path is meaningful for its own reasons.  Your opinion that your path is somehow more meaningful or more appropriately played in an MMORPG environment is, again, your opinion.  Thousands of players don't share that opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
youre being completely condescending in the fact that you are stating &quot;facts&quot; that you know shit about. did you know that our webmaster quit EQ and the roster hasnt been pruned in about a year? that everyone whos come and gone within a year is on that roster because it hasnt been changed? of course you didnt know that but that didnt stop your mouth from spewing things you know absolutely nothing about! you know whats even funnier??? go here and scroll to the bottom of the page. yes viggy, thats your roster with the final count of......220! now i dont know if those are all active but reguardless you are a hypocrit for implying that we were zergish because our roster has 200. <br />

Big, I was very clear in my statement and throughout this entire thread actually.  I belong to a raiding guild, therefore I know exactly how difficult it is to be in a raiding guild.  But Vigdis does not raid with my guild.  Vigdis raids with a small group of friends.  I stated that plain as day in my post to which you are referring here.  If you are going to get all pissed off and up in arms about a quick &quot;zerg&quot; statement, maybe you ought to put more thought into your posts before saying &quot;dammit! now casual warriors cant be as well geared as harcore raiding ones for a fraction of the work!! this is AWFUL!!!!11&quot;  Because, guess what?, &quot;that didn't stop your mouth from spewing things you know absolutely nothing about!&quot;  See?

Why dose this arguement even contuine points have been made On both sides, No, Vigdis didn't say you should get them with easy she said the hard LDoN's if You can beat a hard LDoN with the group you discrpied then damn your My hero or you are geared Beyond the point they where Hard LDoN are Base elemental/Solro quality for there mobs.. sooo whats the risk vs reward  there, they all paly they all spend time they all want to be the best they are Able to, the game is broken and has been since Kunark, yes I said kunark, the point when More and more raid mosters/zones started to Apear.  its A game people have fun play it or not, would it be nice to have a new set of armor slightly above the current top teir yes, would it be nice to have it, at or above elemental quality yes, but in all fairness and reality I Would go for just under it, You did notice the teir 2 armors where Just below ornate, and the top teir just above it did You not?<br />

LDoN armor is very nice as it already is. you can wear full ldon armor in the EP and realistically do well on alot of the stuff. the fact that im pointing out is that if you need stuff thats better than ldon armor to kill the mobs you want to kill, then theres gonna be better armor available. ldon armor gives warriors enough hp/ac to tank anything they want up to and including some stuff in the EP. i think this is a pretty good deal already. <br />
<br />
so heres a question for everyone. name some instances where a warrior in a non raiding guild, with full LDoN plate and augs, would be unable to tank something thats a target for a non raiding guild warrior.<br />
<br />
Big, I was very clear in my statement and throughout this entire thread actually. I belong to a raiding guild, therefore I know exactly how difficult it is to be in a raiding guild. But Vigdis does not raid with my guild. Vigdis raids with a small group of friends. I stated that plain as day in my post to which you are referring here. <br />
<br />
hey i think you missed a couple paragraphs in my previous post, but if selective reading is how you debate then so be it.<br />
<br />
what kind of targets do you raid on vigdis with your friends? mobs that arent considered targets for raiding guilds and are impossible to tank with current takish armor? <br />
<br />
If you are going to get all pissed off and up in arms about a quick &quot;zerg&quot; statement, maybe you ought to put more thought into your posts before saying &quot;dammit! now casual warriors cant be as well geared as harcore raiding ones for a fraction of the work!! this is AWFUL!!!!11&quot; Because, guess what?, &quot;that didn't stop your mouth from spewing things you know absolutely nothing about!&quot; See? Oh wait, the irony was lost on you...<br />
<br />
the zerg statement was stupid and hypocritical especially since your guild roster has more than mine does. so please repeat after me: &quot;bigchest, im sorry for the zerg comment, i didnt realize i was such a hypocrit to critisize something that my guild actually does worse&quot;<br />
<br />
and why is it ironic that i would talk about the difference between casual and hardcore raiders? i have been both in my EQ career as most people have. i admit i skipped alot of pages but if you came up with any examples of where you need to tank something thats impossible with ldon armor feel free to bump them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u241"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p241">i also made a magelo for you guys in case yall would like to underestimate the hp/ac that ldon can give you.<br />

<br />
this doesnt even include gates AAs, if we would like to throw sturdiness into the mix you can pump that magelo up to 6.7 unbuffed which is not what i would call shabby. also a warrior who really ldoned this much would have more augs and higher sta ect but i didnt want to overshoot what im talking about here,</div></div><hr />

That was your asshole assanine and ignorant comment.  What I found ironic is that you are claiming I would post without knowing the facts when my post was driven in the first place by this piece of shit quote.  3830101010 times today I've had to repost that hard core nonraiders are willing to put in the work.  Hell, we'll do the boring Hard LDoNs that you absolutely refuse to do.  We'll slodge through shit becuase its an upgrade for us and may help us and our friends progress.  But to you that is &quot;A fraction of the work!&quot; and you have that opinion because you &quot;don't know the facts!&quot;  That was the ironic thing.  As for my guild, I've noted it before and I'll note it again.  My guild has nothing to do with my warrior.  But on the topic of my guild, I am proud to be in the single nicest Time-guild on Povar and the only non-mandatory EP-level guild on Povar.  You wonder why we have a large roster?  Because if I prefer to play with my friends on my alt instead of raid with my enchanter when I am online, that is A-okay. <br />
<br />
<br />
what kind of targets do you raid on vigdis with your friends? mobs that arent considered targets for raiding guilds and are impossible to tank with current takish armor? <br />
<br />
<br />
Grieg, AoW, ToV, NToV, Epic mobs, Tipt, Vxed, BoT, Ferubi, Servitor, IV.  I hope to tank Ikkinz1-3.  If my friends are able to progress at all or combine an alliance with another small guild, I would probably be the one to tank and the mini-named in Ikkinz4-6 for the drops prior to the final quest guys, the VP shade key, I would be the one to tank Gruumus or Bert.  The difference between this group and your guild when you did it was that we'd be trying these events with significantly fewer persons than you had and many of them would be without the VT-style gear.<br />
<br />
<br />

Why thank you.  I'm at 6.7 unbuffed right now.  Unless I have friends who are significantly more advanced EQ-wise than Vigdis is in gear along for the ride, I get my ass beat down in Tipt.</div></div><hr />

Fact is, theres a gap in the progression. I don't really care if it stops anybody or not, I just think it's bullshit. I'm not bumping my head on it too badly yet, but I absolutely refuse to believe that the extra 200 AC and 800 hp on visible slots alone isn't going to make a whale of a difference when it comes to tanking Tipt.  <br />
<br />
This thread has been very telling, since we warriors are always preaching the value of AC, except when it comes to warrior vs. warrior, then we're only interested in the fact that you can aug an ldon bp to the same number of hp as the elemental one, and that non-raiders can hit 10khp.<br />
<br />
The fact is, people CAN and DO afk through pickup and zerg guild raids to get Raex, while those of us who prefer to actually play and be challenged  have no option. I take issue with that, and that alone. A year ago, the point was irrelevant because pickup raids and zerg guild hadn't made it to the elementals, and the only people there were solid raid guilds who had completed their own flagging . But it sure has heck has changed, and GoD just didn't fill the gap in this area, regardless how nicely it fills in the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you think that doing monotonous and non challenging LDoNs compares even in the least to getting a guild into the elemental planes and being able to farm then i think that you are horribly wrong. alot of your examples are flawed. take the one you used about pyronis earlier. yeah it sounds easy to waltz into fire and kill him, but pyronis isnt the hard part about getting the EP drops. keeping tons of different people together and happy against mobs that can be quite difficult with a backflag system that can be a pain in the ass to say the least is why EP drops should be way ahead of LDoN ones. <br />
<br />
as wandaor said earlier, does turning in 3000 snake fangs farmed in butcherblock mean you should get EP armor as well? im not saying that doing all those LDoNs isnt worth reward, because it is, and theres already a great reward. but LDoNs do not even begin to approach the difficulty of getting a guild to the EP and killing the mobs there.<br />

youre the one that played the guild card in the first place. you are the one that assumed because of our roster we were zergish without knowing the facts. when in fact it sounds like the guild im a part of is similar to the one you are, and thats great, i never attacked your guild, you did to mine and i pointed out how hypocritical you acted.<br />

<br />
i can promise you that the gear you currently have is enough to do what you want. because my guild killed emp in the same month that we killed RZtW, so we didnt have VT access at all for killing bertoxx MM RD ect. it was also before gates of discord and i beleive when we killed alot of the nameds that youre talking about i actually had LESS HP than you currently do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why thank you.  I'm at 6.7 unbuffed right now.  Unless I have friends who are significantly more advanced EQ-wise than Vigdis is in gear along for the ride, I get my ass beat down in Tipt.<br />
<br />
everyone gets their ass beat down in tipt, ive been killed by many a flinty cragbeasts. tipt is hard for everyone. but also remember that tipt wasnt aimed to be tankable by lvl 65 warriors in non EP gear, it was made to be tankable by lvl 70 knights and warriors in EP gear. if you should be able to tank in tipt what stops a lvl 60 warrior from using the same argument and complaining of chronic tipt ass ramming too?<br />
<br />
Big, I think Vigdis keeps her alter ego's seperate. Her chanter is in a large guild, and her warrior isn't. But what the hell do I know. <br />
<br />
ive been in the same guild that came from a twice a week raids on kunark to 4-5 times a week semi raid guild. back then i didnt want to be able to tank content i wasnt strong enough to tank in<br />
<br />
Fact is, theres a gap in the progression. I don't really care if it stops anybody or not, I just think it's bullshit. I'm not bumping my head on it too badly yet, but I absolutely refuse to believe that the extra 200 AC and 800 hp on visible slots alone isn't going to make a whale of a difference when it comes to tanking Tipt. <br />
<br />
no, theres not a gap in progression, its called EP and time gear. they didnt release gates of discord with the plan of people going directly from LDoN to GoD. the part in the middle is upper planes of power gear. thats like some guild doing exclusively velious and then hoping to blast through PoP and then complaining for upgraded velious gear when they cant get far. if you want to progress in new expansions, do the previous expansion or dont complain.<br />
<br />
This thread has been very telling, since we warriors are always preaching the value of AC, except when it comes to warrior vs. warrior, then we're only interested in the fact that you can aug an ldon bp to the same number of hp as the elemental one, and that non-raiders can hit 10khp.<br />
<br />
non raiding warriors can tank all they NEED to tank with ldon gear! LDoN gear isnt supposed to be the shit that everyones after and skips raids to get. if it enables you to tank content geared towards you, and not a character in EP and time gear thats 5 levels above you, then its working damn well id say!<br />

people CAN and DO afk or not pull their weight through LDoNs to get takish armor. dont act like it takes anymore moral fiber or willingness to upgrade yourself to do it through the ldon route.</div></div><hr />

Because in reality it's a game and people want to have fun playing the game.  And since they continually up the bar each expansion people expect to either have reasonable progress made available to them in a reasonable fashion so they can participate in the new content or they don't see the point in continuing to purchase it.  It's a very simple formula Frodlin.  It has very little to do with ego strokes for raiders.  You've gotten your gear.  You've had the use of it for two years now or pretty close to it.   And now you and people like you object to others being allowed to acquire something similar after a serious time commitment?  Did you pitch that kind of fit when cobalt was made obsolete by Velious quested?  How about when Kael quested and NToV drops were made obsolete by cultural armor?  And yet you feel at this juncture, as you are preparing to enter into GoD and gain huge gear upgrades, I presume, that non-raiders absolutely should not have any method to gain gear of elemental caliber or close to it short of raiding the planes?<br />
<br />
And raiders wonder why non-raiders leave the game?  Could it be because if raiders have their way non-raiders will be stuck on the fringes of new expansions forever more, never to actually go beyond the first few zones unless joining a raiding guild or being carried along by uber friends?  This sounds like fun to you?  This sounds like a game anyone who isn't a raider really wants to participate in for the long term?  Wake up and stop worrying about your efforts and your goodies so damn much and realize that the game is on the cusp of serious player base attrition.  Non-raiders are being made obsolete.  Non-viable.  A dying breed.  Maybe to you that's good.  But it isn't to everyone.</div></div><hr />

And it's impossible for one to &quot;enjoy the game&quot; by levelling up in the content given to them?   In other words, as has been pointed out on MULTITUDES of occasions, the gear to get DAMN close is already there.   It's NOT going to be handed to you on a silver platter though.  <br />

LDoN armor all has 3 augment slots, it's got the potential to be pretty much EXACTLY midway between Ornate and EPlane armor.   The rest of the gear is attainable in GoD.   Here's the caveat, you HAVE to go out and get it.  <br />

I camped Cobalt Gloves for 2 months, Cobalt boots for another 2 months, yadda yadda... I found out where the stuff dropped, and parked my ass where it did until I got it, and it wasn't common.   I rolled against people for it, or made deals for it (for instance, I'd gotten a bard weapon that was hot at the time, and gave the bard the weapon in exchange for letting me have the boots)  If I couldn't find a group for one piece, I'd make one.  It's a method I would recommend.    <br />

I'm sorry, but gear, GOOD gear EXISTS.... good gear that doesn't require raids EXISTS now, in a level that's not been attainable by single groups since Kunark.   GoD is simply put, the single best expansion for single group non raid item acquisition since Kunark, and people are STILL unhappy about it.  I just don't understand.</div></div><hr />
