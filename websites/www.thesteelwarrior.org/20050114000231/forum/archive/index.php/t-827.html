<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have three weapons in my possesion right now, a Fleshgrinder, a Frostbringer, and a Short Blade of Lightning, and I'm trying to figure out which combo would be best for aggro.  I'm just about to ding 51 and I'll be able to use the fleshy soon, so I'm pretty sure I want to use that, so it's between the Frosty and the SBOL.  On my server, frosties sell for around 5k, SBOL's for around 35-40k, which should i go with?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fell Dragoon</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Till you hit 56th and get the SBoL to its full stats I Don't think it matters. Once you hit the recommended levels i'd definitely use the grinder and the SBoL though.<br />
<br />
Unless the stats are major league raped on the SBoL i'd prolly just use that combo at your level anyways. I ahve always hated the delay on the Frostbringer personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go Fleshgrinder/Frostbringer and sell the SBoL for other upgrades.<br />
With the 179dd proc on Fleshgrinder the slight disadvantage on ratio at 56 (13/19 to 12/19) compared to SBoL is almost zero.<br />
And Frostbringer offhand should make sure you have nice agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm contradictive replies hehe, right now at 50 the SBOL is a 12/19 for me, so it's the same as the Fleshy.  I think I'm going to go with the Fleshgrinder in my primary and the Frosty in off, the double procage seems better than the slight dps increase from the SBOL, any other opinions?  Or I was also thinking, what if I sold the SBOL and bought another Fleshy?  The SBOL sells for about 40k on my server and the Fleshy for 30k. That way if I were to sell the Frosty tool I could put about 15k into my gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont know about your server but Fleshgrinders are usually very hard to find on Terris and about 50% more expensive than SBoL. (50k if you can find one)<br />
I'd still stick to frosty in offhand though as the proc off fleshgrinder is pure dps but no or low agro.<br />
I would spend the cash on some armor upgrades, like boots, greaves and another earring.<br />
40k from a sold SBoL would get you very far upgrading these slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually got the Fleshy for 30k on Tholuxe Paells, good deal apparently.  So I should stick with the Fleshy in my main and Frosty in my offhand?  And than sell the Sbol for cash?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I would go Fleshgrinder/Frostbringer and sell the SBoL for the upgrades to other slots.  I used to wield a Frostbringer offhand with Prismatic 1hb (13/20) in main.  The aggro was solid provided others paid attention and played intelligently.<br />
<br />
Another option may be to sell the Frostbringer and buy a Great Staff of Thunder.  Keep the other two for non tanking DPS and use GSoT for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the great staff of thunder has a level 55 requirement so he got 4 levels before he can use it.  I say get a windblade for the time being then sell that for the greatstaff of thunder when you hit 55</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, only problem with the Windblade idea is that the Windblades don't go for less than 75k on Tholuxe Paells, and I would have a difficult time selling the Fleshgrinder and SBOL for more than 30 each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HOLY CRAP  the windblade on Tunare goes for 25k to 45k wow.  I guess the great staff of thunder would be higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya just use whatever till you can use a GoT then get that.  You may likely be dps more then MT in PoP zones till then...would be a very good opportunity to buy a Tae Ew War Maul (the 2hb Tae Ew hammer...dunno if i got the name right) and use that for dps to get your 2hb up in anticipation of GoT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But how often is it that you can use a non proccing weapon in an exp group (unless you dual box) and keep agro (especially if your skill isnt maxed or at least very close to max).<br />
When playing my cleric i havent seen a single warrior who could keep agro in a way that the chanter/necro/druid could do their job without having to be very careful when warrior used windblade or dualwielded fast non proc weapons.<br />
Cannot comment on GoT as i have only seen one warrior in a group using it ever and that was on a raid and he was using it for dps rather than gaining agro (but all but one of our tanks have at least one enraging blow weapon).</div></div><hr />
