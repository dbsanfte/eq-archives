<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aside from the mask in VT, there are none that iksar can use with infinite recasts, i checked endlessly =(. i usually just buy invis potions in pok, closest building to PoT stone. they are insta cast 1 charge invis, 10p each with max vendor cha. even if i had a perma cast invis item, i'd still keep an insta invis pot for emergencies, like when you absolutly cant stop to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like the cloudy potions from PoK, I have incarnadine BP but I get tired of the invis lasting less time than it took to cast so 9 out of 10 times I use a potion since the invis lasts a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qaladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Incardine BP has the same effect as a cloudy potion. Different, name, but same effect. Its all in your mind if you think a potion lasts any longer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yiktin Voxbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gnomish Vanishing Device, You will need mana batteries (Class5) to recharge it , in a toolbox. In the space where you would keep 2 invis potions, you can have the GVD With its 5 charges and 20 batteries, thereby giving you 105 charges of Invis, where U would of had 2 potions.<br />
<br />
Now, having said that...... GVD Has a cast time, potions do not, can use a opotion while running.<br />
<br />
At least now you have another option. This item is Tinkered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never heard of such an item, Mokor, could you dig up a link or something for it, please? :)<br />
<br />
Yiktin: Are there any clickable invis items (unlimited charges) <br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions tho! :)</div></div><hr />

My problem with the incarnadine BP is I forget to swap my Vindi back in when I get to the camp.  <br />
<br />
/laugh<br />
<br />
I tanked Auliffe Chaoswind like that, didnt realize it until i tried to switch the incarnadine back in to invis and saw that it was already equipped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try forgetting to switch out your gnomish vanishing device and tanking! ! The DPS really drops :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think Yitkin hit on your best solution being an iksar..but add a Collapsible toolbox.<br />
<br />
GVD, a stack of mana batteries AND Collapsible toolbox will take up 3 slots in a backpack and give you 100 charges of invis.  Heck, I dont know that I've clicked my cobalt legs more than 100 times in the last year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Only problem is either you have to buy or farm the mana batteries.<br />
<br />
Batteries from vendors with my low cha is 67pp each (1,320 for a stack) which vendors never have a stack and in bazaar the cheapest Ive seen is 50pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">there is a gnome in PoK that sells UNLIMITED amounts of mana batteries, all types.<br />
<br />
Anyone who buys mana batteries in the bazaar is uninformed or being deliberately foolish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">...or forgetting to put away your +cha Steins after unloading and proceeding to charge into a new dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i wish i could rember what it was, its a rok item before velious. casted gater shadows. might have been prenerf circlet. don't rember if he had to equip it or not to cast.<br />
<br />
come to think of do you need to be a sk/nec to use cos from invientory</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok , Im trying to understand here. so, you ae saying that it is smarter to pay 67 plat for a battery off of a vendor then to go to the bazaar and pay 50 plat?</div></div><hr />
