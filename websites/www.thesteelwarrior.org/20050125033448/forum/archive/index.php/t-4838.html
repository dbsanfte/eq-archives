<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carnatus</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I read the threads about weapon procs and what not indicating that normally weapons proc twice per minute in primary and once in secondary.  <br />
My question is does this still pertain to weapons that have a proc and are augmented with a second proc from LDON?<br />
<br />
For that matter has anyone done the parses for LDON procs?  Are they in line with the regular weapon procs?<br />
<br />
What about spell procs like the palys get?  Anyone know if they have the same proccing behavior?<br />
<br />
Sorry if these are stupid questions... I am at work and have only minimal time to search forums...<br />
<br />
Oh, here is a comment  for everyone to slam... :)  I have never parsed it, but I swear I have never had a lifetap weapon that procced for shit in all the years I have played... :)</div></div><hr />

People have parsed it. Icon based procs (Pally procs, warrior clicky Call of XXXX) proc the same rate as well as I recall.</div></div><hr />
