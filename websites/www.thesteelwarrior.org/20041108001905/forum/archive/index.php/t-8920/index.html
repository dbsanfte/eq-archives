<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Folks,<br />
<br />
As you can see by my tiny little number off to the left, I'm not an avid poster here, but I tend to read anything and everything I can get my hands on.<br />
<br />
That said, I've searched through the forums as well as the Library for something definitive on the subject, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
My inquiry is simple.  What is the calculation for incoming melee damage while using the Evasive Discipline?<br />
<br />
Based solely on the Lucy spell description (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4503&amp;source=Live), Evasive reduces the chance to be hit by a melee swing by 50%.<br />
<br />
In my searching, I wasn't able to find anything to disprove that definition, but on the other hand, I was unable to find any evidence that it is fully accepted as true either.  Generally speaking, as you all know, most people suggest weighing your discipline use between Defensive and Evasive based on the DB and DI values of the mob you're fighting - where a higher max hit and/or higher DI suggests the use of Defensive to avoid spikes and the like.<br />
<br />
But this leads me to wonder, does Evasive truly provide a situation of half damage received for it's duration, or is there another calculation prior to the 50% reduction that I don't know about?  In other words, does the 50% reduction affect the DI, for example, where 50% of the time, only the DB damage will hit you, but not the (DI*x) or is it actually 50% of the total swings?<br />
<br />
I will very likely find myself some good parsing mobs to test it out on, but I figured while I was at work and thinking about it I'd inquire with others, as I'm sure there's been extensive testing on the subject (I just lack the ability to find any founded information on it!)<br />
<br />
Any insight would be greatly appreciated,<br />
<br />
