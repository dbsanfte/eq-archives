<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard things about taunting at a certain time, right after slow or right after someone else got aggro, will have better results. Is that true? Is there a certain time you should taunt? I have taunt on hotkey 3, slam on 5. So i press 35 every 2 seconds to make sure that no time gets wasted, i don't even look of it's up or not. Probably messes up my keyboard a bit, but at least taunt is always being used with no gaps inbetween. Is this a good way to taunt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emeralde</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
I made a macro that triggers my hot buttons 9 and 10 whenever i press the up arrow to step forward. I always have taunt in 9 and either disarm or kick in 10.  Works pretty well.  I have also used that method for other things such as sense heading and forage (for my druid)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt works by putting you at the top of the hate list.  It does not add any hate if you're already on top, but if you are not, it bumps you up to top (aside from low health agro of course).  Because of this, the ONLY time your taunt is not being wasted is after someone takes agro from you.  I generally don't use any macros or mash my taunt key, but do this:  As soon as I see tash hit, taunt.  If taunt doesn't work, be ready to /shield the enchanter.  As soon as slow hits, taunt.<br />
<br />
If at any time you see a mob summon someone (you will not evade me, &lt;insert name here&gt; !!!), Taunt.  If at any time you see another group members health bar dropping, taunt.  In other words, any time you remotely believe you might have lost agro, go ahead and taunt.  If you time taunts right, you will rarely lose agro, and your group will love you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carne</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm. How thrilled is your uber nuking wizard going to be about having to get beaten upon while you wait for your taunt to come back up?<br />
<br />
I spam taunt (as appropriate) until it's maxxed for that level. After that, I don't use it until I lose aggro. I will often taunt right after a slow or nuke, but usually if I haven't lost aggro, there is no need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to hunt in a trio: 55 shaman, 55 ranger, and myself 55 warrior. Once I arrive at camp with a mob in tow, I immediately slap auto on and begin mashing 'disarm'. I hold taunt for a few seconds until slow lands. I watch for, &quot;Shaman begins to cast a spell&quot; then I try to time my taunt to land just as slow lands. After the mob is debuffed I spam 'taunt' and 'disarm' for a few rounds, and if the mob is sticking on me i leave off on taunt to make sure that it is available should the mob turn to the ranger, sit agro the shaman, whatever.<br />
<br />
Is this more effective? Hard to tell. When the shaman slows early and I get a succesful taunt in the second it lands, you can definitely see the effect on the mob. It peels off of me, runs toward the shaman, then turns around and focuses on me again. I usually have to reposition after this as the shaman is either behind me or to a side.<br />
<br />
All I know for sure is that having taunt available and ready to use when you NEED agro is better than spamming it when you already have the mobs attention.<br />

When you already have agro, mashing your taunt key is basically wasting it. You want to make sure it is available for when you lose the agro.</div></div><hr />

You'll make your groupies much happier. When you do lose agg and taunt doesn't turn mob on first push, use your /shield ability...again, happy groupies ;)<br />

<br />
I can finally get aggro and establish it, and not have to worry about losing it mid fight.<br />
<br />
Of course, without a proc, I'm back to being the taunt, taunt, taunt, TURN DAMN YOU %T, TURN! type of warrior I always was.<br />
<br />
But the RNG has been quite kind to me lately.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just realized this sort of reads wrong. I don't mash taunt during a fight when I have aggro. But due to the aggro some spells draw, and/or the general lack of aggro management that some melees tend to employ, even when I wait to hit taunt only when I LOSE aggro, I still end up having to mash it and mash it and mash it, just to get the mob to turn BACK to me. I just figure it's something all warriors go through. Every few mobs you get one that really REALLY doesn't like the slower, or really REALLY doesn't like to be snared on INC or DoT'd and hated on by an SK or whatever. And it's those mobs where the taunt refresh seems to be an eternity. I've long since given up trying to get people in NON-raid settings to actually take aggro management seriously. Half the time I just think people are TRYING to get aggro from me on purpose. Thank god for red blade procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty straight forward for me:<br />
<br />
1. In Exp Groups, Taunt when needed, but have it ready.<br />
<br />
2. On Raid when you're tanking, taunt every time it refreshes no matter what</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, usually i taunted non-stop no matter what..and, well, unless slow gets resisted the mob usually doesn't get off me when being slowed. From what i'm reading that seems to be the incorrect way to taunt, or the raid way. <br />
<br />
Well, today in PoV i've tried the method posted here: taunt only when you lose aggro. It did work, most of the time. The mob starts running after slower, i taunt, it gets back on me. However, there was a few problems. Mobs run fast, and if i'm standing there fighting and the mob gets slowed it will sometimes be beating on the chanty far away before i'm able to throw my unused taunt at it. Worse, sometimes i taunt but the mob is already too far away! And of course, in both cases the slower takes hits unless red blade proc goes off before the slow. So...is there a way to fix this? I didn't have this problem when i was just pressing taunt non stop. <br />
<br />
Also, i have another question. Mobs have a certain ammount of hate on someone, right? I know they have a hate list, which is who to kill in what order, and i know taunt puts you higher on the hate list. But, don't mobs also have a certain ammount of hate on everyone and taunt gives you more hate? For example, you had 100 hate and taunt gives you 30 more(just an example, i don't know the numbers or if such thing even exists)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But, don't mobs also have a certain ammount of hate on everyone and taunt gives you more hate? <br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge, taunt will not give you more hate if you are at the top of the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of us had to suffer through low dps and I can say that if your being out dps'ed by a large margin then you need to ride that taunt button a lot.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I used to group with a guildie rog that had 41% haste + ssra weapons and I was using an rbg and... hrm, swarmer pincer and axe of venous brood.  He ganked agro if I did not taunt continuosly.<br />
<br />
The point is... I taunt a lot at the begining of a fight and go afk toward the end but I can do this with a certain grade of weapon + offensive aa and having group mates that won't gank agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs run fast, and if i'm standing there fighting and the mob gets slowed it will sometimes be beating on the chanty far away before i'm able to throw my unused taunt at it. Worse, sometimes i taunt but the mob is already too far away! <br />
<br />
Two points here:<br />
<br />
First, you need to be paying attention to your text window - watch for messages indicating when an aggro generator lands. Also, ideally, your casters are CALLING their casts (insist that they do). This way, for example, shammy calls &quot;casting slow on mob_01&quot; - now you know to watch for the message 'mob_01 yawns' to appear in your text box and are rdy to hit taunt if the mob suddenly turns (you'll get so good you will know right when the msg is about to appear - and catching the mob in the act of turning to maul the shammy and ripping his attention back to you WILL get your skills noticed and appreciated). <br />
<br />
Same goes for any aggro generator (slow, tash, nuke, etc). You can look up the messages that will appear under the spell info on allakahzam - get to know them well and your groups will notice that you keep the mobs off of them and invite you back. I redirect all spell messages (and nothing else) to one of my text boxes and I watch that box like a hawk so that I can keep track at all times of who is doing what in my group - this is a key part of being a highly aware tank, and a highly aware tank is one that will keep his or her group alive and xping a helluva lot more than one who is not.<br />
<br />
BTW - a lot of casters only call when their casts LAND - I ask the ones I work with to call when they START the cast so that I can be on the lookout either for a resist (no msg) or a stick (msg appears). Works very well. The idea is that, as warriors whose aggro is not near guaranteed like pallies and SKs, we have to use every trick we can to build and maintain aggro. Asking your group members to do their part to help you keep them alive is not asking too much, after all!<br />
<br />
Second, tell the casters in the group - especially the ones who are not practicing (or even aware of) good aggro management and just can't seem to wait to start casting aggro generators - that they need to be CLOSE to you (just beyond max melee is good - you don't want them to proximity aggro the mob unnecessarily) so that when, as inevitably must happen, the mob turns on them and your taunt fails, you have the best chance to both protect them and regain aggro by:<br />
<br />
1. Using as needed the /shield &lt;insert caster name&gt; hotkey you should have made when the group formed, and/or when group members changed. Note that shield does not work beyond a certain (short) distance, so if they are further away than that distance, you cannot protect them.<br />
2. Continuing to generate hate by beating on the mob instead of missing hits while running after the mob who is running after the silly finger wiggler who has probably panic'd and is very probably about to die. Caster needs to stand there and let you peel the mob off of him via damage aggro and taunt (when it finally pops back up again) - and running may even put him or her OOR of cleric heals. Depending on the situation, I often can get aggro back even before taunt pops back up again due solely to the dmg I am doing putting me back on top of the hate list. In short, if they run they'll only die tired.<br />
<br />
To sum up, if the casters are too far from you, then you cannot shield them, your taunt is useless, and you are not generating hate from damage or proximity to regain aggro. If casters in your group can't understand that the safest place for them is relatively close to your side after you explain things to them, then you need to find new casters.<br />
<br />
As for taunt/hate list, the consensus seems to be that there are two ways to move up the hate list:<br />
<br />
1. incremental quantities of hate building up from melee dmg, spells, procs, etc - this appears to be additive. Say your melee damage has built you up to 400 hate and shammy lands a spell causing 500 hate - shammy is now 100 above you (and mob turns on shammy) until your melee damage or a proc or whatever puts you back on top.<br />
 <br />
2. taunt: this is not a quantity-of-hate added per se like above - rather, taunt 'pushes' you onto the top of the hate 'stack' - so there is no amount of hate like 30 or 100 or whatever associated with taunt. When successful, it simply puts you 1 above whoever was at the top before you taunted. <br />
<br />
Also, most tanks I know do not mash taunt when MTing a raid, since if you have aggro already it does nothing for you, but if this works for you, feel free...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, taunt does the following<br />
<br />
SuccessfullTaunt makes YourAggro=(TopAggroNotIncludingYou+TauntSkill)<br />
<br />
Now, this might be TauntSkill/2, or TauntSkill over 3, or whatever. It doesn't really matter. Point is, Taunt will put you over the top aggro level but a small, but NOT insignicant, amount. I've said this from the time when most people beleive taunt was TopAggro + 1. As I've said for probably about a year, IMO this is proveble by taunint a level 5 mob vrs a level 1 PC... The mob will often focus on you for the entire fight.<br />
<br />
Now, IME, mashing taunt can help... IF another PC in your group/Raid is just barely beating your melee aggro. For example, if you would lose aggro to a rogue or monk every 7-8 seconds, it would be helpfull to mash taunt every time it came up, and every time it was successful, that rogue would not have to evade, and you would basically gain aggro as fast as that rogue or monk.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, my weapons are BoC mainhand, and Primal or RedBlade Epic offhand, depending on if Avatar is up. SKs and Pallies have to actually try to keep aggro past a proc, so I only really use taunt during the first, say, 30 seconds of a fight.<br />
Beleive it or not (I knoow convential wisdom is that epic sucks) after BoC or redblade proc, I generally can go AFK and keep aggro.<br />
<br />
However, that first 30 seconds can be critical during, for example, an exp group. I've experianted exessively with Garish Head Dress Vrs Helm of Rallos Zek (Garish Head Dress is 10% to taunt, while Helm of Rallos Zek is a massive HP, AC, and Sta Upgrade) and found that, even when using BoC/RedBlade, I can hold aggro more efficectively when I taunt just after slow. I don't generally have issue just after Tash.<br />
<br />
Basically, what I am saying, is that, emphirally, to me, the best usage of taunt depends on when and to who you are losing aggro to. I am FAR from being called the best warrior in my guild, or even server, much less serverwide. My opinion may be TOTALLY wrong, since I can't back it up with any amount of or logging that would convince anyone  but me. Mash taunt or save taunt as you feel helps you the most, as I've found both to be more effective, depending on what I was wielding and what other aggro I was facing.<br />
<br />
In fact, if I had to say anything... I've face other 65 warriors in PoV/BoT, with the two of use fighting for aggro. I'd say, actually... remembering to use kick (Remember, 55plus kick causes a stun, and stun is considered a major aggro) manages to cause more aggro then many people seem to think.<br />
<br />
If I have ANYTHING to back me up on this, before I had Blade of Carnage, I once got a tell from a paladin I grouped with. We were both 65. He said  &quot;Dayum. I thought you were a SK, and actually had to mem more stuns to keep aggro, I didn't realize you were a warrior till I looked at you and realized you were DWing. I'll stop running OOM stunning and let you have aggro, if you can keep it off of my group heals&quot;. As an Iksar Warrior, I'm used to being mistaken for a monk or SK, as they seem to be more common then warrior, but when I am fighting for aggro to see who gets to be MA for an EXP group, being mistaken for an SK by a pally, especially before I got an Enraging Blow or Taunting Blow weapon, was a hell of a compliment,.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd concur with whats been said. i only taunt when i lose aggro and not before. <br />
<br />
on a fresh pull, when slows incoming, i will wait to see caster message. once slow lands or is resisted and mob aggroes sham, then taunt - disarm - kick/bash. <br />
<br />
i have also found it more ffective to load up my proccers for the initial stages of the fight. usually they will proc before the slow lands in which case mob doesnt shift attention - saving the need to taunt. once slow lands, i can then swop out to dps wep.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Well, today in PoV i've tried the method posted here: taunt only when you lose aggro. It did work, most of the time. The mob starts running after slower, i taunt, it gets back on me. However, there was a few problems. Mobs run fast, and if i'm standing there fighting and the mob gets slowed it will sometimes be beating on the chanty far away before i'm able to throw my unused taunt at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm fortunate to hunt with the same people on a regular basis, and even though we have been together for 40+ levels now we had this same problem. We do most of our fighting in close-quarters, dungeon-type zones. The way our shaman solved this problem was to position herself right behind  me for slow/cripple. If she gets agro and post-slow taunt fails, the mob just sits there while I /shield and hope the next taunt works. Now, convincing people in pickup groups to do this would be a pain I'm sure, but in a solid group of friends it might be worth a try.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know if this is the standard for most warriors, but a useful hotkey setup for /shield is:<br />
<br />
/assist (switches to the mob's target)<br />
/pause 1<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
This works very well for me in groups where there are 2 or more casters in the group who might get agro.  When there is only one caster, or if I am in charge of pulling non-mezzable charm-breaks off of the one particular chanter:<br />
<br />
/shield &lt;name&gt;<br />
<br />
works really well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done some PoI factory yesterday, easier to test this here. As i've tried this more and practiced a bit, taunting right after losing aggro does give it quickly. Thanks for all the advice :) However, i still have a few questions.<br />
1) If taunt puts you on the top of the aggro list, what is the purpose of taunting more than once before breaking mez? And, on the same topic, i've grouped with a low lvl slower yesterday also and he was getting lots of aggro with his slow, it sometimes took me more than 1 taunt to get it back. Is there a way to change this?<br />
2) With this method others are not getting hit too much, but the problem is repositioning and fighting big mobs. Is there a way to keep aggro non-stop? I mean, on a raid it hurts not holding aggro for even a second with a hard hitting mob. Not only the casters will get beat up badly or killed, everyone will have to reposotion if the mob moves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) If taunt puts you on the top of the aggro list, what is the purpose of taunting more than once before breaking mez?

Is there a way to change this? <br />
<br />
As far as I know, multiple taunting for breaking mez is mainly required because taunt fails a lot.  I've done 3 taunt/beg/disarm's on a mezzed mob just to have it ignore me...and I've also just taunted once than accidentally hit kick and had the mob glued to me. One method I've seen work really well is to have group members completely slow, snare, and debuff the mob while mezzed (with the warrior taunting), then have someone root it at the end before I break mez. By the time root breaks I usually have agro, and if not the chanter is being /sheilded while getting wacked by a slowed, debuffed mob.<br />
<br />
Sometimes mobs just decide to hate 1 person a LOT, and it's nearly impossible to pull them off. Your slower might have been getting that wierd agro for no reason, because of their lower lvl, because they slowed too early, or maybe they were throwing in other debuffs/dots depending on class. If my shaman partner gets a slow and cripple in on a mob before I have it on me it takes a while before I can get it to turn to me, and often the ranger has to nuke it off of her then jolt it back to me.<br />
<br />
2) With this method others are not getting hit too much, but the problem is repositioning and fighting big mobs. Is there a way to keep aggro non-stop? I mean, on a raid it hurts not holding aggro for even a second with a hard hitting mob. Not only the casters will get beat up badly or killed, everyone will have to reposotion if the mob moves. <br />
<br />
Being a warrior I've found only two really good ways to hold agro all of the time. The best way is when everyone in the group does everything they can to keep the agro on you. ANY class can outagro a warrior, it's through cooperation with the group that we can put our HP and damage mitigation abilities to their best use. The other way is to just have insane gear with maxed dex and frequent VERY high agro procs...um, but if you're broke like me it's kind of a non-option.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When breaking mez, I try to stand behind the mob and taunt once then slam to break mez.  If slam lands then there is a short stun and stuns add a bit more aggro.  Also, from behind you get a small added chance to hit.<br />
<br />
In addition, if you have a druid or ranger or wizard, have them land snare while the mob is mezed.  This places them above the enchanters aggro and if taunt fails then they can easily get away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All this work to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
Lets just say that the other night, a paladin was holding aggro effortlessly.  And he had a shield on.<br />
<br />
Honestly he could have been holding a book in his primary hand and hold aggro.  The Shammy got hit maybe 2-3 times in 4 hours of exp grinding.  Shouldn't we be able to do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because that is our lot in life Lorre.  I enjoy the challenge that getting and maintaining agro presents... honestly I think the game would be boring as hell if I didn't constantly have to worry about losing agro.<br />
<br />
Agro control is what makes a warrior a warrior... if you want perfect agro control that works even if yer naked, go delete your warrior and make a pally. don't be lazy though... enjoy it.  It keeps the game challenging.<br />
<br />
And anyway, if we were to gain the ability to hold agro flawlessly, that would mean that Sony would have to increase the DPS of pallies and SKS (since it's lower than ours) and probably increase their mitigation/avoidance and hps.<br />
<br />
Plus, by making agro holding a challenge, Sony has allowed the GOOD warriors to shine past the bad warriors.  People notice who can hold agro and who cannot, and when two 65 warriors are LFG, you had better believe your agro holding skill will make the difference between which one people will pick.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't think taunt is broken.  I don't think taunt needs to be upgraded.  I'm quite content with being exactly how I am, and I know that I can consistantly hold agro for 4 hours nonstop, and that I will have well over 8k hps while doing it, and the max mitigation/avoidance a warrior is allowed, and that my dps will be better than a pally or SKs.<br />
<br />
What's not to like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well there are times when I want a challenge, and a time when I want to kick back and just lvl.  If you compared the aggro ability of knights vs warriors, its such a huge difference.  <br />
<br />
When I first made a warrior, I knew the role that warriors take.  I imagined holding two shields, and just acting like a body guard for the rest of the raid party.  Knights can do this with no problem at all.  We have to rely on weapons with random procs inorder to hold &quot;indisputed attention&quot; of the mob.  <br />

Why make everyone in the group change their play tactics because we cant do our job effectively.  With this Paly, the shammy could slow while the mob was running in, the wiz could nuke above 50%, and no one got hit once during the fight.  If I was tanking, it would be like a game of ping pong.  The Mob would jump back and forth for a while till I regained aggro.  Do you really want to do that every fight?  Is it that fun?</div></div><hr />

So...when 2 65 warriors are LFG, you better believe the other warriors uber equipment will get him into the group rather then your ability to taunt at the right time. But heh, that's not the biggest problem - the problem is Pallys and SKs holding aggro too easily. Decreasing their DPS would be unfair, but making our taunt extremely powerful would make it too easy to hold aggro for us. Maybe the best idea would be decreasing the ammount of aggro pally/SK spells give them so that they actually lose aggro sometimes. Their spells exist to give them more things to do instead of just melee, and some soloing abilities and an advantage in PvP. Their spells do not exist just to give them aggro, so they can't complain if their spells suddenly give them less aggro and they actually have to use taunt.</div></div><hr />

Interesting you say this.. because you see, procs are not infallible.  I don't care what he's wielding, if he doesn't know when to taunt, and he doesn't proc, hes screwed, and everyone realizes that despite all the glamor, and all the attempt to divert attention, he's just a tool that has sacrificed his freedom for some gear... and then didn't even bother to learn how to play his class.<br />
<br />
And if a person that is too stupid to notice this fact decides to invite this incompetant uber warrior that you referr to, over me, then I am happy that I didn't end up grouping with a total moron that has the same risk as the incompetant warrior of getting the group killed.  I'm not that desperate.</div></div><hr />

Lets just say that the other night, a paladin was holding aggro effortlessly. And he had a shield on.<br />
<br />
Honestly he could have been holding a book in his primary hand and hold aggro. The Shammy got hit maybe 2-3 times in 4 hours of exp grinding. Shouldn't we be able to do this?<br />

No please dont nerf them.  They'll go after us if we got VI to swing the nerf stick!</div></div><hr />

They would still be able to keep aggro better, it would just take some work. Spells were do not exist only to give you aggro! For warriors it's already a challenge keeping aggro non-stop. But anyway, the very scary named ogre is right, this thread went way off topic.<br />
Thanks for all the advice! :) I'm getting a hang of this way of taunting now, and it really is alot better than just pressing taunt non stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your group spells is on, you can pretty much always tell when someone has a high chance of getting aggroed, i.e. the first two &quot;Enchanter begins to cast a spell&quot; and the second &quot;Shaman begins to cast a spell&quot; in just about any pulls.<br />
<br />
Get ready to taunt right away as soon as the spell lands, even if it doesn't look like it's summoning/running after the slower.  If you see &quot;XXX yawns&quot; or &quot;XXX slows down&quot; taunt right away.   Remember that your kick does stun and you might've just stunned it so it looked like it's still on you.  It never hurts to taunt after a tash or a slow.  If the spell is resisted, then you'd have to guess when it happened (since you don't see the resist mesage).  Usually, I taunt again after a few seconds after when a slow normally would've landed.  As long as your timing isn't horribly off, your taunt will be up again when the second slow comes in (especially for Enchanters since the slow takes a while to cast) so you don't lose anything.  <br />
<br />
Likewise taunting when any premature big heals or big nukes land is always a good idea.  Even the most suicidal of people usually don't do two consecutive huge aggro spells in a row, which means you shouldn't have to worry about taunt not up for the second spell.  It might not do anything.  It might fail.  But it might also work and save your group a deal of mana.  Even unslowed, there is often enough time between a mob is aggroed and a mob is ready to attack again for you to taunt it (since taunt is instant).  There are lots of time I'd see a caster summoned while sitting down and a successful taunt brings the mob right back, and the caster would sit smack by the mob as if nothing happened.  Oh yeah, if someone is summoned, always taunt too.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
-  First the obvious, taunt just after slow lands and keep it ready for snare as well.<br />
<br />
-  When the ranger gets 5 resists on snare with the mob still at 99% and not yet debuffed, ignore the ranger and hope he dies, turn until you see the cleric, run right up and stand on his feet, taunt when the mob tries to eat the cleric after he futily tried to keep the ranger alive, /shield or ae taunt if it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
-  When the monk opens up and refuses to FD to drop aggro, just let him tank and go pull another mob.<br />
<br />
-  When you taunt a mob off of Nukey_the_happy_wizzy and he immediately sits down, turn off attack and back off to make sure he dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My theory is that if I don't taunt a mob off someone who insist on nuking it with SoS the moment it comes in (or snare or whatever) and they die they'll eventually learn not to do it.  So far this theory has been mostly unsuccessful but it sure is pretty fun testing it out.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Taunt works by putting you at the top of the hate list. It does not add any hate if you're already on top, but if you are not, it bumps you up to top (aside from low health agro of course). &quot;<br />
<br />
that is exactly how it works.<br />
<br />
just 1 point i have to contribute. it is important to educate your debuffers / slowers to stand near the mob when slowing / debuffing. it makes it so much easier. this was discussed i think in the thread, but i thought i'd say it again. i play a shaman and it helps.</div></div><hr />
