<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to upgrade my gear with the limited funds that I have.  Whats a good Stamina number to have when going into exp groups?  I find that with a Shammy buffing, I usually max out stam and with the 255 cap, lose a lot of potential HP's.<br />
<br />
Should I keep my stam around 205-215 area and concentrate on +HP items?  Anyone have any suggestions that I can sell X piece and replace Y piece to upgrade my HP's/AC/Stats?  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackulle</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always try to keep my sta at the lowest possible number while still maxing it with buffs.  I could easily have it capped or very nearly without buffs, but the way I see it im always buffed so I get more hp return from buffs with a lower unbuffed sta.  Not sure about exact numbers as buffs have changed since last time I did any calculating on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just take the Max STA for your level and minus 50 if you have access to a &lt;63 Shammy or 60 if the shammy is 63+<br />
<br />
Basically &lt;60 Sta cap @205 and +hp after that.<br />
<br />
This of course assumes you're getting Shammy buffs.  If you solo go nuts up to 255.<br />
<br />
You're lucky and get all that nice FH armor dripping with HP.  Your neck is really the only place where I see you could swap STA for HP easily.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion of course.</div></div><hr />

One less buff is a good thing -- especially if you are getting Pot9/Symobl/WoG instead of Virtue.</div></div><hr />

Assuming equal amounts of +HP items, you end up with the exact same amount of HP whether you max STA with gear of buffs. You should aim for anything over the min needed to max STA. Once your gear is good enough, go for max STA to save a buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't this thread overlooking the Infusion of Spirit Shammy / BL spell?  Extra 45 stamina, it stacks with Riotous Health (another 50).  So a 54 Shammy can bless us with 95 stamina.<br />
<br />
Downside, obviously is the slot occupation.  So for RAID max buffing you'd probably want to get within 60 of max.</div></div><hr />

I do check my buff stack frequently to make sure I don't have any unneeded buffs on though.  Its not usually a problem until you get 2 or more dots on ya.  If your cleric has radiant cure thats pretty easy to fix in most cases.</div></div><hr />

You used to able to get more hps having bst buffs than the lvl 60 shammy focus, but now that shammies have  Focus of the Soul/ Seventh, you get about 200more hps.  It still is a little less sta then going the with the BST lineup, but not that noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go for the highest raw HP items you can get while still maintaining high enough STA to hit the cap with buffs.  Eventually that STA number will creep up to max unbuffed but that's okay.  It saves you a buff slot when you get there.  A side bonus is that when you upgrade a no sta item to one with both more HPs and sta your unbuffed HPs shoot through the roof.  I got a Talisman of Vah Kerrah last night and gained over 200 HPs unbuffed!  Woot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Folks, sta is just hitpoints.  It is not important that you can cap your STA with buffs.  Just look at it as hitpoints.  If I can get an item that is -10 sta + 100 hps over what I am wearing now, I'm all over it.  Try to max your hps...if that means taking off STA gear for raw hps, do it, even if it means you won't be max STA buffed.  Do whatever gives you the most hitpoints.  Raw hitpoints are better than STA hitpoints in all cases, but don't spend a lot of time thinking about whether your STA is capped or not, get the items that give you the best max hp number buffed.<br />
<br />
Having 305 unbuffed STA is nice to save a buff slot, but make sure you're not losing more hitpoints than you're gaining from STA<br />
<br />
This is kind of confusing, but what I mean is, look at your HP number, not your STA number.</div></div><hr />
