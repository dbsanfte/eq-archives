<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't used Avatar proc in a while, but recently I broke it out. I was at 1581 ATK with self buffs, Grim Aura and Aura of Battle. Once Avatar proced my ATK is now 1575. Odd, ATK was lowered by 6 points. I was talking to another person in my guild. He was at 1588ish with Grim Aura only. Once Avatar proced...ATK was still at 1588. It did not move.<br />
<br />
Now I understand that Avatar is part of the worn ATK cap, but has this finally been hard coded visually in? It would seem so. Still very odd for ATK to go from 1581 to 1575.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cap on Avatar is coded visually as well.  Friend was testing out with Primal at around 220ish worn attack and attack certainly didn't go up by 133 when Avatar procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Avatar cap attack goes towards the attack cap.  The cap is 250 worn attack.  So if you have 250 attack from items already, you would not gain any attack if you procced avatar.  If you have 240 worn attack, you would gain 10 attack and so on.  This only applies to the proc avatar, the spell avatar will go over.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But wouldn't Avatar, which gives much more ATK than Grim Aura, push it higher, or at the very least keep it the same if he was at 244 worn ATK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no because grim aura apparently does not count towards the cap for worn attack so....<br />
<br />
Step By Step  <br />
Your at the worn attk 250 cap<br />
<br />
you have Grim Aura on which doesn't count towards worn cap<br />
<br />
avatar overwrites Grim aura taking away grim auras attack boost, but since your at the 250 cap avatar doesn boost your attack any</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats because grim aura is the SoT/SV spell-line, which doesn't count toward atk cap.</div></div><hr />
