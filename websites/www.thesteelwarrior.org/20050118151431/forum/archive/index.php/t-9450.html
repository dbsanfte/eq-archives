<br />
He'd also need a collection of small furry animals and virgin maidens, to sacrfice to the Gods of Taunt.<br />
<br />
A bottle of whiskey would come in handy to comfort himself after realizing he just made himself into a pally without spells.</div></div><hr />

The only time I ever equip a shield is if I've already gotten a good half dozen or so anger procs, furious and defensive are down, and the mob is pounding the crap outta me.  Essentially this means, only on boss mobs in raids or xp groups if we're in over our heads.<br />
<br />
As to holding agro...you won't unless you've already built up a sizable hate lead over everyone else.<br />
<br />
In 3 months with the SC I've used it maybe a dozen times.  (although it was nice the other night when I accidentally pulled 5 in a hard ldon  :p )</div></div><hr />

I usually don't start the fight with it, and I might swap it out still for a few hits in the fight.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-21-2004, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Step 1: Get a group of people who know what they're doing and how to prevent themselves from pulling agro (Evading rogue, Jolting ranger, concussioning wizard, etc)<br />
<br />
Step 2: Always group with them.  Let them learn how much agro they can work with while you have a shield up.<br />
<br />
Step 3: Pray<br />
<br />
1 and 2 might cover you with a shield, but 3 isn't a bad idea either.</div></div><hr />
