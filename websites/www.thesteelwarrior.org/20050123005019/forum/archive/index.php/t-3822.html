<br />
     I have a few questions regarding this charm some of you might be able to help me with... <br />
<br />
How many flags can &quot;1&quot; solid group obtain to add stats to this charm? And can you name them please...<br />
<br />
After those flags are achieved, what will the stats be on the charm?<br />
<br />
Thanks alot for your help... I am in a small family guild, so we cant do the big raid flags and such... We are nicely equipped however, coming from different guilds, so we can do alot of mobs that usually require 2 groups... I am sure the charm would benefit the other classes and mine even with few stats on it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the alternative entry quests you should be able to gain access to the following zones:<br />
<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
Plane of Valor/Storms<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
<br />
That would put your charm at 50% with 12AC, 7str, 5dex, 7sta, 5agl 50hps, 5save vs all<br />
<br />
Don't know if there is an alt entry quest to torment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only real (not alternate entry) flag to upgrade this charm that you can get with one group is the trial of execution in PoJ.  You might be able to do other trials but they are usually considered harder.<br />
<br />
You might be able to do BoT tower key with 2 good groups if they have really good gear like all VT stuff but usually 3 to 4 groups is safer on the mini bosses in the plane of storms if the people don't have good gear.<br />
<br />
You can also get alternate entry flags to (I believe) tactics, torment, crypt of decay, and halls of honor with just one group.  These are basically to let you group in these zones but they don't count towards elemental progression.  They do increase stats on the charm and give AA points. <br />
<br />
So basically, you can probably get all 6 pre-elemental zone flags with a small guild which gives the stats below but to try to go farther you need a more powerful guild that can kill Maneatic Behemoth, Terris Thule, Aerin Dar, and Grummus to get the real flags.<br />

I'm not positive, but I believe that the endurance ring test in the factory in PoI gives key access to Torment.  Unfortunately last I looked there wasn't much info about the ring since very few people seem to try it.  So if I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the quest is given in Plane of Tranquility and requires getting Orc love (in a matter of speaking)...<br />
