<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick question, is it better to work towards raw HP's on your items or towards stamina generated HP's? When I am comparing two items I try to go towards the raw HP's more than the stamina generated Hp's because when we are raiding I have a shammy there to buff the stamina giving me even more HP's, just wondering if this is the right avenue or should I worry about maxxing out my stam first?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter where they come from.  STA is hard capped though, so if you can replace STA hps for raw hps you are better off in the long run, because someday you will have maxed sta whether you try for it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest working towards maxing your sta unbuffed simply to free up an additional buff slot. On raids, that begins to matter quite a bit. It IS a personal choice, some people shoot for just enough sta to cap out shaman buffed. Brutul is right though, you'll cap stamina whether you want to or not eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go with direct hps over stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your magelo says you have 242 stamina and a whole lot of empty augment slots if it is current.  You are pretty close to the point of diminishing returns on stamina.  After 255 stamina it isn't as many hit points per stamina point so I would also say go for raw hit points as the main criteria for upgrading gear.  On raids, with pp1, you should max out to 285 stamina (305 stamina with pp5 AA) when you get buffs.  Most gear you loot that has a lot of hit points will have some stamina on it anyway.  As far as getting pp5, I would suggest you get the rest of your defensive AA skills before you max pp since those will give far more benefit than the extra 20 stamina from that will for now.<br />
<br />
If you are doing LDoN a lot, as a short term fix, try to get a few of the 6 point stamina augs if no one wants them if you want to increase both while you wait for better gear.  That is mainly just for when you have no shaman but if you can eventually replace a stamina aug with a pure hp one that is the better choice in the long run.</div></div><hr />
