Emailing soe at the general email address doesn't help either.  I'm beginning to wonder if they didn't move the entire QA department to work on EQ2 didn't bother replacing them.  <br />
How can you have such wide spread bugs in a game that brings in so much revenue?  If their is anyone actually working in  quality assurance on the everquest team is their a way to get their email address so that we can let them know what they missed?<br />
On a project as large as everquest their should be over 30  qa people with a supervisor, anyone heard who supervises the QA department?  Does it even exist?<br />
<br />
When they write the patch messages it we get information like <br />
<br />
-Some general bug fixes<br />
<br />
What the hell is this?  If we stopped doing something because it was bugged and they give us no information on what they fixed how are we supposed to know if it has been corrected.<br />
<br />
Has anyone reading this not been affected by a bug in game that has cost them time they could have spent doing other things?<br />
Seriously smed get your shit together.</div></div><hr />

They can do no wrong, the entertainment is cheap as hell, which is good since i spend all of my extra money upgrading my computer, oh and did I mention it is teh greatest gaeme ever?<br />

You sir, are a loser and just do not understand quality when you see it.  They are under no obligation at all to provide you with a quality product.</div></div><hr />

Lord, how you could fail to see that as a sarcastic post is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only things they fix in a hurry is exploits that benefit the player in a large way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmmm.  There's actually some game-theoretic basis for that (fixing major exploits but not major bugs).  Remember that we're dealing with a persistent world here, and that their primary goal (from an evolutionary point of view) has to be player retention, not player enjoyment.  <br />
<br />
If they permit a bug to persist, they will have many annoyed players.  But very few of them will be annoyed enough to quit the game, especially if the bug only affects a small percentage of dedicated players (such as &quot;all raiders&quot;, or &quot;most posters on Steel Warriors&quot;).  And the vast majority of players will never even really notice, or care that much if they do.  And they (the vast majority of players) certainly won't care that some raiding players are being hugely inconvenienced.<br />
<br />
Now suppose that there is an exploit that lets everyone whose character name starts with &quot;Haas&quot; gain XP at 100 times the normal rate.  As long as this is not general knowledge, it hurts no one (not even SOE), and nobody cares.  But as soon as it hits the message boards, it hurts the game enjoyment of *every single player that hears about it*.  Envy and jealousy are incredibly powerful forces.  &quot;There's a banker in Befallen giving unlimited plat, and you didn't know about it in time.&quot; will get rid of more players in one day than twenty days of &quot;And then on my high-end raid, I got ported to the zone and died 20 times in a row to a bug.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE is simply making those choices that ensure that they will continue to exist as a business entity.  And since my continued enjoyment of EverQuest depends on them making those choices in precisely that way, I have to support them in theory, even when the effect of their choices is personally aversive to me.<br />

Take care,<br />

P.S. played last night for the first time since the Dx9 patch (thank goodness my old Voodoo 5500 has stable freeware drivers still!), and...wow, but the geometry bounces and proximity errors and near-infinite mob reach and....ech.  Wow, they suck.  And I didn't even get ported to zone, or caught in a death loop, or anything.  Wake up, SOE!  Fix your stupid bugs!  What's wrong with you, you idiots?!?!  Okay.  Okay, I feel better now.  *wry grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">which is not to say that major bugs should be allowed to remain in the game for extended periods of time.  Such as loseing your group/raid while zoneing.<br />
<br />
You can't alt-tab out of game to check your email without black screening and crashing.   I think that effects more than a small percentage of their user base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that I would ever advocate using EQWindows (www.eqwindows.com).  But I'm reliably informed that it works exceptionally well for properly handling alt-tabbing and EQ, especially if one wants to play a hydra on one computer (as one can easily run multiple simultaneous sessions of EQ from a single directory using EQW).  And there's a new version out that handles the new Dx9 EQ.<br />

Or so I'm told,<br />

<br />
P.S. Why SOE hasn't simply made an arrangement with the author of EQWindows to handle their windowed mode for them is utterly beyond me.  *baffled shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scruppy</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They dont care about people using eqwindows anymore, there's no need to be so discreet about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eqwindows is not on the shitlist anymore. Now if you came out and said something to the effect of &quot;I use macroquest or eq play nice religiously&quot; then you'd have something to be worried about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps I'm a little overcautious.  But SOE's standards are arcane enough that I'd rather talk about the tools my friends use, rather than those I use.<br />
<br />
Strictly for the record, however, I will state that while I have acquaintances who use MacroQuest, I don't, as the ability to observe spawns seems too much like cheating to me.  I'm starting to wonder if this is really a sensible perspective, however, when it comes to LDoN missions, where absolutely no one is harmed by more efficient farming of the nameds.  Opinions?<br />
<br />
However, &quot;this friend of mine&quot; uses EQWindows religiously, and swears by it.  <br />

Take care,<br />

More so than the regular version.  Since the fix on the 25th, I've yet to crash once while in eqw... regular EQ is another story.</div></div><hr />
