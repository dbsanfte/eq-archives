<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He does not give two shits about you or the game all he cares about is using cheats hacks and exploits to make more money. FUCK YANTIS and FUCK IGE. They are ruining the game for you and me and here you are seriously contemplating this Raaj seriously man I am dissappointed in you. That probably doesn't mean much coming from me but still don't sell your integrirty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok if we are talking about AD banner on top of the page there are other companies that do this. It doesn't have to be Yantis or IGE<br />
<br />
Companies do advertise on meesage broads I frequently visit www.pcmech.com forums and they have banner on top from respectabul companies that deal with the message boards. We have alot of traffic so they might be interested. <br />
<br />
This is a forum about a video game and we all need computers to play it. The following companies might be interested in sponsoring or just helping us with the costs of hosting by placing non-intrusive ads on the messageboard. Companies like<br />
<br />
www.dell.com<br />
www.newegg.com<br />
www.ebgames.com<br />
www.alienware.com<br />
<br />
Or other PC related Companies might be interested. This can be alternative to Yantis and IGE solution. I am going to research this more and post emails here so you can contact them more about this. I will send emails I will do the work. Just think about this as an alternative than allowing these criminals and more profits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just say NO to Yantis and IGE. IMO you should leave the site without advertising if donations are covering costs. If external revenue is *needed* to help pay for the site, then there are better places that could place advertising, as Gnomers has given a few options already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I voted no, because I know from another topic that this poll is asking about IGE.<br />
<br />
Yantis = Bad<br />
IGE = Bad<br />
<br />
Infact, I'm sure alot of people would leave if you allowed any plat/account/item seller/resellers advertise on the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depending on what type of ad it is, I might.<br />
<br />
If it's an ad from an honest and legal company, like SOE for example - Sure, np.<br />
<br />
If it was an ad from Yantis / IGE .. I dunno man, I'd be worried abuot being connected to them in any way if SOE started looking around I would feel real stupid supporting someone like Yantis / IGE.<br />
<br />
Especially since they are basically dumbing down the game I love to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since the only two 'companies' brought into the ad discussion were Tweedledum and Tweedledumber (i.e. MYSUPERSALES and IGE, for those late to the discussion), I voted no.<br />
<br />
 More honest poll question would have included the two companies who offered - that way, any visitors who weren't up to date wouldn't get tricked into voting YES or MAYBE and soothing your consciences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>chancy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To be honest, I would consider any ad that is animated (ie click on the bouncing dot to win a prize, etc) to be much worse than IGE/Yantis. If there are pop ups, I'll stay away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I will donate $25 a month if you decide to disallow ads from these unscrupulous companies. If you do, I won't. Having a continuous pledge drive may suck ass, but considering yantis/IGE as the alternative? No thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cuedyen2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The other thing to consider, will SOE continue posting (however infrequently) on a board sponsored by Yantis or IGE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If Yantis/IGE/Playerauctions adds are on here you've lost a visitor and sometimes poster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Make is a regular banner. No pop ups please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Make it a regular banner. No pop ups please. <br />
<br />
/agree, but with a stipulation that those that would undermind the integrity of an online community for their own personal gain aren't included in the banner. <br />
<br />
The day I see a Yantis/IGE add flashing at me from the top of TSW is the day I stop visiting. If money is tight for bandwidth let folks know. I'm sure that it can be worked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gankan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well it's been said enough on here already I suppose but I guess I'll add my two copper.<br />
<br />
Just say NO to Yantis or IGE. No plat/account/item selling companies.<br />
<br />
Normal ads for like dell or other EQ related banner exchanges would be okay as long as it's not a pop-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zanakus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've said it before, and I'll say it again.<br />
<br />
 1.It's completely logical and in the interest of respectable computer companies to put ads on sites frequented by computer gamers.<br />
<br />
 2. The Brock Pierce that owns IGE is the same Brock Pierce that has been charged with child molestation. Letting IGE stick its dirty nose into The Steel Warrior is selling your soul to the devil.<br />
<br />
 3. Your donations are currently far surpassing your monetary needs, and many on these boards have vowed to keep it that way if you keep criminals out of here.<br />
<br />
 Bottom line: Just say no.</div></div><hr />
