<br />
playing my nekkid level 30 Ogre warrior again and wondering what the board thinks are important stats? (as in what a minimuum to shoot for with equipment *want to be dressed for say next 20+ levels*)<br />
<br />
AC=shoot for at least what by level 50?<br />
Strength=<br />
Stamina=<br />
Agility=<br />
Dexteraty=<br />
<br />
along the same lines looking at weapons around 20 delay with some sort of spell effect (heard good for agro management) any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say shoot for 1k or so in AC at least by 50.<br />
Str will come along with your AC for the most part.... if your starting is 135 or so I would imagine as an ogre... go for about the 200-215 range I guess, shouldn't be too hard to hit for an ogre, same with the Sta.<br />
Agi/Dex are slightly harder to come across, so try to get those into the 140-170 range I would guess. Though I had both of those around 125 at 50- 64... heheh. <br />
All four of those are over 200 now unbuffed for me, so the stats just come with equipment as you get further... <br />
<br />
Good luck ogah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AC = Shoot for 1000 AC. Then go from there.<br />
<br />
STR = Shoot for over 100. Then try and get it to 155. Let avatar do the rest later.<br />
<br />
STA = Shoot for 205 unbuffed. You're an ogre. You can DO IT!<br />
<br />
AGI = Shoot for like 101 at first. Then 120. After that it's mostly meaningless. But at 155, avatar will do the rest.<br />
<br />
DEX = shoot for 101 dex. Then 155. Then let avatar do its thang.<br />
<br />
Weapons to look for = Black Blade of Tormenting. Anything with the proc Ykesha on it. Anything that STUNS. Frostbringer. Wavecrasher. Snowchipper and/or Spiked Velium Mallet. Anklesmasher or a Silken Whip of Ensnaring. Kunzar Ku'jich.<br />
<br />
OR, just think about a Windblade at around level 45 or so. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, at your level, since procs don't start happening until your 45+ levels, think about Lamentation, Centi Longsword, Wurmslayer, Centi Shortsword.<br />
<br />
If you REALLY a weapon that procs at an early leve, Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My AC at 50 was 865, and I had top notch gear back in the day....few cobalt pieces, guardian in the other slots.  800-900 is a more realistic goal for 50.  From 50 to 60 tho, you should gain a boatload of AC, and should have no problem hitting 1200 at 60.<br />
<br />
After that, worry about stamina hitting 205, and making sure your AGI stays above 75, and then forget you have any other stats at all, because they're all worthless.  Then just get HP gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, you're probably right. I just always reccommend 1k as the the target.<br />
<br />
Don't feel frustrated if you're at 865 or something like that. That's fine at level 50. Heck, it's more than fine.<br />
<br />
Just keep your eye looking towards 1k. After 1k, start to think about 1200. From there, eh, sky's the limit.<br />
<br />
As before, good luck, and always have fun.<br />
