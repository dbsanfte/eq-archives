<br />
I am now level 62 and feel like a noob again, reminds me of day one in halas, anyone got a torch? I cant see!!<br />
<br />
Currently im using a Copper hammer of striking (Main) and a sword of the bloodsworn (Secondary). Max taunt, max in well everything really. I never slacked in any area. <br />
<br />
I Taunt, slam, slash cut, and cuss but have a hard time keeping aggro on slows. I intrecept the pulls on the way in from ranger or monk so get inital aggro taunt and aggro then I pull it back to group. Mash taunt again, Disarm,  slam etc.....<br />
<br />
I even tried an old warrior trick when I intercept mod off puller before it gets to group I BEG, taunt, disarm, slam and attack and pull back to group and repeat again . <br />
<br />
What do I have to do to keep aggro these days? The only thing I can come up with is my weapons need an upgrade.<br />
<br />
I have 1300 AC and 6859 Hit points with focus/virt/stam/brells.<br />
<br />
If there are any old timers out there like me who didnt quite youll understand why im so confused.<br />

I'm a 62 warrior and I'm so frustrated right now I'm thinking of switching to my shaman alt for awhile again.  I also use CHoS and SoBS or GSoT for agro and some nights (like last night), agro just blows.  We were doing easy stuff - CCY in PoD and I still couldn't keep agro through 2 slows.  I was pulling with a bow initially, then I switched to just walking up to mobs, taking a few swings (and about 1k in dmg back), then bringing it back to camp...very little difference :mad: <br />
<br />
By the way, the real annoying thing is I was 2 boxing my shaman, so I was the one doing the slowing (i.e.;  I knew to wait until I got solid agro before casting, and to be ready to taunt when slow hit, etc...)<br />
<br />
Agro blows and I hope Sony does something soon (not counting on it though.)<br />
<br />
Although I hate to say it, if I knew as much about the game when I started my warrior as I do now, there is no way I would have made a warrior...knight is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point is keeping them alive, not keeping aggro through slows. Taunting when pull just came really won't give you any aggro, unless the puller did it with a spell. Unless you did enough DPS or procced to keep aggro through slow, you will lose aggro. Just taunt right after slow lands. The mob will usually not even hit them, just turn to them and then back to you. Of course, when taunt fails they will take a beating for 6 seconds heh.<br />
But some groups are not very good at aggro management. so some days you will have trouble, other times you won't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 61 and a few AA's ... I'm about 70 - 80% on holding aggro through slows, and about 30 - 40% on snap back taunting when they shift off me.  I DW with SotB and random offhander or use GSoT for taunting weapons.  I haven't lost a slower on a single pull yet, but it's been close when I had a bad streak, or was off my game (or both).  Adds can be troublesome or disastrous if I havent picked up the slower's rythm.  Much of what I have read on TSW has been a boon to me.<br />
<br />
One thing that helps me is having a seperate window for spell messages, and filtering mine down to Group Only.  It makes it much easier for me to see the spell casting, and I can usually time my taunt for the moment just after the slow (or whatever) lands.  I also switch frequently between camera modes - it's much easier to pursue a MOB in the overhead cam to stay in range if it moves off, and the spell caster's particles are another clue about their casts.<br />
<br />
That said, I usually group with the same people; we know each other well and trust each other's play style, which helps immeasurably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asharad</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good advice doggabone.<br />
<br />
I use the same weapons set up as the original poster and rarely have trouble with slows.<br />
<br />
Its simply a matter of timing the taunt to hit right after the slow lands.<br />
<br />
If the slower is going to cast on incoming, there isn't much you can do.  However, if they have half a brain they are waiting a few seconds, then casting.  This gives me time to work the mob over a little bit.<br />
<br />
Also, I've noticed a lot of slowers announce when it lands, but not when they are casting it.  Announcing when it lands doesn't help me.  By then I have noticed because the amount I am getting hit has slowed down, or it has wandered off to eat the slower.<br />
<br />
If they announce when they are casting, it gives me the heads up to watch for the spell message.<br />
<br />
This isn't a crticism of the above poster, but often on the question the answers given are &quot;get an EB weapon.&quot;  For a majority of players, this isn't practical advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real solution is that if you have a shaman slowing, have them use the Malx line, THEN slow, or wait a few seconds first.  I've been 2 boxing shammy/warrior for years now, the only time I ever have aggro issues is when I'm not using Malos for some reason or another.   Typical situation is that I pull, head back to camp, spin, turn on auto attack, slam quick, then Malos on the other comp, followed up by a slow, mob sticks to me nearly 100% of the time.  5 to 7 extra seconds is a huge deal when we're talking about slow aggro, and by having them use a debuff first, there's less chance they'll be mulched from a resist.  I bitch about aggro quite about around here, but it's mostly because I can't keep it off other melees.  Slowing was never an issue for me because I'm doing it myself.</div></div><hr />

Hmm....I've been having a mage in the group cast mala first...will casting a debuff with my shaman actually reduce the amount of hate he gets from slow?  If so, this may solve my 2 boxing problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks Haas and Asharad ... linking your posts for a shaman I group with who hates burning mana on the Malosi before he slows (but casts 2 or 3 slows anyway ... but nm that :D).  Maybe this will convince him.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Now casting ----- on %T&quot; message in the macros is another boon from a caster.  It's one of those caster tricks that should be &quot;EQ 101&quot; as mob flipping is for the tanks.<br />
<br />
I don't know a whole lot about slows and resists, but I know that the shammy in my group pulls aggro MUCH more often on resists (and keeps it).  But checking the Spell Details for Tigir's Insects (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1589&amp;source=Live)  on LUCY, I am assuming that if it doesn't land, the Hate modifier isn't applied and  the shaman takes the full dose.  And he has to cast slow again ;).  So if he can land slow on first cast, that's a big plus for him.  If I'm getting this correctly, whoever can debuff Magic resist the most should do so - one advantage to the shaman doing it is that it extends the time for you to build aggro before the slow hits, but on the other hand the hate from both is on the shaman.  I suggest experimenting with tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with Haass, keeping aggro off casters is pretty easy most of the time(unless they just completely go nuts, or the RNG is really really stingy), it's the melees that give me fits aggro wise, particularly nuke/proc happy rangers are a pain to deal with.  That and paladins that insist on stunning constantly even when they're not the main tank.  But that's a topic for another discussion.   :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zacc</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a couple things to expand on.<br />
<br />
Have your shaman(or mage) cast Mal(x) on incoming, instead of waiting until you attack/slam whatever. The aggro from a single arrow &gt; Malo. Note that this does not apply to tash(x).<br />
<br />
And that sitting trick... doesn't really work as you only gain temporary aggro with it. Soon as you stand back up, or those max hits pop you back up, you lose that aggro modifier.<br />

<br />
No, I don't think I was clear enough.  Reducing aggro directly isn't the idea here.  The purpose of casting MalXXX before the slow is 2 fold.  One to reduce the amount of resists, thereby making it so even if the shaman does pull aggro, he can live thru it.  Most shaman have a decent amount of HP/AC and AA's, they can take a punch from a slowed mob and walk away from it.<br />
<br />
The second reason is time.  By waiting until after you have touched the mob to start Malos, that's a guaranteed 5-7 extra seconds for you to build aggro..both thru DPS, and procs.  That's huge.  Some mobs don't give a fuck, and will seriously rush the slower at any point, but the majority of mobs are easily controlled in this manner.<br />
<br />
I don't know a whole lot about slows and resists, but I know that the shammy in my group pulls aggro MUCH more often on resists (and keeps it). But checking the Spell Details for Tigir's Insects on LUCY, I am assuming that if it doesn't land, the Hate modifier isn't applied and the shaman takes the full dose. And he has to cast slow again . So if he can land slow on first cast, that's a big plus for him.

I suggest experimenting with tactics. <br />
<br />
No shaman in any of your groups is using Tigirs, that's the AE slow.  Turgurs is the spell most of your shaman should be using, and it has no negative hate modifier, so that's not something you have to worry about.  The negative hate on Tigirs is just there so a shaman can actually survive slowing 4 mobs at one time with the spell.<br />
<br />
I don't think resists themselves are the problem.  I've held aggro thru resisted slows just fine.  I think the problem stems from the fact that slow adds X amount of hate, which is already a lot for warriors to overcome.  A resist means that you have to add that X amount of hate again, and again, and keep on doing it until you get it right.  Malos'ing every mob may not seem like the most mana efficient route for shaman, but it increases their survivability and reduces ping pong exponentially by reducing the amount of aggro a shaman has to put on a mob to do their job.<br />
<br />
So, ask your shaman to either Malo/Malos/Malosinia first to both debuff the mob and kill some time while you try to work the happy proc magic, and if you have someone else doing the debuffing, ask the shaman to wait 5-7 seconds or so before he starts the slow.  You'll survive it, and so will he.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haas, you were perfectly clear I just didn't have all the knowledge I needed.  I didn't think to look at the target type on that spell; I just looked for the one nearest his level - thanks for setting me straight.<br />
<br />
It could very well be (and now I think that it is) that the shaman doesn't complain about resists when I don't lose aggro, and that's why I percieve it to be that the resist is pulling the mob more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm an old timer that quit for a year and a half right after Velious came out.  Been back for about a year myself.  Welcome to the new warrior hell that SoE invented.  It's not you, it's the way things have evolved since you've been gone.  The reasons have been thrashed about on these forums quite a bit.  My personal belief, and that of quite a few others, is that it is due to all the new players that didn't have to learn how to manage their aggro with a warrior tank.  With a knight they can just sit back and slow/snare/heal/nuke instantly without having to think.  But you'll find out that sad truth soon enough I'm afraid. /rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lamtium</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya, first time posting here, but I felt compelled to post in this thread.  I use the same 1 hand combo that you are using (CHoS and SotBS).  I also quad box my warrior with a Shaman, Cleric, and Mage.  What I do on pull is to have the Mage send in pet and Mala.  After Mala lands, I cast Turgurs and hit taunt as soon as Turgurs lands.  I would say this is effective about 95% of the time getting aggro on the warrior with the Shaman never being touched.  I also have to agree with the poster above (sorry, don't remember the name!) that newer players have a lot of trouble with warriors and aggro.  I am in a very small guild of friends that has played for a long time and I never have trouble when grouped with my guildies.  Pickup groups are the reason I quad box now...I think that says it all. :D <br />
At any rate, my experience with those weapons would indicate that the weapons are not the problem, but YMMV.  Maybe just suggest that your Shaman count to 5 or something before slowing?</div></div><hr />

Wow, it looks like a resisted slow will add more hate to the shaman than one that lands.  Is that why shamans get pummeled if they have to slow multiple times?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avallach Whitewinds</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also one thing I've noticed is that the more people there are on the hate list, the easier it is to keep aggro. If I duo with my girlfriend's monk or chanter, I had a hell of a time keeping aggro (or in the chanter's case regaining after slow). However, if one of us is 2boxing another character (or grouping with guildies) to mix up the hate list a bit, it suddenly becomes much easier for me to keep aggro. It may just be in my head but it feels like adding more people in makes it easier for me to keep aggro somehow, like the mob gets distracted or something.<br />
<br />
If you have a mage AND slower in the group, my theory is that having the mage use mala/malosinia before the slower starts casting helps by both giving you extra aggro time before slow hits as well as by having someone else up on the hate list.</div></div><hr />
