<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karog</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have heard many different things that the dmg hit cap is on till 20/40/50 which is it. If you look at my weapons they are not bad. and yet i still hit for a max of maybe 45 - 50, and most of the time i hit for 20 - 40. This is really disturbing seein a rogue hit for 100 - 200 all the time. And the monk i group with hitting for the near 100's consistently. I dont have a problem keeping agro, as my Primary procs offten and i usually pull with my bow, that i crit with alot. But i hate being at the lower end of the dps. Any ideas or thoughts on this?<br />
<br />
Also, i have made some equipment updates and bought a new 1hs and ChoS both for under 8k, was that a good price? Are they good weapons?<br />
<br />
As always any constructive Critisizm is accepted. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

You have to look at the delt dps. Take a wurmslayer, it its for like 110 in your lvl but it has 40dly. Now take your primary weapon: it hits for 50 max, but only half the dly + you have an offhand weapon. <br />
<br />
If you really want to compare delt damage, try one of this tools:<br />

<br />
Turn other hits on (you prolly want an extra chat window for that), turn /log on and use these tools to parse your logs. Then compare the damage / second of every groupmember.<br />
<br />
<br />
You might try a decent 2hs like reaver as comparison to your 1hs setup.</div></div><hr />

Mostly it pertains to your weapon skill, ie, 1hs, 1hb, 2hs, 2hb, piercing.  The higher your level (and your weapon skill) the higher your damage cap.  There's really no such thing as &quot;Once you hit level 30, no more damage cap!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Those items were hit hard a while back; if you don't meet the recommended level.</div></div><hr />

Unless you are grouped with level 60+ characters with lots of AA and pretty good weapons I think that it's unlikely rogues and monks are hitting over 100 &quot;all the time.&quot;  I easily out DPS an averagely equiped pre level 60 rogue or monk and I don't even hit that hard consistently.  Perhaps you are noticing their backstabs and kicks and it seems like they do that much damage but they don't hit like that consistently with normal hits until well after your level (45 according to magello).  If you are grouping with well equiped level 60+ characters then you won't be able to hold agro anyways and you might want to group with some lower level people unless you are just getting power leveled.</div></div><hr />

No, no power lvlin here, as you see i am still at lvl 45, but you are correct I logged a dungeon last night and i did see that i was noticing the backstab/power kick from the rogue/monk duo. So thanks for the hints on that. But I did have my first &quot;Crippling Blow&quot; last night at 92! So i was pretty excited. <br />
<br />
My main is a wizzy, i say main. But i think my warrior is now my new main, due to the toe to toe thing just find it more exciting than sitting back and sneaking my head out to do a DD spell and ducking away again. <br />
<br />
Well thanks for ALL the help and i will wait and see what happens when i hit 56*, the recomended lvls of these two weapons!</div></div><hr />
