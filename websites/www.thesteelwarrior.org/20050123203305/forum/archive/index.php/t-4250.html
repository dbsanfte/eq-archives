<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I won my first NToV loot, a Claw of Lightning (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5724).  While I didn't think too much of the HPs and secondary-only aspect of the weapon, it is growing on me. (I already had 41% haste.)<br />
<br />
I'd been using my Ancient Prismatic Spear (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16092) in my off-hand. Now I switch in the CoL after I get my Avatar.<br />
<br />
Now, my question:<br />
It seems to me I generate a ton more aggro with the CoL.  Is there anything about NToV loot that could explain this?  In the offhand, the CoL does maybe 150 more damage/minute, so I don't think the ratio has a lot to do with it.<br />
<br />
The spear is piercing, and our caps are whacked on that skill.  Could that have anything to do with it?</div></div><hr />

&lt; - - weird mood today.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As has been mentioned in another thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3789), aggro may be related to how well a weapon CAN perform, ie. it's Damage potential.<br />
<br />
Now, a Dam 14, delay 18 weapon have a tremenduos damage potential.<br />
Might be that's what you are seeing, IF the theory is correct.<br />
<br />
And lets not forget that Piercing skill caps lower than 1H Slashing does, that may be a factor as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked my ATK, the piercer in the off-hand produces the same ATK as the slasher.  On-hand is a different matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warram</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Higher DPS over the people you're with. The same reason monks &amp; rogues pull aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only the ATK for your mainhand is shown in your ATK rating, but I think there was some valid parses about EQ using the weapon skill for ATK on offhand seperately from the mainhand, even if it doesn't show in the user interface.<br />
<br />
Was a looong time ago though, might be obsolete nowadays.</div></div><hr />
