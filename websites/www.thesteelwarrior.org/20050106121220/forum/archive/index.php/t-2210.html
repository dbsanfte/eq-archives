<br />
However, the keys which I have always been told were No Rent ... have not rotted.<br />
<br />
Is this the same for everyone?</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure its just a bug and they will get around to making them poof when ya leave the zone again some day. But if its an intended change it would be nice. Pain having to keep a backpack full of keys but if ya plan on going back up it makes things a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Friday I went up with Guild Group to do Monk Epic Mob, we cleared First island, and When I left I bank my Keys and they were still there last night.<br />

Would make that zone alot more Reasonable, if you could get keys and just hop to where you need to go.</div></div><hr />
