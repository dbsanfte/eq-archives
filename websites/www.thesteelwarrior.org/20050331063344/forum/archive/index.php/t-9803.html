<br />
<br />
Cloudy/IC whenever banished, and hope for enough damage before he banishes so he'll summon you back!<br />
<br />
Hits pretty wimpy, just need to have decent DR/PR (which I assume you have.)</div></div><hr />

He owned me pretty bad :(</div></div><hr />

  <br />
Got him to under 80 with self haste and no discs up.  Pretty sure i could take him alot father down if i had all discs up at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XAclylospradaX</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started going for Kunark dragons around last june, got gore to about 22% I kinda rushed the fight, I knew what went wrong. Talendor I actually died at 1% , 3% and 6%, Sev I've never found up. At the time I wasn't using ToD to slow or even attempt, I would use willsaper for about 8% of the fight, if it landed cool (most of the time it didn't) if not then it was just all out dps with discs etc.<br />
<br />
Wushi is fun also, remember to dispell the shit outa her, the DS is huge and will chew you up pretty quick. <br />
<br />
For the last few weeks I've been trying to catch the 3 up again (sev,tal,gore), without a doubt they will die with ease, even if I don't Tod them.<br />
<br />
As for Trakanon, a guild monk has been messing around with him this past week, I'm going to start looking for his availabilty soon and give him a shot. <br />
<br />
The fight where I lost with a low % left I really wish Warlord Tenecity was available, I'm curious to anyone else that has solo'd kunark dragons if you used that aa. <br />
<br />
Also I'm usually self buffed when attempting solo dragon kills, is this a normal practice with you guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have soloed Talendor and Sev a few times. I usually kept my boxed Druid close by just incase, but I found out I didn't need him at all. He was pretty much useless on Sev anyway due to being feared and stunned....heh.<br />
<br />
For the most part, I was self buffed with 9 and regen. I would try to tash/slow but realized it was really a waste of time and DPS.</div></div><hr />

I usually have druid buffs, since I'm botting a druid aynway, just in case something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
did wuoshi today, didnt remember to dispell his DS till I got him down to like 80%.. after his DS was gone, fight was a lot easier, I ended 35% health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone give me a play by play on how this is done. I probably dont have the goods as of yet but i think it sounds mad fun. <br />
<br />
I remember i used to solo the evil eyes in king xorb back in my lvl 30 days just cause' if your mr is decent the eyes' spells won't stick and you take little to no melee damage from them...as long as there pets arent up...im figuring its the same theory.<br />
<br />
Yeah so shoot me a step by step from buffing to disc's to weapon types you guys use, this subject is really interesting to me, im always looking for a good solo to kill time when im the only one on at mad-dark-30 in the morning. Thx <br />

<br />
I watched a warrior/shaman/cleric team (all Time equipped to the teeth) Fail on Telk because he was both unslowable and had a metric fuckload of hps.  The cleric just simply ran out of mana somewhere around 20% Telk's hp.   Warrior had DB + EoE + full reax and time goodies (this was between LDoN and GoD)<br />
<br />
I forget how many hps ... but it was a lot ... somewhere along the lines of 250-500k?  If you leave the old world dragon model of having 32-50k hps i'd imagine the difficulty level goes up considerably for a solo encounter.</div></div><hr />

 Im curoius if you botted or not, Telk has a fuck ton of hitpoints for you to solo it :(</div></div><hr />

since you can't stack them, you can heal yourself for only 40kHP max ...<br />
if you manage to stay in berserk mod without dying, you could chain all your discs for max effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought Telk had less than 100k or did they up it?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Much higher than 100k. <br />
<br />
The average xp mob in tier3 PoP has 30kish hps ... krigers in BoT have 50kish hps.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure a time geared trio could down 2 back to back krigers with a gimp ae before the cleric went OoM.  Unless i'm mistaken it is ~500k on the highend (certainly not more) and ~250k on the low end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">start with dathor and riposte disc (brings him to around 10%) then use fellstrike while in berserker for higher crips, and just stay there for the rest of the fight, switching out prayers of life and ds clicks. Savage onslaught, evasive the whole time, its was decently hard. First time I tried I was using willsapper to slow, didn't work out well, lost alotta dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could not have had two discs going at the same time though. And dathor hammer riposte bringing him to 10%? I sort of doubt that because it only lasts 12 seconds. Even with the healing I dont think it seems feasible, and why use evasive in the first place? Wouldnt stonewall be the better choice to mitigation without any real drawback in this case and you would not be missing as much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah evasive makes you lose dps, why would you use that? Seems very fishy to me.</div></div><hr />

Right when pop was released we trio'd and owned Telk with a monk, war, cleric many times. Couldnt imagine how they wiped with a warrior in time gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
???<br />
<br />
You're telling me you did several hundred thousand dmg to him in 12 seconds?<br />
Sorry bro i don't buy that for a min heh.<br />
Mightystrike will net more dps over time while zerker methinks, but i could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm thinking (hoping) he meant bring him down BY 10%... to 90%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">12-11-2004, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">clarifying since what I said is impossible unless they nerfed furious and dathor hammers recently?<br />
<br />
<br />
Lower him by 10% pretty fast with Furious, then fellstrike when berserker, then evasive with willsapper, then switch back to normal weaps, use fellstrike once knocked to berserker, stay in berserker range using prayers of life as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stonewall also worked well when I did this because he's perma-rooted.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you're thinking of a dragon other than Telk?<br />
<br />
He's unslowable with quads for 500's (I believe) and several hundred thousand hps.</div></div><hr />

max hit on me was like, 250, and I didn't know he wasn't slowable, didn't proc willsapper, took alot of trial and error.              I'm getting someone to record this next time I do it so I can post it here.</div></div><hr />

If not I would assume I could do it duo with shm fairly easily?  Been a LONG time since I fought him @@.<br />
could do it with shaman, solo would probably be iffy.<br />
<br />
I did both kelorek'dar and wuoshi pretty easily when I still played, just start off wuoshi with pumice.</div></div><hr />

Form of Endurance I, Frostreaver's Blessing, Shield of Torment, Miraculous Visions.  I had about 30% health left when he started to run.  I had burned all discs (I don't have any oow discs yet.. don't ask) I wouldn't even want to try it with less than 9k hp unbuffed/buffed and a time+ weapon combo.</div></div><hr />

I got him to 80ish% before i logged off my cleric.. If a warrior solo him, he would have to carry a shit load of heal clickys, i dont belive anyone would.  If u do 300 dps during the fight, you will use about 20 mins. If he do 50 dps on you, he will do about 60k dmg to you(and thats a lot of clickys). :p<br />

I was able to get him to 81% before I had to zone into ToV with less then 20% HP left. Used furious and mightystrike in the process. Got very lucky on mightystrike with a string of flurries.<br />
<br />
His 4 slot debuff and his self dispell make him pretty hard for a warrior imo, but with clicky heals and such he could be solo'd. Though i doubt I will be able to any time soon.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Had Salik,Steeloak,Balikor,Druid DS,Shield of Torment, Form Of Defense1, Shield of the Arcane on.<br />
<br />
His DPS is very weak, and cleric came back from afk to toss a supernal cleansing, and i finished off the fight. No OOW Defensive, but, 10k unbuffed, used Furious+Mightystrike when i hit berserk /w TCGS. <br />
<br />
Amazing guild's used to wipe to him &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Trak himself is a joke.  Go buffless next time, makes it a little better =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
i just posted here for the fact its a kunark dragon and  hmm  i think thats the title of the thread. so  if  i made your e-penis just a little bigger by allowing you to make your comment  im happy for ya.</div></div><hr />

Sure you can fight just trak himself.  Get him to summon mode before he banishes, and then instainvis as soon as he does.. he'll summon you back, and the shrooms dont agro.  Win!<br />
<br />
(im not 100% on warrior discs but monks can /disc whirl with a Dathor to drop him down far enough usually)</div></div><hr />

Sev only once, cuz he so frikking hard to find up and alive.<br />
<br />
But these days, they are rare, and I don't feel like wasting time, so I amuse myself by soloing the twin &quot;uber&quot; guards of freeport, I'm max ally in north freeport. Back in the days, it was funny to be an ogre and walk unharmed in the paladin town, people would be so awed. Now, no one ever goes there...</div></div><hr />

Also, since the pally flaming sword was in such high demands, I got to help more then a few get their piece from lucan.</div></div><hr />
