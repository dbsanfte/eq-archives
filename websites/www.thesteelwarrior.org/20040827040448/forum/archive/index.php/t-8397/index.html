7:20 am.<br />
<br />
Grace rolls over and slams her hand down on the buzzing alarm clock. Yawning and rubbing her eyes, she sits up in her bed. The sun is shining through her window, the sky is clear. It looks like it could be a good day. Maybe I can go jogging after work, she thought. I have to start getting shape, Will is coming home from France in a few weeks, I don't want him to think I just sat on my ass all summer, which is exactly what I did. Oh well, screw Will. Nathan loves me just the way I am. &quot;Oh. Coffee. Coffee, I need you now,&quot; she said. Making her way into the kitchen, she wonders if she should call and wake up Nathan just to say hi. Yeah. Why not? &quot;Hi Nate. I know you're asleep, but I just wanted to say hello to my honey-pie. I'll call you tonight and we'll get a pizza, ok. Half veggie delight, no cheese and half pepperoni and sausage. Love ya, babe.&quot; Click.<br />
<br />
7:49 am<br />
<br />
Where in the flippety-fuck am I? Whose bed, no whose futon is this? Oh my god, did I sleep with all three of them? Hmm, maybe I did. These questions puzzle Jack as he wakes up in someone's house. Stepping over three sleeping naked men, he goes into the bathroom. Looking in the mirror, he plays with parting his hair in different ways. &quot;Aw, come on. Come on, stupid hair! Stay, that's good! My, you're pretty!&quot; He admires his handiwork and kisses the mirror, then his hair droops down over his forehead. Stomping his foot, he says, &quot;Ugh! This blows! My hair will not stay, this is a catastrophe!&quot;<br />
<br />
8:01 am<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Karen, Mister Stan, time to rise and shine,&quot; bellows Rosario. She pushes a huge breakfast tray into the bedroom. Always the same, a mimosa and strawberry nutri-grain bar for the missus and 4 scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, fruit salad, french toast, and coffee for the master. Karen is not thrilled to be awake. &quot;Hey, honey. Yeah, Rosie, why don't you let us sleep in for once? Jeez, I know you're anxious to get me out of the house so you can loot my jewels, but you can do that while we sleep, right?&quot; Rosario will not stay silent, &quot;Oh don't start with me today, Miss, I drink therefore I am. I had a dreadful time this morning already cleaning up after your party last night. You know, you could be a little more considerate of--&quot; &quot;Oh come on, Rosie,&quot; Stan says as he sits up. He gets out of bed, all 280 pounds of him, and lumbers down to the table where the food is. &quot;I don't want any lecturing or whining while I eat. Coming Karen?&quot; &quot;Oh honey, I think you know the answer to that!,&quot; she saucily replies. All laugh. Everything is good in the Walker funhouse.<br />
<br />
8:06 am<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh&quot; Will stretches out on a bench with a friend in Paris. It is 2 in the afternoon and the sun is beating down on them. His friend, Louis, is a 33 year old artist he met a few weeks ago. They have hung out a few times and last week had gone on a date. This has been a fun few months for Will, he had hooked up with a number of guys this summer and he had been able to clear his head from all of the failed relationships in New York. Louis rubbed his arm. &quot;Hey, Will. Shall we get a cold drink. A maybe soda?&quot; Will smiled at his English. Louis was adorable and Will was really happy there with him. He was very sorry that he would have to leave in a week. Will answers him, &quot;Sure. Let's go to that cafe down the street that we went to Sunday. They had the best croissants.&quot; They stand up and link arms. In Will's free hand, he carries a bag of gifts that he had found at a few stores. A few small pieces of jewelry for Grace and a T-shirt for Elliott. They walk down the street, blissfully unaware of what was to come in a short while.<br />
<br />
8:13 am<br />
<br />
Jack sits on the number 3 train heading up to his subway stop. He had left the guy's place a tad on the early side, so he could get home and get some more sleep. It turns out that he had met those three hotties at a bar last night and had gone home with Antonio. Martin and Stephen were the other two. Martin and Antonio were ok, but Stephen was a total jerk. He might call Martin sometime. He sighs. So much to do today, he listed them off in his head: go to the gym, steal some food from Will and Grace's apartment, take a nap, take a steam with Karen, check e-bay for any new Britney items, and watch Mermaids for the 3rd time in a week. He steps off the train. The subway was jam packed with commuters coming and going everywhere. He finally gets outside and walks home. He hums &quot;Believe&quot; along the way.<br />
<br />
8:28 am<br />
<br />
Grace enters the lobby of the Puck building downtown. She loves this building, and is so grateful for the cool SoHo location. Great shopping and galleries nearby! As she steps off the elevator and enters her office, she is appalled to find an open bottle of red wine on the desk and an empty glass and spilled wine on the floor. &quot;Dammit! That stupid little bitch!&quot; she yells. She curses herself for letting Karen lock up last night. She grabs some paper towels and starts cleaning it up.<br />
<br />
8:40 am<br />
<br />
Karen is putting on her make-up and having her hair brushed by one of her many workers. She wanted to get to work earlier than her usual stroll-in at 10, so she could straighten up the office. She may have left a bottle of wine out, and that stuff was expensive. She gets up and puts on her shoes. &quot;Karen!&quot;, calls Stan. &quot;Yeah, honey?&quot; &quot;Don't forget to meet at Nobu tonight, we're having dinner with Sam and Stella Coburn at 8,&quot; he reminds her. She comes over to where he is reading the paper. &quot;Stan, I don't like Stella Coburn. The last time we went out with them, she commented on my collagen. She said I need more, do you think I need another dose?&quot; He shook his head no and pulled her in close. &quot;Babe, you're fine just the way you are. Now do I get a good bye kiss?&quot; She smiles and kneels down and unzips his pants. &quot;You'll get a kiss, honey, as soon as I get a drink.&quot; He moans happily.<br />
<br />
8:46 am<br />
<br />
After a bit of work, Grace puts the wine-soaked paper towels in the trash and leans on her desk. No sooner had she started to drum her fingers on the desk top, was she jolted out of her mind by a deafening crash. The building shook slightly and she fell on the floor. Stunned, she picks herself up and wonders what in the world just happened. An earthquake? She goes to the window and looks out at the twin towers in clear view from her building. She tries to scream, but no sound comes out. Her hand to her mouth, she is stunned at what she is looking at. She grabs onto the windowsill to keep her balance. Grace's heart pounds as she watches the flames and smoke consume the sky.<br />
<br />
8:50 am<br />
<br />
Karen climbs into her car with Rosario. Karen is telling her about how lame Grace's outfit was the previous day, when Rosario turns to her little spit-fire and says, &quot;You know, missy. You need a hobby. A purpose in life. It makes me sick to think that your biggest decision of the day revolves around which brand of vodka you want in your martini. Or which employee at Barney's you are going to try to have fired. I work my tail off for you, why can't you put even a little effort into something other than making fun of your friend? At a job, where you spend the day painting your claws? Perhaps join your husband in his charity work, one day? Try it, brat, you might actually learn something about people.&quot; Karen is shocked, and momentarily silenced. Not for long, though. &quot;Rosie, what did you huff this morning? Do you honestly think I want to help with Stan's stupid causes? Ha ha ha, 'cause no, I don't. And don't ever insult me again, or I will cut down your phone privileges from two phone calls a day to one. You make it seem like I do nothing all day. That is not entirely true. I have to put up with boring social engagements and hanging out with obnoxious people like Stella Coburn. My life is not all peaches and cream, ya know. Though my complexion is, tee hee. You know, no one is forcing you to stay here. You just make things more difficult.&quot; Rosario rolls her eyes. She hears this junk every day and she is sick of it. She opens her mouth to retort, but to what use? She feels trapped here. She loves Karen, but the woman can be so difficult sometimes, and oblivious to her faults. Karen snatches her purse out of Rosario's hand a little too harshly. Both pause and look at each other briefly, wanting to apologize, but not knowing how to. In an uncomfortable silence, they exit the garage and start the drive downtown to Grace's office.<br />
<br />
8:54 am<br />
<br />
Will and Louis sit at a cafe, eating pastries and treats. Things couldn't be better for them right now. Will knows that he has made a very special friend in Louis. They sit in a comfortable silence, just taking in the sights around them. Will was glad he had brought his camcorder, he has hours of cool stuff to show everyone back in New York. Louis turns to Will and says with a smile, &quot;Will? Do you think you would consider moving here? Paris and I, we're made for you. You've had fun here, yes?&quot; Will is taken aback by this offer. Paris? Me? He kisses Louis, and says, &quot;God, I love it here more than anything, but I don't know. My friends, my family is back home. I can't just leave them, though sometimes I feel I would like to. I just- I don't know.&quot; Louis expected some hesitation from him. After all, this was a huge question, one that would require some serious thinking and planning. He just took Will's hand and held it. They were deep in thought, when Will's cell phone rang. Slightly annoyed at himself for having a plan that allowed him to be reached by anyone, no matter where he was, he opens his phone. &quot;Who is ruining this moment for me?&quot;, he mutters softly. &quot;Hello?&quot; &quot;Will?&quot;, a shaky voice asked. &quot;Wha- Grace, is that you? You sound weird,&quot; he answered. She went on, a bit more hysterical, &quot;Oh my God, Will, you'll never believe what just happened. A plane hit----&quot; There was too much static for either of them to hear the other. &quot;Hello? Hello? Grace, are you there?&quot; Will was cut off. Confused by her words and worried by her tone, he called the apartment. No one picked up, so he left a message, &quot;Hey Gracie, it's me. Um, I got cut off from you, I just wanted to make sure everything is ok. Call me when you get a chance. Later.&quot; He called her office. It rings once, then is cut off. He tries again. Same result. &quot;Hmm,&quot; he wonders as he closes up his phone. &quot;What is wrong,&quot; Louis inquires. Will shakes his head. &quot;No idea. I'm sure everything's fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
9:00 am<br />
<br />
Jack is watching &quot;Mermaids&quot; and eating a few oranges that he swiped from Will and Grace's place. He is interrupted by a knock on his door. He opens it to find his crazy neighbor, Val standing there with an iron. &quot;Hi, Jack-in-the-box,&quot; she says. &quot;Whoa, Val, Jackie hasn't been in a box in about 17 years,&quot; he replies. Both chuckle. He continues, &quot;What's with the iron? As long as you have it, wanna do my clothes for me?&quot; &quot;Oh no, I just found it in the hallway. Is it yours? Or can I keep it?&quot;, she asks. He shakes his head. &quot;Nope, not mine. I don't iron my hair anymore.&quot; She shrugs and goes on, &quot;Anyway, the real reason I came by is to borrow an eggplant.&quot; &quot;For what? You don't cook,&quot; he says. Val looks impatient. &quot;I do now. I'm cooking eggplant parmesean for my boyfriend and I need an eggplant!&quot; Jack is skeptical of this. He questions her,&quot; Val, darling, you don't have a boyfriend.&quot; She counters him, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; &quot;No, you don't.&quot; &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; &quot;No, you don't.&quot; &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; &quot;No, you don't.&quot; &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; &quot;What's his name?&quot; &quot;Charles the Second.&quot; Jack stops and is clearly confused. &quot;Charles the Second?&quot;, he wonders. &quot;How do you like my pants, and is that his real name?&quot; &quot;Your pants are a little tight, and no, it's the name I gave him,&quot; she says. &quot;He's the second guy named Charles that I've ever dated, so I call him Charles the Second. Is that weird?&quot; &quot;Uhh, yeah,&quot; Jack replies. &quot;Anyway,&quot; she goes on, &quot;Can I borrow an eggplant?&quot; Jack sighs, and tries to flip his hair. &quot;Sorry, Val, I don't have an eggplant, try Will's apartment. And, I still don't believe you have a boyfriend. How come I've never seen him?&quot; Val rolls her eyes at Jack. She answers him, &quot;Because he works during the day.&quot; &quot;Hmph,&quot; Jack pouts. They continue to stand at Jack's doorway, when the elevator opens and a man steps out. This is Charles the Second. He is a tall, handsome man, with green eyes and light brown hair. He's very hot, and very well-dressed. He comes over to Val and wraps his arm around her waist and kisses her. &quot;There you are, silly. I've been looking on every floor for you. What's up?&quot; he asks. &quot;Oh, just talking to a friend here. Jack, this is Charles the Second, Charles, this is Jack, the big queen I told you about,&quot; she says. Jack is clearly jealous of her good fortune. &quot;Well, I stand erected. I see you do have a boyfriend.&quot; Val smiles at him. Charles the Second extends his hand to Jack, and they shake. Jack gives him the once over and is impressed. Charles the Second addresses them, &quot;Hon, I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed, but I'll be up this afternoon for our daily game of Yahtzee. Nice meeting you, Jack.&quot; He kisses Val once and goes into the elevator. She turns to Jack again. &quot;Jealous?&quot; she asks him. Jack scoffs. &quot;No! Well, ok a little bit. Where did you meet him?&quot; She answers him, &quot;I met Charles at a party a few weeks ago. Weird party. There were clowns, cookies, and a Connie Chung impersonator. Long story, maybe I'll tell ya sometime.&quot; Jack shakes his head. &quot;That's ok, I don't want to hear it. Anyway, could you leave? I have to finish Mermaids. I'm fast-forwarding through all the bad scenes. You know- the ones without HER in them?&quot; Val smiles and nods. &quot;Got it,&quot; she says. &quot;I have to go find an eggplant, now. Bye!&quot; She leaves, and Jack closes the door. Weird girl, he thinks. Funny, but very weird. And nowhere near as good-looking as me. He settles in to resume his movie.<br />
<br />
9:03 am<br />
<br />
Grace is at her window, staring at the flames that are rising in the sky of the first tower. She is shaking and scared to death. She squints at something in the sky approaching the second tower. A rescue plane?, she thinks. Oh, that's good, that's good, wait- that's not good! &quot;Oh my god, what is it doing? No!!!!!!!!! Oh my god! Oh my god!&quot;, she screams. She begins hyperventilating, something that Will has only witnessed twice, and that she has kept a secret from everyone else. Grace is having trouble catching her breath and barely holding on to the windowsill. She is glued there watching the smoke fill the sky and the second that people start jumping out of the windows to their deaths on the streets, she races to the phone again. Frantically dialing Will's cell number, it rings once and goes blank. She dials Karen's cell, and it rings once and goes blank. She calls Nathan, Jack, her mother, a few neighbors, and the police. All ring once or not at all, and then go dead. She hangs up, waits a minute and calms herself then picks up the phone again to call Nathan. There isn't even a dial tone this time. She runs to the office adjacent to hers and asks everyone there what is going on. The workers there are frantic, and they tell Grace to stay there with them. As a group, they all watch the horror unfold in front of them, through the window. They think they have seen the worst, but unfortunately they haven't, yet.<br />
<br />
9:06 am<br />
<br />
Will borrows Louis' cell phone and dials Jack's number. Something didn't feel right to him. And no, it wasn't the escargot he ate last night, just something felt.....weird. Jack presses pause on his beloved movie and picks up the phone.<br />
Jack: Hello?, Jack's house of porn. To whom am I freaking?<br />
Will: Jack! Do you know if Grace is still at home?<br />
Jack: What? No hello, no how am I, just is your skinnier half still at home? That's not very nice, Will.<br />
Will: Jack. Please, I am so sorry for not considering your feelings, but could you please check for me? I got cut off from her and she sounded weird. Can you just see if she's home?<br />
Jack: Wilhemina, I was just at your place. I took some oranges. And no, she is not there. She did leave her wet towel on the couch, but I was nice and put it on your bed.<br />
Will: Thank you, that was so kind. Um, could you call the office for me? I have to find out if she's ok.<br />
Jack: I guess so. But you are gonna owe me for this, you are gonna owe me so-----<br />
Jack's phone goes dead.<br />
Jack: Hello? Hello? What the hell?<br />
Will: Fuck! What is going on there? All the phones are going out! Jesus Christ!<br />
Jack hangs up and waits a minute. He picks up the phone and gets no dial tone. &quot;Odd&quot;, he thinks, but doesn't dwell on it very long. He presses play and forgets about Will.<br />
Will hands Louis his phone back and looks agitated. &quot;What is going on at home there?&quot;, Louis asks him. &quot;Is everything all right?&quot; Will looks at him with a concerned expression. &quot;I hope so, but I won't feel settled until I talk to Grace. The phones are so whack right now, I'll just wait until later to call. It's ok, maybe I'll tease her a little and make her guess what I bought for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
9:08 am<br />
<br />
Karen and Rosario sit in the back of the black luxury sedan on the way to the office. Narrowly missing pedestrians, messengers, and taxis, the car makes its way down Park Avenue. Karen closes her eyes and thinks about her upcoming getaway weekend to St. Maarten's with Stan. Nothing big, just a few days of relaxation with her hubby. In her mind, she goes over the items that she needed to buy for the trip. New bathing suit, check. New sunglasses, check. New sundress, check. New sandals, che- no, wait a minute. &quot;Rosario!&quot; Karen springs up and faces her startled maid. &quot;What is it?&quot; &quot;Rosie, we have to go downtown and get my sandals right now. I forgot to pick them up yesterday.&quot; Rosario is a little irritated. &quot;Now, you want to go? What about work?&quot;, she reminds her. &quot;Oh honey, it's ok,&quot; Karen dismisses work and completely forgets the spilled wine that she left at her desk. &quot;We're running early, and besides, I want to buy my sandals before I get too buzzed and forget about them again. We leave in 3 days, you know.&quot; Rosario nods. She did have a point. &quot;Fine,&quot; Rosario agrees. &quot;Driver!&quot;, Karen yells, as she raps on the divider. Driver lowers the divider, the only thing that protects him from the wicked witch of the east side. &quot;Yes, miss?&quot; he answers her. &quot;Driver, we have to make a stop downtown to get my sandals. I forget the name of the store, somewhere on Water Street, near the World Trade Center. I'll know it when I see it.&quot; &quot;Of course, miss,&quot; he says, relieved that she isn't asking anything too outrageous at this hour of the day. He puts the divider back up and Karen settles back in her seat. They continue their drive downtown.<br />
<br />
9:12 am<br />
<br />
Grace and the employees of the company next to hers are all scared and frantic. Some are trying to call people, most are staring out the window, and some are getting hysterical. All are scared and horrified. Grace stares out the window, not knowing what to do. They can hear the sirens, coming from all directions. Grace's mind flashes to everyone she knows and she frantically thinks and tries to remember everyone's whereabouts. Will isn't here, thank god, but she wishes that he was. Nathan is still asleep, that's for certain. He doesn't get up until 10 or so. Jack, well who knows where he is. He's probably at the gym or watching a Cher movie. Karen is on her way downtown to the office. &quot;Oh my god. Karen,&quot; she whispers to herself. Trying to remain calm amid the excitement of the office, she picks up a phone and to her surprise actually hears a dial tone. Silently, she dials Karen's cell. It rings once. It rings twice. Come on, Karen, pick up!, she thinks. It rings a third time, and for the first time in her life, Grace was thrilled to hear that whiny, annoying, childish excuse for a voice that Karen has. &quot;Hello?&quot; &quot;Karen! Oh thank god. Whare are you?&quot; Grace asks. &quot;Well, honey, I'm on my way to --&quot;, Karen says before the phone goes dead. &quot;Aaaughhh!&quot;, Grace yells, while slamming down the phone. &quot;You, too?&quot; a woman asks. &quot;We've all been getting cut off from the phones. I'm surprised you got a dial tone.&quot; Grace nods. &quot;What is going on with the phones? Is it because of the towers getting hit? The antennaes, maybe?&quot; she asks the others. &quot;Probably,&quot; a man says. They all stand still for a minute, then huddle together at the window again, watching. Just watching.<br />
<br />
9:27 am<br />
<br />
Jack is lacing up his shoes, about to head out for the gym. He takes a final look in the mirror, adjusts his headband, and picks up his pink gym bag and a water bottle that he stole from Will and heads to the door. The phone rings, so he turns back to pick it up. He's a little tired of all these phone calls this morning, but what the heck. He's a popular guy. &quot;Hel-lo. How can I do you?&quot; Grace is on the other end.<br />
Grace: Hey! Jack, it's me. Listen, turn on the news.<br />
Jack: What? Why? I'm on my way to the gym, you know, gotta keep the bod in tip top shape!<br />
Grace: Just do it, now! Tell me what you see.<br />
Jack: Oh ok.<br />
He turns it on and to his horror, sees the World Trade Center on fire. He sees the news correspondents addressing the public on what appears to be a possible terrorist attack.<br />
Jack: Oh my god, where are you? At work? Did you see it? Grace: Yes, and yes. It's awful. People are running in the streets, every which way, they don't know where to go. I don't know if I should stay or go, or what to do. I hear the sirens. I've been trying to call you forever, but the phones keep shutting off.<br />
Jack: Is Kare-Bear there, too?<br />
Grace: Not yet. I don't know where she is, I hope she's---<br />
They get cut off. Jack hangs up, afraid of what he's seeing on the tv. He remembers that one of the guys from last night lives near the WTC. He tries to call, but there isn't any dial tone. Jack picks up his cell and tries that, but to no avail. Worried, and unsure of what to do, he sits glued to the tv set, hoping that he can get ahold of his friends soon.<br />
<br />
9:39 am<br />
<br />
Karen and Rosario are now downtown, near the office, and a little bit aways from the store that she wants to go to. There is massive traffic, the smart thing would be to just park at the office, but unfortunately the driver doesn't know enough to do that. They hear sirens from all directions and they see smoke in the sky, but they don't know where it's coming from. They inch along, and Rosario turns to Karen. &quot;Miss Karen, there is a dreadful amount of traffic now. We are close to work, why don't we just go there now and we'll pick up your sandals this afternoon on your lunch break.&quot; Karen doesn't care. &quot;What are you in such a hurry for? I want my sandals now, so we'll get them now. I wish he would step on it already. Where's this fire coming from, anyway? Jesus. If it makes you happy, I guess I could call Grace and tell her I'll be a little late.&quot; &quot;That would be nice of you,&quot; Rosario says. I'll dial for you, I know you wouldn't want to smudge you freshly painted daggers you call nails. Karen glares at her, but then tries to hide a smile. &quot;Oh Rosie, you're too good to me!&quot; &quot;I know it. Here you go.&quot; Rosario hands Karen the phone.<br />
*****<br />
From the office next door, Grace strains to hear something. A phone? From HER OFFICE? Oh good, maybe the phones are ok. She dashes in and picks up on the third ring.<br />
Grace: Hello? Jack, is that you?<br />
Karen: No, honey, it's me. Listen, I'm stuck in traffic and I'm gonna be a little late. We have to make a stop on Water Street for those sandals I told you about. Grace: Water Street! No, no, Karen, Wh- Where are you? Are you close by? Do you know what's happening? The World Tr---<br />
*****<br />
As usual, they get cut off. Karen smacks her phone a few times and is clearly annoyed. &quot;Lousy service, I got here, lousy service!&quot; She addresses Rosario, &quot;Honey, hand me the car phone will you?&quot; &quot;Miss Karen, don't you remember? Oh why do I even ask. You broke it last week, during one of your drunken spells. You ripped it clear out of its socket. It is being repaired.&quot; Karen rolls her eys. &quot;Oh great. Oh well, doesn't matter. I just want to get to the store already.&quot; The car continues downtown, into an enormous mess of traffic and people. Driver is wary, but he keeps on going, as his mistress ordered.<br />
<br />
9:52 am<br />
<br />
Jack dials Will's cell phone, in hopes of filling him in on all of the horrific news. He knows that Will sometimes has meetings downtown, and that he would be anxious to know what was going on. He dials, and to his surprise, it rings. It rings again. It rings again. Once more. Then....<br />
&quot;Hi, you've reached Will Truman. I can't answer my phone right now, so leave a message and I'll get back to you. Thanks!&quot;<br />
Jack leaves a message.<br />
&quot;Willard, hey, it's me. Listen, I thought you'd want to know about all the stuff that's going on here, umm, a few planes just crashed into the World Trade Center and it's on fire. People are jumping out the windows, it's so fucked up. And, and they say another plane is missing, I don't really know. Just call me back. Grace is fine, don't worry about her, and I'm ok, too. Ta ta.&quot;<br />
*****<br />
Will and Louis are kissing under a tree in a park in Paris. They are so into each other, that they almost don't hear the phone go off. Will finally looks at it after Jack leaves his message, and recognizes the number. He doesn't want to stop this wonderful moment with Louis, but he just feels that he should check the message. He dials and listens. &quot;Oh lord. I can't believe this,&quot; he says upon listening to Jack's words.<br />
<br />
10:01 am<br />
<br />
They are in trouble and Karen knows it. The car is practically on Water Street now, despite the traffice of fire trucks, police cars and ambulances that surround them. Trying desperately to turn around and maybe head back uptown, Driver is trapped. Karen is tired of this nonsense. She doesn't even want the shoes anymore, she just wants to get the hell out of here. They all can see the enflamed buildings, but there is nothing they can do. Closer and closer to the store they get, but they are forced to take a detour by a cop. Driver takes a gamble and pulls the car down a side street, a little closer to the WTC, but hopefully they can pull out of here soon.<br />
<br />
10:05 am<br />
<br />
Grace and the workers next door are in shock. The South Tower has started to crumble away from the impact, and before you can say Anastasia Beaverhausen, it is gone. Gone. No more twin towers, only one is standing now. The sky is full of smoke, dust, and fire. Grace and about half of the people there scream in horror. Their building shakes again from the force of this massive trauma to lower Manhattan and the sound of people's screams and destruction outside is deafening. They see people running in every direction, trying desperately to get away. Tears come to Grace's eyes as she looks at her beloved New York in a state of frenzy and sadness.<br />
<br />
10:10 am<br />
<br />
Karen, Rosario, and Driver are among those running away. They abandoned the car after a large chunk of debris fell on it and smashed the front. Shaken, scared, and frantic, they join thousands of others in the fight to get away. Where they're headed, they don't know, but there are so many people on the streets that they can't get far. People are covered in ash, making them look like ghosts, and others are screaming in pain. They try to stay together and they pray that they will make it out alive. 10:13 am<br />
<br />
Grace goes to her office and dials Nathan's number. Shaking and crying, she presses the numbers slowly abd deliberately, with the hope that by doing so, her call will go through. After 3 rings, he picks up.<br />
Nathan: Yello.<br />
Grace: Oh god, Nathan. It's so good to hear your voice.<br />
Nathan: Thanks, gracious. It's good to be woken up to yours. How's work? Touching yourself until I can get there?<br />
Grace: No, what- Um, do you have any idea what's going on?<br />
Nathan: I'm still in bed, honey. I woke up when you called me. What's going on? You don't sound good.<br />
Grace: You'll never believe it, but these planes hit the world trade center and one of the towers fell! It's chaos out there. We're all watching from in the office.<br />
Nathan: But you're ok, though, right?<br />
Grace: Oh yeah, I'm good. But Nathan, I can't get ahold of Will or Karen. I don't know where she is, I keep trying her cell, but there is no answer.<br />
Nathan: Is it really that bad?<br />
Grace: Hon, turn on the news. Yes, yes it is.<br />
Nathan: Oh shit. That is so... oh wow. Wow.<br />
Grace: Listen, I gotta go, I'll see you as soon as I can. The phones have been crazy, I'm surprised we talked this long.<br />
Nathan: Ok, you know I love you.<br />
Grace: I love you, too.<br />
Nathan: Bye bye and tonight, we'll watch a movie and then---<br />
Cut off. Again. That was ok, though, Grace felt a million times better now that she was able to talk to him. He makes her feel good, something that not many guys can do. He treates her like she's special and he values her creative and loopy tendencies and goddamn is he good in bed! For the first time all morning, she smiles to herself. One down, two to go, she thinks. She dials Will's cell again, but gets cut off after one ring. She dials Karen's cell, but it rings until the voice mail picks up. How odd, she thinks. Karen ALWAYS has her cell with her. She doesn't let herself think any bad thoughts, though some are creeping into her head. Karen's fine, she thinks. Out of all of us, out of this entire city, if there is one person who is indestructable, it is Karen. But, god, where was she?<br />
<br />
10:20 am<br />
<br />
Stan paces back and forth in his office in midtown. He is sweating bullets, worried sick about where Karen is. He has called her cell phone no less than 40 times in the past hour and he is just beside himself with worry. Sighing and keeping an eye on the tv screen, he calls Grace Adler Designs again, for the 7th time in 10 minutes. She has to be there by now, right? It rings a few times and Grace picks up.<br />
Grace: Hello?<br />
Stan: Grace! Hi. Are you guys ok, I've been trying to call for a while now. Please tell me you're both ok.<br />
Grace: Well, I am but Karen hasn't arrived yet.<br />
Stan: What????? Where is she? Have you talked to her?<br />
Grace: No, not for a while, she said she was going to be late. I don't know where she is. Probably just stuck in traffic or something, but she's not answering her cell. Stan: I know, I've left a million messages. Well, there's nothing we can do right now, just stay safe and call me as soon as you talk to her.<br />
Grace: Ok, and you do the same.<br />
Stan: All right, then. Bye bye.<br />
Grace: Bye.<br />
He hangs up and sits down. He had just talked to his ex-wife and was told that the children's school uptown is perfectly fine. That was a huge relief, but he wouldn't feel complete until he could see or talk to Karen. He dials Jack's number on a whim, but after one ring, it gets cut off. Stan knows that he should probably go home, where nothing could harm him, but what is Karen tries to call here? With fear growing inside and a huge headache coming on, he decides to stay put.<br />
<br />
10:28 am<br />
<br />
From the window, green eyes watch it. On the couch, looking at the tv, blue eyes watch it. From the street, hazel eyes watch it.<br />
'It' being the North Tower of the WTC fall down. It doesn't just fall, more like it peels itself away before it's thunderous collapse. Debris, smoke, dust, and people are launched everywhere.<br />
From the window, Grace and the other workers in the office are stunned. Truly stunned. There is no action, no words, no screams, no tears. They are frozen and stunned. Grace tries to think of something to say. Anything at all. Something that will break the horrible silence of the office but she comes up empty. For some reason, though, she is calm. She knows she has just witnessed history, she knows this will be a story she will tell her children, and she knows that she will never, ever forget this moment. Barely breathing, they all remain standing, as if in some chorographed routine, where they have been instructed to remain still. They watch the chaos and disaster down below. They all wonder what will come next. Grace's mind wanders to her friends and it settles on the one person she hasn't been able to get ahold of. Normally, she would begin freaking out, but now she can't. She remains there at the window, like a statue, praying that all will be ok.<br />
On the couch, looking at the tv, Jack's mouth hangs open in disbelief. He is deeply saddened at the wreckage and destruction on the screen. The news reporters are frantically trying to sstay on top of the story, but they aren't needed to know what is going on. It is clear to all watching at home, that both towers are officially gone. Jack scrambles to the phone to call Elliott's mom, but the line is dead. He goes to his video drawer and selects a VHS tape that has old episodes of Buffy on it. Saying goodbye to Buffy, he pops the tape in the vcr and presses record. He wants to have this day on video forever, he wants to record this day as it happens.<br />
On the street, Karen stays close to Rosario and Driver as they try to get to a safe place. They huddle close, and are herded into a section of a street where the police have put up barricades. They are safe now, it seems. There are police surrounding them, not allowing anyone to go anywhere because of the danger. So, they wait with many other people. For the first time in a while, they can take a deep breath and relax. Somehow, Karen knows that they will come through this. She knows they can't end this way. No sir. Karen plans to die while fucking Stan. If you're going to go, you might as well die happy, right? She puts her arms around Rosie and they hold tight. Shaken and weary, Rosario hugs her pet. People around them are yelling, sobbing, trying to get out from the barricades and go home. The police firmly enforce everyone to stay put. They assure the scared crowd that they are ok, but everyone really knows that nothing is for certain.<br />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: How tall were the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center?<br />
<br />
A: One World Trade Center or North Tower was 1,368 feet or 417 meters high. One World Trade Center had a 348 feet or 106 meters high. The total height of One World Trade Center was 1,728 feet or 527 meters high. Two World Trade Center or the South Tower was 1,362 feet or 415 meters high. Two World Trade Center had a rooftop observation deck where people can go up to and look down on New York.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Who designed the World Trade Center?<br />
<br />
A: The late Minoru Yamasaki with Emory Roth and Sons Architecture Firm. The engineer was Leslie Robertson.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: What companies were located inside the World Trade Center?<br />
<br />
A:Mostly banks, financial institutes, law firms, internation corporations, stock trading, doctor's office, stores, restaurants, and television transmission.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: What kind of airplanes were used on September 11?<br />
<br />
A:Boeing 757 and 767, large jumbo jets that can fly cross-country or across the Atlantic. Boeing 757 and 767 are very common airplanes, that many airliners use. Both have very good safety records. Unfortunately, of the six crashes involving Boeing 767, four of them were sabotage, with the 9-11 attacks.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Why did people jump out of the burning World Trade Center?<br />
<br />
A:People were trapped above where the airplanes crashed and they could not escape. So, they become desperate and rather than getting burned, they jump out in hoping their body will be found unburned and get a proper funeral. This type of act has occurred in the past with high rise buildings on fire, in which people cannot escape. Also, there were reports that part of the North Tower had collapse after the airplane crashed into the tower. Some of these people thought the skyscraper would collapse, so they jumped out.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Why did the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center collapse?<br />
<br />
A:Jet fuel burns at a very high temperature. The heat from the burning jet fuel is enough to melt steel and turn it into some sort of putty. Also, there was tens of thousands of gallons of jet fuel burning uncontrollably. The fire melted the center support column and truss and causing the building to weaken severely. It triggers a domino effect. Also, the truss were weakened severely by the violent inferno inside the building.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Why did 7 World Trade Center collapse?<br />
<br />
A: This is only speculative. Probably, falling debris from the Twin Towers and a diesel fuel tank was ignited. The diesel fuel was for generators in the bunker that former mayor Rudolph Giuliani used. Also, there was a report of a natural gas fire inside the building.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Why did the September 11th terrorist attack happened?<br />
<br />
A: We may never know an exact motive, but likely it is related to America's involvement with Israel. Also, one important thing to note is that it happened on the anniversary of the Camp David Accords, which change the course for the Middle Eastern world. It is best not to know.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Why do some people blame America for the September 11th attacks?<br />
<br />
A: Those people who like to blame America for the attacks have no idea what they are talking about. Its ignorance. Its very complex. Also, you have to look at the fact that those governments in Middle Eastern nations are corrupt and they do not help the people. 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the September 11th attack were from Saudi Arabia, in which the leaders are rich from oil, but they do not help their people. Blaming America for the attacks is very one-sided and prejudiced. Its just another way of shifting blame, which is just as bad. The blame should lay solely on the terrorists and no one else but them. They do not look at the other side, showing their complete ignorance and warped worldview they have. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Why is America so hated?<br />
<br />
A: They see America as imperialist. Imperialist in a sense that they see American culture as morally decadent. Good example of this are movies and music, which they see as decadent and sleazy. Also, especially in the Muslim world, they envy our freedoms and civil liberties we enjoy. Many Muslim worlds are not democratic, but run by despots, with the exception of Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar increasingly. This hatred for America is a result of regimes ramming it down people's throat through propagenda and threats, like in Iraq or North Korea. Unforunately, hatred for America runs in America as well, which is rather ironic. Its seen mostly on the left, but on the right as well. Right in the sense they range from racists and religious fanatics, however they are not as vocal as on the left. The left is usually more vocal for hating America. Its common among professors, school administrators, some politicians, and entertainers. However, the hate America crowd in America are in a very small minority, but highly vocal in nature. Hatred for America is worldwide, but it is very common in Europe and the Middle East. It all really boils down to envy. They were once superpowers and now they are cesspools. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Why do Americans hate America?<br />
<br />
A: There are lots of reasons. This type of thinking is uniquely American. It does not occur in other industrialized nation or Third World nations. One reason is America is a heterogenous country in terms of ethnicity and race, which could cause someone to hate America, which is common among racists of all colors. Another common reason for one to hate their own country is that, they are raised in a sheltered environment in a gated suburban community, in which their rich parents, either they are home or not at home, raise them into spoiled brats. Also, since they live a sheltered life they do not see reality and suffering in society, which gives them a sense of guilt. They never had to work in their life. The parents did not teach them values, which usually the parents are not around the house. Since, their minds are often impressionable, they get to hear how America is evil and imperialistic, from which they believe in. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Who is Osama bin Laden?<br />
<br />
A: Osama bin Laden is the son of a wealthy Saudi businessman. Osama bin Laden finances his network with money he inherited from his father, who died in a helicopter accident. He is the leader of al-Qaeda network, which means &quot;The Base&quot;. Al-Qaeda ran training camps in Afghanistan, before they were destroyed. Osama bin Laden trains people to fight in a Jihad or Holy War. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Where is Osama bin Laden?<br />
<br />
A: That is anyone's guess. Could be either dead or alive in the mountains of Afghanistan or Pakistan.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Does Osama bin Laden go by the Koran of Islam?<br />
<br />
A:Absolutely not!! Osama bin Laden is going against what Islam teaches. Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. Islam teaches that everyone is equal, not of hate. Also, Islam is a religion of peace, not violence. Islam is also against suicide. Think of al-Qaeda as Christian extremists, like the Christian Identity. What Osama bin Laden is doing is bigotry, hatred, and racism at its worst.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: What kind of people laughed at the terrorist attack on September 11th?<br />
<br />
A:Just plain stupid and ignorant people. Mostly younger folks who do not understand the world or politics, whose minds are so warped and impressionable. People who laugh at 9-11 must have their brains examined.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Was any other attacks being planned on September 11th?<br />
<br />
A:Most likely yes. Some speculative, some true. In Europe, police arrested some Middle Eastern men, after the learned they planned to nerve gas the European Union headquarters on September 11th. Also, more airplanes in America were likely to be hijacked and crashed into, like in cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Orlando. These are based on evidence, federal authorities have gathered. Other possible hijackings may, I need to stress may, have been planned in Asia and Oceania, like Australia, Japan, Indonesia, Malayasia, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Based on evidence from Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, they were going to hijack tanker trucks and crash them into gas stations throughout America on that day.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Was a rogue state involved on September 11th?<br />
<br />
A:Very possible, but very speculative as well. The reason is the attack was well executed. Also, something like this requires lots of money. Many experts suspect Iraq might have been involved under the dictator Saddam Hussein. Some Iraqi defectors have came forward saying that there are terrorist training camps, in which one involves a mock up of a jetliner. It appears to be an old airplane. Most likely they train future terrorists to hijack and possibly control the airplane and crash it.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: What is the profile of a typical suicidal terrorist?<br />
<br />
A:They are usually young and poor. Most of them are not religious. Unemployment among them runs rampant in those kind of people. They are usually desperate and feel down trodden. They feel they have no purpose in life. They are not insane or suffer from any mental illness. They do not fear death and are very focused. However, the September 11th terrorists were different. They came from well to do families. Mohammad Atta's father was a prominent lawyer in Cairo. Hani Hanjour's family were car dealers in Saudi Arabia. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: How long will the War on Terrorism last for?<br />
<br />
A:That is anyone's guess. Some put it at 5 to 10 years. Some say up to 50 years. It could last for a generation or too. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: What other countries will the War on Terrorism be in?<br />
<br />
A: Currently it is likely going to be Iraq. North Korea (Kim Jong-Il), Colombia (FARC), Pakistan (Muslim Radicals), or Yemen (Muslim Radicals) are possibly next.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Will the War on Terrorism be fought in America?<br />
<br />
A:Most likely yes. Al-Qaeda cell groups operating in America. Also, extremists groups, radical left and right, racists, and activists are potential targets as well in War on Terrorism (eg. PETA, ALF, ELF, Ku Klux Klan, MEChA/Aztlan, Black Panthers, and NAMBLA).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Did Israel's Mossad knew about the September 11th attacks in advance? Some say, that Mossad agents were the hijackers, not Al-Qaeda, is that true?<br />
<br />
A: No, it is just another crazy conspiracy theory by people who have too much time on their hands and do drugs. Very common conspriacy theory in the Arab and Muslim world. Callers from the hijacked airplane indicated that the hijackers were Arabs, not Jews. Sounds like typical Jew baiting, something that the Communist and Nazis would spew out. Another form of anti-Semitism.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Is it true that Nazis fled to the Muslim countries after World War II?<br />
<br />
A:Yes, many Nazis did. It is not as well known. It is rarely talked about. In fact, the Middle East was one of the primary places for Nazis to flee, besides South America (Argentina in particular). Most of them went to either Egypt and Syria. Mainly Gestapo and SS Nazis fled, most notably Alois Brunner, Leopold Gleim, and Alois Mosser. Alois Brunner was Adolf Eichmann's aide. Leopold Gleim was the head of the Polish Gestapo branch. Alois Mosser was the SS general who killed Ukrainian Jews. Also, many Nazis that went to South America, spent time in the Middle East, like Adolf Eichmann, Franz Stangl, and Walter Rauff. Adolf Eichmann was the engineer of the Holocaust, who was caught in Argentina in 1960. Franz Stangl was commander of Treblinka death camp and later fled to Brazil. Walter Rauff was the inventor of the mobile gassing truck and trained Arab Muslims to kill Jews. Rauff later fled to Chile. Nazis are known to have gone to Palestine, Iran, Iraq, and possibly Saudi Arabia. The ODESSA network operated in the Middle East. Egypt in fact was the place where ODESSA operated, besides Argentina. There are many reasons why Nazis were given asylum in the Middle East. They range from sympathy, anti-Semitism, and need of technological expertise. In fact, when Egypt and Syria waged war on Israel, Israeli intelligence indicated that Nazis war criminals were helping them. Those Middle Eastern nations that welcomed Nazis are likely harboring them, particulary Syria. Another interesting fact, Arab Muslims rallied to the defense of Adolf Eichmann when he was caught and tried in Israel. He was viewed as a martyr for killing six million Jews. Here is the information I got it from. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Did the CIA fund Osama bin Laden?<br />
<br />
A: Yes, but indirectly. The US sided with the Mujahadeen when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. America had to side with two evils and decided to side with Afghanistan instead. The Soviet Union killed 50 to 70 million people during its reign of terror. Communism was responsible for killing 100 million people. The US would rather side with someone not bloody and destructive, like Communism. Communism is a failed and evil system that kills like Nazism. The world is better off without Communism.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Do people have the right to protest?<br />
<br />
A: Yes, its freedom of speech. Its what makes us unique. Let's see what the First Amendment says:<br />
<br />
Amendment I:<br />
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. <br />
<br />
Free speech only applies to the government. Freedom of speech is not absolute. Private entities do not have to go by the First Amendment and can do whatever they want. It does not mean, freedom of speech can trample on other people's freedom. Trampling on one's freedom is not freedom. Freedom of speech is not freedom when it causes a clear and present danger, like yelling, &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater. Also, calling for the overthrow of the government in times of war is sedition, which is illegal and therefore does not constitute free speech. Protesting is a right when its done peacefully. Now, when people start breaking the law while protesting, that is not freedom of speech and could be seen as inciting a riot. Also, freedom of speech does not mean you can listen to them and you can disagree with them. Freedom of speech cuts both ways. If it wasn't then that it would be tyranny. There is no such thing as absolute freedom. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: What if another terrorist attack occurs and the death toll is higher than the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001?<br />
<br />
A: More then likely, America will be under martial law. FEMA will take control and use REX-84, which detains at least 6 million people into detention camps for some unknown amount of days or greater with Congressional approval. FEMA can detain people from citizens, celebrities, Congress, and the President, who are seen as interference in a national emergency. Most likely to be affected will be activists, protesters, celebrities, and people of certain religions, and nationalities who are not citizens of America. <br />

Q: Do you think anti-Semitism is on the rise, especially with the conflicts in Israel and 9/11?<br />
<br />
A: Absolutely! I mean look at Europe or Middle East. Jews are often harassed, their synagogues attacked, and lot of Jew baiting. It often comes from newly immigrated Muslims, Communists, leftists, and Neo-Nazis. Lot of the anti-Semitism of today is similar to that of Nazis and Communists, the biggest purveyors of anti-Semism and killers of humans. Lot of this anti-Zionism stuff is just thinly veiled form of anti-Semitism. The Communists of Soviet Union were ardent anti-Semitic/anti-Zionists and devoted a lot of resources to destroy Israel. Also, anti-Semitism is a big problem on college campuses among the intellectuals and activist students. Not a surprise.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Q: Will Muslim terrorists form alliance with non-Muslim groups and engage in terrorism?<br />
<br />
A: Yes, Muslims, Communists, and Nazis share a lot in common if you think about it. They form a unholy trinity. They share a rabid hatred for America and Israel, Judeo-Christian, and capitalism. They all seem to have virulent hatred for Jews. Carlos the Jackal called for non-Muslims to side with Muslims to destroy America. Neo-Nazis praised the 9/11 terrorist attack. The founders of Neo-Nazis sided and fought with Muslim radicals. In fact, Francois Genoud, who was a Hitler youth member, funded terrorists like PLO and Hamas. Communist groups like ANSWER and World's Worker Party get their funding from North Korea, a rogue nation. Communists throughout history have sided with Muslims. The Soviet Union gave military arms to many Muslim nations that were involved in wars with Israel. In addition, Muslims enjoyed more rights then Christians and Jews in the Soviet Union. North Korea also ships weapons to nations that are known to sponsor terrorism like Iran and Syria. Many non-Muslim groups like FARC help Muslim terrorist groups in South America. Weirdly enough, many ex-Nazis, and Communists from Soviet Union, and Muslims chose South America. One area of concern involving terrorism is the Tri-Border region where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet. Not surprisingly, that is where Nazis ended up, Argentina in particular. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">http://www.daytonanow.net/images/candleani.gif<br />
...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my memories, stepped out of Grand Central when the first plane hit I heard a sonic boom/sound of large girder falling/hard noise to describe as it was rather faint.  As you often hear things like this in NY I didn't give it much thought (8:40am?).<br />
<br />
At 9:00am I was in 345 Park avenue grabbing coffee when I heard the news from one of the other managers who had NPR on their offive radio.  Walked down 1 floor and folks were talking with 2 of our friends from Deutsche Bank who were attending the Waters Risk Conference (103 tower1?).  They were sending Blackberry messages that &quot;everything was fine&quot;.  Last Blackberry was received about 9:10.  They both died.<br />
<br />
9:10 am and on, internet, cell and land lines saturated (can't call home).  Walk from 345 Park to 280 park.  On my way stop and look at TV monitor on local atm/bank branch (soverign bank?).  Bunch of tourists standing there.  The first Tower falls while I am standing watching it on the street....I wont forget seeing it on TV and then looking south and seeing smoke rise as far as the eye can see to the South sky.  Older gentleman (ironically French) asks me what just happened...tell him tower fell...the look of sadness was unreal &quot;but thats impossible&quot;.  <br />
<br />
10am standing in MDs office on 40th floor 280 park looking South.  Most communication still out.  News is from 1010 news on his radio.  Walk back downstairs at some point to get coffee.  Pause at television monitor...tv is re-running pictures of people falling from the towers as they jump to escape fire (CBS...since edited &quot;lost&quot; I've never seen these picturtes again).<br />
<br />
Noon: release us for day.  Metro north/subways/bridges are all off-line.  Noone really knows what to do or where to go.  DBA I work with decides to walk South, I go with him.  Most of the rest of the day is me and he walking down 6th avenue just watching (normally you can see the towers in the distance walking down 6th).  Furthest south we get is about 14st.<br />
<br />
Mid afternoon I get ahold of my wife.  She lets my parents know I was in midtown.  Get ahold of an old friend who was in downtown for training with Social Security (in Federal building across the street from WTC).  He left as soon as plane 1 hit and jumped on 4/5 line to midtown (violating federal orders /grin).  Invites me over to hotel as he has already started drinking heavily.  Around 3-4 in afternoon hear the first fighter aircraft starting their patrols.  Its very unnerving as it is a crystal clear day but you cant see them.<br />
<br />
Spend next 3-4 hours watching my friend drink. He is staying over night but I keep trying to find out when Metro North will be back up.  He doesnt talk much about what he saw down there.  He still doesnt.  Finally get out of the city about 8-9 at night.<br />
<br />
Nothing special but I imagine this was the same kinda day 3-4 million other folks had in/around manhattan that day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was at school, world history.<br />
<br />
We would watch (CNN)TV once a week as part of  world history and sept. 11th was one of those days that we had CNN on, one of the most shocking things I've seen, teacher was cursing out loud... he had family that worked near by.<br />
<br />
World spread to the entire school in under a min, we shuffled along with each bell to our next class with our thoughts on new york, coming to find the sadness from another TV in our next class, after lunch they told us we were free to go home, it was to much of a burden on everyone to try to continue their day as if nothing was going on.<br />
<br />
If you guys and ladys had friends around the towers at any point in that day or the week following have them go to the doctor, they found some esbestose in the towers which went into the air when they fell and that stuff can cause cancer if you leave it alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Woke up to screams in the halls of my Barracks in Okinawa, poked my head out the door to see what was wrong, heard someone say that the towers were falling with lots of people trapped inside. Tried to go back to sleep with thoughts of what tomorrow would bring...<br />
<br />
Easily the most horrifyingly surreal experience in my life, sitting on my bunk halfway across the world in Japan, staring at my pressed uniform ready for the next day, unable to do a damn thing.</div></div><hr />
