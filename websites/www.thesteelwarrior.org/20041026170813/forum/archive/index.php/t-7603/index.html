<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Turned out you can survive ONE DT but not 2.<br />
<br />
I had Virtue and Focus (Brells faded), Calrena, Spellshield, and 12300ish HP and 31% spellshield.  I fortituded and start beating up on a Tribunal, didn't have enough time to take a screenshot after the first DT because they all fire off at the same time.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Whoa, just realized I only had the 2nd Calrena for that instead of the higher one, so the margin was a bit closer than I expected (Brells fading didn't help either).  I had the 960 Calrena version instead of the 1280.  If I had the highest Alendar (1600) would've shaved another 640 HP off the first DT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shakkha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nice!<br />
<br />
would have been nicer with some mob calling your name though hehe...<br />
<br />
Btw nice UI!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Default UI &gt; all.<br />
<br />
I'll try some old world mobs sometime I guess, but it's actually harder than Tribunal because you've to know when to turn Fortitude on so you stop taking melee damage.  Even as weak as old world mobs hit, that melee damage is not insignificant when you consider you have to survive a DT.  Tribunal seems the ideal candidate since they're not KOS and you can easily fortitude (or just stay out of their melee range) so you're only taking a DT (or two).  I believe Locospider was casting Exodus in that picture, but evidently it wasn't fast enough.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you could get a insta gate potion then run into fear near the DTing golem then after the first DT gate out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is that a true Death Touch? I can't see the screenshot on this machine (too dark), but I didn't see &quot;PHANTRON!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shei and Exiled for example have what essentially amounts to a DT, but it's not actually a DT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dairen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only difference I'm aware of in the two types of DTs is that the original old world version ignores DA and still owns you. Shei, exiled, etc could be DA'd through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice!  WTG :)  and seriously, do some work on your UI hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only difference I'm aware of in the two types of DTs is that the original old world version ignores DA and still owns you. Shei, exiled, etc could be DA'd through.<br />
<br />
The point I was kind of beating around is that a true DT could possibly also just kill you outright, regardless of total HP or spellshielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A true DT is still just 20K of spell damage even the ones they called out your name.  I know I saw a screenshot of Furor getting DTed for 19300 (20K - spellshield) on Emperor Ssraeshza way back in Luclin and I'm pretty sure old Emp has the standard DT.  Since DT still does spell damage it is subject to all the normal forms of spell damage prevention (Rune, Spellshield mods, Alendar, etc...)<br />
<br />
Now obviously they could code DT to ignore certain effects, like how mod rod damage is not affected by spellshield mods.  But I'd assume there just never a need to because until now, it didn't seem plausible to survive 20K of spell damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spellshield wasn't around during the original emp that I can recall.<br />
<br />
That was probably a rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There's a wizard spell called Spellshield that absorbs 700 points of spell damage, not to be confused with the spellshield mods.  I think that spell is Kunark, it's just no one ever bothered with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">oh Yeah... sorry I was thinking of the mod and forgot the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Very nice to see that, though now I wonder how long it will be before they up DTs and Falling damage to 30k.<br />
<br />
Regardless, nicely done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Clear fear up to one of the golems and just walk into his aggro range you wont need to worry about furious. We where clearing fear once and I walked a little to close  Loading please wait</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
can falling damage be mitigated in anyway as a warrior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't think there is any way to mitigate falling damage at all besides Safe Fall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As I understand, even safefall only mitigates as long as the fall is below a certain height. After a certain distance, it's supposed to be insta death regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You got some unique SS Phantron. It's 32k now.</div></div><hr />
