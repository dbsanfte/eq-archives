<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bumbleroot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild took down Vindi again last night for the fourth time. We had 4 groups, 5 clerics and I tanked it all the way.<br />
I have over 7800 hps fully buffed, our number 2 warrior has about 7200 and our number 3 warrior has about 7100. At the end of the fight I asked our clerics what their mana was. Each of them had over 50 pct left and some of them had 60 to 65 mana left. <br />
We have 10 clerics in our guild that have clickers and we can expect to get 8 clerics on really important raids. In fact for really big raids we can have 35 to 40 people on as a total. Our average level is probably between 62 to 63 although most players are either 65 or 61.<br />
Are we ready for Avatar of War yet?<br />
Also I need a very good spoiler for him if anyone can provide me with a direct link to one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in order to spawn aow, you need to kill the idol of war.  In order to spawn idol of war, you need to kill statue or rallos zek (5 day spawn).<br />
<br />
If you can kill statue without slow &amp; no nukes, try idol unslowed.  If you win that fight you have a reasonable shot at aow.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like your clerics dont have big enough mana pools or you dps is lacking though to be honest, based on what your clerics mana pools were at for 24 people killing vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Five</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do Idol unslowed.  That will tell you if you are ready for AoW.<br />
<br />
Corner.<br />
Aggro management.<br />
3 second CH chain.<br />
Divine Intervention.<br />
<br />
Work on MT changes unless you have the clerics and manapool to go to a 2.5 sec CH chain when DEF drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tithus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definitely try Idol unslowed without nukage (I think you can actually use anything but fire based nukes for the test, but I'm no wizzy so not too sure).   He's pretty much the same fight as AoW when unslowed.  You will probably need all 8 clerics that you spoke of.  The hardest part to handle is if an MT switch is necessary.  If your raid listens well and follows directions, things can go smoothly.<br />
<br />
As Gallerus pointed out, you may need a little more dps or bigger healer mana pools.  AoW is an order of magnitude harder than Vindi.  He's a much longer fight.  Overall, I'd suggest giving Idol a shot unslowed and seeing how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only thing I would suggest different is to forget trying a tank switch. Even the slightest glitch in a tank switch = wipe and a blown spawn. If cleric mana is in question, then get 2 more clerics.<br />
<br />
Better yet, make 4 cleric + 2 SK groups for Zevfeer's Bite (equavalent of FT10 per SK if chaincast). That coupled with AE bard mana, PotG(9), KEI+, and Blessed Armor of the Risen and your clerics should have no problem maintaining mana for a very long fight.<br />
<br />
With 7k+ tanks, you should be able to single tank the AOW. Keep in mind that when the first AOW was killed, 7k tanks were all but nonexistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">even killing statue unslowed would be a good warm up, aow has about 2x times as much hp as statue to give you an idea. <br />
<br />
yah, fire nukes dont land on aow so should do idol unslowed and with no fire nukes, why idol is slowable is beyond me though.<br />
<br />
only strat u need is keep healing MT with 2 sec ch chain till he dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aow is an interesting hurdle...before you kill it its like this holy grail encounter...after you beat it like 6+ times you start to wonder why a gm just doesnt summon you every 5 days &amp; hand out loots :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Danathor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think AoW resists the SK bite spells, I can't remember for sure though.<br />
<br />
Basically just try idol unslowed, if you can do that with little or no problem you can kill AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How does the MT maintaint Agro during a 2min CH chain casting parade?   dont' get me wrong I know this is how some encounters are done... I am just wondering.. you simply fight alone at first and then call your CH's?  /defensive is in order I assume and aside from taunt you just pray DPS keeps you there?  (and procs if you have em of course)??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Five</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get aggro by fighting alone for a few seconds, about 15 ish.  Then calling in the troops.  Troops stay at max range.  Autoattack off if mob turns.  Yada yada yada.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unslowed idol is not equal to AoW -- the agro management issues are different on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SamirDaStinky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unslowed statue / idol will definately give you an idea of what kind of fight to expect with AoW. Also, I've noticed that if you can do Vindi easily and kill him before defensive drops, then you should have enough DPS to stick it to AoW.<br />
<br />
If you're afraid of blowing the spawn, try statue unslowed. If you want the best shot at it, do idol unslowed. Of course this is all just practice and prep for the real deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the agro management issues are different on them. <br />
<br />
I personally havent noticed any differences in agro management between the two - we pull/tank/kill both virtually the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">AoW is pretty much 100% proximity agro, while idol is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karthunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We have killed AoW ~ 8 times in the past, and I never saw anyone pull him off the first MT. Only time we had people die was when the MT up would die and there was a small period of time to get the next tank up and tanking. He is &quot;undead&quot; aggression or as Hulanta said &quot;100% proximity agro&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">think they meant more in what the cleric has to do for ch rotation and what the mt should expect to get hit for. one time (on our vindi raid) the other guild was pulling aow and man does he hurt. got a flurry and hit for 6500pts of dmg (well a little less like 6478)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes an unslowed and no nuking on idol and clerics over 40 or 50 i believe is ABOUT equivalent to AoW and also the 1st and 2nd kills are always hard after that he is a farming bish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">park a mind wrack mob nearby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Trot02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">or....u could just slow statue / idol, get by them quickly, and try the real thing for urselves. if ya blow it ya blow it, its a game, have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">or....u could just slow statue / idol, get by them quickly, and try the real thing for urselves. if ya blow it ya blow it, its a game, have fun. <br />
<br />
Honestly this is about the dumbest thing I ever heard.  If you cant kill idol unslowed, you cannot kill aow, thats just fact.  Therefore, you are robbing yourselves of a mob that you can use to practice on multiple times instead of 1 or if you are very lucky the 2 shots you will get at aow &amp; thats not to mention pissing off the aow capable guilds by blowing the spawn if you cant win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trot02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">my guild never tried idol or statue unslowed - to much effort, and beat aow second try.  clearly by other posts people have said its not the same and imo its not..so if ur guild wants to practice on something that drops no loot like Gallerus's - do that.  BTW if u quickly pull AoW after idol - which we do since clerics are all fm when idol dies, we always get a second shot at him if we wipe due to a lucky shot or something. <br />
<br />
&quot;not to mention pissing off the aow capable guilds by blowing the spawn if you cant win.&quot;<br />
<br />
hmm if they are aow capable they should have him on some kind of timer, since he's kinda a big mob for guilds at that lvl...so this will usually not happen...unless u mean the guild that scouts for cash mobs after their raids and kill him with 30ish, but its fun pissing those guilds off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No, I think they mean if you blow a spawn, not only do you blow your chances at an eb item, but you blow it for another guild too, and making everyone wait another 5 days.<br />
<br />
On my server, EB dropping mobs are pretty contested, and it is really crappy to hear another guild made everyone wait a week.<br />
<br />
We don't do firenukes on idol either, just to make sure. <br />
<br />
I kinda see the saving mana argument, but I can only see that one when you have aow down to farm status, and have proven your competance to the server anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">BTW if u quickly pull AoW after idol - which we do since clerics are all fm when idol dies, we always get a second shot at him if we wipe due to a lucky shot or something. <br />
<br />
Slow idol at 3% then &amp; med up - now u are fm for 1st aow attempt as soon as idol dies.<br />
<br />
So lets look at the pros vs. cons of slowing idol:<br />
cons:<br />
no accurate gauge of if you can kill aow or not<br />
piss off guild_02 if u despawn aow<br />
get 1 or maybe 2 shots at aow &amp; leave yourself with no mob left to practice on if you lose<br />
<br />
pros:<br />
practice forever on idol to gauge cleric connections/mana timing<br />
practice tank switching on a very high dps mob<br />
knowledge that you have a very good chance at killing aow<br />
if you wipe, you dont blow aow loots for 5 days for guild_02<br />
<br />
Slowing idol doesnt kill him faster (in fact it slows killing him down cause your mts dshield wont do as much damage :D) &amp; has no bearing on cleric mana for aow fight - therefore it is stupid to slow him, especially on your 1st attempt or 2 at killing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Trot02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">practicing on aow is the best thing, not an unslowed idol where u don't nuke and make clerics stay above 50% or whatever u guys figured out who like to practice on idol do.<br />
<br />
it shouldn't piss off other guilds who need his stuff, because as someone said the competition is tough, little chance this guild that kills vindi walks into kael with statue up - if ur farming aow u know when statue is going to be up and ur scouting.  slowing idol kills him much faster - u don't wipe once. i don't know about ur guild Gallerus, maybe u guys needed practice on ch rots, ours didn't.<br />
<br />
btw anyother way to see if ur guild is aow capable is by having a naked ranger tank vindi with the guilds melee's using only their fists, not using any nukes, no mana buffs on the clerics, and a bard chain gating him<br />
<br />
(or u could just try the real thing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Last night I killed vindi with 7 people &amp; statue &lt; vindi, i'm pretty sure I could kill idol with about 9 people if I really wanted to - thats no indication of ability to kill aow though.  Killing the idol unslowed IS an indication of ability to kill it.<br />
<br />
My guild has never lost to aow - pretty much the only reason we kill aow anymore is for rings.  We did, however, lose to idol 1st time we tried him &amp; its cause we tried him unslowed.  Had we slowed him we would have lost to aow &amp; blow the spawn - since we didnt slow him &amp; we learned from the fight, we ended up that night with aow loots instead of a blown aow spawn.   When I see you say things like &quot;slowing idol kills him much faster - u don't wipe once.&quot; I know everything I needed to know about you &amp; the quality of your guild.  <br />
<br />
&quot;i don't know about ur guild Gallerus, maybe u guys needed practice on ch rots, ours didn't.&quot;  Why dont you consider who you are giving advice to - a guild that has never even fought sorz from the sounds of the initial poster.  This guild probably has never had a ch rotation longer than 4 people &amp; has almost certainly never done a 2 sec. rotation as they most likely never had the need to.  Also had you bothered to looked at the posters description of their clerics mana pools after killing vindi, its very easy to realize they have very little chance at killing aow - you are advocating them to go slow idol &amp; blow the spawn - supa advice.<br />
<br />
So in summary for the last time: your advice = gives them 1 real mob to fight &amp; very good chance to lose &amp; blow the spawn &amp; loots &amp; be done for the night.  My advice = gives them practice on a mob thats very similar to aow that they can try over &amp; over as much as they want until they get it right where they can then try aow with confidence that they have a very good shot at winning.<br />
<br />
Its pretty clear to me that your advice sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Trot02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">unslowed idol is not = to aow...my original advise = try the real thing for urselves. if ya blow it ya blow it, its a game, have fun...someones a little upset that they won't be able to put a new boc on their trader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Trot02 = Frustrated  war giving bad advice.<br />
<br />
Nuffsaid. <br />
<br />
Why the f_ck should they just slow the idol and risk blowing AoW ?<br />
Oh yeah, its its good advice &quot;just go for the real thing&quot;.<br />
With no clue as what to expect. Nice thinking.<br />
<br />
Hey ! We just blew AoW ! Got RAPED doing it ! Was fun ! too bad !<br />
At least we pissed local Uber02, and we dont get a 2nd training shot.<br />
Lets thank &quot;Trot02&quot; and his wise ideas. <br />
<br />
If you want to be ready for AoW do what everyone said.<br />
1) Try Tanking Unslowed Idol<br />
2) Try Killing Unslowed Idol without caster DPS<br />
<br />
If you manage to do this AoW will be just formalities.<br />
<br />
Unslowed idol is NOT AoW, but its the closer thing you'll get.<br />
And you can do training on that. <br />
And not have a 60 min timer just ticking away.<br />
<br />
PS : If local Uber02 comes breathing down your neck.<br />
Slow the idol, and go for it. Double or Nothing.<br />
But if you have some time to practice on unslowed idol.<br />
USE THAT TIME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Trot02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">1. im not a warrior<br />
2. if u don't know what aow does by now u should just quit<br />
3. why would you not use casters for idol when u can for aow<br />
<br />
the only reason people cry about blowing aow is because they won't be able to sell his loots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">1) I apologise my bad.<br />
Trot02 = Frustrated non war giving bad advice<br />
<br />
2) AoW = Quad 1100 + Flurry... <br />
Now lets see .... <br />
How does that really help a guild going for him on the 1st time ?<br />
How does that help on tank switch ? Mana management ?<br />
MT management ? Whats his real DPS like ? How easy is he to agro ?<br />
Do we need to use Weaponshield ? Do we need necro feed ?<br />
Can we Bind/Die/CoH/Nuke ?  etc etc <br />
<br />
3) You do agree that AoW has a bit more HP than Idol ?<br />
Thus a guild going OOM (clerics) on a slowed Idol, has no chance vs AoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blowing AoW happens. Its a fact. No one will complain for that.<br />
Blowing AoW because you &quot;wanted to see how it feels&quot; is retarded.<br />
<br />
If you can kill unslowed idol, you have right to blow as many<br />
AoWs as you want trying to get him down.<br />
<br />
If you cant kill unslowed idol, then AoW is out of your reach.<br />
<br />
Why should you go blow the spawn ?<br />
Its not even curtesy, its common sence. Too bad some lack it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Trot02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i never said blow the spawn purposly - u know that, stop being dumb. i said try it, which does not mean blow it every time it spawns either.  aow is definatly killable without trying idol unslowed...but i guess for those that desperatly want that boc or horz on their trader, advising unslowed idol is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Let me guess ....<br />
but i guess for those that desperatly want that boc or horz on their trader <br />
<br />
You are frustated wars / ubers can sell phats for 200-400k.<br />
When you cant either sell , or buy same things for your char ?<br />
<br />
While you got a meager 5kpp in your old shitty dusty bank ? <br />
There's got to be a reason you keep mentioning the &quot;uber thing&quot;  jealous ?? <br />
Spit it out and stop bullshitting us. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am really making this personnal. you give a fellow war BAD ADVICE.<br />
<br />
You are not EVEN a war.<br />
<br />
And you say we defend &quot;uber traders&quot; with our advice ?<br />
<br />
DUDE HELLO REALITY CHECK ??? !!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
The guy's guild is thinking about trying AoW.<br />
Everyone told him to give unslowed idol a shot.<br />
So they can get the idea of what AoW feels like.<br />
<br />
Most of us gave him a good advice, an advice that will probably<br />
help them defeat AoW the first time they spawn him.<br />
<br />
Sure they may blow him the 1st time, and kill him the 2nd.<br />
But why blow AoW ? <br />
When you can with 2 hours and our advice maximise your chances to get a kill ?<br />
<br />
If they think they can take down AoW, let them try.<br />
If not, why go blow him ? To piss off uber traders ?<br />
Or to get &quot;A real rape by the real feel AoW&quot; with no chances of succes ?<br />
<br />
Now thats SOME NICE ADVICE !</div></div><hr />
