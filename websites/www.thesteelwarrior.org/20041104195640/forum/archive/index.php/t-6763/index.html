<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know i've been seeing a similar thread floating around, but i'd like to see if I can get a few more suggestions. We have about 4 tanks at 9 - 9.3k buffed, we skipped VT so some of us are lacking gear. We currently have about 35-50 elemental flagged people online on any given day so I was looking for some recomendations for targets. We had 40 on the other night and found 2 charm birds up in PoF, that was a blast, we were able to down them both after an initial wipe. Later we moved on to PoE and tried to spawn the mud ring, we killed the red con mud men, and all the little mud men spawned, we did this about 4 times until raid leader said that PH popped and mud ring is not up. Is there any way to tell if it's up besides clearing all that nonsense? After we finished that we decided to make a run at Tanti, so we move to his little temple, lev and float over and start killing the 3-4 spawns on top, all of a sudden about 15 adds appear from no where and destroy us, we figure somebody did something stupid and try again, same thing happens, apparently something is aggroing and pathing through a butt load of spawns and bringing a train every time, can anyone tell me what we should be doing here to fix this? All in all the elementals are proving to be a great challenge so far and were having a blast. Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there are some invisible mobs up that let you know if the poe rings are spawnable, if you got the right software...<br />
<br />
most mobs in any zone are doable with 40+ if you have clerics for good rotation and a few tanks, not going to single tank much out of disc. other key in fire is to get few mephit pets, really help with low numbers, each pet is roughly 3 rogues.<br />
<br />
i guess you know, but you arent going to see potime without recruitment, hopefully yall are looking at an absorbtion or back flagging another 30 ppl. encounters like rathe council really tax a small raid force.</div></div><hr />

Do you know the names of these mobs? if so can you post em or PM me the info please.<br />

Were still backflagging, RZ has been a roadblock for us, he's highly contested and doesn't stay up for more then an hour or so. Once we hit him up one more time we should get about  70-90 Total elemental flagged people. We are a fairly large guild, but we've only been around three months so backflagging has been huge so far being that we started from scratch with no pop flags, and no VT gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lots of stuff in Fire can easily be taken down by 40 people.  Pretty much any of the field named.  Start with Pyronis, Druav, and the charm birds.  If they go down easy, try firetail, Babs, magma, and blazzax.<br />
<br />
Really nothing but maybe Magmaton and Blazzax should give you any trouble at all.  <br />
<br />
You can probably do earth rings with that many as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could also try the Air Avatars.  Should be able to do Mist and Wind easy enough.<br />

Make damn sure you kill all pets before you levi and float over to the flatform.  Pets tend to take the long way around and aggro everything on the way.</div></div><hr />
