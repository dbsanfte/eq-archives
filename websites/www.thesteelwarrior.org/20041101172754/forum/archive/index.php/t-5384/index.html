<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok so i see a lot of people running around with heated blade augments on their weapons??  is this just for the extra 50 dd, or is there some aggro component tied in there with it?  i know it's cheap as hell, but is there anything more to it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, it's just cheap really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">40AP For the augment, I think most ppl grab it after their first adventure just to say oww wow I have 50dd fire augment. At least, that's what I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got it so I could see how well augments worked.  By the time I replaced it with Anger3, I got my value from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At level 48 I was only getting 10 points per adventure and doing 1-2 adventures a week, so I felt like it was worth the 40 points to get the aug now because I knew I'd get a lot of use out of it.  Once I am higher level and getting more AP per adventure I'll start looking at ykesha/anger procs.  Heated blade is not great aggro, but is a nice dps increase and is a bit of additional aggro.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also the spell effects are kind of cool, fire dripping down.  Goes nicely with the lightning effect on the CHoS.  Fire and lightning.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good bang for the buck augment.  Should be worth about 1.5-2 dps on a primary weapon with 200+ dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I bought it after one adventure just to see how it worked. I don't do many adventures so I have kept it to this point. I regularly parse it at ~2dps with 285dex. 50dd proc for 40 points is really hard to pass up, even if it is only used temporarily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">aye and compared to the other 50 point dps aug it's a flat out steal. it and the 20pointer from guk are very nice for lower lvl wars who can't amass points fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ulic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Interesting thoughts...I've been sitting on my points for anger 3 but I need about 600 more points in EF to unlock them. Maybe I'll pick up one of these cheapies to tide over the boredom ( warriors need their toys ).</div></div><hr />
