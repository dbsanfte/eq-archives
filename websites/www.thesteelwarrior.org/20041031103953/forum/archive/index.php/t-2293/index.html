<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All the hubub over this stupid weapon, I finally broke down and grabbed one (thanks SOE for making drop rates plain dumb...more common than rusty short swords now).<br />
<br />
Anyway, using it in BOT for many hours made me realize how great it was...held aggro 95% through slows and duration of the fights. I can see why ppl have loved it so much. Easily out-aggs my CHSD/Epic or any other combo of offhand.<br />
<br />
I still use trusty windblade on raids when not tanking as the GSoT will turn the mobs onto me (tested) too frequently that it was a pain to /attk off.<br />
<br />
Thought I'd share, and add another GSoT post the huge stinky pile ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yup. blows gsot out the water aggro wise</div></div><hr />

<br />
Friend gave me GSoT a week ago, i loved it. Then I went on a pickup Severilious raid, and i was the only one there who needed the scale that dropped. I had planned on doing epic, but then realized it would be a waste. I sold the scale, bought me a CHoS/SotBS, along with new bow and boots. <br />
<br />
Now I love my dual-wielding again hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Getting green scale defaulted to you then selling it = bad mojo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Every other person on the raid was 65, they only invited me because they're warrior had BoC/SoD. I offered to have everyone roll for it when the scale dropped, they refused and handed it to me.<br />
<br />
Believe me, at the time, i was stoked. The day after it dropped, I started asking guildies if they'd be willing to help with the perma drops for epic, red scale, etc. I then had several people tell me it really is a waste to do the epic when you can buy weapons just as good for cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">But epics looks so cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you are the weakest link!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am excited just to be able to wield it.  Friend in guild gave it to me from his exploits so its sitting in my bag, after that hopefully will go and do some hunting in droga for a couple of months see if I get CHoS/Bloodsworn after that.. just looking for a nice 2HS for DPS and I'm happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">since where on the subject should i try camping the king or should i just buy bloodsworn for 8k and wait for hammer to go down from 20</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Would it be worth selling my frosty and vengeful yak for a gsot?  I wouldn't have any aggro 1h weaps if I did that, so would it be good enough to cover those aggro wise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have used Frosty and Vengeful Yak. I sold the Frosty and bought another Yak after using the first one for a few weeks. I heard about GSoT and since I am alwats MT for our small guild I sold my WB and bought a GSoT. I gave the two Yaks to a buddy of mine the next day. GSoT is a better taunt than two Yaks, which was a better taunt than FB+Yak.<br />
<br />
I am still in testing with my Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn, but initial feel of the two 1handers is that they seem at least a bit stronger aggro than GSoT. Once I have a week or two of testing I will make a firm decision, but I must admit I really did miss dual wielding.<br />
<br />
Short answer: YES, sell the Frosty and VHBoYkesha and get a GSoT if it is affordable, BUT if you got a few friends and perhaps 2-8 hours you can get CHoS and SotBS.<br />
<br />
More testing to come!</div></div><hr />

It may have been where I was hunting, tactics, or hell I don't know but its a great weapon for the price imo.  Down to 4k on Brell now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have the following:<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of thunder<br />
Greatstaff of the four winds<br />
Great blade of storms/Copper hammer of striking<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems to me that of these 3 sets, the GSoT still has the best snap agro.  The damn thing procs like mad with 280 dex.  Roughly 70-80dps from the front on tier 3 mobs with 1400atk, Punishing blade 1 and CF3<br />
<br />
The 4winds staff has wonderful long term DPS agro..  So any 3+ minute fight you'd do fine with this.  Equip a GSoT for inital agro and switch to the 4winds staff.  I'm easily breaking 100dps on PoP tier 3 mobs from the front with 1400atk, Punishing blade 1 and CF3<br />
<br />
I'm still kind of iffy on the GBoS/copper hammer.  I have had my GSoT for 6 or 7 months now and just recently picked up the GBoS/copper hammer, so I tend to lean towards the GSoT.  I haven't parsed it yet, but it feels like it's in the 80-90 dps range.  Of course the damage has some huge spikes because of the proc.  I don't have ambidexterity yet, which is probably why I'm seeing a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gonaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">In my experience the GSoT is slightly ove -     . Sure it fairly good at holding aggro but still mobs in pop break for the slower half the time.  The damn 30 delay just doesn't deliver enough fast, regular aggro and if you're unlucky enough to miss the mob twice in a row, off it goes to one of your less-abled colleagues.  The stun proc gets resisted a hell of a lot too - maybe more than half the time.<br />
<br />
So whilst I do use the GSoT as my main tanking weapon, I still like to switch to dual wielding and don't notice much difference in keeping aggro really, and my 1-handers are pretty average nowadays - 12/20 and 12/22 stats, both with procs.<br />
<br />
So is it just me, or is the GSoT hyped up?? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I love my GSoT.  Dont get me wrong, it isnt the be all and end all of aggro weapons or anything;  if you group with idiots or people who think their aggro relates in some way to their penis size, they're still going to pull stuff off you constantly unless you're really proccing like mad. (it's still sort of on and off for me; my dex isnt great).  Overall I think it's great, but admittedly, I haven't gotten the opportunity to wield a lot of the good stuff yet. (but I don't know of anything with that kind of DPS and that kind of aggro that can be purchased for 4k either)<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The stun proc gets resisted a hell of a lot too - maybe more than half the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
A resist generates the same amount of agro as a stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sure it fairly good at holding aggro but still mobs in pop break for the slower half the time. <br />
<br />
Heh that happens no matter what you wield...its the ol' warr curse (class balancing at its finest).<br />
<br />
I think the only situation where I absolutely like the dual wield combo over GSOT is when I'm in a group that lacks really good haste.  GSOT really seems to lose some steam in these situations.  But for day in and day out (PB3 Ferocity 1) I like the GSOT.<br />
<br />
But I don't think its over hyped by any measure...with current prices where they are its actually still a pretty good bargain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">How does the Copper Hammer of Striking or Sword of the Bloodsworn compare to a CHSD or BoC?  <br />
<br />
I currently use a CHSD + Dukatlos combination and it seems to hold agro fairly well, but I admit it could be a hell of a lot better.  The Dukatlos, which is shown in my Magelo, has an ice based 320dd proc on it that likes to go off 1-3x a fight.  Without a stun component to it though, the agro generated from the proc falls as quickly as it rises.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Used GSoT for two months now when MT and War Marshall's Blade when looking for DPS. <br />
<br />
The Copper Hammer must be bad ass for aggro because the Sword of the Bloodsworn with any of my other one handers is less effective than the GSoT.  I will try to get some peeps to go to Droga and get a hammer just to try it but as of now...I am doubting it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">last night on Sol Ro<br />
<br />
GSOT 1300<br />
<br />
that's right 1.3k and 2 at that price.<br />
<br />
sheesh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Picked up a CHSD a few nights ago.  The dps on it is terrible, but the agro is insane.  I finally bagged my GSoT, after 6 or 7 months of use, for a CHSD/GBoS combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">About resist:<br />
<br />
Its not particularly the warrior curse, but the curse of 0 resist mods on procs. The Frostreaver (which I used until a GSoT dropped for me) has a -100 resist check on it. Very nice. Too bad DPS and agro are better on GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Krakah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yep, great proc. Got my 53 warrior a bloodsworn sword, and the agro is GREATLY increased from my SBoZ and rhag 2 sword ( 15/20 ) lol. Generally duo him with my 65 shaman, and now, once the mob gets to about 60% I can lay BOS and BON on the mob and most of the time it wont even look at me, where as before my shaman would end up tanking no matter what.<br />
<br />
Seems to be resisted alot tho.</div></div><hr />
