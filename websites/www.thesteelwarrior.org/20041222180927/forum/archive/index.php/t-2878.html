Any solid info on tanking skills .Like getting vinny into the corner in Kael  after monks or who every is pulling him?And my second question is just how long should i tank a named mob, or hot mobs before i call the raid into battel . Is there a rule of thumb to go by here Like 97% 90 % 99%. Im takeing into acount also giveing the debuffers and slowers a chance to do there work before the call in on the mob..... Rember your talking to a Ogre</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally 10-15s aggro workup on a raid mob if you're not yet to the point of getting EB weapons, at least thats what we used to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">magnes</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">im not clear on the term &quot;EB&quot; weapons..</div></div><hr />

+600 hate<br />
<br />
Blade of Carnage, Hategiver, Bloodfrenze, Blade of War, and to a lesser extent, Cord Hilted Spike Driver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some weapons out which have a HATE Proc.<br />
<br />
EB = 700 Hate (Bloodfrenzy, Hategiver .... )<br />
TB = 450 Hate (Cord Hilted Spike Driver ... )<br />
<br />
But to answer the first question. When you as the MT think that you have generated enough aggro so that all can jump in and dish damage, then you call them in.<br />
<br />
That is maybe after 10 seconds when you get some lucky procs or after 20 seconds when your damnd weapon would not like to proc or maybe after 30 seconds when the mob is one who is chainstunning you ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bakaris</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on your weapons when you can call people in! If with EB weapons, well you can almost instantly! Your fellow guildmembers should know how much agro they do and make sure not to have some high agro weapons at least not in the start of the fight.<br />
<br />
As for cornering Vindi, statue and AoW, I think it was nerfed or something, cause its hard to find a spot where you can hit him when cornering! It can be done, but you need to find the spot plus you have to backstep all the fight too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zarrk what you are asking is called experience.<br />
<br />
Absolutely nothing will replace that.<br />
As you will level up, xp more, raid more, you will start to have &quot;a feeling&quot;.<br />
<br />
That feeling will tell you  &quot;Ok now he hates me for REAL&quot; <br />
<br />
It may be 2 3 procs, 10 15 seconds, a couple of good rounds.<br />
I know that when i get that feeling i say &quot;/gu BUURRRRNNNNNN&quot;<br />
And works like a charm every time.<br />
<br />
As for tanking guides, well /tell random lvl65 war of ur server.<br />
Most of us would be glad to help a fellow war.<br />
And if its really a specific question, post here :)<br />
<br />
(/ all war 65,  find the ones in the elementals, / all guild of that war)<br />
If they are all together its a raid leave them alone.<br />
If they are split up its xping, and someone asking for advice is<br />
a nice thing to break a boring grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs seem to be a huge pain to corner for large races now (shrunk or not). I can still corner Vindi quite easily, but I can't corner statue or AoW. I also can't corner VT named, where a warrior in my guild can corner them in wood elf form (non shrunk!).<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is an intentional nerf or what, but ask for dark elf or wood elf (or a small race) illusion from your local enchanter. Or find another way to get illusioned (wood elf crown, potions, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WilasLoM</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Emilia is exactly right.  The best way to get better at tanking is to get experience up to the point where you dont really think about what you're doing at all.<br />
<br />
As for cornering Vindi...<br />
You have to make sure your guild stays well away from the corner where you plan to tank him and when the pull comes in, the puller will FD and you have to be the closest person to him so that he agros you.  Give him a few whacks and as you do this back into the corner.  This is pretty much it for Vindi, although you will prolly find it easier to corner him with the illusion of a smaller race on.<br />
<br />
In terms of when to call your guild in...<br />
At your lvl there is no way you have an EB weapon yet, so you will have to figure out what point your agro goes from static, to 100% onto you.  After a bit, you just know when you can call assist<br />
<br />
Best of luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The whole &quot;You'll have a feeling&quot; answer probably is not what you are looking for, but it is pretty much what happens.  At your level you can afford to be conservative, take your time and make sure you have aggro locked.  As you get more experience you can start reducing how much time you take.<br />
<br />
As for cornering, you can't do it in every situation, but when you can, just back into a corner, keep walking backwards, look up.  The view is usually terrible but it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Calling assist is for weenies.  If your DPS classes can't manage their aggro, calling for assist isn't going to help.  If they can manage their aggro, they will think you are a dolt calling for assist and ignore you.<br />
<br />
Just say no to calling for assist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Calling assist is a good way to get people new to the raiding game used to disciplining themselves to wait an appropriate time, not only must the new prospective warrior take time to practice and get the 'feeling', so too the folks DPSing....<br />

This guys new to raiding thus the questions, it's not unlikely that his raiding partners probably are too.<br />

/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its sorta a gut feeling. If I can get a few procs at the start of the fight, even 2 procs, I call assist around the 10s. But if I dont, I just give it a bit more, maybe wait 5 more secs :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno.  I've seen so many sins covered by calling assist.<br />
<br />
Best raids I ever did, the MA told people not to steal his aggro, then the clerics yelled at people that took damage.  If you always wait for solid aggro, you'll never learn where the edge is (as a DPS class), which hurts efficiency.  <br />
<br />
Takes a lof of practice moving though Kael (or wherever you do early raiding), but if the DPS classes learn where the edge is, I'd say that's better for the guild overall.</div></div><hr />
