Anyhoo, can someone who knows where to scavenge great prices and stuff enlighten me.  I'd like a setup w/ monitor and w/o monitor por favor :D</div></div><hr />

Oh whatevr you decide to do.  DO NOT buy a PC or any hardware from TIGERDIRECT.  They sell junk, 9/10 times you will be doing an RMA on the hardware they buy.  Also the PC that they sell, they use VERY low quality parts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd advise against Dells.<br />
<br />
http://www.alienware.com/Configurator_Pages/area-51.aspx?SysCode=PC-AREA51&amp;SubCode=SKU-PERFORMANCE<br />
<br />
More expensive, but Alienwares will last you a LONG time. I have much love for mine.</div></div><hr />

Have you considered building one yourself  <br />
<br />
It'd probably be more expensive, and if something goes wrong, you're screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL so you pick gateway, thier computer are not that great and their  customer service isn't much better.  Alienware nope for his price range, they tend to over charge for everything.   <br />
<br />
<br />
If you want a pre-built computer DELL is one of the best.  They have better customer service thant any other company and they make really reliable computers.   The bad part of buying a computer from one of these computers that they use properity hardware which means you can't upgrade.  <br />
<br />
I highly recommend building your own.  It is not to difficult to do, it is basically pluging stuff in.  For 1k you can build yourself a great PC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In some cases it may be more expensive but for 1k you can still build yourself a great PC.  That is the only downside of building your own PC no tech help or warranties.  <br />
<br />
I also suggest look around your hometown and see if there are local companies that build computers chances are there are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had no problems with Gateway. Their customer service is kinda lacking, but I've had my Gateway for at least 6 years. (It's now my bazaar bitch.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if he'd save up a bit, Alienware is a great choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alienware by all means is pure waste of money.  The prices they charged for each component is crazy better off blowing that money on a hooker at least you will enjoy getting screwed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, maybe that's just you. I happen to like my Alienware ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey I didn't say they didn't use quality parts or did not say that weren't any good.  I just daid that they tend to overcharge for thier computers.  I got to admit they have some badass cases though<br />
<br />
Personally I love building my own computers, I know I have quality parts and I can UPGRADE the PC without having to go through Dell, Gateway or even alienware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Alienware does overcharge. Their comps are really freaking shiny, though.<br />
<br />
Dell = solid all around. Good value, parts, performance, and customer service.<br />
<br />
http://www.am-comps.com/ &lt;-- lesser-known vendor; their PCs are pretty damn good for the money.<br />
<br />
http://www.slickdeals.net &lt;-- good place to bookmark.<br />
<br />
Also, Pricewatch is alright but you can get screwed if you buy from certain vendors. http://www.newegg.com and http://www.tigerdirect.com = more reliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">www.am-comps.com   has alot of good prices<br />
  I like the fact that they tell you the brand name of the components.  You can not go wrong with an ASUS mobo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to through my 2cp in here, but Gateway and Dell do not have Tech Support internal to their company payroll.  They out source all of their work.  One such company that takes their outsource technical support is called Convergys<br />
<br />
Convergys lands new deal (http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2001/08/20/daily35.html) <br />
<br />
Convergys reports earnings (http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2001/01/22/daily31.html) <br />
<br />
Don't let these Dell tech support commercials fool you.  The same people that work at Convergys and take the Dell / Gateway tech support calls are the same folks that take the tech support calls dealing with refrigerator problems and air conditioning problems.<br />
<br />
I have a personal pet peive on company's that out source or use foreighn support centers to service the States. *cough* India *cough*<br />
<br />
<br />
If you know how to build a computer then your best price and best system will come from a personally built system.  And no, your not screwed, all parts have manufacturer warranties.<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been mostly happy with dell, and I figure the customer support doesn't get better, which is really sad.  They have actually come to my house twice to replace a fan and MB and within one day of scheduling it.  Unfortunately I had to go through a week of !@$^ hell speaking for hours to mindless idiots reading from manuals to get there.  But, if you do happen to speak Indian, Dell is definately the way to go.<br />
<br />
A guildmate of mine just bought an alienware system.  Here are his comments as he has been unable to login for a few weeks now:<br />
<br />
Why YOU should buy from Alien Ware!!!<br />
<br />
1) You can have the opportunity to pay far more then the computer is worth. You do get to say you have an Alien Ware system tho.<br />
<br />
2) Have you ever been to a fine restaurant? Where the waiter doesn't approach the table until well after you have had plenty of time to relax and have conversation with your guest. Well Alien Ware takes that attitude. Approximately 4 to 6 weeks after you have ordered your computer you will receive it.<br />
<br />
3) The cost for the computer comes with the finest warranties. They E-mail you a Shipping label Fed Ex Ground to you personnel e-mail address. Did you not make it clear, YOUR COMPUTER DOESN'T WORK!!<br />
<br />
4) OK You have managed to retrieve your label. Send computer in. Check tracking and its been signed for. YA!!. In Alien Wares infinite wisdom it believes that a computer needs time to grow accustom to its surroundings. It was signed for on the 4th of the month. What other company would care so much for your computers feelings<br />
<br />
5) Its now the 11th of the month. Now your computer is escorted to the hospital. And its only taken 7 days. With support like this, you realize the price was worth it.<br />
<br />
6) You have called Alien Ware. They let you know that do to there intensive repairs that it will be mailed back to you in 7 to 9 working days. 7 to 9 WORKING days thats like a 9 to 11 real days. Keep telling yourself Alien Ware is worth it. Alien Ware is worth it. Eventually you will believe it ....Or fall asleep. So far I still fall asleep.<br />
<br />
7) I rest my case. Alien Ware is the ONLY way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">build one yourself, its what i did and mine can go thru the bazaar with 95% clip plane :D<br />
<br />
id say mine ran about 800-900 us$ and id recommend getting your parts from pricewatch or the nearest fry's electronics, but be prepaired to swap your motherboard with them 3 or 4 times ( i dont know why but i always get 1 or 2 faulty parts, but they always extange them for the good stuff) just dont buy games at fry's, as ive seen them jacking up the cost of a game by 20$, they must make up their cash from that rather than hardware(which is cheap)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh and if your a student you can get windows XP pro edition from a hastings store alot cheaper than normal, they have a student discount for OS's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Building your own is the way to go for Cost.<br />
<br />
Buying factory is the way to go for conveniance.<br />
<br />
If you decide to build one www.newegg.com is a great site if you know your parts and do some homework on the vendors.<br />
<br />
Also, a sidenote on fry's.  They have good deals but They DO sell refurbished gear without letting folks know.  They got into a lil trouble awhile ago regarding that.  So buyer beware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnarian</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, what faederya said is partially ture.  Alot of companies like Dell and Gateway are outsourcing more of their customer support based relations overseas to places like Manila and India and so forth.  BUT most of it is still in fact located in the United States.  The company I work for as a local site Telecommunications Engineer and the 2nd in line on Domestic and overseas networking takes a large majority of the Gateway and Dell customer server and technical support calls.  We don't take refrigerator calls or anything of that nature, most of our client base is in the computer support nature.  My company has 7 sites domestically and 1 overseas to handle Gateway and Dell.  From dealing with most computer systems produced today personally, I would suggest Dell over any of them.  It isn't the outsourcer that is causing alot of the CS issues you have now, it's the actual company and the training model, CS source program, and so forth that causes issues.  Dell and Gateway both get their internal parts from most of the same sources, so you actually have the same equipment in both.  The difference in the 2 is the quality of the production line, testing, packing, and SOFTWARE.  Gateway puts so much BS on their systems it's best to reload em when you get them.  Anyway I am rambling, I own 3 Dells they are the best in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Griglon</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A site a friend of mine uses is http://www.monarchcomputer.com<br />
<br />
I built my own computer two years ago and upgraded from this site and had no problems for a decent price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've also used monarch computer in the past, as well as Dell and Gateway systems. My new favorite site is ibuypower.com though. Better prices than monarch, they look hella cool, and you can customize every single aspect of the puter.<br />
<br />
I just ordered a 2nd box from ibuypower, without a monitor, for $1300. I emailed dell, and sent them the specs of the computer I was getting, and asked them how much they could sell it to me for (I didn't tell them how much I was spending at ibuy). You know what their response was? $1750, with 6 months aol free, lol. Ibuypower.com all the way!</div></div><hr />
