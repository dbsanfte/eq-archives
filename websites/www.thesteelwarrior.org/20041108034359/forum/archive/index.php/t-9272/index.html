<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brenin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya folks. Great site here, with some incredible information. I especially liked the abbreviation guide in the Library. Man, does that thing ever make it easier to follow some of the discussions! Some quick questions for you though, if you don't mind: <br />
<br />
First of all, I've always liked the idea of a Dark Elf warrior, but looking at the starting stats, I'm just blown away by all the extra strength and stamina that Ogres get, not to mention the stun immunity. I know everyone says once you get geared up and throw in some AAs, the starting stats won't matter much anymore, but is that really true, and even if it is, how painful is the road from here to there going to be if I go with my roleplaying preference instead of the min/max approach? Also, should I go agnostic, or is the cultural/imbued gear worth the extra faction issues?<br />
<br />
Second, I always assumed that Stamina was the end-all-be-all stat for warriors, but in some of the discussions here and especially on the EQLive boards, I see people talking about a somewhat more balanced approach with at least a nod to Dex, Agi and Str. Also, I even saw some mention of Charisma if you plan on raiding at the high end down the road! Was that just someone pulling a newbie's leg, or is there actually truth to that?<br />
<br />
Lastly, I have about 20k to spend on gear, but I'll be blowing through levels 1-50 pretty quickly to catch up with some friends, so I'm thinking I'll use 3-5k for the twink stuff and save the rest for when I get near lvl 50. Does that sound reasonable? If so, any suggestions for both the twink gear I should get now and the early-50s gear I should keep my eyes open for? Also, any particular items that that I could use now but that would still be useful in my 50s? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any answers or just general advice y'all might have!<br />

I'll answer part of the question :p  I'm a dark elf warrioress and have also been into the lore behind the drow and the like.  When I began this character I had no intention of becoming &quot;an uber&quot; but I enjoyed the character so thoroughly that throughout her career shes advanced quite a bit.  The great thing about dark elf warriors is there are so few of them.  Plenty of Ogres out there with illusion wood elf masks etc. and the occasional guise of the deceiver, but not true dark elf warriors.  You get noticed for that particular reason, especially by those who follow in your path (lower level players generally asking questions like this!).  <br />
Anyhow, back when I never had max'd stats (which was WAY longer than I have had max stats probably) I never noticed much difference between myself and an Ogre tank, mainly because the only places I needed the extra HPs that an Ogre would have in stamina above me I could grab a shaman buff and equal.  Gradually you close the gap and items make this issue obsolete. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps with part of that question- I dont know much about twink gear nowadays but Human / Elf (wood elfs , half elves , dark elves etc.) warriors are generally seen in greater density in the higher tier guilds.  I kind of have a philosophy about this because when I created the dark elf, I knew that I would not be superior to a large race on a raid (actually I didnt even think about raids at this time in game) but I just didnt care to much, eventually my will to advance my character made me a formidable tank and rival to most large races in the guild, and today I can say that I see nothing detrimental in my choice. :)  Check the magelo if you wanna see my background pic of my dark elf that I cut out and photoshopped into a poor attempt at showing my dark-elfness with a little tune. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First of all, I've always liked the idea of a Dark Elf warrior, but looking at the starting stats, I'm just blown away by all the extra strength and stamina that Ogres get, not to mention the stun immunity.

<br />
Race really doesn't matter.  Nowadays, with 304 stamina and plenty of the rest to go around, I don't need the barbarian.  I wish I was a dark elf honestly, because I'd look cooler.  You can get to my point in the game basically solo too, so it's definitely not out of reach by any means.<br />
<br />
If you're going to make a character, just make sure he's Rallos Zek.  Some people are going to disagree and tell you that diety doesn't matter either, but they're full of crap.  You won't find a better piece of gear for the price than Fierce Heraldic, so you might as well use it.  It's also not rare like some of the other diety armors like Helanic Tundra and the Ogre stuff.<br />
<br />
Second, I always assumed that Stamina was the end-all-be-all stat for warriors, but in some of the discussions here and especially on the EQLive boards, I see people talking about a somewhat more balanced approach with at least a nod to Dex, Agi and Str.

<br />
95% of all warriorrs will never need charisma.  It's useful for the very top of the very top.  Even at the stage of the game I'm at, I could never see burning the 2 emeralds for Divine Intervention on a regular basis.  If you needed charisma, you'd know by now (IE : You'd already have your time+ guild lined up and just ready for you to roll up your toon so they can tag you, flag you and PL you).<br />
<br />
For everyone else, make stamina your primary concern.  Some hippies are gonna try to tell you that all stats count because of your endurance pool, but that's a load of crap.  For levels 1-50, you're not gonna be able to use the endurance fast enough anyway, and by 50, you should be getting close to the stamina cap anyway.  Worry about AC, HP and Stamina first, everything else after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">brenin,<br />
your right that there are good things about being an ogre.  im an ogre and love my race but i can tell you, shrinking is a pita.  even with a cobalt bracer, everytime u die its dig out bracer, swop it in, target, click click click. repeat ad nauseam.  and you will find its not just a requirement for raids but even for experience groups i find myself shrinking, especially where there are corners.<br />
<br />
DEs are cool, rare too.  but in my opinion if your  not going to go with ogre  and the non-stunnable route, then id go gnome just for not having to shrink, they look damn cool and theres cool gnome only stuff to get. stats will all level out at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
regarding gear, because of continual upgrades you will be making from the 40-65 route i think what you suggested sounds reasonable. ive always believed its better to pick up some good items than a lot of trash thats just going to get upgraded.  dont forget to get a decent set of weapons too. <br />
<br />
for the 50s, i would aim at either deity armour, ornate if your rich. theres also lots of nice magnetized crafted armour coming out of OoW.  theres countless choice for non-visible slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Brenin,<br />
Haass is correct concerning diety options, the role of charisma, STA, and race.<br />
If you like the look of a dark elk, roll 'em up. Celestias's comments in this regard are also good.<br />
I'd stress the diety armor factor, particularly given that you plan to get to 50 fairly quickly and seem to have the means to do so. Rallos Z is probably the best choice, primarily because that cultural armor is as good as it gets as a cultural set, and because sets that are more or less equivalent, such as Tribunal, are less often made by smiths.<br />
With PoK [Plane of Knowledge] vendors and the bazaar you just don't have to worry much about faction to deal with everyday bank/gear/travel issues.<br />
I think your idea of spending 3-5K early and saving the rest is reasonable. You can get individual pieces of armor from the crafted, crustacean, or LDoN sets (Gothic, Frosted) for around 100-200 pp each and they will easily carry you to 40ish; you can start looking at the cultural armor and get a feel for the prices on your server and pick up pieces of it that are good deals as you go.<br />
I haven't leveled a warrior since level restrictions were imposed on weapons, so I'm not able to give the best advice on which weapons will be best for a low-level warrior. I believe that the centi weapons (short sword, long sword, hammer) do not have level restrictions, and would be fine for you to start out with. There are slightly better weapons that cost more, but those are quite usable. If you don't know what level restrictions are or how to tell how they affect a piece of gear that you are loooking at, find out from your friends before you buy stuff, heh).<br />
At level 50, if you are substantially in cultural armor and have a copper hammer of striking and sword of the bloodsworn (CHoS and SotBS around here) you'll be better geared than most warriors, and it will be gear that can carry you to 65 (and basically until you are able to fight mobs that drop better stuff). <br />
One thing that you'll need to think about is that although 20K is a great leg up, it's not enough to outfit yourself at level 50. Save your plat as you level, and keep an eye out for good deals. Also keep in mind that eventually you will want some form of haste, which can be got from worn items, augments and/or tribute (casters will also cast haste on you, but in addition you want worn haste through your gear or, later in your career, tribute).<br />
Warriors basically do one thing better than any other class in the game: absorb/otherwise deal with damage from mobs. That's your funtion as main tank, and it's the primary reason groups and raids want warriors: you get the mob to beat on you and you alone while your group/raid kills it. When Haass says AC, hps and STA are the important things to focus on, that's why: all of them directly relate to improving your ability to perform your primary role in a group or a raid. To do your job, you have to generate aggro--that is, be the character that the mob wants most to kill. That's why on this board you see so much discussion about aggro-generation: if the mob ain't hitting you, you can't be doing your job as main tank.<br />
<br />
Ask questions here if you need help with anything. this is a great site and some of the folks here know a tremendous amount about the game and the warrior class.<br />
<br />
I'd also suggest that you not spend all of your time pre-level 50 getting powerleveled. Do hunt in groups before then so that you learn how to play a warrior in a group before you get to level 50. Try to hunt in indoor and outdoor zones so that you are comfortable in either type of zone.<br />
<br />
Help your friends whenever you can. To progress as a warrior, you will need the help of your friends, so return the favor cheerfully.<br />
<br />
Finally, you are a warrior, so never whine; it's shameful. Bitching, of course, is different matter entirely.</div></div><hr />

1) If you like the idea of being a DE then play one.That idea is probably worth more fun than any racial advantage.Min/maxing ogre/troll/barb is only important if a hp advantage in the early part of the raid game in a guild is important to you competitively speaking.Post velious that advantage rapidly dissapates to nothing as you aqquire gear that caps your stats first buffed then eventually unbuffed.RZ/Tribunal armor is nice and will give you an advantage awhile.Faction issues don't really matter at all.Other racial advantage's are neat ,but,really matter little in the course of the game these days.The racial hp advantage's due to high stam can make a differance sometimes on your slot in the tanking order early on during raids,but,that advantage fades fast with gear these days.I'm a Barb and have been MT since pop ST before that.What you do with your warrior is far more important than what race he is.<br />
<br />
2) I'd say stamina.Doesn't matter much though gear &gt; starting stats.With a bard and a shammy buff DI has usually fired for me np since the clerics got it.Stamina will give you a hp advantage before you are capped with buffs.Having high charisma is important to DI imo,but,on a raid buffs/bard song are normally available.<br />
<br />
3) Haste first imo though levels can impact the efficiency.Troll forged yaks and frostbringers are probably good.Cultural armor especially rz/tribunal is a good investment when you've got some levels on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FlexoMuscolo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some advice from a fellow tank ..<br />
<br />
Race - It's EQ .. play the race you think is cool .. don't worry about stats cuz if you enjoy playing .. you'll eventually progress to the point where your gear will make up for any lack in starting stats.<br />
<br />
Diety - I would suggest picking one simply because you'll probably be able to pick up some cultural gear cheap at this stage in the game.<br />
<br />
Gear - If you wanna lvl fast you'll need a decent weapon, haste, and mad regen OR if you can 2 box start up a shaman to assist you in your lvling.<br />
<br />
EQ is about enjoying an alternative world for you and your toon where you can make friends and have fun.<br />
<br />
Best of luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Riggor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey there, I would say to go with an Ogre. Ralloz zek diety, troll/ogre get a different Ralloz zek culture armor that sells for alot less then Fierce heraldic. Money wise, I would say thats the best choice, but choose whatever you like the most. Looks are a big part of the game, and thats why i'm a Barbarian. Ladies just can't say no to a man in a kilt :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Suporma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I started in Oct. 99, I chose a Half-elf Warrior who worships Mithaniel Marr.<br />
<br />
I chose Half-elf because I thought they looked good, and I wanted to play a righteous character. I chose Warrior because I didn't want to be a hybrid class, and the alternatives based on my race didn't look as good to me. I chose Mithaniel Marr because after reading all the religions ( I could be any religion I wanted) it sounded the most like how I wanted to play the game. <br />
<br />
Five years later, I'm still playing this game, and I still have no alts. I didn't really know much about the game, and I didn't take a long time, nor did I put heavy thought into my character creation. I didn't even invest my starting stats correctly, but hey, it was good enough.<br />
<br />
In fact, about a year later, I moved Suporma over to a new account, and since they didn't have the same services they do today, I simply gave him all my old gear (it was all droppable back then) after I deleted the old Suporma and created the new one. I was only level 23 when I changed accounts, but that was fairly decent back in the day too  :p<br />
<br />
When I moved him, however, I intentionally made the same mistakes in starting stats because I was so attached that I didn't want to change him.<br />
<br />
To this day, the only thing I would have changed at any point is my religion. There was a time when I really, really could have used that Rallos Zek gear. However, since that period is over, and have better than Rallos Zek gear, I'm happy that Suporma worships Mithaniel Marr. My starting city is Freeport, and I still enjoy killing the militia for fun and roleplay purposes  :) It's always nice when the people who know the score would cheer me on, over the years, as I soloed the corrupt guards.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I have killed my God a couple times... but in all fairness he was KoS to me and I had to kill him for Planar Progression and I never tanked him!<br />
<br />
Why was my God KoS to me! WHY!?!?! Stupid PoP plotline  :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, I guess my point is this: Pick whatever class/race/diety that will allow you to have the most pride in yourself as a player. Don't let anyone tell you how to have your fun in EQ. <br />
<br />
The advice given in this thread, however, is very good. If you're undecided, or don't care, Rallos Zek is the way to go. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably play a Dark Elf Warrior simply because I could get an Worker Sledgemallet eaisily. You NEED to get that before you hurt your faction, look into it! I love my hammer, but I got it back when puppet strings were rechargable!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you don't know what religion to be, choose Rallos Zek.  If you have your heart set on something else then by all means go for it.  Always play what you enjoy, but if you don't care greatly one way or the other choose Rallos Zek.  It sounds like you DO want to play a dark elf, so go ahead and do so.<br />
<br />
Assuming you choose to follow Rallos Zek, look around for a Troll GM smith on your server and try to get a pair of Vengeful Honed Blade of the Ykesha - for some reason, Sony forgot to tag them Rec:45, so enjoy your 12/22s at level 1.  As an added bonus, they proc two levels sooner than a regular Ykesha, making 35 &amp; 36 Warriors ecstatic.<br />
<br />
When buying Fierce Heraldic gear, concentrate on the non-visible slots first.  There's a reason so many 65+ warriors are still wearing Fierce Heraldic Visors, Pauldrons, &amp; Cloaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mbahansen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I gave up on caring about starting stats along time ago.  I play an Ogre Shammy and a Barb Warrior (2 box) so stats are always maxed easily.  I do make alt's on a regular basis since the Shammy can PL very well so now I usually pick a race I like and make the important stats even.  Meele always even STR, STA, DEX, AGI as close to the same as possible then let Shammy do the rest.  Play what you like.<br />
<br />
Alot of people have spent alot of time figuring out how to make the best possilbe toon, but the truth is that matters most only at the start of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have played a Wood Elf warrior for 4+ years now.  The only regret I have ever had in his initial rolling was when they put out cultural armor.  I'm agnostic, and the racial armor for elves sucks.  For a while I really had wished I could wear that RZ armor.<br />
<br />
Dex/Agi/Cha are worth concerning yourself with a little.  However, with your starting stats as a DE you should be fine on dex/agi.  Cha is only usefull for raiding, and even then I have DI fire quite regularly with just a shaman buff on.  Other than that, cha is just usefull for buying/selling, and you can get two steins for that in the bazaar for next to nothing (Opal Encrusted?).<br />
<br />
Starting stats are almost irelevant.  The only advantage Ogres have over any other race today is stun resistance, and with some AAs you can overcome that as well.  Pick the race that you would enjoy, don't let anyone tell you any different.<br />
<br />
As far as twinking goes......Find yourself a decent haste item and a pretty good set of weps to start out.  Make sure to get at least one item from each skill set to keep that skill up.  1hs/2hs/1hb/2hb/pierce  You don't need a good one from each area, but at least decent ones to keep your skills up.  You never know when you're gonna come across a really good item, so you wanna have the skill up as you go instead of spending forever trying to raise 2hb on blue mobs.<br />
<br />
Dunno about prices, but I would find a good haste item, a few good weps, and as much RZ armor as you can afford.</div></div><hr />

Not horrible, but not the worst i could have done...i havent had many sta problems, i tanked ssra with shammy heals for 2 1/2 hours last night...IMO picking a race is all a matter of personal opinion.

I have to admit, after all my hemming and hawing about being a DE, I'm starting to warm up to the idea of an ogre. I think the problem is that I had the new models turned off, and I just couldn't get into the roleplaying aspects of the dumb and cuddly old models. Once I turned the new Ogre models on, though, boy! That's quite the improvement. Now they look like real bad***es and the EQII lore is apparently based on the aftermath of an Ogre invasion.... I don't know. I may go that route after all.  :rolleyes: Anyway,  I'll be rolling up in a couple of days (once I finish all my research), so I'll let you know how things turn out. Thanks again!<br />
