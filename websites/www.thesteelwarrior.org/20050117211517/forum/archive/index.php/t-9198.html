<br />
Just my opinion though, give it a shot and see what happens, worst ya have to do is fail or rez :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curdlex</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the failures are due to time not wipes.  A magician is ideal for these IMO because some of the mobs are summoned.  Mages can mezz some of the summoned  (Rock guys) and have higher nukes as well as pet mez.  I would think more along the lines dps because the timer is so short.  Also remember if mobs are mezzed, you will probablt not have enough time to taunt before you break mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could probably keep the warrior alive without much trouble, the mobs are roughly the same as the basement mobs I think. Just pile on the ds's, and make sure everybody fights the same mob since the  timer resets after each kill. Put your group in the far corner before each spawn so the warrior gets all the initial aggro, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tooby</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did it at about that amount of hp, less ac (but level 58) admittedly the rest of the group was 65 and well geared, but my weakness didnt really make too much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get some more levels first.  Who cares if you're L54 and have the pov/pos flag?  You can zone in there at 55 and can't really tank anything there for awhile yet anyway.<br />
<br />
If you must get through the trial now, take 5 friends who can beat it without a 6th.  That's how we planned trials way back if someone needed it.  We labeled that person &quot;baggage&quot; and got 5 people who could beat it assuming zero contribution from the baggage. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The group you describe doesn't have enough DPS to win the execution trial. <br />
<br />
As other posters noted, your hitpoints won't be the issue; you'll fail because the timer will elapse before you whack a mob. Mages and Druids are awesome for this trial because of their ability to banish summoned (the rock mobs). If you have one or more of those classes with you, make sure they do NOT banish the mob you're beating on. If they banish an unengaged mob, you've gained an extra 30 seconds to kill the target you've been already working on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That group won't have sufficient dps.  Throw in a 65 wizard or mage or rogue or bst and you'd be set.<br />
<br />
As for tanking it, it would be very rough for you.  I tanked trials at level 59 with about the same amount of hp's, but higher AC, and it was rough going especially against the end boss.  I came really really close to dying on more than one occasion.  My cleric was only level 60 though, but she rocked, also had a 65 shaman backing her up which it looks like you'll also have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbahansen</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done the trials many times and I hate doing them as a Warrior.  I can tank them fine, but if the rest of the group is not up to the DPS then you will fail.  Alot of people just don't understand the Warriors are about being hit, not major DPS.<br />
<br />
If a cleric trys using CH during the early part of the wave they are toast.  If you have some bozo try to kite one you are toast.  If casters are using DOT spells you are toast.  Slow is pointless because you should have a good DS on.<br />
<br />
I have been through these when they were cake and I have failed on many it is all about who is standing behind you that determine pass or fail.  I have never heard someone say it was the warriors fault we failed.<br />
<br />
I have done enough of them that now I put my own groups together if someone needs a flag in the guild rather then just take who comes.  They are easy if they are done right.<br />
<br />
PS:  If you are going to banish a mob damage it first or it will not reset the timer.</div></div><hr />

I didn't know that! Are you sure?<br />
I'm not disputing you, just intensely curious, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bustauff</div><div class="date">10-02-2004, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have taken many many many groups through the PoJ EXE trial. Will tell you this, if you really think you need to do this at lvl 54, get a 65 Cleric, 65 Chanter, 3 65 Mage/Wizzy/Druid. AE is the way to go. I have done the all melee groups also. If you want a melee heavy group, get 3 65 Rangers/Rogues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I did them, it was my job to call the target and then when it died, immediately get people on another target.  So if I'd been dumb and slow, we could have failed while people waited for me to get on the next mob.  <br />
<br />
That's about all a warrior does... that and pop defensive for the executioner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, time is of the essence in executioner trial.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen people fail simply because they were not able to switch to a new mob after the previous one died.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is written all over if you look up the encounter on some other pages.  if you do engage it first the game credits you with the kill when you banish.  If you just Banish then you will not get credit for it and the timer will continue to count down.</div></div><hr />

F8 gets you your next mob pronto.  I also pop AE taunt on the first wave and they usually stay close to me throughout the fight.  This also gives the other guys a chance to calm down.</div></div><hr />
