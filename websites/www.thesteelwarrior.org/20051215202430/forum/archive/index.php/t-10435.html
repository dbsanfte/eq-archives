Basically my question is this... do the majority of these instances require raid forces? Or are they still feasible with a 5-man group. The little bit of information I can glean from various posts seems to suggest most just raid the instances.... which would make me sad. I'm not a big fan of the zerg.

lbrs/strath/scholo is doable with 5, ubrs requires 10-15ish probably.  Most people are raiding lbrs/strath/scholo because there's an assload of trash and it's pretty damn boring to do with 5 -- not to mention lots of gear rots if you dont have the correct classes there for when the item drops.<br />

I used to be adamantly against raiding the singlegroup dungeons, but after having doing lbrs with 5, it's a totally tedious notdifficult zone with way too much trash to do with 5 without wanting to shoot yourself in the head repeatedly.  The only upside to doing it with 5 is that most quests are theoretically not completable in a raids -- though people have been pseudo-sploiting around that limitation too.</div></div><hr />

From what I understand, the only one that really &quot;requires&quot; small raid forces is upper blackrock spires (2-3 groups.)<br />
<br />
The other ones have a ton of quests that require 1 grouping, although I've heard of plenty of people raiding them.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, UBRS can be ten manned probably, the rest is one group content other than MC.</div></div><hr />
