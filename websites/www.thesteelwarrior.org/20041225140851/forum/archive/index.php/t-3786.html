If you go there you will see two pictures called HateList1 and HateList2 (kinda towards the end). <br />
<br />
If you read those you will see that my Warrior clearly had agro, and the mob was beating on him but when the Mob went to cast spells it turned to the Chanter (chanter did the pull, tash and slow), cast on the chanter then went back to beating on the warrior...... <br />
<br />
I think this indicates there must be two seperate hate lists or something.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pictures appear to be out of context; ie I don't see Samlancer's hit for 145 in picture 1 on picture 2's chat.  Also, the resisted spells being cast in both pictures are fear spells; it may be that the mob is using ae fear, i.e. the cleric spell &quot;wave of fear&quot;.<br />
<br />
It would be helpful for you to post a log file if possible instead of two seperate screen shots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both SS are by the Chanter. <br />
<br />
They are entirely seperate encounters, just to show how repeatable this is.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill log some but it seems clear enough. The mob is hitting the warrior, then casts on the chanter (chanter doing nothing), then goes back to beating on the warrior. It appears that there must be a second list..... <br />
<br />
<br />
It seems to be a single target fear spell, the times it landed the chanter would just run, none others have been effected. Also the mob does cast other spells (bloodboil or something) at the worrior, just the fear spell at the chanter.... <br />
<br />
Why does the mob turn to face the chanter if its AOE? Oh and the warrior didnt get the &quot;you resisted the ...&quot; thing, but ya I guess logs are better I log both the warrior and chanter...<br />
<br />
<br />
The mob is SK</div></div><hr />

Has the mob been rooted?  Proximity controls mob mellee if it's rooted, but wouldnt stop it from casting on who's really on top of it's hate list.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">couple times while i'm tanking in BoT and a caster is pulled, it looks like i lose agro for a few seconds while the caster turn to cast on some one else. that's happened for as long as i can remember.</div></div><hr />

Mobs have learned to Multitask ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup this has been around easily for the last 3 yrs plus.  Pull with higher toon, engage with lower toon.  Casts go to the puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes the chanter (level 65) did do the pulling, and the warrior is level 63. The chanter tashed and slowed so was on top of hate list for awhile until the warrior got agro lock. <br />
<br />
Well dosnt that mean there must be two lists of some kind.... <br />
<br />
And now we have something where there is a level dependancy as to hate....., assuming this all occured because the higher level pulled.<br />
<br />
I have logs now but as no one disputes it occures I'll only post them if someone asks.<br />
<br />
Also not ALL casts go to the higher level puller just the fear spell, the Blood spell always goes to the warrior AND even if the high level puller is in mellee range the mob will cast the spell and not hit the puller.<br />
<br />
So what do we conclude from this......  Seperate lists for distance spells and for mellee/short range spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could be as simple as having one &quot;list&quot;, but one check uses highest value in the list, the other check using the order of the list.  i.e. something akin to (but obviously entirely different in detail than) this:<br />
player:hate<br />
toon1:2511<br />
toon2:4673<br />
toon3:7596<br />
<br />
Toon3 would (all other things being equal) get melee attacks or DDs/dots (i.e. has highest &quot;hate&quot;), but toon1 might get targeted for debuffs, etc (i.e. first on list).  Same list, different checks, kinda like rampage.  Nothing I've observered conflicts with one list being used, it's just that people (myself included in the past) seem to assume it's a SORTED list, which isn't necessarily true at all... and from a coding perspective almost certainly isn't.<br />

<br />
the hate list sets your threat lvl. mobs with ranged atacks will attempt to remove all threats. if your a threat but not close you get casted on.<br />
<br />
hope that made sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever since the NPC spell casting revamp last year, mobs have been doing this kind of thing.  Any kind of &quot;crowd control&quot; spell that the mob uses is typically cast upon someone who is NOT at the top of hate list.  It doesn't mean you've lost aggro - in fact if you assist the mob you'll still get your warrior on target, even though the mob is temporarily casting on someone else.  Bottom line: mobs like to root/snare/slow/dispel/debuff people who are lower on the hate list.  Anyone who has spent much time in BOT, Tactics, Droga, Sebilis, Dalnir, etc. in the past year should be familiar with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK its always been the case that enchanter mobs will tash the entire group, etc.<br />
<br />
If I had to make a guess at it I would say that when a mob decides to cast it does a /random for every person on the hate list and then does a check if its a spell with lasting effects to make sure its not already on there.<br />
<br />
That way mobs wouldnt chain tash the same person or put the same dot on the same person before it wears off etc, and so they would mez people (hopefully healers?) etc so the mobs can at least feel like they have some sort of strategy themselves.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with a second hate list though.<br />
