<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">wtf is up with making mounts targetable. Was bad enough when my clerics mounts trying to bite me after AE tuant. Target closes npc button always returns monts now....  Its gay. Also did I meantion they all look like humans with awfull luclin models turned off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hm. That's odd. I dont see anything with Luclin models off, just the person using a horse walks real slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hanover Fiste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you saw the humans too?!?  thank god...i thought i was just really high....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And let me tell you, it's disturbing seeing your big manly barbarian guildmate with some human dude in tight leather named Xxxx's Mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ROFL i have yet to see that and i 'am eternally thankful for this small gift!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I see it too human models named XX's mount. only happened after last patch. rather annoying too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah it is annoying as fek. F8 is useless for me when I see 5 other mounts there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL I am so glad I havent seen this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">horse mounts show up as human males, naked for the cheap ones, chain / plate for more expensive ones.<br />
<br />
drogmor mounts show up as human females, also naked for cheap, chain / plate for more expensive.<br />
<br />
I have to say though, seeing a pally with holy steed, having a male human mount is enough to make me laugh :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If anyone finds a way to get rid of these, please share the sekrit. Nothing like having the chanter/shm die because you couldn't target properly due to their mounts! (not that it has happened to me... I swear!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, I personally don't see the mounts as humans (the ones I've seen were from screenshots).  I see normal mounts on people whose race I have new models for, and no mounts on models I don't have turned on.  The only reason I can think of that it is this way for me, is that I have horses and elementals turned on, and am I assuming properly that you all who see them don't?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cyphon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here's a shot of that :-/<br />
<br />
but funny thing is human wasnt there before the last patch...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the main gripe is they are targetable....<br />
do people who see them as horses able to target them as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I attack them to get a fresh avatar and rune 3 up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">not targetable as horses, I think this is just a temporary bug, should be fixed next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">AE taunted my guildmate's drogmar in PoSky the other day. After he died it attacked me. I gave it a couple warnings, then I told him it was going down, and proceeded to lay it's azz out cold. Too bad the corpse poof's on death, woulda been a great screenshot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The only new models I have on are male barbarians and horses/elementals. I dont see human mounts, nor do I get mount's in target window. I gotta turn Vah Shir back on though, because they are all naked without the new model on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ok I'll turn on horses/elementals asap that shit sucked</div></div><hr />
