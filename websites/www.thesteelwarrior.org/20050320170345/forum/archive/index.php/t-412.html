<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuendal</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiho my brother and sister warriors, <br />
<br />
been reading these boards for a few months now, but this is my first time to actually post.  <br />
<br />
Last night we tried to get the High Priest in Ssra, but we had issues keeping the mobs cleared long enough to move in and engage the HP.  I would appreciate any suggestions that you all could toss my way that would shed some light on the best way to get into the HP room and engage him.<br />
<br />
Just to let you know what we tried.<br />
<br />
We pulled the large room just before the HP room with the golems and killed them off, then pulled all the mobs from the HP room and had chanters/bards charm the Zel's and then killed the rest of the mobs.  We waited about 5 or 10 minutes to make sure of the spawn times of mobs (I think this might have hurt us).  By the time we started to move into the HP room, the room prior to the HP was respawning and we got caught there with respawn and by the time we actually got into the HP room the priests were in full respawn.  At that point we lost a few of our clerics and a couple of the tanks on the raid to the respawn.  We weren't able to continue after that due to loosing the only rogue on the raid.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be most appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did this on our first kill, in retrospect its a horrible plan though.<br />
<br />
Anyone on your HP side of the raid gets low hp, the adds from the prep room will charge through to HP socialing all the golems with them to get to the low hp person.<br />
<br />
Just clear golems, clear/mez HP room in 1 big pull, then charge in and kill HP.  Have mezzers pull mezzed mobs into HP room and keep them mezzed along the wall out of AE range.  Tank mez HP when needed, kill adds, then jump back on HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a horrible plan that has never failed for us.<br />
<br />
Some eq pioneers may have had it rougher though so your milage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roehm</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That used to be a top secret strat once upon a time.<br />
<br />
And it never, ever, ever failed us.<br />
<br />
Ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mesmerize the Zels<br />
banish the disciples<br />
tank mez the priests away from the HP so they don't heal him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Similar tactic to those posted above.<br />
<br />
Clear the room before HP<br />
Use a rogue with SoS to pre-select targets for people<br />
Have a DA person drag the entire HP room (12 mobs) into the jail/prep area.<br />
Enchanters mez the 4Zel mobs<br />
Offtanks handle the 4 priests, we normally choose to drag the priests back into the HP room to avoid them dispelling mez off the Zels.<br />
The disciples can be banished by Banishment of shadows, but if you have necros they are charmable and make decent pets against HP.<br />
<br />
From there its a simple MT/Chain to keep a tank alive, make sure to set rampage and have adequate healing.  Not uncommon for HP to rampage a good deal before cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The strat posted is sound. Zels mezzed, Priests offtanked, bannish Disciples.<br />
<br />
The key is to not damage the priests till you are ready to kill them, after the HP is dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galuvian</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Priests = tank mez (clerics, will summon, heal, *dispels other mobs*)<br />
Zels = mezzable<br />
Disciples = cleric/necro banish, or charm<br />
<br />
DA pull the entire HP room back to the jail.  If your puller is a bard, they can hit Fading Memories as mobs just start coming into the jail, this will split the room into 2 pulls.  <br />
<br />
Get the priests tank mezed, kill everything else.  2 knights, a druid, and a shaman should be able to hold down the 4 mobs once things settle down.<br />
<br />
Charge the HP room, have chanters ready to mez the zels as they respawn.  Make sure they are ready for the HP to dispel mezzes...<br />
<br />
Have necros ready to banish the disciples as they respawn.  The raid should break off from the HP and kill the disciples if you don't have enough necros.  Charm is bad here, the HP will dispel it and the disciple eats the necro.<br />
<br />
An additional option is to have a couple chanters mez the Zels in the jail.  This needs to be done carefully or the priests will just keep dispelling the mezzes.  We prefer to have the chanters come into the HP room so they can contribute to the HP fight as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cydrenlin</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need to clean the golems in the room before HP. You just need to kill the 2 chapel guards. The golems won't aggro if you stay in the middle.<br />
<br />
After that, pretarget and pull the whole room and split / mez/banish-kill as explained above.<br />
<br />
Then send MT alone in HP room, ask him to go on the other side of the room and aggro HP with some arrows or some aggro spells so he turns around and use his AE stun on him. <br />
Then move the raid in HP room and kill HP.</div></div><hr />

How long did it take you to move from jail to HP room with at least 2 traps between them?</div></div><hr />
