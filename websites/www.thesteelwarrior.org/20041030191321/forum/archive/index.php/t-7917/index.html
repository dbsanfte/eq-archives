<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The last few times I was in a group, there hasn't been a shammy there for major buffing.  My dex hasnt really been capped as much and I primarily wield a Copper Hammer of Striking.  Lately Ive been using the blue epic blade in my off hand and I seem to do better.<br />
<br />
The sword of the bloodsworn offhanded doesnt proc much and the extra dex and +attack of the blue blade made that a more viable option.  Ive put away my gsot due to the high aggro from the copper hammer.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone use the blue blade anymore?  Ive subed in the sword of bloodsworn, red epic, but lately Ive prefered just using the blue blade.  There isnt a proc but the extra dex and attack allow my copper hammer to hit a bit harder and proc more.  <br />
<br />
I havent seen anyone wielding the blue blade actually.  Am I the only one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">probably yes.<br />
because has you said yourself the blue epic his not an aggro weapon. and to repaet again what you said, yes when our stat are low it's hader to hold aggr and thus all the way get them better are good. <br />
it get the same result as your blue epic, try to get a primal wepon (now it's ancient primastic  I think) it will bump up even more your dex, str and atk. moreover their've got better ratio and the proc hold three time longer, ollawing you to switch of wepon after the first avatar proc.<br />
<br />
You will love it for sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i used both of mine for tradskilling. why? not really sure. some little bird told me +dex is good for combines. besides that; eh; they look good in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dex is good for archery only, Shikarii. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it's also good for fletching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Doh! Thanks Iskandar. <br />
<br />
Archery, fletching. ToMAYto, toMAHto ...<br />

<br />
(No, Lathen.. they are NOT the same.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">they should make it usefull for tayloring<br />
(danm I hate this too small hole in neddles when I have to sew a falling button of my shirt)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">great !! <br />
<br />
I only need to remove my &quot;parkinson effect&quot; when I try to consentrate on minucious work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well, only GM tradeskill I had was fletching so i'm glad i was half right :D rest were averaged at ~ zero</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I keep my blues banked and use my reds for decor.<br />
<br />
For me, the added dex of the blue pales in comparison of having an aggro weapon off hand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since I'm not at the atk cap, I swap blueblade in for ranged fights. If you're gonna be firing arrows, doesn't matter what melee weapons you have, and the extra attack can't hurt.<br />
<br />
Course, if your a warrior and doing ranged DPS, it's not exactly gonna make or break the raid if you have that extra bit of attack...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Best use of epics:  Going AFK in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">from what i understand of parses done by shams, the added dex from blue sabers is  really going to be hardly noticeable as far as proc rates are concerned.</div></div><hr />
