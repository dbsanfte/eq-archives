<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, warriors don't solo too well (like farming for cash) and yes, if you want a twink, armor can get pricey. You can do it the old fashioned way though and do armor quests and save for weapons a bit at a time. Druids (I think) have greater opportunities to make cash sooner farming stuff as they can solo more easily.</div></div><hr />

Stats and skills?<br />
<br />
wrong forum there, i like saying that  :D <br />
<br />
<br />
depends....<br />
<br />
depends on if you want to be in the front of things tanking bleeding dying, tryin to hold agro and we are very very gear dependent and group dependent so you have to be social for this class and run everywhere<br />
<br />
or...<br />
<br />
do you want to sit on your butt medding doing root rots, snaring, soloing, porting, able to go wherever you want, more soloing class so you are not really group dependent and you can really exp where you want and camp whatcha want<br />
<br />
<br />
so depends on what you are looking for<br />
<br />
druids and warriors are a dime a dozen but its your skills that set you apart from them</div></div><hr />
