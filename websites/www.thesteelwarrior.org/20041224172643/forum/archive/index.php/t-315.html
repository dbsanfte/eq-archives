<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuronekosama</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, in my sig is my magelo link like everyone else.  What should I look into upgrading, and with what?  I don't want to just sit and keep saving money up to get the 600k I'd need to get a SoD and BoC or whatever.  With my being 54, is there anything that I can really get as a drop anytime soon?  I so hate exping hehe, but I know that may be the only way for the nodrop stuff.  With my gear where it is, how far will it take me (armor wise)  Also, will the pair of fleshgrinders generate more aggro or would the windblade be better?  If there is more storebought aggro that can be had than the 2 FGs, I can do about 80k per 1hs to spend.  Anyhow, please reply ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your gear is fine.<br />
<br />
Now all you need is levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuronekosama</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ehh but I haaaate levelling - I know my gear is fine for a 54 warrior - I'm a gm smith and I fill orders for lvl 65s for heraldic so I know I'm doing ok.  Ignoring levels though - what should I upgrade next =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh ... hmmmm ... I think what I was trying to say is that TRADABLE gear isn't much of an UPGRADE for you anymore.<br />
<br />
Look at levels so you can start getting the no drop upgrades.<br />
<br />
Some tradable gear that's an upgrade for that magelo:<br />
<br />
1) Helm of Rallos Zek (way too much money, but hey, it's tradable)<br />
<br />
2) Sceptre of Destruction or Blade of Carnage (again, way too much money)<br />
<br />
3) Idol of the Wavecrasher <br />
<br />
4) Heavy Rubicite Girdle<br />
<br />
5) Amygdalan Chain Mask<br />
<br />
6) 9th Ring MQ<br />
<br />
7) Cobalt Greaves (even if they stay in your bag, the utility is there ... but actually they stack up well against the FINE heraldic armor)<br />
<br />
8) An invigorate BP<br />
<br />
9) Anizok's Gauze Press, with collapsible toolkit and some mana batteries<br />
<br />
10) Truncheon of Doom<br />
<br />
11) CAMP stormfeather, get a new mask if Amygdalan Chain Mask doesn't excite, and you don't want to level<br />
<br />
That's pretty much all I can think of.<br />
<br />
Maybe look for resist gear too.<br />
<br />
In any event you can take the gear you're currently in and ding 65 in it and still be rather well off.</div></div><hr />

:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But dude..everyone is different tho, they all need their own special thread.<br />
<br />
You want stuff to upgrade to?  Check out some of the magelos around here.  There's a warrior at every level with top notch gear running around. Figure out who's in your particular ability bracket, look at their gear and get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no one likes to lvl, its nothing but a grind, all the fun is raiding. its simply essential, and lvling is just half of it, need a good 80 or so aas just finish your defensive skills, get busy !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Upgrade your Levels.  Seriously. That will help you more than anything now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah definately level. i know you have better weapons but epics still are good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want us to tell you you've got good gear? You've got good gear. Tradeable, ain't much you can upgrade.. And you won't get the nodrop stuff unless you level.<br />
<br />
So.. If you want to upgrade - level up some.<br />
<br />
So get some levels and put that gear to good use, otherwise you ain't nothin' but a shopwindow clothes dummy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get off your duff and level, that's about the best upgrade you can get at the moment.  Cruising the bazaar will only take you so far. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know what your talking about people, he NEEDS upgrades. I say stay in that bazaar and buy buy buy. We al know real warriors dont fight, they buy and sell.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, that was false. Unless of course you a gnome, elf, human, or halfling warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason the last 1000 haven't said anything new is because people hate these kind of threads.<br />
<br />
When I'm bored maybe I'll make a guide on how to make gear decisions for yourself, including how to search magelo, lucy, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am actually working on such a guide/database perhaps... Me being a guilty to asking what to do about gear etc.. figure I'd contribute and make such a thing...  Of course like it has been said here.. mostly a guide to 'teach how to search' the different profiles.. allakazams lucy etc.. importance of STA hp's and such over AC.. softcaps and all.. anyways.. before I ramble.. figured I'd say I'm working on it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I learned to make my own gear decisions ages ago.<br />
<br />
DPS modals from MB board helps a lot.<br />
<br />
Searching magelo and alla's database helped a lot.<br />
<br />
Asking friends in game helped from time to time.<br />
<br />
And reading these types of threads helped a lot.<br />
<br />
Somewhere along the line I just quit having to ask.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />
