<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yoarik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Perfected Warder is a pretty tough encounter. The mob seems to mem blur itself as a proc. But worse if you back away to let the MT  regain aggro, the freaking Triumvirate of Soil mob summoned me and ... well.... beat me up. Now the Triumvirate of Soil were being kited and the one that killed me was at 99% health. I have been told that  mobs will not summon if you have not hurt them and they are above 96%. Was I misinformed? Are these mobs exceptions to that rule? Also if we kill two of the Triumvirate, will not killing the third prevent three new ones from spawning? Or do they get replaced on a one for one basis?</div></div><hr />

Do over 300damage to the triumvates and they summon, which 99.9% of the time results in a wipe.   Have everyone click off their damage shields before ya kill the last dusty warder, then 3 triumvates rush you - kill 2 of them and root the last one, let everyone get FoM - circles/seasons, have a bard play ae fire/cold  and assign kiters.  Then kill the last triumvate, named mob rushes and either you get A. 3 triumvates with named, or B. named will spawn triumvates. They are snareable, arent mezzable, they do summon if damaged. So have your chanters mez the blue ones that spawn, druids kite the red ones, everyone else focusing on named. <br />
