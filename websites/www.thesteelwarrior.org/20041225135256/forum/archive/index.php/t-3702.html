<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knodis</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From EQLive<br />
<br />
<br />
Our update on October 9th went very well. You can read the details here. <br />
<br />
Here are some things we're working on for the November update: (Please note: my producer is making me tell you that in addition to this list, we'll still be bug fixing and maintaining the live game and that, while we hope to get each of these features in, nothing is certain. But this is what we're working on at the present time.) <br />
<br />
<br />
New LDoN raids will go Live - We be moving the two new raids that were introduced on Stormhammer to the Live servers. These raids will prove an interesting challenge for the best of guilds. <br />
<br />
Another new LDoN raid - We will also be bringing one more new LDoN raid to Stormhammer with our next update. This raid will be created with Elemental capable characters in mind. <br />
<br />
Font changes - Since EverQuest was launched, there has only been one font available. With the next update we plan to introduce the option for players to choose the font for their interface. <br />
<br />
Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted. With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort (something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have targeted much easier. <br />
<br />
Consider - Along the same lines as the proposed improvement to targeting, we want to add a way to distinguish the /con color of your target. We plan an indicator that will be easily distinguished once you have a target (probably someplace in the Target window), that should remove the need to use the /con command. <br />
<br />
Other interface changes - We are also working on some other changes that will help you to organize your information. We plan to add a new text color option for damage shield reports that will allow you to pick what color those messages use. We also want to split the &quot;My Pet Attacks&quot; filter into two separate filters, one for hits and one for misses. <br />
<br />
/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion of combat. We want to add an option that would work much like an instant messenger. Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. Obviously this would be an optional feature. <br />
<br />
Help for new players - New characters will start with a bag. This will give them a little more storage space and the opportunity to learn how storage containers work earlier rather than later. We are also working on removing one of the more tedious &quot;features&quot; of the game, the need to practice Sense Heading. Most folks have that skill mapped to trigger along with one of their movement keys. Not an exciting skill to practice. So we plan to have all characters start with a 200 skill in Sense Heading. This will allow new players to navigate more easily, and will reduce a bit of tedium over the course of gameplay.</div></div><hr />

I just look foward to WoW from this point on. Hell, I even reinstalled Starcraft so I can do somthing.</div></div><hr />

I mean aside from the numerous maps on the net, the map function in game, and locations...Sense heading was really a game breaker. <br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />

<br />
 It is rather sad to see all the relatively innane things being addressed when there are moderate class playability issues to be dealt with.  This rates up there with fixing doors in Freeport.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Help for new players - new players will start with elemental planes armour, epic weapons and the ability to summon one new high level loot item per day until they reach level 10 at which point they can summon two a day and so on.  Should this not prove enough to get rid of the tedium we're thinking of introducing an SOE Home Gamer service for an additional monthly fee of $39.95.  A skilled SOE employee will come to your house and play the game for you so you can avoid having to do all that boring levelling, exploring, grouping..... you know, all the things you should do in order to learn the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How hard is it to put a bag on a new toon, its not even worth mentioning in a patch. Sounds like they are just looking for filler info to make it look like they are doing some work.</div></div><hr />

Oh wait, I remember, I EARNED and SAVED for a backpack......and what did I do when I wanted to travel across Norrath at the Brash level of 15?I made a dangerous solo trip into NK and dodged mobs till I found a druid nice enough to port me.This was way back before spires...when boats were actually a valued mode of transportation etc....and SoW was source of income</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raychael</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay so lets get this sraight here....<br />
<br />
Newbs start with:::: All spells mem'd, all clothes on (this is a little depressing), a bag for phat newbie lewts, the ability to die and come back fully dressed until level 10 (no losing your corpse in the Gfay woods anymore) And your little bit of newbie food doesnt go away for 10 levels:::::<br />
Oooo and lets not forget inate sense heading :p<br />
<br />
For Zek's sake can we dumb it down anymore?!?! Guess what!! For the first 10 levels you don't even have to learn what your inventory is :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget that you spawn right near your trainer upon entering the world for the first time, and your trainer is supposed to give you directions to the newbie zone.<br />
<br />
My first 5 deaths were from wandering up to orc hill because I had no idea where I was supposed to be. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so do we get our sense heading skill increased to 200 aswell?<br />
<br />
I started working on mine after wiping to some mob where the raid leader was yelling (all caps like) at me to stand to the east of the mob and with no sense heading I had no idea which way was east. oops.<br />
<br />
So now its up to like 180ish and I want to max it so I get a cool little arrow on my map instead of a cross, but those last 20 skill points are proving real hard to come by. <br />
<br />
If they arent gonna increase everyone's sense heading then I might just be tempted to say fsck it and re-roll as a lvl1 sense heading maxed warrior, will remember to choose RZ this time too.</div></div><hr />

Dunno if i missed this patch message so if so forgive me, but I was messing around with a ranger i twinked a few months ago.  It was the first alt i had made in about two years.<br />
I was soloing in EC when i got some adds and was high-tailing it to WC.  Just before the zoneline, a lioness stuns me...uhh oh...almost dead. My health is at maybe 3% or so.  Stun wears off...bamm!  I zone.   I look up to my health bar to see how many hp's I made it out with but much to my bewilderment, I am at something like 85% health.  wtf?  I mean WTF?!<br />
<br />
Well, that's strange....<br />
<br />
At any rate, I zone back in to ECand continue soloing.  A few minutes later, I again get an untimely add and beat feet to zone.  You guessed it.  Health shoots back up upon zoning.<br />
<br />
As I leveled up, zoning continued to heal me heal me, albeit less and less, until it finally stopped around level 15 or so.<br />
<br />
Needless to say it disgusted me.  Could SoE make it ANY fucking easier for newbs?  It's so patently obvious why there are so many more morons (when it comes to playing your class or having a fundimental knowledge of game mechanics) of all levels running around than there used to be...not that EQ was ever short of them to begin with.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I had never seen this 'feature' meantioned and thought I'd bring it up for those who were unaware.<br />

<br />
the thing about dumbing down the game. when we first started there where alot of poeple around. so you could ooc where so and so was or go to the newbie zone and ask. now your lucky if you have another person in the zone, and 9 times out of 10 they wont talk to you.  they dumbed down the game since kunark and LoIO.<br />
<br />
they should make a hardcore pre fear server and when you get to lvl 50 you get a free transfer to any server you want and you get a cool &quot;star&quot; infront of your name to mark you as Hardcore or some shit.<br />
<br />
oh well go go railgun.</div></div><hr />

IMO they are destroying that experiance for new players. I remember sitting there befuddled about how to set up my hot keys and such but now they do it for you. I remember having to try and strive not to die because finding your corpse was a bish and then losing it was even worse because trying to follow a bard when you didn't know what the hell /autofollow was made the game a challenge. I don't know how these new players feel about it but I would feel cheated!<br />
<br />
SOE work on what you want but realize that you are destroying the content for these newbs :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can cross many many zones and never get an aggro...got very skilled at it as a warrior with no sow in my young days.<br />
Now I shake my head as I see 65's who charge across zones and get ganked in the process.Its really not that hard to avoid.<br />
<br />
Soon every new player is going to have a infinite cast sow potion until level 20 ....and thats a BAD IDEA ABSOR.DO NOT MENTION IT TO SOE /shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vack</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know the funny thing about this is that they think the game is fair and balanced. Hey us warriors get defensive. So we are the &quot;only&quot; ones who can tank the high end raid encounters. Well thats great but that means a Guild needs 5-6 warriors tops to be truely effective.<br />
<br />
So on the high end we get the screw because in order to compete you have to have at least 80 aa to even be considered a tank nowadays. And the guild really doesnt need you. And since the Guild really doesnt need you well I guess you can XP right? Well gosh no. Why take a warrior if a Pally or SK are available. They control aggro so much better.<br />
<br />
I loved playing my warrior till 60. I think up to that point it was very balanced between the melees. After 60 the warrior goes WAY down in potential. What do we get post 60? Nothing. What do Pallys and SK's get? Awesome spell upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">--SONY PLEASE READ--<br />
<br />
I figure I spent as much time increasing sense heading as it would take me to group for about 40 AA points.  So, that being the case, I would like 40 AA points the day you give newbies 200 sense heading for free to compensate me for my time.  This would be just 1 AA per level that I spent mashing the sense heading button approximately 100 thousand times.<br />
<br />
I also have 8 bags that I was able, against all odds, to procure on my own.  I would like an aditional 5 AA per bag when I log on to compensate me for the time you made me waste doing this.<br />
<br />
While we are making it easier for newbies, how about making newbies start out with 200 swimming, 250 in all trade skills, and a bank balance of 200k plat in order to make their transition easier and to spare them all of the mental anguish that being a newbie is sure to inflict on them.  I also think advanced (anyone above level 10) players should be appropriately reimbursed for their swimming and trade skill work as well at a rate of 5 AA per level of swimming and 1k plat per level of tradeskill.</div></div><hr />

It takes what maybe 5 minutes of coding, and a quick replace all in the character database. Sense Heading lost all usefulness when they added the compass and maps to the game. Honestly when was the last time you used the skill? Its like languages on a non-roleplaying server, they offer no benefit except coolio points to say I have mastered them all.</div></div><hr />

A couple of meetings to discuss the probably reaction of the public,<br />
a couple other meetings to calculate the reaction of newbies,<br />
the statistic calculations to find out the true profit from such a change,<br />
more meetings to settle down on an appropriate skill number,<br />
after the third meeting on a subject, someone said &quot;oh hell, lets just put it at it's cap!&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally there was talk with the programmers, and a couple of meetings to choose whom shall implement the coding.<br />
Once that done, the programmers would discuss the best ways of approaching the problem between games of WarCraft3 and CounterStrike....<br />
<br />
Now you all know why its taking so long for melee changes....<br />
they're still at the stage of finding out who is going to pull one of the 50 ideas out of the hat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I bet at least a couple of meetings in that process to discuss how to remove the skill altogether ;).<br />
