I'm 15 now, and as I'm working on towards 20 I'm beginning to debate the value of dual weild. to do this I need to know how it works. Is it like EQ in that offhand hit less often for less damage, or is it just like slapping on a second mainhand in terms of dps? i'm hearing a lot of talk saying that 2 hander is the way to go, but im liking the defense bonus on my shield. what to do what to do..<br />
<br />
also, what are some good dungeons for a 15 warrior and a 11 preist to duo for level appropriate gear/xp? im not opposed to travel.<br />
<br />
thanks :D<br />
edit: retarded..</div></div><hr />

In order to be really effective, you'll want to be able to pull out whatever set if weapons/shields/whatever that is fit for the job, and run with it.<br />
<br />
Offhands in this game take a 50% damage penalty, and 24% hit penalty for both weapons.  This makes it a bit too streaky for my liking,  although I haven't seriously tried it lately since I hit 60.  They can definetly perform, but the problem is you'll want 2 good 1h weapons to do it, which is harder than getting a single 2h.<br />
<br />
If you're alliance, deadmines in westfall can be run with a group of 18's.  Not sure of the horde equivalant.</div></div><hr />

It is for levels 13-15. You'll probably need more than two and your buddy may need a few levels. =]</div></div><hr />

<br />
ive done a few mini elite mobs, what are some good mobs to farm newbie shit from? or just for fun? sorry for the vague questions, WoW seems huge and im kinda lost~ :p</div></div><hr />

I REALLY like Westfall and Redridge for the 15-25 range.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">06-03-2005, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grinding is rather dumb at lower levels. Quest give you gear, coin, exp and faction in noticeable amounts. Everything you need to set up anyone for later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-04-2005, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sarcazzm, ya seem kinda lost man.  A lot of your posts look like you're coming to this game with too much of an EQ mentality.<br />
<br />
Here's the straight story man.<br />
<br />
2 boxing is for the most part, a waste of time in this game.  Everyone can solo to 60, so paying the extra 15 bucks a month seems kind of a waste.  The reason it became so acceptable in EQ (and even moreso acceptable on these forums) is because EQ's design almost encouraged it after awhile.  It's exactly the opposite in WoW.  Once you start getting into harder dungeons, you won't even be able to 2 box and tank effective, and I mean that.  There is A LOT of movement required in this game, tanking is a full time job ala EQ bard, and worrying about another character is just a shitload to handle.  Fights are highly intense, and short lived, even in dungeons with 5 man groups.  The emphasis is definitely on quality of player over quantity.<br />
<br />
As far as a roadmap, or a path to 60, as far as leveling and as gear...you're not gonna find anyone with one.  Just follow the game.  When you walk into a new area, be it a town, or an outpost or whatever, first walk around, and talk to everyone you see, gather up all the quests you can and then take a look at your log and pound them out from top to bottom.  There is no secret formula to it, and you don't need any spoilers.  Follow the game, and it will take you everywhere.  From your newbie area at level 5, you'll get a quest to go to the first mid sized town, from there to a low teens area, and then after that you'll be introduced to other areas (The contested zones on PvP, not really another way to name them on PvE) a level or 2 before you become appropriately leveled for them.  The reason no one can give you a set of gear you should be on the lookout for is because gear just happens in this game for the most part.  If you talk to everyone and do what you're supposed to do, you end up being decently equipped and should never have to purchase a single item until your mid 50's.  Things that you don't get from quests you can get from instanced dungeons, and the dungeons in this game are really only meant to be done 3-4 times maximum.  You don't need to spend all week in wailing caverns trying to finish up your Fang set, because by level 30 it'll all be in the trash anyway while you're wearing new gear.<br />
<br />
Honestly, that's the only advice you need in this game.  Don't sit in one spot and grind.  Don't feel compelled to sit LFG in Lower Guk all nite.  Talk to everyone you see, and don't worry if you don't think you're wearing the greatest gear.  All that shit evens out over time, and it's nothing to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">06-04-2005, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great advice, Haass. I'd like to emphasis the follow the quest part. Like was said earlier, the lower levels are all about quests. When you see the exclamation point, clicky clicky. Simple as that. Use the quest log, it will tel you everything you need to know to complete the quest. If you don't know what you are supposed to do, read it again, really. With very few exceptions, there is very little reason to ever ask what to do, or look things up on online. WoW doesn't have that research aspect that EQ had, where everything had to be research unless you liked banging your head against a wall.<br />
<br />
Some quests will send you to an area to talk to someone and then you have to go back to the quest giver. The area you were sent to is most likely going to be an area that is good, or will be good, adventuring at your level. There are usualy at least 2 or 3 different zones that you can head to for level appropriate content. Personally I liked the darnasus/darkshore/wetlands progression, but they are all good. Make sure you check them all out, The human westfall/redridge/duskwood is good as well as the dwarf progression (can't remember the names). Make sure you grab every quest available, some are quite fun, others have good rewards, and others still are simply hilarious. Blizz spent a good deal of time on these quest and it shows, to get the msot out of the game, take time to enjoy the stories they tell. There's a lot of entertainment value there to be had if you take the time and explore all your options.<br />
<br />
To reimphasis, gear is not an issue, it will come from drops and quest rewards as a matter of leveling. you outgrow gear very fast, so planning is problematic, but luckly its not all that important until later levels.<br />
<br />
Check out the deadmines if you are looking for a chalenge, or the other (ELITE) flagged quests available to you. Keep in mind, most elite quests will not open up until you have completed typically one or two subquests in that area from the quest giver as part of their progression. Nearly every area at least has a Boss type encounter, usualy on a wanted poster at the inn or townhall and it is usualy an elite quest.</div></div><hr />

I used this comparison the other night.  It's a good one.  With shouts and weapon swaps and stance switches, we are constantly mashing buttons.  Sometimes (either grinding quest mobs or easy instance runs) you get in a rhythm, using the same skills, but most of the time you're thinking ahead to what skill you're going to use next.<br />
<br />
New players find out really quickly that warriors on here aren't like EQ or any other warrior.  Lot more thought involved, and many more tools at our disposal.   Especially for tanking.  I usually hate dungeons and tanking, but this game makes it fun.  Lots to think about, bunch of skills to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the quests note, one time, at the beginning of the game, I thought I could buck the trend and grind mobs for exp.  Good god it got boring, made me quit the game for a month.  Stick with the quests, there are some greta ones and you should always have a close to full log book.  Really makes time fly.<br />
<br />
Did I add anything or just repeat what's already been said using different words?  You guys are too thoughtful, I want to add something once in awhle.</div></div><hr />
