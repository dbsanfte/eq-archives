<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nopain</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
  I am returning to EQ after a year long sabbatical in australia and I have realized from Alla and TSW that much has changed.  Several new expansions since LoY and a ton of new gear. <br />
 I've been trying to do enough homework on it so when I jump back in I am not totally lost.  I have had my EP geared cleric friend re-equip me and although he has done a phenomenol job I am looking for a few suggestions. <br />
 While I have many levels to go (to 70 now...) I want to purchase/quest gear immediatly at lvl 55 that will pretty much take me to 65 where I can readily raid and re-equip in EP and quite possibly Time.  <br />
  I have a chos and a GoT.  I will most likely use the droga combo and sell the spliter.  What should i re-equip with the 100k or so I will obtain from that sword?  I am on Vazaelle and definetly out of touch with the market there so any suggestions/ critiscims at this point are more than welcomed.<br />
  I am deciding whether or not to get my VT key or if I could just by-pass that seeing as the guild is near approaching Time... and OoW has just been released.  Any thoughts on whether this should be skipped?<br />
<br />
here is my char.. pretty much the same as I had it with a couple of flags grabbed for me by my friends.<br />
<br />

<br />
some thoughts from patrolling the boards have been grabbing bloodmetal earrings and steel rings of earthen resilience.. possible strength of elements.  I dunno about the head/legs and feet slots though.  Hesitent to dump any cash on ornate since it has no resale and I probably will get some from leveling anyways.   As well any weaps for dps that i should look into since I am not going to be in the raiding tank line up for at least a month and probably will be the SA of ldon's for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely upgrade your spider earring. <br />
<br />
Strength of the Elements quest is fast and you could possibly get a new earring if you decided to kill the gots while you're getting the ore. <br />
<br />
Your vambs and fortitude bracer could be upgraded but nothing comes to mind. <br />
<br />
If you have the cash or the farming ability go get Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites or Ornate. <br />
<br />
Once you hit 61 get a Stonewood Bow or the like.<br />
<br />
... or get ideas from my magelo.</div></div><hr />

Start doing LDoNs and save your first points for hate augments for your weapons. then look at the armor sets; depending on what you can pick up while fighting other places, the LDoN armors are not bad at all in some slots.<br />
Do the earring upgrade. <br />
Looks to me like you have a good sense of what to do.<br />
Poke around with the following to look over LDoN possibilities:<br />

<br />
Oh, and if you've been gone since before our discs were unlinked, etc., do look into that.</div></div><hr />

Try to at least have some hps in every slot. Pick up a Mana Threaded Bone Bracelet if you can as well.<br />
<br />
Steel Rings and Bloodmetal Earrings are good, but can be expensive. You can probably nickel and dime other more needy slots first for less cash.</div></div><hr />
