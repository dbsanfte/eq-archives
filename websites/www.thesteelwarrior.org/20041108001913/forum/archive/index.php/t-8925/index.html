<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It looks like they updated some of the scrapped combat systems abilities. They moved them to timer 9. It doesn't look like some sweeping change, so maybe they're looking into still adding them as useful abilities... What do ya'll think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed that too.<br />
<br />
It would be a good way of using my endurance bar when:<br />
a) Im not tanking and inbetween pops of Offensive discs, when my End bar is staring at me all full saying &quot;What do you wanna do with me, handsome?&quot;<br />
b) Im doing xp groups, really, the bar is often around 70% unless I pop Fellstrike, but that happens every ~30min?<br />
<br />
I really would like to use my endurance bar more, the only times it has ran out is if the shit hit the fan and I had to use Fort/Furious then Def/Eva and Inciting multiple mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ditto. To all of it. And I'm normally tanking 2+ mobs in a normal LDoN, using incite when needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vilis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did any of the minor end burning abilities make it to OOW?  I saw some the one day I did beta, but...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sikkorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does anyone have any more information about this?<br />
<br />
On lucy there are a heck of a lot of warrior &quot;spells&quot; that have been modified.  A couple that come to mind that have, as said above, been move to timer 9.<br />
<br />
Power slam - stun(4s/65) - end cost 105<br />
- someone has seen the tome on test (its in lucy), anyone seen this on a vendor ?  it is only a war/52 skill, stun up to 65 ? on a lvl 52 disc, I can see this changing.<br />
<br />
Armour slice - increase dmg modifier 5%, 5 ticks, war /42<br />
- um is it just me or did the warrior just increase guild dmg output by 5% for 5 ticks ?  if this is how I interpret it (my own of course) this is pretty amazing for a lvl 42 disc.  then again, it could only be for the warrior dmg that used disc.  However it seems to go on the mob, interesting.<br />
<br />
Slice, War/55, increase hate 225.  hmmm this on a different timer from incite line ?  Interesting no ?<br />
<br />
Well, it will be interesting to see what the length of timer is on any of those skills.  And how they choose to make them available.  Maybe you have to do quests or tasks for these, unsure.  Or, maybe this is all to make us feel like something is being done, when its not :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nagellom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Timer 9?<br />
What's dat?<br />
Or better yet, where?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All warrior abilities and disciplines have a timer number. None that I saw had timer 9, until the recent changes to the scrapped combat abilities. Check Lucy for what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hope they add armour slice and most of all power slam or slice.<br />
<br />
Armour slice should only increase the damage of the warrior using the ability.<br />
<br />
Power slam and slice would both be desparately needed additional agro for the times when arrow, melee, incite loses you agro (which for me is very often with WA4, two anger III on BoC, CHSD.)</div></div><hr />
