<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has a push problem.  Not the normal push you get with 20 to 30 melee beating on a mob's ass, but &gt;BANG&lt; now its 10 to 20 feet from where it was, usually having  been pushed right over the warrior trying to tank it.  Its driving us nuts, and no one will admit to being the source of the problem.<br />
<br />
In my search for a culprit, I've been looking at weapon procs (this is a recent problem, so I'm thinking its a recently acquired weapon).   We have several PoP weapons with  Ethereal Strike - Double-edged Greatsword of Visions, Featherwood Compound Bow and Valorous Quarterstaff - these are listed on lucy as having a push back of 1, which doesn't seem like it would be enough to cause what we are seeing. We have a couple of Norge'tals that are listed at a push of 3, but I'm assured by the owners that they don't use these on raids for fear of drawing aggro.<br />
<br />
For reference, we are a large non-elemental raiding guild that kills everything outside PoP with the exception of VT.  In PoP we are currently working on solving stuff like Bert and MM.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a clue on this?  Any insight would be greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Katina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It could be those... but it also could be just casting spells and basic raiding. I've noticed in my raids that sometimes for some odd reason the damn mob moves.. gets pushed back by everyone beating on it perhaps?  don't know for sure, just a suggestion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's funny that you mention this:<br />
<br />
Yesterday, I was a guest on a raid where this was a HUGE problem, the raid leaders were beside themselves over who was knocking back the mob, and no one could figure out what was going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Paladins have a stun that moves the mob a pretty fair distance. Check with your paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">turn &quot;others spells on&quot;; log a fight, and see just how many times ye pally go ape with their stun spells :D<br />
<br />
also, check yer monks out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A couple of things to look for would be anyone wielding a GSoT.  The knockback on that is annoying.  Also, last night I noticed a friend's necro pet was pushing like mad on the mobs in UP.  It was quite annoying as usually I outpush a single pet.<br />
<br />
Edit:  just remembered that a friend's cleric has a spell with a sizable knockback and stun.  I finally &quot;convinced&quot; him to stop using it by letting him tank the mobs.  He doesn't stand up well to the POP mobs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Non-controlled pets as well as normal pets contribute a great deal to mobs being pushed in an unwanted direction. We pretty much ban the use of pets in Water because they cause more problems than good. Swarm pets are the devil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have a sizable number of mage and beastlord pets all attacking from the same side, they can screw things up in a hurry. Get your pet casters to spread out where possible, does wonders for positioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pally and Cleric stuns have knockback effect, some of them at least. I sometimes tank and the cleric has mana to spare and might throw a nuke, and my mob will go 'out of range'. Also pallies, sometimes the mob will jump the chanter for example, I go taunt it and bam, the mob moved OOR suddenly and its stunned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To reiterate, this is NOT normal push that you get on raids from having most of the melee on one side of the mob.  I've been tanking for my guild on large raids for over a year now, I know what is normal, this isn't.<br />
<br />
Pally and cleric stuns are accounted for, we haven't acquired any new members of either class in awhile, and the ones we have really know better.<br />
<br />
GSoT?  Sorry, I'm not familiar with whatever this is.<br />
<br />
Beastlord and mage pets are not the culprits, have spoken to these guys at length.<br />
<br />
One of our officers has a theory that what we are seeing is some kind of dot effect, because its so frequent that he doesn't think it could be a proc.<br />
<br />
Necro pets can cause knockback? Will look into this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, yer looking for stuns from clerics, wizards and paladins, certain nukes from druids (the Fury line will cause a knockback IIRC), GSoT (great staff of thunder), chetarii staff (one of your casters may be meleeing), or the virulent paralysis root from shamans.  <br />
<br />
If no one is gonna fess up to it, I'd turn all spell chat on and parse the whole thing as a melee.   When the knockback happens, make a note of it and go back thru the log and account for all spell effects.  When you have something you don't recognize, look it up on lucy and nail down the culprit and then /guildremove their ass for lying about it and causing you trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok Shik, explain the part about monks if you would please.<br />
<br />
I was just in PoN last night at the gobbie camp and the group was getting mad saying that I was knocking the mob away from our rogue.  I was mostly using Flying Kick for my special attack.  I was throwing in a few Dragon Punches/Tiger Claws for discs and aa abilities later on.<br />
<br />
Unless they quadrupled the push from it, there is no way I was knocking the gobbies around that much.  I saw the ranger we had knocking the gobbies 3 feet sideways while I was running around to the other side of the rogue so I would be straight behind again.<br />
<br />
Or did everybodies special attacks get tweaked without us knowing about it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Monk special attacks seem to push a good bit, plus the sheer amount of attacks they get. Especially with the PoP Wu's Technique AA that lets them get chain special attacks.<br />
<br />
 A big thing is to make sure some of your casters face different directions when they nuke. I *think* all DD's have a small push associated with them. Beyond what is listed in Lucy, just like melee pushes a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yeah, grimmlokk explained it. i dunno either if they were tweaked more than what they were but when we looked into our push problem my old guild had we saw that the monks seemed to be almost tied with the pally stun_push. luckily we easily compensated it by using the amount of fat tanks we had and our /trueshot rangers were happy.<br />
also one of the older monk 2H blunt sticks proc'd &quot;one hundred blows&quot; ( i don't know the name of the thing offhand ) and that alone plus the monks special attacks seemed to move mobs around quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pet push is hideous, my guild has been having issues with that of late as well.  Melee push can be substantial but decent positioning can cut that down some.  Worst case scenario, no pets, no kicks, no bashes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;Dragon Punch&quot;<br />
<br />
A couple of monks in my guild can single handedly Control a mobs position with this ability so long as the mob does not resist it.<br />
<br />
I think it is a normal ability not a disc or anyhting but it has tremendous push,Mobs can also resist it somehow..I never looked much into the ability..probably should sometime...<br />
<br />
I have an issue with Beastlord pets.The Beastlords can imbue the pets with a KB spell,However the ones in my guild do not or at least claim the imbue spells they have do not proc....<br />
<br />
However,Even without the pet being &quot;imbued&quot; with said KB spell,One beastlord pet can outpush an entire group of melee.Like I ma talking 20 melee swarming a mob and everyone steps back to see wtf is pushing it and there is this one tiger moving the mob 5 feet at a time....<br />
<br />
I have argued endlessly with the Beastlords in my guild and a few times I have orded the pets killed and the push problem was instantly fixed..They are Adamant that it is not their pets,Going so far as to post various topics from the beastlord site on it, but upon death of the pet the push issues cease.</div></div><hr />
