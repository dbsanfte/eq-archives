<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vaximian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, new to the site, but older to the game.<br />
<br />
I was at DragonCon in Atlanta this weekend and there was actually an EQ forum.  The forum was meant to be for PP tricks / quests, which I figured might just be funny to listen to and laugh at some scrubs, but it turned into a riff session on the game.<br />
<br />
One member of the panel was a marketing guy from SOE, who used to be the GM on a server (Xegony I think), but now organizes Fan Faires and such.  His name escapes me at the moment.  Anyway, I brought up the need for Warrior class balancing and although he wouldn't reveal anything to me, he indicated that it is &quot;on the list&quot;, that the developers do read the SOE Forums and this forum, and by far the best way to force change from the developers was to email him or the feedback option and ask for it.  Apparently they actually prioritize their list of back fixes based on how much people complain, rather than the severity of the problem.  If I find the guy's name, I'll post it.<br />

You mean the worship at the alter of the all mighty dollar? Not to be unexpected from a company as big as Sony. And it also explains druids real well =p</div></div><hr />

They've already said that spam letters will be ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not spam letters, but one letter every week.<br />
Detailing in a clear way what we want.<br />
<br />
Send the letter through mail, and not e-mail if you have to.<br />
<br />
And that thing about changes being based on the severity of whinage..... warriors have been rightfully whining for years and years....<br />
and what hasve the recent changes been?? Stuff casters didn't even think of...<br />
<br />
Ohh... a clarity for my pet? err.... ok... thanks... i think...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Folian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea the guy at DragonCon was actually cool to talk with. I have sent feedback after talking with him, and have also had any warrior in my guild do the same. Something to keep in mind though, try to sound as clear and specific as possible...  just saying /feedback  &quot;awwww, c'mon we suck&quot; isn't going to help. Although, that sounds like something the druids/rangers did...  so it may work /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Perhaps it was Daegarmo?  Or was it Palladius?</div></div><hr />

You got suckered by an SOE marketing guy. Marketing guys == bullshit to make the customer happy regularly resorting to outright lies.<br />
<br />
Right now, short of sending typed bussiness letters of complaint to John Smedly (his bussiness address is online btw) I don't think we are going to get any sort of changes.</div></div><hr />
