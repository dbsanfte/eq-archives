Does this mean paladins are the best tanks of WoW like in FFXI?</div></div><hr />

God I need to get my EQ account up again, to ease the craving for WoW until it comes out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started the beta a couple days ago.  I only have a 6 warrior right now but at level 6, I already have over twice the number of things to do in combat as my 65 EQ warrior.  I'm excited to make it to higher levels and fool around with the stances.  The fact that I can look forward to being able to snare and slow opponents, use my stances to control aggro and dps.  Obviously I haven't gtten to screw around with the stances yet but at higher levels it really sounds like warriors are very versatile.  Unlike EQ where for the most part, having 2 warriors in the party means the second warrior is nearly useless, in WoW a second warrior could go into an offensive stance and provide substantial dps.<br />
<br />
Still gear dependent but right now I'm doing pretty good even with only drop and quest armor and weapons.<br />
<br />
The quests are fun.  Hell, just in general the game is fun.  Anyway, I'm loving WoW beta so far and I'll post more as I go on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also got into the beta this week. I started with an orc warrior :)<br />
<br />
Level 17 as of today... and they are a heck of a lot more fun that my EQ warrior ever was. Solo same level mobs or even higher? Yep. Downtime? Minimal.  I'm still getting into the groove of how the class plays, and obviously its a long ways from retail.. but this class is new and fun  for me even at this stage of the game.<br />
<br />
I do see some grumblings on the beta warrior board about some people becoming bored, however the talent system is currently not implemented, so everyone has identical abilities currently.<br />
<br />
&lt;- Gzak, level 17 Orc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got into phase 2 beta, and am currently a level 34 dwarven warrior(yeah, I know, real original).  I'm absolutely loving it.  Aside from all the things like a great quest system, a tradeskill system that produces items you actually use during combat and downtime, and the other various things available to everyone, I'm really enjoying the utility of being a warrior.  Thats right you heard me, I used &quot;utility&quot; and &quot;warrior&quot; in the same sentance.  <br />
<br />
Without getting heavy into the mechanics, we have a Battle Stance, a Defensive Stance, and an undeveloped Berzerker Stance, and probably more to come.  <br />
<br />
In the Battle Stance you become damage/utility, you have single hit damage increasing abilities, a snare(warriors being one of the few classes that has snare), a dot, a battle starting charge that stuns and gains rage, a casting interupt skill, a riposte skill, an AE(up to 4 targets) dmg/slow, and a longer reuse mightystrike style crit skill.  <br />
<br />
In Defensive stance you gain an innate addition to your Defense skill, a taunt that works and has visual cues(to my knowledge we are the ONLY class currently that can taunt, or gain the mob's attention through any method other than dps or healing), shield block, shield bash which interupts casting(sword and board is actually useful in WoW, and the prefered choice for defensive tanking), disarm(which actually means something since just like players mobs cannot use certain abilities without a melee weapon equiped), a reverse riposte, a stackable AC debuff, and a longer reuse 75% incoming damage reduction skill.<br />
<br />
Berzerker Stance is currently unfinished and only has one skill atm, but it comes with an innate 10% haste boost at the cost of increasing incoming damage by 20%.<br />
<br />
Add to this a Shouts system that is independant of your stance and currently includes a group atk buff, an AE atk debuff, an AE taunt, and an AE fear.<br />
<br />
So far the utility and tanking ability I bring to a group, often using more than once stance in a single battle, as well as the ability to ply all the above in solo situations effectively have me very impressed with the design of the warrior class in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(sword and board is actually useful in WoW, and the prefered choice for defensive tanking)<br />
<br />
 Right now it is the preferred choice for everything. Back in alpha and beta1 1H weapons were way way way way way better than 2H. Due to damage bonus application and how procs(swing % based) and weapon buffs(straight dmg boost per swing) work. Now 1H are only way way way better. 2H need major work. The main reason I haven't really gotten into a warrior yet(have a lvl 17 human one locked from beta 1 who I was speccing out in 2H for kicks).<br />
<br />
i been playing wow since alpha phase and i made both a war and a pally got both to 25. with the same gear and talent points used i had more hp and ac than the warrior and held aggro alot better.<br />
<br />
 That is flat out bullshit. Especially in Alpha. Paladins have and had no great agro gaining method. And warriors get more hitpoints per level and per stamina. The only way a paladin would have more then is with significantly better gear. Now the hp from stam is lower for everyon and it might be slightly easier but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
 Back on agro. I played a rogue last push. 30(cap at the time). Very very decent gear. Maxed skills blah blah maxed spec. The *only* person that could remotely hold agro off me even slightly reliably was a warrior. When I duo'd with paladin guildmate(rune sword blah blah great gear) it was a running joke that he was just the priest and I was the tank. It's not impossibly for a paladin to tank by a longshot, it's just not nearly as easy as for a war.<br />
<br />
 Playing a horde shaman this push, so unfortunately I can't compare the 2 classes from a healer perspective(no horde paladins).<br />
<br />
 In short. Everyone should find something to like about WoW warriors. At least once they get 2H balanced properly. But some people who played warriors in EQ will want to stray away from them somewhat I'm sure, and there's plenty out there if you still want to wade into battle without being a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">05-22-2004, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now it is the preferred choice for everything.<br />
<br />
Nah, I carry the third best dagger currently and I dual wield in Battle Stance exclusively for soloing, and for dpsing on the rare chance I'm not tanking(currently third highest AC on the Thottbot profile listing).  Also in my limited dueling experience dual wield is much better against melee, while sword and board is good for casters for quicker spell interrupts with the shield.  So far from what I've seen warriors still aren't a strong PvP class, at least not one on one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">05-22-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot warriors got DW earlier this push=P<br />
<br />
 As for PVP, warriors aren't bad at all. Maybe not the strongest but pretty good. Hamstring alone makes them very nice. I imagine they'll be better for group PVP than 1 on 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, disregard my above comments about using Battle Stance for soloing.  I discovered that the reason I found Defensive Stance lacking for soloing is because there is currently a bug that when you use a gun, shield block becomes basically null for a period of time.  Now that I've put the gun away, Defensive Stance with sword and board is far superior to Battle Stance for soloing.  The only time I switch to Battle anymore is if I'm grouped and don't have to tank, or I need to snare a mob near the end of the fight.</div></div><hr />

This happens when you have  a gun equipped or after you use it to pull?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using it to pull, I still have a Sniper Rifle equiped for the 2 Agility, I just don't carry an ammo pouch anymore.</div></div><hr />
