<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karlorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail warriors! New warrior here, stopping by to say hello and ask some advice.<br />
<br />
I was an old school player, quit after velious I just never deactivated my account. I have been following the game through the message boards so I have a pretty fair idea of what gear is best to get, and what AA path to take when the time comes.<br />
<br />
What is puzzling me however, is LDoN. I'm not sure where to look for information. I'm hoping someone can post up the short story on where to go for warrior type drops.. and any advice or suggestions on how to maximize my time spent there. Also, how exactly do the augments (or whatever you call it) and all that work as far as attaching it to items? Any particular augments to look for? Also, how does one figure out what weapon to get that has the right slot or whatever for aggro proc enhancements?<br />
<br />
If there is a web page laying around that explains all this please let me know!<br />
<br />
Thanks folks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the zones in LDoN have warrior drops.  What helps us is what level you are and what type of gear you already have.  If you have a magelo, post it so we can view it and see what we are working with.<br />
<br />
As far as attaching augments, make sure the augment is the same type as the slot allows on the item you are augmenting.  Go to any of the Wayfarer camps you will find a birdbath.  Click it and put the item and the augment in it and hit combine and that's it.  Once I get home from work I can Pvt Msg you the link to the LDoN merchant scripts.</div></div><hr />

I have some fierce heraldic armor pieces being made as we speak, so don't laugh at my armor!<br />
<br />
Can you tell what class I used to play based on the gear I wear? lol..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Welcome back.  Here's my basic LDoN write-up...<br />
<br />
To begin, go to your home town, and hail the LDoN NPC there.  Follow their script, and that will get you started.  Then, go to the EC tunnel, and talk to the bard NPC in white armour there, from what I can remember, his keyword is &quot;farstone magic&quot;, I think ??  If that doesn't work, ask guildies or in /ooc for the keywords, and people will help you out.  You need to speak with both NPCs to get started on your LDoN adventures.  The benefit of this is, you get an &quot;adventure stone&quot;, which is basically an augment for your charm slot.  This adventure stone increases in power/strength with the number of LDoN adventures you successfully complete at each camp.  Eventually, after completing 100 successful adventures at each camp, your adventure stone is maxed, and has fairly nice stats to ad to your charm, including 100 hp.  By the way, to save backpack room, augment your charm with the adventure stone as soon as you begin.  You don't have to wait for the stone to max out in stats before using it to augment.  To add the stats to your stone, get 10 successful adventures completed in any one of the 5 different adventure camps.  Once you have 10, at each camp there is an NPC whom you can hail and will speak with you about &quot;information&quot;.  Every 2 successful adventures counts as 1 &quot;hail&quot;, and you will get a message along the lines of &quot;you gain a valuable piece of information&quot;, or something like that.  Every 5 successful hails, you get an additional message, &quot;your adventure stone magically increases in power&quot;, and your adventure stone will gain HP/mana.  Another thing... you don't have to do your adventures in any kind of order, or time limit, to get the wins needed to increase the stats on your adventure stone.   You can get a single win at another camp, then go adventure at a different camp for the next few months, then come back, etc. etc.  All that matters, for max adventure stone stats, is that you have 100 successful adventures at each of the 5 camps.  Any order, any timing is fine.  Just keep hailing the &quot;information&quot; npc at each of the camps, to gain the stats.<br />
<br />
As you successfully complete adventures, you gain Adventure Points (AP).  The number you receive depends on your level, the level of your group doing the adventure, and the difficulty of your adventure.  As you collect AP, you can use them to buy different things at the adventure camps, such as armour, weapons, or augments.  Here is where it gets confusing.  To &quot;unlock&quot; the AP merchant at any of the different camps, you have to have AP from THAT specific camp.  Unlocking here simply means getting the AP merchant at that camp to show you what is available.  Let's say you are at the Butcherblock camp, which we'll call Camp A, where you have successfully completed a number of adventures in Mistmoore Caverns, collecting 500 AP.  Clicking on an AP merchant at that camp, will show you which items are available up to 500 points, and a bit further beyond, such as up to 580 AP for example.  You won't be able to buy the 580 AP point items, but you will be able to view them now.  You will however be able to buy any item for under 500 points.<br />
<br />
Now, you go and do some adventures in Everfrost at Miragul's Menagerie, which we'll call Camp B.  You earn 300 AP there.  Your group is on a roll, and head back to the EC camp, and do another few adventures there, gaining another 250 AP, at Camp C.<br />
<br />
Your point total now looks like this:<br />
Camp A - 500<br />
Camp B - 300<br />
Camp C - 250<br />
Total     - 1050<br />
<br />
You can now spend these points at any one of the 3 camps where you have gained AP at, to unlock the AP merchats at any of those camps.  For example, you go back to Camp A.  There is an item there for 500 AP that you want.  Well, now you can buy 2 of them.  However, you saw a 550 AP item there that you really wanted.  You won't be able to buy it yet, until you have earned another 50 Camp A points, for a total of 550.  Or, you can go to Camp C, and see a 250 AP item there that you really like.  Well, now you can buy 4 of them.  <br />
<br />
Basically, as you are going through your adventures gaining AP, you have 2 kinds of AP accounts/totals.  The first is your total AP sum, which is a large pool of all the AP you have accumulated to date, less the amount of AP that you have spent on items/augments.  This total pool can be spent on any item you have &quot;unlocked&quot; the merchant for, at any of the adventure camps.<br />
<br />
The second kind of AP account is the total account for each specific camp.  This total simply shows you how many points you have ever earned at that camp.  It is not affected by spending points and buying items; it is merely an aggregate total sum of all the points you have ever gained at a specific camp, and is used to determine which items you have &quot;unlocked&quot; from a merchant at that camp.  In other words, you can gain 400 points at a camp, go somewhere else and gain more AP, spend ALL those points on some upgrades, and then come back to the first camp and gain 200 more AP.  While you only have 200 AP total to spend now  again, your AP aggregate total for THAT specific camp will show you at 600 AP.  This simply means you can buy any item for up to 600 AP now, from that camp's merchants, once you have re-earned enough points.  Once you have unlocked an item from a camp's merchants, you can gain the points to buy it anywhere you wish.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for augmenting, at each adventure camp, there is a fountain, that looks like a bird bath.  This is actually a container, such as a forge or kiln.  Once you have determined that you have the correct kind of augment, and you know which piece of gear you want to add it on, simply place both pieces in the bird bath, and hit &quot;combine&quot;.  It is a no-fail combine, so don't worry about losing anything.   Augmenting makes a piece of gear no-drop, so if you later want to sell or get rid of some now-augmented, no-drop gear, simply place the augmented gear back in the bird bath, with a jar of augment solvent *sold by the magus at each adventure camp*, and hit combine.  The augment will be removed from your gear, but will be destroyed and lost in the process.  Your gear will be fine tho, and will once again be tradeable. (obviously, this only applies to gear that was originally droppable... any gear that was originally no-drop will remain so)<br />
<br />
As for augments...  When comparing augments to gear for compatibility, you have to ensure that the piece of gear you wish to augment, has a slot available of the correct type for the augment you wish to use.  Every piece of gear will have a listing such as &quot;Slot 1, type 7&quot;, or Slot 1, type 1; Slot 2, type 2; Slot 3, type 3.  This means that this first piece of gear only has 1 augment slot available, and it takes a type 7 augment.  The second piece will take 3 augments obviously, but each slot will only take the type of augment specifically listed for that slot.  Weapons are usually listed as Slot 1, type 4.  Any EQ gear, including armour and weapons, that does not come from LDoN, or from the Plane of Time in the PoP expansion, has only 1 slot, slot 1.  There might be a couple of rare exceptions to this rule, but I haven't seen them yet.<br />
<br />
As well, every augment that drops, or that you can buy, will have a type on it, such as Augmentation Type 7.  This means that this augment has to be put into a type 7 augment slot on a piece of gear.  You won't be able to put it in to any other kind of slot type, it must be a type 7 slot.  Doesn't matter if it's slot 1, or 2, or whatever, it simply has to be type 7 slot.  This mainly matters when buying augments.  When you see an augment you want at an AP merchant, check what slot type it takes, and make sure that you have that correct slot type open, before you buy the augment.  Some augments also have restrictions as to where they can be used, such as BP and legs only, or anywhere but ears/fingers, or weapons only, etc.  Check those restrictions as well, before you spend your AP.  In other words, as you look over an AP merchant, and see this very nice Type 2 HP augment that would be kick-ass on your gear, check to make sure that you indeed have a Type 2 slot open on some armour, that will accept that augment.  Make sure you don't get slot number, and slot type mixed up.<br />
<br />
Also, as you go through and do LDoN adventures, a number of augments will drop for your group.  Usually these augments are type any, which means they'll go.... anywhere :p  These are nice for augmenting your non-LDoN gear with, as most non-LDoN gear only has type 7 augment slots available, and type 7 augments are a somewhat limited selection.<br />
<br />
As for where to get AP at, for buying gear... Well, for armour, the Tak camp in North Ro has the nicest plate gear, which is comparable to or better than ornate, in most cases.  However, it's also expensive, with each piece costing 1492 AP.   You can get the next level down in gear from the Everfrost camp, with each piece costing around 750 AP, I think.  This gear is also damn nice, with AC and HP only slightly less than the Tak gear.  As well, Everfrost has the very very nice Anger3 augments for weapons, which are basically an EB proc you can add to most any weapon.   These proc buffs are 1150 AP, so will also take some saving.  Every camp has something very nice to offer a warrior; either gear, or weapon procs, or HP augs, or AC augs, you name it.  The best idea is to see what's available, figure out what will upgrade you the quickest for the number of points you'll need, determine how much time you'll be able to spend gathering AP, etc., and then go from there.  <br />

This is a very nice site for checking out what's available;<br />
