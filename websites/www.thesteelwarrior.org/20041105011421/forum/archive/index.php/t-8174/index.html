<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karnloft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What suggestions do you folks have for quests and gear during these levels?  I'd hate to spend all my money on stuff that's obsolete quickly.  My current swords at 37 are a Centi Shortsword and a Sarnak Skullsplitter.<br />
<br />
I have 1700pp and this is basically my only toon.  I have help from my guild (a few 65s, mostly 40-60s), but I don't want to take large donations to gear up.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">weapons are fine might think about something with a stun/deuff proc for agro.<br />
<br />
most of your plat should go to armor. good weapons only help when you can live through the fight, or not be to much burdon on the healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Would be a lot easier to suggest items or quests if you posted a magelo of your current gear. If you are looking for gear upgrades use the 1ac &gt; 6hp rule.<br />
<br />
Thurg armor from kael giants comes to mind. You just need Kindly faction with coldain and the gems. Sometimes can find it for free. If your Deity is Rallos Zek or Tribunal there is some nice culture gear made you could buy, it's expensive though but will last a long time. 6ac 65hp rings. <br />
<br />
Like I said before, post a magelo to make suggestions easier. That's all I can think of off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">maybe try some gothic steel armor or acylia plate. both are decent ac if you're just starting out and are dirt cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First, you generally want the faster of your weapons in the primary hand, especially with both being the same delay. Next, use the formula 1ac = 6hp = 2sta (each sta should give you about 3hp, give or take). Keep upgrading your gear accordingly. Strength isn't terribly important, neither is dex or agi. Ac, hp and sta are king.<br />
<br />
  Grab some 6ac 65hp player made rings if you can, they tend to be fairly cheap for the benefit. Bazaar shop for other upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm afraid that I leveled before the recommended level bug was fixed on weapons, so you'd have to check the following carefully to see how they would perform at your level, but these are cheap weapons:<br />
Jarsath trident 11/22 piercing pri/sec<br />
shimmering partisan 17/39 piercing either hand (this is an offhand possibility) +20 Dex.<br />
Weighty polearm 2HS 29/34, AC +15 (other stats too) hp+35<br />
<br />
I always suggest to people that if they can run through Dawnshroud Peaks, they can go to the zone-in at maiden's Eye and ask politely to loot any rotting Goranga Spiked Clubs. these drop off mobs fairly near the zone-in, but you have to use extreme caution not to let anything aggro on you, since you'll be dead. Goranga spiked club is 12/23 primary only AC+5, STR+2. The Centi Short sword is a worthy weapon; the club is just slightly faster, and it's free (though you can offer a small donation for looting rights--this is a no-drop item, so it tends to just rot).<br />
<br />
A Magelo will help with the armor side of things, since it's hard to make specific suggestions without seeing the whole picture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, Karn, the places you'd probably get the most bang for your buck in upgrading armor are your greyhopper slots, your fingers, and your chest. You'll have to look around a bit to compare exactly what gets you the most AC/hps for the buck, but luckily you have some options.<br />
first, go to the bazaar and search by slot, race, religion, class and some budget amount (let's say in your case, 1K). In each slot, write down the best AC item for &lt;300 plat, &lt;500 plat and less than &lt;1000 plat (you might do separate budget searches to make that easier). Then go to the dwarf smithy merchants in PoK. A good number of players skill up on smithing in that place and sell the items they just made right back to the vendors there. Look in particular for LDoN armors (gothic, sandblasted) and see what's available, then check that against the bazaar prices.<br />
<br />
Oh and before you buy stuff from merchants, spend 40 pp or so and get 2 opal encrusted steins. They are +25 cha each, and will soon pay for themselves even if you don't do a great deal of buying from vendors.<br />
<br />
If you see LDoN armor on the vendors, you should be able to get, for example, a breastplate for around 100 plat. The gothic steel breastplate's stats are:<br />
AC: 27<br />
STR: +3   STA: +4   <br />
SV MAGIC: +6   <br />
WT: 5.5   Size: SMALL<br />
Class: WAR CLR PAL SHD BRD<br />
Race: HUM ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF<br />
             IKS FRG <br />
<br />
As you can see, this would be a big boost to you, and several upgrades should be within your budget.<br />
Shop carefully; take notes and compare what you can get per plat for each slot. I'd pay little attention to anything but AC, hitpoints, and STA on armor, but when competing pieces are close in AC, do weigh the other factors. Don't get in a hurry to buy stuff in the bazaar until you have a good sense of what your server's economy is like.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the plan of attack.  I did pick up Ry'gorr Chain Leggings last night with some higher levels friends in the Eastern Wastes.  It'll be helpful to have a plan when looking in the bazaar...it can be quite overwhleming when one has so much gear to replace.  :)<br />
<br />
I noticed that the Gothic Steel was for small races...is there a comparable large race set of armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes, the LDoN armors come in different sizes. Lol, I haven't checked lately, but I think the LDoN armor is called &quot;small gothic XXXX&quot; or &quot;gothic xxxx&quot; or &quot;Large gothic xxx&quot;.<br />
In other words, there are different sizes, and depending on what the smith was making, not all sizes may be around at once. In the bazaar, you can put in your race as a screen in you searches, but when you look on a vendor, you have to be very careful to buy only the stuff that you can actually equip.<br />
<br />
Even in the bazaar, you should always look before you buy. Sometimes in the bazaar people will sell summoned gear, which is okay for folks looking for such things, but if you buy it thinking you got a great deal on bandages, heh, they'll dissappear when you log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">summoned armor ! LoL I imagine the noob buying a large bunch of summoned items (like focus items for casters) and selling back their former slot items with a big smile in their face thinking at the big deal they have made. log out to sleep a bit in hapiness thinking at the huge deal they made, and the next day when they log in back WOUCHHHHH everything has dsapeared !!<br />
<br />
LoL this would be to much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh, at gothic isn't the only player-made LDoN armor. It's for tanks, but you could also make do with &quot;sandblasted&quot; or whatever it's called.<br />
The EQ traders site I liked has all the stats for the various pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karnloft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What about 1h slash weapons or a good 2h slash for under 2k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">my little wariror is only level 39 and his twin lammys and his mith 2Her ( thx Five and Brutul ! ) still do a decent enough job. I'd recommend my 2H blunt stick but it no longer drops ( Steel Rod of the Knight (?), from the last GM event )<br />
Armour tho; i got mostly Crafted still and it's nothing to brag about; pretty generic but can do the job. You being on a proddie server can net ya some nice deals and what the others mentioned will do very well for ya.</div></div><hr />
