When you're in RFK, take a left, you'll come right to him.<br />
<br />
Bring friends, RFK ain't no fuckin joke right now.  After next patch, it should be a little better.</div></div><hr />

Care to explain? Elite mobs getting gimped a little or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't have a lot of DPS, or need to take breaks or basically it's just your first time there, RFK is a harsh place, and you're gonna end up seeing Razormanes behind you pretty quickly if you sit in one spot too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you know where the Great Lift is, it is right past it, on the left.  On the right, directly across is a higher level instance, Razorfen Downs.  If you don't know where the Great Lift is, it is south of Camp Taurajo which is south of Crossroads.  It's also Northwest I think of Thousand Needles.  I know you are alliance...  sorry I can't tell you exactly how to get there from Alliance side.  The Great Lift is also close to the Sandstone Flats.<br />
<br />
I didn't find RFK to be that hard...  but admittedly the mobs were green to me when I went there first, low green.  I was duoing with a priest and we were doing ok.  I think we died once though on a boss not that terribly far in.  Lots of mobs in groups there, easy to get lots of adds.</div></div><hr />

I've been putting it off, since I was certain that I wouldn't be able to complete it until I was 30+ and able to get a group for the instance, but Haas, you said something about duoing it. Would I be able to just go in there with a druid partner and duo it, to complete the brutal armor quest? I've got to deal with the same guy the alliance does.<br />
<br />
I know how to get to RFK, I was just wondering if i'd be able to complete the quest with a partner.<br />
<br />
Also, where do I get the berserker stance quest? I don't know what i'd search for on thottbot, and having something to help a little in DPS when im soloing/not tanking would be great, but I don't know who i'd have to talk to to get it.</div></div><hr />

I believe I did it when I was 30ish..with a shaman.  Pretty sure I did it the nite I got Berserker stance, but can't remember for certain.<br />

From your warrior trainer at level 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binabink</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did it yesterday.  Was me at 29, another warrior at 22, and that warrior playing his girlfriend's 52 warrior.  Even though she was 52, we still died numerous times due to the darn large aggro radius of caster mobs, coupled with fleeing stuff and massive trainage.  It also didn't help that we didn't look up where he was first, so took the right fork.  However, it did seem to take about an hour for stuff to respawn after we'd killed it.<br />
<br />
Renix, at 22 you'll have an extremely hard time with the level 28 - 31 elites.</div></div><hr />

Now i've just got to bug some guildies into helping me with the cyclonian quest for the whirlwind weapon 10 levels early!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your difficult is not with the caster mobs, it's the aggro radius on the 22.</div></div><hr />
