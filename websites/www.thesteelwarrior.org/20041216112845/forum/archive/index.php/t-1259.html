SoE has lied to us time and time again, It's sad, its annoying, Its typical carrot in front of the mule attitude.<br />
They keep promising melee changes but they never happen, Class revamps never happen.<br />
Heck we even got screwed on the charm from PoP Progression. (sorry but a few points of ac dosent cut it. Our's should look more like 30 Ac 20 str 15 dex 20 sta 15 agi and 170 hp) Why did you give us the same charm as the Hybriud's got except for Mana and int/wis on their's? Thats a buncha BS.  (mind you I put 170hp per our's because its Mana/Hp equilivent if added together for hybrid)<br />
<br />
Where is our Pure melee balance SoE? When can we expect to see more pure war items that are easily obtainable? If you want to make us a class that is itemization dependent dont make it so the items we need come off God's. That would be a balance in itself.<br />
<br />
So i'll put my cards down in this semi rant. SoE you've lied to me, You've lied to the warrior community. And the sad thing is whenever we start to see a light at the end of the tunnel, We only realize its a carrot held in front of the trudging mule. <br />

Thanks Sony for anther fine disappointment. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats even more funny is when they talk about the new expansion they talk about lots of new spells, but not a peep about any possible new skills for the melee people.<br />
<br />
I think they have given up making up new skills for melee, or maybe they just ran out of gimmicks. <br />
<br />
I think the real problem is that making a new skill takes actual EFFORT and a bit of coding time, whereas new spells any apprentice can slap together and they can push it live with simply updating the spell file.<br />
<br />
So in other words, the outlook for pure melee isnt that good, because actually doing something for our classes would require them to spend designer/programmer time which they do not seem to want to allocate.</div></div><hr />

I'm not willing to go as far as you're going.   In every recent message of upcoming changes, they've *never* promised that the melee balancing issue would come in the next patch, as a matter of fact, when I read it, it has seemed pretty clear to me that they specifically have shown it to be in the more distant future in every update. <br />
<br />
Quite frankly, I'd rather them say what they're working on and goals laid out than none at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to burst your bubble. Those skills are nearly as useless as VT's Dodge, Parry, etc modifiers. Not to mention that there are plate drops available to Hybrids than can close the HP gain from Raex. <br />
<br />
Of false promises.. yea.. where the fuck are those melee balancing patches we were promised months ago?? Since then, I have only seen caster boosts!! Really.. WTF!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah 2 ac and 10 hps are worth those extra 80 mana or so..<br />
<br />
NOT one single piece of war only equipment does anywhere near compensate for all the mana on knight gear. That is why I think 1 mana == 1 hp for warriors would be a substantial improvement by SOE.</div></div><hr />

anyway if you think that charms should have been 170hp for warriors and 90hp 80mana for others, fine . you are a fookin genius.<br />

<br />
Paladins get 90 hp where a warrior gets 100? From what i read elsewhere generally warriors are expected to have about 20-30% more hp's than an equivalent knight? On this class specific item that general guideline is ignored, now if that is happening with elemental armours and etc then warriors could validly argue that their only current advantage (such as it is) just gets more and more eroded....<br />
<br />
Personally I don't consider hp's as a valid balance issue these days but I can see their point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two examples, for those with the intelligence to understand:<br />
<br />
Level 59 Paladin spell:<br />
Celestial Cleansing<br />
Mana cost: 225<br />
HP restored: 700<br />
Ratio of HP to mana - 3 (this means 3 HP are restored for each point of mana expended).<br />
<br />
Level 63 Paladin spell:<br />
Light of Nife<br />
Mana cost: 400<br />
HP restored: 850<br />
Ratio of HP to mana - 2 (this means 2 HP are restored for each point of mana expended)<br />
<br />
Using these ratios 80 mana is 240 HP restored using Celestial Cleansing and 160 HP restored using Light of Nife.  Doesn't it make sense that an equal piece of Warrior gear should give 150-200HP if the Paladin receives 90 HP and 80 mana?  Be sensible.  A mere 10% more is pretty meaningless.  10 HP all the time does not equal 240 HP or 160 HP on command, now does it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it doesn't make sense. It's more retarded whining and it sounds like druids. 200hp???? Are you high? While I agree that we should definately have a better HP advantage to compensate for the mana(and effective mana, dun forget wis/int) anything close to 1:1 is ridiculous. Top knights have 2500+ mana from gear. So equivalent warriors should be what, 10000+hp unbuffed by your theories?<br />
<br />
 While it's nice to rant and rave and post retarded bullshit, there's still game balance to think about. What should *really* be done is lower the HP/AC on their gear, to restore some balance. But that won't happen. But slapping another 1500+hp onto my mid-high gear is ridiculous and stupid to even propose.<br />
<br />
 As for the general whining that is quickly becoming the trademark of our class, well that's what this forum was made for at least. Grats Jr. Monks.</div></div><hr />

Yes, if you give the hybrids mana and intel/wis we should get more than 10hps and 2AC additional. You are the moron for saying we shouldn't. You have no clue of class balancing and neither does Sony. Mana matters in this game (duh) and all the Knights like to downplay it, well if it didn't matter they would be warriors right? No, they have heals and life taps, unlimited aggro control, and at earlier levels fear kited for easy exp. So stuff it if you can't figure out warriors should get something additional in the melee department.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't want our class, the warrior class to get better fine. <br />
<br />
But for the rest of us who give a damn, SHUT YOUR FUKING PIE HOLE.  We could give up, bend over and take it, make a new class. BUT WE DON'T WANT TO!<br />
<br />
So if all you come here to do is to tell us to stop whining, GO TO HELL and join the hybrids.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna complain until SOE either banns me or makes positive changes for warriors and pure melee. If you don't like it, tough. But don't tell people who aren't blinding themselves from the truth to quit the game. Find a different forum for that. This is the outhouse, the place for the rants. You don't like it talk to the mods or get off these boards!<br />
<br />
But don't tell another poster to stop complaining at the sorry excuse for class balancing just because you don't wanna hear it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I hate is for a person to tell someone else to stop complaining about real problems. Which is what pino did in his first post. I didn't bother reading the rest of his posts until later, dribble that they were.<br />
<br />
So yeah, anyone who tells warriors to stop complaing on the rant forum should stfu or form a really good argument as to why warriors shouldn't be complaining. Just telling us to stop complaining neither solves our problems or gets us to stop complaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But telling him to stop complaining gave us 1sec recycle on AE taunt and innate 40% mitigation?<br />
<br />
 I personally tell warriors to stop complaining. It's even possible that my 1st post about it was the basis for this entire forum getting made. It's gotten to be fucking ridiculous. It's not well thought out, convincing arguments. It's bullshit garbage spouted out from ill informed fuckwits with daft fucks like you backing them up with some sort of martyr complex. Like you're some crusader who is making a real difference in the world.<br />
<br />
 Asking for double knight HP's on gear doesn't turn any SoE people's heads and make them think &quot;Hmm, maybe they have a point&quot;. It makes them look at us and think it's the complaining of mindless assholes. BECAUSE IT IS!<br />
<br />
 I'm all for well thought out, constructive discussion. It accomplishes something. But spewing out every stupid self serving bullshit idea that pops into your head and pretending like it's solid gold and not the festering pile of shit it actually is accomplishes nothing. 500 posts declaring Knights to be God's that are able to cure cancer and feed the hungry don't accomplish anything. They're made by melodramatic shitheels and backed up by spineless dicks(as opposed to my dick which has a sturdy and straight spine).<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in a group last night and a paladin tanked!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Followed by 50 posts of<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! It happened to me once! NERF KNIGHTS! WARRIORS NEED DEFENSIVE ALL THE TIME!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Is stupid and just makes us look whiney and stupid as a whole.<br />

 I sure as a motherfucker didn't elect you as representative, lord, savior, or Joan of Fucking Arc of my class. Go throw your stupid ass on another cross, so far all you've done for me is make me hate my own class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't say 1:1.  But come on, you think 1:8 is a reasonable ratio?  We get 10 HP, they get 80 mana?  You think 10 HP = 80 mana = 240 HP HoT = 160 HP quick heal?  I beg to differ.  That's farked up.  Tell me that it isn't.<br />
<br />
If we got 150 HP to their 90 HP this would in fact be 60 HP more which would be 1:1.3.  So we'd have 60 HP = 80 mana = 240 HP HOT = 160 HP quick heal.  Much more realistic.  Much more in line advantages that mana gives you. <br />
<br />
Anyone who can't see this is a retard and probably should be playing a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heck,<br />
I am not saying add 1 hp per every point of mana. <br />
Realistically, I would have hoped for ac 30, 20 str 15 agi 20 sta 15 dex 150hp <br />
Is asking for that too outrageous being at that point you have access to Time?<br />
<br />
No, My point in general was if warriors are to be a itemization class, Then make items for us, Not just watered down hybrid available gear as well.<br />
<br />
As it stands to get good war only gear you have to kill god's or AoW. Why ? WHY in the name of heaven do we as a class have to achieve said feats to get items designed for our class when other class items fall like candy from everywhere else?<br />
<br />
My only bitch and moan session is that warrior's are a intirely gear dependent class, and yet 95% of our equipment is available to hybrids as well,  Yet if you turn it around only 62% of what a hybrid can equip is also war usable.<br />
<br />
Can we see the problem here? Maybe Grim cant or Dumb_AssClownSK_01 cant. But asking for simple things that define our class which SoE has promised to fix, and fix, and fix yet never does ( move faster mule Hiya! or you wont get your carrot) a bad or horrible thought?<br />
<br />
Maybe if your Uber_headupyourownassPaladin_01 it's a bad thing, Or maybe your in uber_guild_01 and you think improvements may trivialize your job. Or you might be the idioit off the shortbus that thinks their cool because they make dumb comments and hit themselves in a face. <br />
<br />
Anyway it goes, Some of us want to make improvements to the class, Some like to belittle said people, Other's want to keep their phat aggro lewtness. Me I just want my fricking class fixed.<br />
<br />
Its just too bad that a lot of people fail to realize that hey, The Main-Tank made this possible, He is the guy breaking his fingers hitting taunt and using defensive to do AoW, to Do Vulak, Aary, Empereor, Aten Ha ra, Terris MB. etc etc etc. <br />
<br />
I sure the hell bet it wasnt a fricking hybrid steping up to do those bad asses when it was your guild's time.  <br />
<br />
Warrior's make or break a high end encounter.  Giving them better class gear wont trivalize it, if you believe that BS lemme have some of what your smoking.  Warriors that argue trivalize are more then likely elementally equiped and dont want more people getting up to a level to compete wth them. Pal's SK's think they will get neutered out of a job.  <br />
<br />
You guys are wrong, Its too bad you cant see the advantages of it.  All you can see is your inflated uber lewtness.<br />

 Durrr Glat? You even quoted that line from me then continued making that post?<br />

 Seriously, you people can not possibly be reading what I write. I fully recognize that there are problems. I recognize what those problems are. I also recognize that acting like monks isn't going to solve them. See where asking for over the top shit got them? Nerfed and bitchslapped.<br />
<br />
 As for an actual ratio, 3-4mana = 1hp would be about as far as you could even remotely reasonably ask.<br />

<br />
 Yeah, it's tough to grasp onto your theory that more HP's would let us have more HP's. You're a regular Alfred Einstein! If only all my &quot;inflated uber lewtness&quot; wasn't blocking my vision. God damned...uh...lewtness.<br />
<br />
 Anyhoo, I gotta get back to ubering all my lewtness, let me know how those 170hp charms turn out. Man, I can't get enough lewtness, especially the uber variety, though I do loves me some phat agro lewtness occasionally. Good luck brave crusaders, you'll be in the prayers of the rest of us merely mortal cowards who don't dare put our necks on the line for the good of the community.<br />

It's entirely another to assume that their premise is wrong becuase they haven't considered the conclusions' ramification.<br />
<br />
I too think that it'd be insane to give warriors a 1:1 ratio of HP/Mana, but you know what?   I think that the concept is pretty valid.    The power gained from 90hp/80 mana is SIGNIFICANTLY more than the power gained from 100hp.   You can deny all you want but you'll be wrong.   <br />
<br />
Now, going &quot;170hp vs. 90/80&quot; is asinine as well, but the idea isn't too bad of assessing the benefits from the mana gain and giving a small percentage of that based on some balancing factor...   the thing is, you dont' REALLY need to be a dick to disagree, all you have to do is point out where it's problematic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then how about adding something constructive rather than ranting about how people are behaving like Druids?  You have a ratio in mind, suggest it.  Otherwise, you're just bitching about people bitching.  Too bad, so sad.   We see the problems, we want to say something about them, and unless the mods ban us, we will.  People need to deal with that reality.<br />
<br />
Like Frodlin said so clearly:<br />
<br />
I too think that it'd be insane to give warriors a 1:1 ratio of HP/Mana, but you know what? I think that the concept is pretty valid. The power gained from 90hp/80 mana is SIGNIFICANTLY more than the power gained from 100hp. You can deny all you want but you'll be wrong. <br />
<br />
So rather than being satisfied with the &quot;concept&quot; of us constantly getting either the exact same HP as a Hybrid tank or a trivial amount more like 10 HP, how about we get enough to offset the clear advantage of mana?  Or is that logic just to simple to make sense?  <br />
<br />
And this is not so much about the charm as it is about itemization in general that has been giving it to Warriors up the arse since Velious.  If our HP is supposed to be such a huge advantage, why are Hybrids walking around with 1500-2500 mana and we're walking around with 600-1k more HP, if we're lucky enough to have that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, you clueless retards. Did you even bother reading the thread!? The point isnt about this particular item!! It was used as an example of items deemed &quot;balanced&quot; for comparison between Warriors and in this case Paladins. The point is general itemisation across the game, particularly in PoP, where warriors are lacking in a huge way.<br />
<br />
Warriors are nearly completely gear dependant, minus our 3 minutes of glory in Evasive or Defensive. Make gear with very very marginal differences for HP/AC between hybrids, but all the benefits of mana and spells and it leads to where we are now.<br />

I think pino got and gets flamed for entirely different reasons than disagreeing.  I'm pretty sure that pino gets flamed for making bold statements and not explaining them, and then implying that if he has to explain them then those who ask for it are stupid (I think the term he used was 'retards').<br />
<br />
On another forum I asked Pino to back up a claim once... I'm still waiting for him to do so.  He implied to me that I was retarded for making a claim (that warriors mitigate the same as Knights in identical AC).   I offerred him evidence to the contrary which he has yet to acknowledge, and has seemingly disappeared from this discussion.    <br />
<br />
People who make one line statements, who's only backup is &quot;agree with me or you're a retard&quot; are going to get called on the carpet for it.   It happens on every forum everywhere.  This isn't exclusive to TSW boards, this issue, Pino or anything... hell, go look at Seventhsword or Goodwind on the PoN boards.. they take crap all the time for similar things.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does kind of seem like SoE considers mana some kind of freebie, or semi-irrelevancy. Why they should value mana at 1/10th of a hp (or whatever that pretty low value is, assuming they consider warrior and paladin PoP charms balanced) is hard to see. Even Grimmlokk's sort of proposed ratio of 3-4/1 is *substantially* more than now, and would in fact end up with what some might think of as crazy looking charms.<br />
<br />
Just as a thought experiment: A 65 paladin in normal gear has what? 3k mana? 3.5k mana? If there were a correction from 1-10 hp/mana to 1-3 hp/mana, that would mean adding 700 hps to the average 65 warrior?<br />
<br />
1/10 ratio = 300 hps = 3000 mana<br />
1/3 ratio = 1000 hps = 3000 mana<br />
difference = 700 hps<br />
<br />
There are 14 slots, so 700/14 = 50, so the charm should have 50 extra hps on it (assuming the correction, etc).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not proposing adding 700 hps to every 65 warrior, or even 50 to the charm, but I don't think it's crazy, from a class balance perspective, to consider seriously changing the relation between hp and mana. Changing this relation would be a generalized way to balance caster and melee classes.<br />
<br />
By the way, I see from EQRankings that well-equipped paladins are easily breaking 4k mana, and some have over 5k mana. There are 1522 paladins in EQRankings (of all levels, unfortunately). The modal paladin (position number 761) in that list when sorted by mana, has just over 3k mana. I think when the non-65s are eliminated the number would rise to around 3500, but EQRankings doesn't let you do that, and I didn't feel like copying and pasting all that data.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Okay, one important point. The 1/10 ratio is derived simply from the difference in the pop charm, standing in for gear in general. However, the average warrior has maybe 800 hps more than the average paladin (less in my guild though - I have 500 more than our guild knights), who still has his average 3500 mana. On that basis, SoE is valuing mana at 1/4 approximately of an hp. BUT, that's blurred by gear, like charms! They appear to have two standards: innate and gear. One could argue that it's itemization that's been killing us, or that fact that paladins are looting armor with 90% of the hps and mana at a substantially higher ratio than they used to get, or do get innately. Dunno if this all makes sense.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Okay, I created some magelos: Nakedwar and Nakedpal. Both are human, level 65, with no AA. Nakedwar put 20 points into sta and 5 into dex at creation; Nakedpal put 10 points into sta and 10 into wis.<br />
<br />
Nakedwar - 2637 hps<br />
Nakedpal - 2202 hps 1300 mana<br />
<br />
That's 435 hps for 1300 mana, or about 1/3. Obviously that's a lot bigger than the ratio on gear, and suggests that warriors are losing ground, hp-wise, relative to the growth of hybrid mana on every piece of gear looted.<br />
<br />
Itemization, or the fact that paladins are getting a ton of extra mana relative to additional warrior hps, is certainly a big part of the class balance problem.<br />
<br />
The magelos are <br />
<br />
Nakedwar (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=718901) <br />
Nakedpal (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=718905)<br />
<br />
EDIT: I dont' know where to find this data for the PoP stuff, but here are some hp/mana ratios from previous armor sets:<br />
<br />
Kunark<br />
Paladin AC: 177  HP: 50  Mana: 50  Wis: 10  Sta: 0<br />
Warrior AC: 195  HP: 50  Mana: -    Wis: -   Sta: 20<br />
<br />
Velious (Skyshrine)<br />
Paladin AC: 206  HP: 270  Mana: 90  Wis: 32  Sta: 39<br />
Warrior AC: 250  HP: 335  Mana: -   Wis:  -  Sta: 31<br />
<br />
Ornate (PoK)<br />
Paladin AC: 255  HP: 410  Mana: 350  Wis: 42  Sta: 40<br />
Warrior AC: 298  HP: 530  Mana: -   Wis: -    Sta: 60<br />
<br />
Note that 2 bracers included in every set. <br />
<br />
A few things jump out. Number 1 is the huge bump in mana for paladins with Ornate, relative to prior sets. That's in line with other itemization changes. Note that warriors and paladins, however, got the same hps on their Kunark sets, and that paladins got *more* sta on their Skyshrine armor. I included wis and sta, because those are convertible to mana and hps, and in every case, the ratio there favors paladins.<br />
<br />
Ratio of hps for armor sets (paladin/warrior):<br />
Kunark: 50/50 = 100% residual 0<br />
Skyshrine: 270/335 = 80% residual 65<br />
Ornate: 410/530 = 77% residual 120<br />
<br />
The residual here is the difference between warrior and paladin hp for the set.<br />
<br />
residual hp/mana (not including wis or sta):<br />
Kunark: 0/50 = ?<br />
Skyshrine: 65/90 = 72%<br />
Ornate: 120/350 = 34%<br />
<br />
Higher end paladins are gaining a ton of extra mana, relative to the gain in hps. <br />
<br />

The main thing being argued here between our big spats of stupid is item based mana vs. hp. As I said many moons ago(yesterday), top paladins gain 2000-2500 mana directly from gear(Mana only, not int/wis). Meaning gear only we should probably be getting 400-500ish raw hp over them. As it is top warriors get about 3000hp *raw* from gear. Top knights 2800-2900. This is the problem. It should be 2500ish for the top knights. But that would be a huge nerf, and will never happen. Only choice is to leave it as it is, poorly balanced for us, or to boost us up, further trivializing content. And yes, 400hp on your main tank is a huge difference over-all. Our HP per stamina is where 90% of our HP advantage comes from. What they could maybe do to help balance the HP differences is restore stamina to full benefit after 255.<br />

 Oh, and sorta on topic but not really. Warriors typically have a *slightly* better AC advantage over knights. Assuming similar gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/nod And I fully expect that to be completely gone if they ever implement the shield changes they're talking about.  They're much more likely to make shields beneficial for Knights, since they're already designed towards that end, than for Warriors.   The most likely outcome in my mind is that Knights will use shields regularly thereby averaging greater AC than a Warrior.  Of course this is complete speculation based completely on SoE's previous history.  Maybe they'll surprise me.  But I'm not holding my breath.</div></div><hr />

The answer is yes. I guess we suspected that before, but I wanted to prove it to myself for my own satisfaction. Basically, I think we've reached the same conclusions; I just wanted to work it out.<br />
<br />
Note that just as paladins are getting more and more mana per hp as they progress, the rate at which they regen that mana is increasing dramatically. Warriors are losing out in several directions here.<br />
<br />
This means that in part the power imbalance between warriors and paladins isn't just due to the importance of aggro in pop -- at a basic level due to itemization, paladins are also simply gaining power (in the form of extra mana per hp) relative to warriors.</div></div><hr />

Yeah yeah.  You have a point.  But some people don't understand anything other than that.

That's kind of the point. NToV, Luclin, and PoP itemization favors paladins more and more the further up you go. In the mana dimension, at least, they've opened the floodgates. Paladins are getting more and more mana, and regenning it faster and faster (never mind which additional spells they can cast, or high ratio weapons they loot, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK...<br />
<br />
yes i said 1hp==1 mana....that was said to make a point, i dont ever believe we would get a 1 to 1 ratio at the current inflated mana of hybrid gear..<br />
<br />
HYBRIDS are supposed to be blends of casters and melee, supposedly they pay for this melee ability by limited spell casting, and pay for the spell casting by limited melee ability. IN exchange for this they pay a penalty in experience and progress slower...<br />
<br />
THAT is the standard of EVERY RPG in existence...<br />
except... EQ removed the xp penalty, hybrids are AT LEAST 80% as effective as melee by their own admission... 80% dps, 80% hps, 80% ac... and they hvae virtually unlimited use of their spells with all the hp regen/gear available, since their spells were designed for smaller mana pools and have lower casting cost, so they are probably at least 60-70% as effective as a caster at what they do...<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at a few things...<br />
<br />
HYBRIDS != Pure Casters<br />
HYBRIDS != Pure Melee<br />
<br />
so should... <br />
<br />
hybrid gear mana == 90%(pure caster gear mana) <br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
hybrid gear hp == 90%(pure melee gear hp)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OR INSTEAD should...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hybrid gear mana == 50% (pure caster gear mana) <br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
hybrid gear hp == 50% (pure melee gear hp)<br />
<br />
<br />
YOU tell me which is closer to the truth?<br />
<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
The problem is much deeper than just simple numbers, the balance of pure classes vs hybrids is so great. it would require much time and effort to fix. <br />
<br />
With the Current status quo, Hybrids are the way to go, all the benefits, no drawbacks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
several people have come into this thread and made some rather ass backwards comments, which I am going to paraphrase here:<br />
<br />
WAR, PAL, and SHD are all tank classes, and should all be equally viable replacements for each other in an exp group setting<br />
<br />
...now we have reached the part of the thread where I tell you, the halfwits making these comments, to shut the fuck up.  no, seriously, shut the fuck up.  you, with your pathetic ideas about 'fariness' and 'equality' and 'cant we all just get along?'  you, who wouldnt know class balance if it was sittin in the parking lot, waiting to give you gonorrhea.<br />
<br />
there is THE tank class, and then there are the 'servicable replacement' tank classes.  and the second you get these categories confused (for the developers, this happened sometime around Velious), you no longer have a right to talk about class balance.  freedom of speech does not extend to fucking retarded opinions, sorry.<br />
<br />
When the warrior leaves your group, you should have a clear set of options.  either A you find another warrior and life goes on, or B you find a &quot;servicable replacement&quot; tank and life goes on, but just not quite as swimmingly.  ANY OTHER SITUATION - such as the current one, where warriors are the third choice - is unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Why, you ask, as you sit there FD'ed reading this messageboard, Shadowknights?  Why, you ask, as you med up after rezzing yourself, Paladin?<br />
<br />
BECAUSE WE GAVE UP EVERYTHING TO BE THE TANK CLASS, AND IF WE LOSE THIS POSITION, WE GAVE UP EVERYTHING FOR NO REASON.<br />
<br />
Remove all agro from PAL and SHD spells and you know what youd have?  Warriors would be the preferred tank.. PREFERRED... what a concept.  Its called Balance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My intial post to this thread (when I started it) Was basic itemization.  The charm that was given was only the ammo. Why is it that its war only and yet is only slightly better then the Pal/SK verision? Thats my point.<br />
<br />
Why is a class that is based upon our gear solely screwed on that one fact? Why do the items we need to do said job (for aggro) come off god's or avatars? <br />
<br />
Why is it itemization for warriors are so trully messed up?<br />
Thats what my orginal post was about, That and the supposed melee balance that they have been looking into for several months now. (even as casters become more powerful. Didja hear bout the cleric whom soloed Ragefire for their epic?)<br />
<br />
I say this now. More HP's and better aggro capabalties WILL NOT trivialize encounter's.   To anyone that say's otherwise to you i say show me proof.  How will it trivialize Reparm?  How will it trivalize Fenin? Or Xegony?  More HP and Better aggro control will not do CRAP to said encounter's.  It may even save people's raid's. <br />
<br />
So why advocate agaisnt it?  Are the people doing so in Time? Do they think that more guilds given these things will let them advance to the big boy playground? <br />
<br />
Make more warrior only gear drop. Its our time now. Not the hybrid's.  Thats what this is about, The item drops in Pop are trivalized by the fact that almost everything that drops is war/pal/sk  or Pal or SHD.  We need items that come out weapon wise/armor wise that is war only in mid tier 1-3 in PoP.  War only gear.<br />
<br />
Am I asking for a lot? I dont think so. Just more toy's for a class that is ITEM dependent.<br />
<br />
C'mon Sony do something for us for a change.<br />
