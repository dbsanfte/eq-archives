Thanks in advance.<br />

EDIT:  Forgot to mention...weapons in my magelo.  Should mention that I had a SotB and a CHoS and these seem to hold aggro as well and I do more damage.</div></div><hr />

Get either a pair of droga weapons or a Greatstaff of thunder.  Personally i'm a fan of the staff and it would save you 10k or so ... the aggro and dps is roughly equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As usual, as apolyon said, buy a droga pair or a GSoT. Aug them with A3 or Ykesha, your choice. Hell, buy both. Can we sticky this or make a FAQ or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm slightly less of a fan of GSoT than Apo, but as per one of your other posts, I mentioned the GSoT because a 55 warior without a lot of plat and who is wearing 22% haste is way better off with getting the GSoT and working on haste than scraping up 10K for the droga pair and then getting haste.<br />
The GSoT will put you in the same ballpark in terms of aggro as the droga pair, and planer Strike proc is much better than what you've got now for aggro. For 200 plat you can forget about your weapon for a bit while you deal with haste and better AC.<br />
If there's a &quot;classic case&quot; for using a GSoT, your situation is it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I did notice someone named Uganok posted below me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">D'oh!<br />
Beg your pardon.<br />
Depending on your plat situation, either the droga or GSoT would work, as Apo (and everyone here, problably) would say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felnar</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree-Droga pair, GSoT, or both.  If you're strapped for cash go with the GSoT and work on haste as previously mentioned.  If not, get both and see which works best for you.<br />
<br />
Honestly I feel it's not a bad idea to use GSoT until you get at least 65 and 1 or 2 pts each in CA/CS.  Before then I feel the riposte difference has more of an impact, even if you are using defensive/evasive/stonewall and fortitude/furious.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well your magelo doesn't have much flaws, everything seams good for now, excaet your weapons.<br />
As everybody other said CHoS / SotB or the GSoT are the best aggro weapon avaiable for your lvl and your money. <br />
But since you already have the droga combe (as you said in your EDIT) just buy the GSoT and alternate the DW and the 2Her to know what is better depending on sittuation and your lvl, nevertheless you will keep them both untill lvl 65.<br />
<br />
if you want to get some dps for when you aren't tanking buy a War Marschall Bladded Staff (it will last you long too, and it's cheap) or use your F. Exe. Axe<br />
<br />
<br />
well as I started your within the margin of your progression so for now your gears are fine, you just need some lvl :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun,<br />

Now thats good advice...thanks Yoda.  I can sell these weapons and end up making money when I buy the CHoS and SotB again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure about that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, just in case you haven't noticed the thread linked below, you can check it out. Most of the aggro weapons &gt; droga/GSoT are what I'd consider pretty darn spendy, or, in the large majority of cases, no drop. So, they come later in your career:<br />
