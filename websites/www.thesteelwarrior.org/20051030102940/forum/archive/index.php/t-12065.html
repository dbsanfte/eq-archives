<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">06-24-2005, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am thinking of shelving my warrior (like I would seriously put him down for too long, pfft) for a bit to level my Paladin.  Unlike other paladins, I do not want to be a warrior that can heal.  I was thinking of making a frontline invulnerable healer for PvP.  The idea being I would be a warrior's best friend, focusing on healing them so they could bring the smack down.<br />
<br />
My idea was a 31 Prot/20 holy Paladin.  While not the most powerful healer, I would be able to heal without worrying about getting attacked.  I would have redoubt, holy shield, thorium shield spike, and reckoning.  I was thinking of getting engineering in order to eventually get Reactive Force Shield for even more return damage on block.  People attacking me would end up impaling themselves on me.  From healing I would get Focus, Illumination, Divine Wisdom, and divine favor.  That would allow me to get heals off and maintain mana, using blessing of wisdom and seal of wisdom, in order to keep the heals and cleanses coming for warrior buddies, and others.<br />
<br />
I think it would be fun, especially knowing that with my help, good warriors could become godlike with my backing.  I get so tired of our servers normal selfish paladins, that I want to make a paladin the way they should be, the powerful unlillable support class that other warriors would love to have with them all the time instead of being irritated everytime they saw a paladin.</div></div><hr />
