<br />
Could this be the hate value for it? If so that would seem to me why some people have absolute great luck with stun procs and others say it sucks ass, because of it's complete randomness.<br />

/shrug thought i'd bring it up, it's 3am and i'm rambling =p</div></div><hr />

Don't really think this is gonna be an aggro upgrade tho.  Even NPC casted spells have the &quot;Changed Base2_2 from 0 to 2000&quot; like Trample, for instance.<br />

<br />
For example, for a stun on a slot X :<br />
<br />
- 1s stun =&gt; baseX = 1000 / base2_X = 500 (Anger (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=3624&amp;source=Test), Force of Ykesha (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=4358&amp;source=Test), Pestilence Shock Strike (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=3862&amp;source=Test), Call of Fire Strike (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=3131&amp;source=Test))<br />
<br />
- 2s stun =&gt; baseX = 2000 / base2_X = 2000 (Trample (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=4577&amp;source=Test))<br />
<br />
- 3s stun =&gt; baseX = 3000 / base2_X = 3000 (Time Rend (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=3878&amp;source=Test), Static Blow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=5544&amp;source=Test))<br />
<br />
- 4s stun =&gt; baseX = 4000 / base2_X = 4000 (Ancient Force of Jeron (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=5299&amp;source=Test))<br />
<br />
- Ys stun (with Y &gt; 5) =&gt; baseX = Y000 / base2_X = 5250 (Tactical Strike (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=3755&amp;source=Test), Serene Command (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=5292&amp;source=Test))<br />

If those are really hate values of stuns, it makes Fleshbiter very interesting !</div></div><hr />

But that seems like a pretty ridiculous value for aggro to be honest with you. 3000? Pretty damn high.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they will change all the (stun/10.0) descriptions that we've known have been wrong since the first one was created.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, mobs can certain stun you a lot longer than 5.25seconds.<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see if that effects mobs too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think stun duration and hate generated have any sort of direct correlation.  Mage PoP+ Air pets, as well as the Epic pet, are capable of stunning mobs up to level 6000 (Yes, 6000) for 3 seconds, yet they certainly DO NOT generate shittons of hate like Paladin stuns do.  If anything, I'm pretty certain all spell/proc amounts are stored and calculated entirely serverside.  After all, the server is what does the agro calculations in the first place.  Why waste bandwith sending that information back and forth to the client anyways? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nastasja performed a parse on PoN that showed there are three levels of Paladin Stuns:<br />
<br />
Non-Damaging Stuns - 700 hate<br />
DD Stuns - 800 Hate<br />
AA Stuns - 520 Hate<br />
<br />
Stun duration does not affect aggro.  Also, SOE has admitted that there are no 10 second PC stuns, they are in fact 5 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Does this mean the proc augs are considered a DD stun? And if so they are more agro then a angerIII aug right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No clue, the parse done by Nastasja (over on PoN) was only looking at Paladin Stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think SoE would be stupid enougth to put hate value on spell data because it would trivialise our job. Moreover I think it's the real stun duration : baseX being the duration (multiplied by 1000) showed and base2_X being the duration (multiplied by 1000) used. thus all the 1s stun are actually 0.5s long and all stuns are actually capped at 5.25s long (on test server of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whopping</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duration caps on stuns used to be hard-coded but we're moving that to spell data instead, hence the 573 changes reported on Lucy.  The change should be seamless in-game.  Though we've modified the way the data is handled behind the scenes, the spells should function exactly the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good explanation on paladin board too:<br />
<br />
http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm22.showMessage?topicID=1530.topic<br />
<br />
Summary: the new values are duration caps in ms, not hate values.<br />
<br />
We have known since 10.0 second stuns were introduced and given to us with absurdly high mana costs that they never did and never will stun for 10.0 seconds. We couldnt offer up a reasonable explination for this, people thought the turning of a full tick stunned would break stun, some thought it was other stuns causing it to break early (which you could disprove), others just figured spells were hardcoded to NOT stun for the full 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
It is the latter who are correct, shown in Lucy's current update.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, for a stun on a slot X :<br />
<br />
- 1s stun =&gt; baseX = 1000 / base2_X = 500 (Anger, Force of Ykesha, Pestilence Shock Strike, Call of Fire Strike)<br />
<br />
- 2s stun =&gt; baseX = 2000 / base2_X = 2000 (Trample)<br />
<br />
- 3s stun =&gt; baseX = 3000 / base2_X = 3000 (Time Rend, Static Blow)<br />
<br />
- 4s stun =&gt; baseX = 4000 / base2_X = 4000 (Ancient Force of Jeron)<br />
<br />
- Ys stun (with Y &gt; 5) =&gt; baseX = Y000 / base2_X = 5250 (Tactical Strike, Serene Command)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Base1 - base_4 are linked to stun duration on players (why tactical strike CAN stun you, the recipient of it, for 30s, but on a mob, if it were possible, the base2_x value is used, which is why mobs will never stay stunned for the full duration of any stun spell lasting over 5.25 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stun duration on a Player casted spell caps out at 5.25 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
So as we have known for years, there is<br />
<br />
NO SUCH THING<br />
<br />
as a 10.0 sec stun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont believe me? Try it for yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you Lucy for finally showing us what the deal is.</div></div><hr />

would be better aggro than chos, and sotb( 0 second stun)?  Or am I high?  <br />
That is the stun duration I found on lucy for rocksmash proc.  Im just asking as these are budget weapons, and im not a high ender.  <br />

<br />
Then... simple question.<br />
FB and EoE.<br />
FB proc = 125dd + stun (3.0/65) ///// EoE proc = 150dd + stun (0.0/68)<br />
Which proc gives more aggro?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then... simple question.<br />
Reinforced Sandstone-Hilt Sword and Copper Hammer of Destruction and Peable Crusher.<br />
///// RS-HS proc = 30dd + stun (2.0/55) <br />
///// CHoS proc = 150dd + stun (0.0/55) <br />
///// PB proc = 0dd + stun (4.0/55)<br />
Which proc gives more aggro?<br />
<br />
<br />

BBoB proc = Anger<br />
DBoW proc = Anger<br />
<br />
Which proc gives more aggro??</div></div><hr />
