<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From what ive seen the 15 ac and 25 hp/mana/end are pretty common drops. assuming you can have your choice, id probably go for the 15 ac as i dont normally have endurance problems (and thats even before forthcoming endurance problems to items). <br />
<br />
was wondering which ones you guys been plumbing for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they are lore - get both</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I want em both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was just looking on allakhazam and there are 2 of each type of augment each with a different name so...yeah they are lore but you can get 2 +15 ac augments and 2 +25 hp augments.  Which i find quite cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My group got both 15ac aug and 25hp/mana/end augs in the same dungeon crawl.  I can't tell you how glad I am I yielded the 25hp to the bard and then ended up getting the 15ac by default :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">other then these augments, there is also a 36% haste augment that is type 7 and fits in most all slots.........my question is should i get this augment or stick with my 41% haste neck item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i know they are lore, what i meant was which one would you choose...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Originally posted by gulug <br />
i know they are lore, what i meant was which one would you choose...  <br />
Well, if I had to choose, I'd take the 15 ac augment... and that's coming from someone that could benefit from the 25 mana portion of the alternative, as well as just the hp.<br />
<br />
But seriously, just between gloves and both bracers, that's 3 slots that previously didn't have any exceptional choices for augments(unless you raided LDoN a lot).  3 slots that could use good augments, we now have 4 new augments that aren't hard to get... why is there any choice involved?  Get them all, as stated earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are 2 differenet named augs of each type, just in ferubi.<br />
<br />
2 different 25hp/mana/END<br />
2 differetn 15 AC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gauntlets just scream out for a 30hp/30End augment from the tipt trial.<br />
<br />
The enraged mother here is awesome, drops 30hp/mana, 30hp/end, AoB, 2 FT/regen augments. And is an easy farm.. 30-45 minutes. Always drop..<br />
<br />
get em while you can..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Two two northen Ferubi elites, Pxet Elite Blademaster and Pxet Elite Spearmaster, always drop their 25/25/25 aug. They're lore, and they always drop the same thing, so at most you can get two.<br />
<br />
The two southern ones, the Pxet Elite Brawler and Pxet Elite Hammermaster, always drop 15 AC augs, but they are also lore, so at most you can get two. I got the two AC augs and didn't worry about the 25/25/25 ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also:<br />
<br />
Plenty of different 15ac augs in Kod'Taz and the Smith raid area in Ferubi (type7/8)<br />
<br />

<br />

A monk and a warrior using riposte discs can kill most of the blue/white con hynid/rager named with just the 2 of them. Add a little more dps and you can riposte-kill the Pixtt and Hextt named from temples easy too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would just like to point out that having these augs flip to type8 in KodTaz and beyond is pretty lame.<br />
<br />
Im a pre-elemental, pre-VT warrior that can still max buff at 10400 or so.  I finished sewers, vxed, and gotten to boss in Tipt all pretty easily.  Its gonna suck if I did all this to get to KodTaz and find out that I cant use any of the loot.<br />
<br />
If they truly intended this to be only for time+ players the trials should have been a LOT harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">All of the loot that drops in Kod'Taz and the Ikkinz trials, normal loot and augments, are type 8.  It wouldn't make sense to drop type 7 augments in a place where type 8 armor drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dagz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There is also another +35hp aug from KodTaz,can't for the life of me remeber named that dropped it but got it twice now.<br />

Notched Sandstone of Health<br />
Magic Item No Drop Augmentation (Non-lore)<br />
Type:8  +35hp<br />
slot:ear, neck, shoulders, fingers<br />
  <br />
Also what mob drops the Unweildy Irestone of Savagery (50/50/50)?  Ive heard maybe Venomblade but not sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It appears that the augment loots in Kod'taz off of named mobs (Howler, Rager, etc) are random drops.. they all share the same 7 or 8 augment table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I got two very special Augs so far.<br />
<br />
In Yxxta off a golem named I aquired the very leet &quot;Hollow Stone of Wind&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
35 endurance type 8...<br />
<br />
And then,a few days later in Second Ikkinz trial good fortune smiled upon me again,when I recived yet another endurance augment,only this one was for 50 endurance!....<br />
<br />
<br />
Die endurance Augments,die die die die die die die.<br />
<br />
<br />
On that same note,the 50 end aug was type 8 and only fit in shoulders,back neck face and waist,which happens to be the same slots that ldon 10 ac augs go in.Genius.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The 50/50/50 aug which is the best in KT comes from both white and yellow named from what I have seen,One off a Ukun named &quot;rav&quot; something and another of an Anuk yellow named.<br />
<br />
Also any of the augs that drop in KT will also drop in the 6man ikkinz trials off the Named Pixxt mobs,not the PA ,PS,PD ones but random named versions that can spawn in the trial,they are jsut trash hitting mobs but have the pixxt name....</div></div><hr />

Add another 100 for studiness 5, 100 for pot9, a few more HP from leadership and a few gear/augment upgrades and your at 10.4k.

Have +100 hp group leadership, max sturdiness, etc.  Thanks to the Tipt augs my Royal Attendant greaves have more HP than unauged Raex:<br />
 +40hp LDON aug<br />
 +30hp / 30e Tipt aug<br />
 +30hp / 30m Tipt aug<br />

Add in some AoW and Seru loots and its quite easy.  Now if I could only win the roll on the Tipt bracer....<br />
