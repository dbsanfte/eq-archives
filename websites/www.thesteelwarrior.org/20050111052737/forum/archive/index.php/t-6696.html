<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apologies if this is listed some place, but I couldn't find much when I tried to search ( I only got 5-6 threads, all fairly recent that mentioned VT...).<br />
<br />
I'm curious about the relative difficulties of mobs in VT.<br />
<br />
VT is pretty hotly contested on our server and the AHR cycle is pretty hard to find up if you're not Asian, European, or in an East Coast college :p. Last night my guild found a partial pop and decided to kill everything we could find. We started at DXXT, cleared in to and dropped VXAHR (mini Aten), then killed both KTXAHR (Blob 2) and killed Aten Ha Ra herself. In the past with the various repops/etc we have killed the TVXs, DXV, DXX, KTXAD, and TXD. <br />
<br />
I'm just curious how Thall Va Kelun (TVK) and Diabo Xi Va Temariel (DXVT) fit in the scale of difficulty. The other mobs seemed to be a pretty much progressive scale (well except AHR seemed a fair bit weaker than Blob 2, but I guess she does have silence and rampage) and I was curious if the others are the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TVK and DXVT should be just fine for you guys. Not very difficult. Will be stressfull though if you have to clear hall of ass  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TVK is probably the hardest mob in Vex Thal.  He is slowable, but unslowed he's freaking terrifying.  Mind you, he's also a rogue, so you gets his +backstab hit every time it refreshes, and I'm faily certain his regular hit (1000) is more than his backstab.  Add in the fact that he has about a million HP and rampages frequently, on top of the slow proc he has, he's pretty vicious.  <br />
<br />
Temariel is a wimp.  Aside from just having a ton of hp, he's slowable, doesn't rampage, doesn't flurry, and really doesn't AE all that often (1500dd).  Temariel is ranked up there as probably one of the easiest.</div></div><hr />

there are no difficult mobs in VT just have to stay awake to get to the nameds thats the hardest part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts exactly.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like fun.  Spend countless hours camping boring emp key parts and shards so you can spend more countless hours farming a boring zone!   :confused:</div></div><hr />

DXVT is an extreme wimp, we had one of our clerics MT him last time we did him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, something rather interesting - Temariel doesn't riposte.</div></div><hr />

heheh the 20+ minute fights on Blobs 2 were definately proof to that :) Thanks for the responses, guys.</div></div><hr />

He's a wizard, and I'm pretty sure his AE's are mostly casted really. Though they're probably his own personal spells. I haven't done VT in a year and a half, kinda old knowledge.</div></div><hr />
