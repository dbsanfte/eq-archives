<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jdogt515</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just recently started a warrior and have only worked on my 1hs and 2hs skills.  My 1hb, 2hb and peircing skills are at 0.  How important are these skills being that the epic is 1hs/2hs?  Whats the best way to raise them.  Especially when Im in a group im the main tank and I cant be using a 2hb or 1hb at a skill of 0.  Im sure I would be kicked out of the group.<br />
any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All the weapon skills should be trained.  You need to keep in mind that a weapon may become available to you that is of 1hb / 2hb / piercing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kragrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My 1hb sucks big but the rest are pretty much maxed out.   Piercing is an easy one just get your hands on an embalmers skinning knife, procs bandages for you and will help keep that skill up.  I will probably get ripped for this but I ignored the 1hb - 2hb till i was in my late 40's all I did then was get a half decent 2hb and use it every time I was in a raid.  It took about 6-7 levels to catch it up.<br />

Try and keep all skills up - you never know what your next big upgrade might be :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use all 5 melee weapon skills.  Currently I use 2 weapons, Greatstaff of Thunder 31/30 2hb with stun/move proc and Greatstaff of the Four Winds, 41/31 2hb with 75dd proc.  I don't even bother to carry 1h or 2hs weapons at this point.  As you can probably guess, I'm really happy I kept my 2hb skill up.<br />
<br />
That said, I am maxed in all 5 weapon skills so if anything drops, I can use it.<br />
<br />
Keeping all of your skills maxed as you move up in levels just isn't going to happen, something will always lag behind.  Once you hit the 40s, you can start getting everything to max and you should be maxed or damn close by the time your skills start increasing again in the 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I kept all my skills up from day 1 and im damn glad I did.  Pre-expansions there were really no 2hb weapons that were worth equiping as a warrior, but now there is a good weapon for every skill at just about every level.  When your tanking for a group always keep your best weapons equiped, but theres times when you arent tanking, or arent grouped.  just screw around with other weapons while you arent trying to grab agro and they'll stay pretty close with your others, from there when you get a good weapon with a skill that isnt maxed it'll go up fast.</div></div><hr />

  You've probably got a few training points lying around at your local Warrior's guildhouse. Those could be used to prime the pump - so to speak - but are not really necessary. Throw at least one training point into each.<br />
  After that, getting skill is a matter of swinging at XP-giving mobs.  Logic follows that the more swings you can get in, the faster your skill will raise. DEX helps too, so I'm told.  What worked for me to get lagging skills up was to get weapons that are fast for their type, and low hitters. Then get the best Haste I could afford. Then find a place where I could fight mobs that flee when low on HPs. If you can team up with a snarer this is much safer; or , just snare 'em yourself with a whip or Kunzar K'unch. After beating the mob into fleeing, I'd switch to my training weapon and lay into it. Brought peircing, 2HB, 1HB, and H2H all to max (for 30th) with this method.<br />
  A safer method that garners no XP is to ask groups that are in a XP area for your level if they mind you practicing on their kills. Always be polite, and mindful not to break their pattern of killing (off-tanking, mezz-breaking, etc.).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!  May Brell fill your cup with his own hand!<br />

Actually I was 57 when I got the Greatstaff of Thunder.  My 2hb skill was about 10 or so.  I got it maxed in about 2-3 days of casual exp grouping.  Great thing about that weapon is that even though my damage sucked, you still proc even on misses.  My role as tank didnt change while using it.<br />

Best bet is if you are raiding and the raid force is overkill (and you're not part of the MT line), get ure skills up there.</div></div><hr />
