<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eaphin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone fought this guy? Saw on Alla's that he only drops two things. Might he have more loot on him, just no PoP reason to kill him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guild tried him once about a month back with 3 groups just to see what happened and how we'd do. Well, we all went home wearin hammer prints on our bums. He hits decently hard and i cant recall if we were able to slow him. The room is surrounded with Tribunals who fire off a few different ae's to make things interesting.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, he used to be killable with a single group or two, but his loot table was too good for mob that easy to kill. So they made him harder but didnt change his loot table. So now you have a raid level mob with a crappy loot table, just not really worth it other than just to be able to say you did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No they changed his loot table. Upgraded stuff slightly.<br />
<br />
 Someone in guild linked a couple drops supposedly from him 2 nights ago so seems someone killed him. Looked about in line with what I'd expect from him. IE: Too weak for the encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think Silent Redemption guild kills him, you can try looking through their stuff. <br />
