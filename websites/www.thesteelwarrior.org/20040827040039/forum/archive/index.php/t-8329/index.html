<br />
A defensive-style ability (ie, one that reduces the damage you take from melee) that eats your endurance based off the amount of damage it soaks.<br />
<br />
An example with made up numbers:<br />
33% of incoming damage is negated, for every point of damage you negate you lose 2 endurance.<br />
<br />
In the long term, this allows a warrior to use endurance as a sort of pseudo HP-regen, amount other things.<br />
<br />
It also allows a warrior to deal with short predictable reasonably sized damage spikes (like, a large pull in a group, or a named mob before it is slowed) better.<br />
<br />
It doesn't increase the raid tanking ability of a warrior (your END pool would evaporate immediatly under any raid opponent).<br />
<br />
It does allow warriors better soloing abilities, especially at lower and mid levels (where it matters).<br />
<br />
Variants on this ability:<br />
1&gt; Higher HP-&gt;End conversion ratios.<br />
2&gt; Larger % of damage soaked by endurance.<br />
<br />
You could even have different flavours.  More efficient, lower %, and less efficient higher % variants, which you'd have to choose between.</div></div><hr />
