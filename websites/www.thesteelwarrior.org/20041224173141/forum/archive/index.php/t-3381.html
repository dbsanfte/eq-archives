<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirulus Delon</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all, few questions. I have a 65 mage and 51 rogue, my wife a 55 dru and 29 war. This is her second warrior at this lvl and she is hurting gear wise (I gave her plat and she had no clue what to buy so ermm, some mistakes were made). Anyway, rather than spend plat again (using it on tradeskills lol) on stuff that should not be bought, what can I quest for her? As I said I have a 65 mage and with her 55 dru I am sure we could do some good amount of questing, just need an idea what is a goal attainable by this duo. Mitigating factors are; 1.) Dain faction is blown as are the other dorfs due to my Dain raids (on the mage only I mean) 2.) She is DE.<br />
(Basically trying to twink her up a bit so she does not quit on this class as well)<br />
<br />
Second, what clicky quests can we do for her? All my info I get applies primarly to rogues and mages, then to a lesser extent monks. She likes questing and I want to find stuff that again can be duoed or that she can do alone.<br />
<br />
Third, how and where can I pl her with my mage without her losing the valuable melee skills. When I get my other computer online, I will move my druid to a seperate account (I hate druids) and just be the healer for her warrior. The way I did it with a monk friend was I would ds him (before the buff nerf, it was the 45pt ds) and use bind wound plus his mend to keep him alive. I am trying to get her to my rogue's lvl so that I can try my hand at dual boxing a healer with them two (probably will be a shammy). Thanks in advance (and sorry if my requests for twinking help offended anyone, I apologize),<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirulus Delon</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I was thinking something more lasting, that I would not need to upgrade or perform VERY minor tweaking post 51. Suddenly I am thinking someone will point at Velious armor, lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, there isn't much beyond crafted until the Velious armours. I have no idea about the SoL crafted/quested stuff (well except that it was less than Thurg), but in my day we went from crafted to indi (from Hate) to Velious...<br />
the druid and mage may have a hard time doing the &quot;plate cycle&quot; in the Frost Giant manor but they should kick butt on the arena mobs. Otherwise you are looking at things like spending the plat for cultural.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirulus Delon</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cultural? Ohh, tell me more. I can get my rogue up to par on that or have her tradeskill it. Wait, nm. Cultural DE armor cant be made by a woody. But she can do it, what do I look up when trying to find info on how to get started? *edit* Scratch that, I found it and it looks perfect (well of course it does to me, my only constant melee is a rogue!) thanks all.<br />

<br />
If you can't find it in the bazaar spend some time ruining your Othmir faction and you might do alright.  =)<br />
<br />
The Lodi Shell is back wearable.. Good back piece slot. Quest a Wurmslayer for her to use into the 40's.  Centi SS not bad either. And get a Nathsar Greatsword for the 2HS skill. <br />
<br />
Shovel for 2HB, and I think a poison censor for 1HB, it shouldnt' start proc'ing until what? 50? Anyway, it's fast and you can raise 1HB good with it until it starts proc'ing, then move to a bed leg club or something like that. <br />
<br />
Be sure to get a fast piercer too. Keep 1HS capped, and then put another weapon type in the off hand. Try to keep 2HS up and it's easiest with a fast 2HS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that you were asking about quested armor, instead of bought armor, but I reccomend picking up some of the new armor made with the LDoN tempers.  Gothic is the best warrior armor, with plusses to strength and stamina, as well as magic resist on all the pieces.  Calcified armor has bonuses to agility; deep cavern has dexterity; frosted has intelligence; and sandblasted has wisdom.  All of these pieces have better armor class than crafted.  Lots of people are using these recipes to skill up, and most of them are using the forge in PoK (they have to buy the superb leather paddings from the dwarf there, anyway).  Check the vendors in the forge building to see if tradeskillers have sold their stuff and the vendors are reselling cheap.  Or talk to one of the tradeskillers and see if you can work something out.  I started giving away for free all my calcified breastplates  and greaves, because I couldn't get rid of them all in the Bazaar.   I think these pieces are a great mid-level item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use a mixture of Gothic, Calcified and Deep Cavern to get good ac and fairly good stats.  I recommend trying to get sta the highest then dex then agi then str.  Str is probably the least important except for the fact of the DE so the Gothic sounds like the best way to go and then try to augment the armor.  Then, when she saves enough she can buy some armor from the Adventure merchants.  MM has good stuff for 150 points each, Takish has ornate quality gear, and I cant remember about the other ones.  She can also get some good weapons this way and get some plat to spend, while also leveling up.  Fast weapons are the best at lower levels when working on skills so find a fast weapon and damage doesnt matter too much.  GL with the twinking.</div></div><hr />
