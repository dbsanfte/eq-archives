<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am just gonna throw this out, and I am completely prepared to get shot down, but since the patch where they added the &quot;success/fail&quot; taunt message, I have noticed something that seems far too consistant to just be coincidence.<br />
<br />
Several times now, when trying to taunt a mob that I do not have agro on, I have gotten him to turn to me even though I get a &quot;taunt failed&quot; message. Now, I know what you are saying, it is just coincidence, ie. you got a proc, or damage which caused the turn, and not the taunt button. But I swear it seems directly tied to the taunt key. In the same way you can tell when a successful stun kick interupts a mob casting, I am correlating my &quot;failed&quot; taunt press to agro.<br />
<br />
Like I say, I am prepared to write it off as coincidence, but when you do something for so long, you get a &quot;feel&quot; for how things work, and I can swear that this is what is happening.<br />
<br />
Also, if this is true, it leads me to wonder if taunt was really broke after all.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else happened to notice this? Or am I just crazy? (entirely possible)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShaikYerbooty</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...interesting.  I have no experience with this yet.<br />
<br />
I don't taunt much if I'm not MT, and when I'm MT I rarely lose aggro, so have no opportunity to examine this phenomenon.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting if you could parse this from logs over the long term, and see if it really is more than just chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem with logs is, it won't show that the mob actually turned to me after a &quot;failed message&quot; unless he hit me right after. But even then, he could have turned to me for any reason. It is a hard thing to actually show without actually doing some video capture to see what I see.<br />
<br />
Also, I have been doing a lot of LDoN lately, quite a few are hard missions. In LDoN is mostly where I have noticed this, although I haven't done much xp outside there lately. Not sure if that matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PARSE PARSE PARSE !!   <br />
<br />
Get a Shadowknight/Paladin/Cleric .. whatever, let him tag a low level MOB a couple of times with Terror (+hate spell) / Stuns (no damage) and then taunt it off him/her (no Melee and stuffs).<br />
<br />
If it turns on a failed Taunt, then you might have found something interesting.<br />
<br />
Repeat the test several times to see if it's consistent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That could provide proof in my mind that it is happening, but again, how would a log show it? Obviously, I wouldn't want to be attacking when I do it, but the mob would have to actually hit me before the log would show that a failed taunt turned to me. <br />
<br />
I am willing to try, but I need suggestions on a good test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azunias</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I noticed thats (sorta) along the same lines ..... <br />
<br />
Incite ... and let it &quot;time out&quot;. It gives you some message that it (the ability) has run out. Now hit taunt. I bet it fails .... every time.<br />
<br />
But the mob is on you rear....<br />
<br />
Weird....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slantedvision</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're taunting a mob to gain aggro, chances are you're also attacking.  Or perhaps the player that the mob had aggro on hit a jolt-type spell.<br />
<br />
A lot of things to consider, the only thing that can be done in this case is an actually full out test with the purpose to prove or disprove this theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">only thing i've noticed is that taunt success rate is way more suck ass than I'd thought.  60% is a bit high.  I think they actually increased the failure rate of taunts when the added the fail message.  just a gut feeling, nothing to support it.  Pretty sad actually. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has happened to me a few times, but I put it down to either incite ticking away and that 70 hate being enough to get aggro back, or just the damage I'm doing to the mob's back while it's turned away from me. I think it's coincidence that it happens on a failed taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugnok</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive had the same thing happen...press taunt...not using provoke...having fail message pop-up...grab aggro.  Happens to me like twice and adventure at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've experienced this as well, I taunt, but even after a failure I get agro.<br />
<br />
I can't say I remember if Berate was still doing its thing, or the class it was attacking used an ability to drop agro (jolt, feign death, etc...), but its happened.<br />
<br />
It leads to a few interesting questions, such as is Taunt REALLY failing? Does it give a set amount of hate even if it fails? Or is it just a strange coincidence that on several occasions that after a failed taunt that we (or rather, I) have agro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about the reverse of this, is it possible that a successful taunt is not actually generating the top +1 when it should? This would be one explanation for why sometimes it takes multiple successful taunts to turn a mob sometimes...<br />
<br />
There really is no way to tell for sure. But, I will run some tests tonight and see if I can get this to happen in a controled way, and get it into a log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squizer</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It happened to me too, a failed taunt gave me aggro. ( happened a few times already )<br />
Was using a 2hs so it was easy to see if I landed some attack/proc to grab aggro back. This wasn't the case.<br />
It could have be a incite tick landing, giving  just the aggro needed, but I've seen it happen without using  any kind of provoque.<br />
<br />
So, either the fail msg isn't accurate to the effectiveness of taunt, or the whole taunt skill is bugged somewhere ( not about the fail percantage ).<br />
<br />
That said, it happened the other way around too. I mean a succesful taunt didn't took aggro back ( yes, in a normal case, like just after a slow. Something that worked 100 times before )..<br />
<br />
Only way to parse that would be findind a mob that hit really really fast, but not too hard.. ( a hasted pet ? )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have gotten the same thing in several different zones.  LDON, Perma etc.  We cleared the bear pit for a Beast epic I was running around hitting all that were agroed with taunt, and smacking them around.  I would see the failed message and still get agro over the BL pets and mage pets etc.  I chalked it up to me being rusty.  <br />
Well suffice to say, it was easy clearing the pit.  We werent buffed or anything really due to the Spirits being easy but the Shaman notices a new mob in the pits.  A huge terror (The chilling terror or some such crap) and proceeds to pull him.  I grab agro on the way back when I notice Im getting the shit beat out of me.  I look at the damage and see 500's scrolling across the screen and people falling to AEs or just him beating the shit out of them......  <br />
Needless to say we came back and recleared the bears.  Again I noticed that I got agro with the failed taunt message.  So I know I can repeat it.  I can do the same thing in an LDON adventure, not sure about the PoP zones yet as I dont hunt there much.  But you can reproduce the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, just logged for the night, and I attempted some testing, and although I could not get it to work, I would like to share my findings, just cuz I found some of the results interesting.<br />
<br />
To test, I had to have someone else have agro, for me to taunt off of. I boxed my cleric, and we headed to FG to play with the infamous, vocal shrooms.<br />
<br />
For my first test, I pulled with my cleric with a single level 5 stun, and then taunted until I got agro, hoping that I would get a few failed to see if I could recreate my observation. After about 7-8 tries like this I noticed 1 thing clearly. 100% of the time it took exactly 4 successful taunts to turn the mob to me.<br />
<br />
I started to wonder if this agro my cleric had was perhaps temporary, and faded with time, so for the next 3-4, I waited 30 secs before taunting, then 3-4 more tries waiting 1 min before taunting. Results were the same - 4 successful taunts. As a side note, once, she got into the 'low hp agro' range, and like Furor said, not even Jesus Christ himself could taunt the mob off her. I threw everything I had at it, including attack with a proc...it was glued to her. Finally hit DA so she wouldn't die, hehe. Anyway, back to testing...<br />
<br />
Next, realizing that it took 4 successful taunts regardless, that getting agro with a unsuccessful taunt would probably not even be possible. So, I tried just using proximity agro to pull with my cleric, and taunt it off her. Interestingly enough, it STILL took 4 successful taunts to turn the mob. I thought that was odd, apparently, whoever is first on the list get a set amount of agro regardless of how the mob is pulled. I was gonna test some other types of pulling, but I wanted to get back to testing my original hypothesis. Oh, one other side note (only did it once, so it isn't conclusive), I pulled once using proximity agro, and used her level 5 stun on it. Oddly enough, I was suprised to see that she got agro after 1 cast, lending support to the argument that Pali stuns are still not 'balanced'. But..I digress, once again, back to the task at hand.<br />
<br />
I now realized that taunting off from initial agro from a pull was not gonna work for the purposes of my test. So, my next method had my cleric, again, pull with her level 5 stun. I then would taunt until I had agro. Then, she would cast her single stun, and immediately get agro back. Next, I would taunt, and the first successful taunt I got, turned it back to me. I kept this going back and forth, because I figured, if I were to get agro on an UNsuccessful taunt, this would be the method that would show it. I continued until one of us needed a heal, at which point I would just finish it off, since a ch would mess up the agro status. I did this a couple of times until I was bored to tears and gave up.<br />
<br />
Net result....no agro turns on an unsuccessful taunt. So, at this point, this is what I can conclude about my theory.<br />
<br />
A) I didn't continue long enough to see if the bug/querk/whatever would happen.<br />
B) Combat with a whole group, and the combination of agro generating spells, procs, melee damage, and deagro spells introduced some variables which could create the phenomena, that I can never recreate in a controled environment consistantly.<br />
C) This phenomena is tied to the differences introduced with the way instanced zones work, in which case, testing would be quite difficult.<br />
<br />
-OR-<br />
D) I really am crazy, and it really is just a coincidence.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am leaning towards B or D, with D being the most likely, lol.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would post my log in some fashion to let you guys take a look, but, I am basically too lazy to 'trim the fat' out of it, and, I am sure that anything in it is probably stuff you guys already knew, hehe.<br />
<br />
I am gonna let this go for now, unless some great way to conclusively test this pops into my head. So, on that note...blah blah blah...I am gonna shutup now :)<br />
Happy hunting :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Victatious - this post was about an observation about a potential bug with either the actual success or failure of a taunt, or the new code added which reports a failure. It also contains my observations about how taunt currently works, as well as other peoples observations as well. Nowhere is it mentioned anything about wishing taunt worked &quot;no fail&quot;<br />
<br />
I would like to thank you though, for coming here to give your insight and wisdom on the subject at hand. And, that your warrior is retired and you still took the time to post, is touching....<br />
<br />
There is this thing called a clue....look into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duchess Inferna</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am pretty sure that the sucess/failure messages are broken.  Many times I get the mob to turn on a failed taunt and they won't turn on a successful one.<br />
<br />
I think the messages themselves are not reliable indicator on the success or failure of taunt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chancy</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in CazicThule the other night and while fighting one mob, had a new one add and was almost immediately mezzed. Once mezzed, our shaman slowed it. I attempted to taunt it twice and received the failed message. Then the mez faded and he immediately started attacking me. He wasn't rooted nor snared. I'll admit to kind of being a novice as to how hate works in EQ, but as far as I can tell the only hate he had from me was whatever xferred from the mob we were currently killing, the two &quot;failed&quot; taunts, and my close proximity to him when he woke up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mishratm</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the messages may be broken, or agro is far more sensitive than we think.<br />
<br />
I've got several messages that say taunt has been successful, yet still not got agro. I know agro is dynamic, but when it's me botting 3 toons and I haven't done anything with the other toons since I managed to taunt successfully, it makes me worry. (Not to mention the enchanter bot died after a string of 7 unsuccessful taunts and a period of no EB procs - dual wielding bloodfrenzy and hategiver - but at least I got the agro when he died!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsebach</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was having a discussion with someone about the taunt message... I was (and for the most part still am) under the impression that taunt is a binary thing... it either works and gives you highest +1, or it does nothing at all.  Thus the fail messages mean exactly that.<br />
<br />
My counterpart was saying that a fail message doesn't mean that the skill didn't succeed, it just didn't take you to the top of the list. <br />
<br />
&lt;shrug&gt;<br />
<br />
He didn't convince me, and I doubt I convinced him, but I have noticed that in certain situations, usually tied to group makeup, taunt seems to fail a lot more.  <br />
<br />
When grouping with my usual exp/adv group, taunt seems to fail a lot less.  These are people who know how I play, and I know how they all play.  Granted, I hit taunt a lot less overall because of group synergy, but as a ratio it seems a lot better.<br />
<br />
Now, one day we had one person missing, so we added a ranger.  This ranger happened to be wielding a VDD. ;)  Accordingly (as my group is mostly ToV/LDoN equipped) he also had way higher HP and AC.  As much as I tried, he pretty much tanked the whole time.  There was no complaint, mind you, because the group was quite successful.  But I did notice that my ratio of taunts to fail seemed to be really high.  I have also noticed this phenomenon when we substitute a lower level ranger who is not so good at controlling aggro (note, I'm not picking on rangers, this is just the two times I've noticed this :)).  <br />
<br />
This observation seems to conform with the other persons view of taunt.<br />
<br />
Again, note the liberal use of the word &quot;seems&quot;.  None of this is parsed, it is all anecdotal, and so even to my mind it is completely inconclusive.  I only throw it out there for discussion... perhaps group dynamics have more to do with it than we think.<br />

Brutul did all the homework (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1811) I ever need to see on taunt.  It's a long long thread, with some very good bits in it - especially concerning the *4 taunts for aggro* thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While my test did coincide with his test results, I did add a small bit to conclusions in that, in each case, the person pulling went to the extreme in order to get agro (massive stuning, rooting, snaring, what-have you), I mearly added the other extreme of how little agro I could get with my cleric, and it still require 4 taunts to turn it.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, my testing wasn't to prove, disprove, or otherwise alter Brutuls (or anyone else who added to the test) findings. My results were a byproduct of the original objective of determining if the 'unsuccessful' message is reporting incorrectly. I just posted my observations I had gathered along the way.<br />
<br />
In every case where agro changed hands, both my cleric and I were within melee range. And, once I overcame initial 'puller' agro with 4 taunts, it only required 1 taunt/stun to swap agro. I could have backed my cleric up before her turn to stun to get agro to test the effects that proximity has on the agro equation, but my test centered around attempting to get agro from a 'failed' taunt. In this case, I just needed the cleric to regain agro :)<br />
<br />
I have not, as yet, been able to catch, conclusively, in a log, proof that this is really happening, although, now that I am watching for it, I seem to notice it a lot. Sometimes though, my getting agro can be discounted as coincidence, and be explained by other reasons why I would get agro (proc, FD, Evade...etc) But still, it seems to happen. Unfortunately, the log never conclusively reflects this.<br />
<br />
One thing my testing has done for me, is when it comes to breaking a mez. If someone other than the chanter got initial agro, then the process of mez/tash/slow by the chanter will overcome initial agro (like my 4 taunts). Since I have proven, if only to myself, that once initial agro is overcome, only a single taunt is needed to out-agro someone, I taunt till success, then hit incite, and break mez. When the chanter is the first on the agro list (puller pulls, FD, and the chanter mez's add from beyond agro range), I know that I have to get a taunt or two more in before breaking to prevent a chanter beat down.<br />
<br />
This seems to have greatly improved my getting agro quicker and better without needless chanter beatings. :)</div></div><hr />

There are for too many variables at work in the average pick up group. One thousand people could say that they got aggro on a failed taunt in an xp group, but that still wouldn't mean jack.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilsofa</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had the following happen several times during hard LDON missions tonight:<br />
<br />
1. Mob is mezzed.<br />
2. Mob is Incited by me.<br />
3. Mob is taunted, taunt fails.<br />
4. Mob is taunted, taunt fails again.<br />
5. Mob is slammed and attacked, mob runs to mezzer.<br />
<br />
In almost every case I have found that an Incite followed immediately by a successful taunt allows me to break the mez cleanly.  Thus, seeing whether taunt succeeds or not is very valuable information to me.  Incite/taunt/slam can be done in about a quarter second, nice instant mez break, and can hold off on slam if taunt didn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding mez'd mobs and incite:<br />
Just a note, for this I'm considering all taunts successful (I know thats far from true, but just for examples)<br />
<br />
Lets say your chanter has 1000 points of hate on the mez'd mob, while you have done nothing to it yet.<br />
<br />
If you Incite, you will have 400 hate.  Then you taunt puts you at 1001.  Next tick, you will be at 1071 (assuming nothing else done to mob in that time).<br />
<br />
But if you Taunt first, that would put you at the same 1001 points of hate.  Then using incite makes you jump up to 1401, and next tick would be 1471.<br />
<br />
So it is actually much better to use taunt first, followed by incite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have seen the reverse when breaking mez in a normal LDoN adventure.  My normal mez breaking is Bellow, let it tick a couple times while taunting successfully twice (sometimes three times), kick/slam, and auto attack on. Mob makes a bee line straight for the enc/shaman. Next taunt usually turns it back on me, but it should of been on me from the start with that much hate from Bellow and 2+ successful taunts.</div></div><hr />

Anyone else who could verify this ?<br />
Perhaps using another spell instead, like Ensnare / Slow ?</div></div><hr />

For example, in a hard LDoN last night, our SK was pulling with snare, and, if I got a clean bow shot before it got to the group, it always came straight to me.<br />
<br />
I find it interesting that the one arrow gets me at the top of the list where 3 pure taunts does not. <br />
<br />
Also, when there are times when I don't get a clean arrow shot. but, on inc, a clean finger roll (attack on/taunt/kick) will also peel instantly off puller.<br />
<br />
After pondering this for a week now, I realized this is one of those things that the more you try and understand it, the more confusing it becomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I've noticed from being able to see tuant successes now.  Aggro from sitting down is added after all is said and done on the hate list.<br />
<br />
We all know that sitting down creates more aggro then standing.  Take a wizzie for example, he unloads a nice big nuke on the mob, mob is still on the warrior.  Wizzie sits, mob goes for him.  Wizzie stands the mob goes back to the warrior, wizzie sits the mob comes back to the wizzie again.<br />
<br />
Now, I always taunt after I nuke with my wizard.  Since I knew that sitting aggro is higher than standing aggro, I decided to hold my taunts for when I sat down the wizard.  Hoping to get higher on the list by tuanting above his sit aggro instead of his stand aggro.<br />
<br />
Now that I can see the success messages, I know this trick does not work &quot;at all&quot;.  If the wizard has 1000 hate and I taunt, I have 1001 hate.  Wizzie sits, he's got oh, let's say 1100 hate, and gets attacked.  The second he stands, his hate is back to 1000 hate.  That 100 (just using 100 as an example, I have no idea on the exact number that is added to your hate from sitting).  If I wait for him to sit &quot;then&quot; tuant, I don't get 1101 hate.  I still only get the 1001 hate.<br />
<br />
Sitting hate is considered last.  I believe this to be true after many times of hitting tuant &quot;after&quot; I've sat down my wizard, the tuant was a success, yet the mob went after the wizard anyway.  Taunt didn't lie to me, it just ignores that extra 100 points from sitting.  The 100 points is not a part of the main &quot;hate list&quot; value, but rather added in seperately and not added into the value you get from tuanting.<br />
<br />
My theory is that sitting down has a fixed hate value modifier that is added together with your hate value when considering who the mob should attack.  But it's not a value that is added directly into your hate value on the hate list.  Just a modifier that is either on or off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, didn't they raise bow aggro some because Rangers could get away with doing lots of damage basically risk free on raids ? I think it was changed during Luclin expansion.</div></div><hr />

Hi. Read the taunt thread in the library. It's been known for quite some time that hate is a compound of pure hate value and a modifier. Examples of modifiers are sitting aggro just like you've observed, low-HP aggro - that sort of thing. I don't mean to be a jerk, but there is a lot of good information in the library, and we'll never learn new things if all we do is confirm old news over and over.</div></div><hr />
