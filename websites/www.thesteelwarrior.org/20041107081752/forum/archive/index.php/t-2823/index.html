sigh<br />
<br />
I just feel like hurting something after reading Absor's comment,<br />
on how they simply didn't have time to address a major flaw in the class balances.<br />
<br />
But I guess he's right....<br />
I mean... after rehauling the spell book, adding in new foci, making dots actually show their damage, making pets get a clarity, making pets cast spells, changing the resists on mobs, adding foci to many many old items, testing new ldon spells, changing the value of mana from int/wis... and more<br />
<br />
after all that, it's normal that they didnt have time within 3 years to do anything for melees...<br />
<br />
We all forgive you, absor.<br />
Hopefully you'll have time to look at the melees once spellcasters can start soloing gods. <br />
But then, I doubt you even give a shit.<br />
<br />
Should be good stuff working for SOE eh? Don't do your job properly, but who cares?? They're all addicted to the game anyhow, why care about making it a Good game??<br />
<br />
But I guess you have to show that you do SOMETHING now and then, by going to each community board within 1 week, and ask &quot;got any questions about ldon?&quot;...<br />
then you can go back to playing golf for the next 4 months.</div></div><hr />

I hate to knit-pick, but he changes exactly jack and shit in the game. He's a spokesman for the company not a game developer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's basically public relations, and what sort of relations did he maintain?<br />
<br />
We haven't heard of him for over 4 months,<br />
and then suddenly &quot;Hi, got questions?&quot; answers a few questions quickly, and poof, gone again.<br />
<br />
Actually, there is no public relations... He's just an advertiser.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ya, I wonder how many people are gonna buy this expansion now because they think that SoE cares about their opinion because of one thread on a messageboard.  When he comes back here with a goddamned notebook and sits down with Frodlin and Furor and talks about balance, then i'll start thinking about buying more of their products.<br />
<br />
This is gonna be the 2nd expansion in a row I don't own.  How many more you gonna put out before you address the real issues in the game and not just pump out expansions to try to draw attention away from your competitors, SoE?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In a panel of 2 main game developers and absor at a fan faire. . .well absor seemed pretty clueless. . .and a lot older.  He's basically the fall-guy/spokesman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whatever happened to Felhammer?<br />
<br />
His puzzles and little games to help ADVERTISE the new expansions were very neat.<br />
<br />
He really got the grassroots, word of mouth about the 'net type of &quot;hype&quot; going for the upcoming products.<br />
<br />
And he got the players excited about the new stuff.<br />
<br />
I thought that was his job.<br />
<br />
Where'd he go? Why is Absor now doing that with LDoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He was good enough to work for EQ2 probably... or some other upcoming soe title...<br />
<br />
Only the incompetent people stay back to nurture a 5 year old game that's lying on it's deathbed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He is the public relations guy, and he sucks as much at his job as everyone else does at theirs at SOE :)</div></div><hr />
