<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThrokRock</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you level up to 65 with unmaxed stamina would you be missing out on a bigger hp bonus?  As you level up stamina points equal more hp(there wouldn't be a loss of potential hitpoints becuause you can max the stat later)...but are there hp bonuses based on stamina when you level?<br />
<br />
I guess the same thing goes for AA's such as ND/PD/PE.  Will I miss out on hps if my stamina isn't maxed when I spend the AA to get the hp abilities?  Would it be better to wait to get ND/PD/PE after you have planar power/stamina maxed?  Do these abilities increase the sta/hp ratio or do they just boost your percentage based on current hps/sta.<br />
<br />
The descriptions of some  AA abilities in the AA menu are unclear in regards to my question(s).  This description,&quot;...increases max hit points by 1.5 pct...,&quot; (PD) is ambiguous.  Max potential hps or my total hps topped off?  I just want to make sure I can push my toon to his highest potential hps.  If waiting to spend aa's on hitpoint abilities till you are maxed on stamina and have some nice hp + items will improve your total in the end it would be well worth it to do so(and go for offensive abilities sooner).  Would I be getting more hps if I waited to get PD till my stamina was maxed OR can I get PD with low stam with the intention of inevitably maxing it later...and get the same result?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, waiting until you have better gear doesn't do anything.  You'll gain the same % increase from HP aa's now as you will when you're in elemental gear and 8khp unbuffed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThrokRock</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that you are saying that the PERCENTAGE never changes ...but if my hp base is larger (due to max stam/hp +; NICE GEAR!) I will get more hps? <br />
<br />
ex. 1.5% of 4600 with sta 280 -vs- 1.5% of 4800 with max sta/better gear.  Get PD at 280 and get the  sta later.. and get the same resultant hp? Or did i lose out on that 25 stamina not being in the calculation?<br />
<br />
I guess this brings up another question...what is the best max hp?  Is there a cap or sky's the limit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the original question was based on a faulty asumption.  I hear this one more often then you would believe so if this isn't what you were thinking thor then I am sorry.  <br />
<br />
I think Thor was told some where down the line that you get some X number of HPs when you level.  This number is based off sta and AAs etc.. but it is a static level up bonus number or something.  This type of system is used in D&amp;D based games as well as a few others.<br />
<br />
For example if you were lvl 64 with 100 sta, dinged 65 then got up to 200 sta you would have less hp then if you got the gear to get you to 200 sta before you dinged.  In D&amp;D it works like this.  You get a hp bonus every level based on a ran 1-10 + a sta bonus (yeah its not sta in D&amp;D).  The bonus only comes into effect when you ding.  (IE a bonus of 4 hp and a roll of 10 gets you 14 more hp, if you get yoru sta bonus to +5 you still have the same base hp.  If you got the sta bonus to +5 before ding and rolled the 10 then you would have gained 15 hp) EQ does not work this way.<br />
<br />
So thor in answer to yoru question, if you ding 65 then get max sta and nd3 pe etc... or got all you could at 60 then dinged 65 you would have the same hp.  It won't matter.  Getting the sta/AAs before or after the ding has no effect on your possible max hp.<br />
<br />
Getting a level only changes the way the hp calculations work (basically giving you more hp per sta) but your hps are never set in stone. <br />
<br />
I hope I was clear.<br />
<br />
In answer to yoru second question, with all AAs and the newest and greatest gear from time... I think 1.1k buffed is possible.  I haven't really checked though but the number is likely around there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The percentage never changes.. I believe somewhere it was said that PD3, ND3, PE give an 11% bonus to your HP<br />
<br />
So, if you're naked with 2800hp, the above AA will give you 308hp or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're in full elemental gear with 7600hp you'll get 836hp..<br />
<br />
The percentage never changes.  As you get new gear the bonus is applied as soon as you put it on.  If you get ND3, PE, PD3 (which you can't get) at level 60, then level to 65, you'll end up with the exact same HP as you would if you went 65 then did those AA.<br />
<br />
The HP you receive when you ding isn't calculated on your current stats, it's based on a set number, then your bonuses for Sta and whatnot are added after the fact.  In other words, if I have a base sta of 100 and I ding level 61, I'll get the same ~50hp that a troll with a base sta of 140 gets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PD and PE multipliers affect everything.  As an example, with PD3 and PE I recently got an upgrade that was 50hp on paper, but it ends up as 58 hp with the multipliers on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThrokRock</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what I wanted to hear...very cool...it modifies everything you put on and stamina that u gain AFTER you spend the AA is calculated...lol just making sure!  I play a 65 froglok with ND3/CS3/CA3 currently and have been pondering whether or not to wait on the remaining hp AA's because frogz lack stamina compared to big classes/any race that can worship RZ(Mith Marr is a wimp and I forsake him!).  So I'll go ahead and get those AA knowing I'll get the same amount of hp when i max out the stamina anyway.  Thx guys!</div></div><hr />
