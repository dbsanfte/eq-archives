<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">the fb shield is supposed to increase all spell and bash aggro by 40%.<br />
<br />
lets say your duel wield setup is an anger3 augmented GBoS and a CHoS.<br />
<br />
2 anger3 procs from primary = 1200 hate per minute<br />
2 force strikes from primary= 900-1000 hate per minute<br />
1 force strike from secondary= 450-500 hate per minute<br />
<br />
all for a grand total of  ~2800-2900 hate per minute based on procs alone assuming the 2/1 primary/offhand rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
now ... assuming that the shield does in fact increase the hate from all spells by 40%, lets look at some numbers<br />
<br />
2 anger3 procs (840 each) from primary = 1680 hate per minute<br />
2 force strikes (700 each) from primary = 1400 hate per minute<br />
<br />
all for a grand total of 3080 hate per minute from procs alone.<br />
<br />
now i know the dps would be a good bit less (somewhere in the neighborhood of cut down by 30-35%), but on the same note the aggro from bash (albeit small .. but still there) is increased by 40%.  in this case, the shield is actually generating more aggro than an offhand weapon would be, while at the same time increasing ac, decreasing ripostes, and giving nice hp/stat buffers.  adding another anger3 ldon proc to the offhand weapon would balance out the shields &quot;overaggro&quot;, but lacking an induced proc in the offhand weapon, it looks like the shield hate is actually stronger.  With the new WA aa's, further increasing the proc rates of weapons and augments, it would seem to make the shield have that much more of an advantage over duel wielding.  (i mean really ... theres just a point where more aggro is kinda ridiculous ... if you lose aggro, then somebody other than yourself is doing something wrong).<br />
<br />
the reason i bring this up is i picked up a stormrider carapace tonight.  i havent got a good 1hs to burn my anger3 proc on yet, but i'm looking to one hopefully in the future.  duel wield will be, of course, my primary choice for ldon and xp (hell and anger3 GBoS should give me more than plenty aggro pre-elemental .. and even in the elementals for that matter), but tanking bosses on raids, hard ldons, and rampage tanking, would see me using this entirely different setup.  if the shield is working &quot;as intended&quot;, it would seem that this item is heavensent for the boss tanking warriror.<br />
<br />
sure, an anger3 BBB, BoW, SEWS, Vanazir is ideal for maximal dps .. nice stats, while maintaining strong/crazy aggro, but not everyone has access to such fine weaponry. <br />
<br />
are my calculations off?  plz poke holes in my &quot;findings&quot;, and can anyone verify from experience whether this shield is worth my time to put to use.<br />
<br />
ps- and plz dont knock the shield saying the aggro isnt as good if youre sporting an augmented BF and BoC combo, because i wouldnt expect it to outaggro very highclass aggro weapons.  i just want to know if it will hold up with your average mid-tier raiding guild and occasional pickup open raid tanking situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the reason i decided i wanted one was i attended a pickup AoW raid back before the release of LDoN, with a small group of raiding friends.<br />
<br />
The MT on the raid had right around 9200hps at the time, and used this shield in conjunction with a Bloodfrenzy.<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy is 700hate per proc with 3 procs per minute.<br />
<br />
2100 hate per minute from procs + this shield, was more than enough to hold aggro, and we didnt even give her any real amount of time to &quot;build aggro&quot; at the start.<br />
<br />
now i had also been on many other raids with said individual, and the result was always the same on every mob.  she would engage .. then 5 seconds later call for assist and never once even threaten to lose aggro.<br />
<br />
with the implement of ldon, its feasible to easily obtain and augment a weapon thats pretty much the same aggro as an unauged BF.  the GBoS/anger3 setup i'm thinking of would be right at 2200 hate per minute rougly.  an obsidian scimitar of war with 2.5 procs per minute (assuming 450-500 hate per proc) would be 2450 aggro a minute.<br />
<br />
anywho ... it impressed me then, and just wanted to bring my questions here for the analysis of you dudes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does not.  Only bashes are affected even though looking at lucy makes it seem otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I remember seeing a thread here about this where 2 essentially identically equipped warriors using BoC were using a FB3 shield and found that at FB3 you get more total agro than dual-wield.  The FB3 warrior always got agro off the dual-wielding warrior.<br />
<br />
Our problem is not having sufficient agro, but rather getting sufficient agro quickly.  For that, you need PPM or procs per minute and in that respect, dual-wield can't be beat.  You could tank with a rusty sword and keep agro once you had it thanks to other classes (Wizard nukes, you taunt, Wizard concusses).  <br />
<br />
AoW is a bad guage of agro since he has so very many hitpoints that he essentially works as if he were undead attacking the nearest player regardless of total agro since it's all a drop in the bucket to him.  As long as the warrior was closer than everyone else, it didn't matter how much agro the warrior had and by the time it did, the warrior will have had a successful taunt anyway.  All AoW shows is that the warrior was the closest to AoW and everyone else was further away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something I've been wondering as of late along these lines... I do more damage and stun more regular with a shield bashing then I do kicking.  Seems to me, stun is stun whether its magic based or melee based it still pisses the mob off.  I will often ghetto bash but switching out a for shield when bash pops up is more a luxurary than anything.  <br />
<br />
I main hand a CHSD aug'd with Anger II and off hand a SotBS when I duel wield.  The proc on the sword is not something I find I can count on when I need it(although I will be aug'ing it with Yakesha in the hopes that having 2 stun procs will increase the likelyhood of a stun going off).  So I am thinking that bashing with a shield every six seconds with a chance to stun (which seems to happen a lot more when bashing with a shield vs kicking) is a more regular source of stun hate than the innate proc on the sword.<br />
<br />
I have raid tanked with my Stormriders Carpace in the offhand and had no real aggro issues.  I do notice its harder to grab that initial aggro with a shield but no worse than a good 2h'er.  Hopefully in a raid setting the raid will let you build at least a smidge of aggro... just a skosh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember no such thread.<br />
<br />
I remember about 20 threads were it was stated the incremental agro from FB seemed to immaterial (borne out by personal observation using the FB4 shield from Bot).  Also that the only use of the a FB shield seems to be:<br />
<br />
1. Were you are MT and already have overwhelming agro (turtle mode)<br />
2. In a &quot;ruatha&quot; shield swap mode.  In this case you pick up agro as the bash agro &gt; slam/kick agro.<br />
<br />
Anyway....FB shields are still very limited in utility which is just sad.  Too bad GoD didn't add an AA skill to increases FB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">being the non-uber still in some velious gear leezard that I am, I'm finding that I cannot tank in GoD with out my SC.  I'm finding the 400/450 hate proc's in my main hand + incite are enough to hold aggro even when your groupmates are only half-assedly trying to control their aggro.  Funny how 4k dmg in 1 round can chill even the most pain in the ass rogue's out. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I ghetto bash with a Zek buckler, its not a SRC, but it's something. But I dont think offhanding the shield will give me more results than DWing, so I use both, I DW and ghetto bash, that way, you have your DW setup agro plus the shield stun and FB, you really dont have to choose between using a shield or DWing, you can perfectly use both :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It doesn't add aggro to your procs or spells.  Only your bashes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In theory this might work if procs were spells, however they are not.  You get no message when you proc mainhand with shield in hand about it glowing, like you do when you bash with it.<br />
<br />
If your raiders push up to your current DW level of aggro be ready with AEtaunt or rez's for them if you switch to shield.  The only times I switch to shield is to bash casting mobs and when a boss mob is about to enrage and I am laggy.  By then I pretty much have aggro if peeps are paying attention to what they are doing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GroovinFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you put anger 3 on a shield, will it get the 1ppm offhand rate, or proc at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shields do not have type 4 slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shields dont have type 4, but there is also a type 8 Anger aug. Are there any of the high end FB shields with a type 8 slot ?  If so then the question becomes can you get a proc by bashing with a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">or type 7 anger/yak augs.  that would RULE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Prolly it would be like a bow proc rate.... kinda rare heh</div></div><hr />
