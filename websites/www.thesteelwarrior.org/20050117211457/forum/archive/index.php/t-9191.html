<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magumas</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just picked this up the other day (Ornate Blade of Revolution): stats are roughly: <br />
2H Slash 48 dmg 34 delay 145 hps and other decent stats with a proc of Chaotic Stike 1, which is 100 dd plus stun.  <br />
<br />
Was wondering if I should use this as my primary weapon opposed to my two one handers GboS aug with Anger II and Curse Smelted Long Blade (auged to 16 dmg 19 delay) with Yekesha aug.  Was thinking about selling back the anger II and Yekesha aug for Anger III in the 2H..  Would that be a wise decision?  Also was thinking of a second option of just selling back the CSLB along with the 2 dmg aug which would give me around 1800 Ldon points and just buy a CHoS and place the Yekesha aug in that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuzzee</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thinking 48/34 with Yak+ (chaotic strike) is gonna be some gooooood aggro.  Considering you're using a curse smelted longsword with only 1 proc and a GBoS with 2 , it may even be the same aggro or better, especially augged with a yak aug or anger 3.  Generally, sounds like  a pretty sweet sword.  Just curious, where'd you pick it up from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's almost BoW ratio.<br />
<br />
Didn't Frodlin7th say he wanted to find a weapon comparable to the BoW with a stun proc to dispell some myth?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=140155&amp;postcount=53)<br />
<br />
Where'd you get that weapon, anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />

He didnt hit to hard but had lots of hps.. Was a pretty long fight.  One group?  Prob duable with a really good group.  As far as where he spawns, not really sure.. It was pulled to our spot.. Best to just have a tracker... However, I do know that we had to chew through a few mobs before we pulled him solo...</div></div><hr />

Im sure who ever is in the zone will thank you for killing him.  I am going to try to pinpoint his loc as soon as I can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any headway on where this guy is in zone and how often he drops or anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haddion</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a patch on Ruined City of dranik last night.  We headed there with 2 groups to waste him again after patch.  We could not agro him or the croonies around him to save our life.  He is part of some script and I have no idea how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried him earlier too. Managed to kill most of the mobs around him. It appeared each time he spams the zone the dragorn near him that replies becomes targetable, about 30 seconds later. So when we got there 5 or 6 of them were targetable - presumably all the ones that replied to his earlier broadcasts. We killed them then killed one at a time each time he did his SPAM. <br />
<br />
However when we had 3 mobs left, Sympathetic Dragorn, Dragorn Heckler and one other when Tiorpat did his thing none of them replied or became targetable. We cleared a load of stuff around him as we were getting bored but gave up in the end. <br />
<br />
Seems broken to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
kill the brown mobs<br />
<br />
the gray mobs should start waking up<br />
<br />
TT should then wake up, with adds<br />
<br />
could be done by 1 very good group. I would take 2 min.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I luv RCoD. Did an oldschool crawl there last night. Most innovative mob is the Bridgekeeper. Battlemaster was alot fun too and the Zun was ehhh. The cool part was it had that crawl feel that you dont really get on raids anymore and it was pretty relaxing. Decent loot too, lots of runes and did druid epc x 2 and BL annoying epic x 1. very productive evening all around.<br />

BattleMaster dropped this, which I will be evaluating for agro value<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Tornwing event seems to be way broken.  I was at the statue with a group about a week ago just grinding and getting lots of named mobs as usual, when out of the blue TT spawns with his cronies all around the statue.  Our chanter was able to mez all 4 adds and we succored out.  Later that night we grabbed another guild group and took him down easily.  Dropped 2 70 runes and some 1hb for casters.<br />
<br />
Then, last night, we went to the statue again and went around back as usual to camp on the hill.  I believe it's bugged because all of the mobs conned KoS to all of us, but never raised a finger to attack, even after Tornwing called something to the zone and the one right next to us responded.  We couldn't pull any of them associated with the event, nor could any of them attack us.  We didn't have enough balls to try Tornwing though, we were getting too much exp and drops to try wiping (3 Earrings of Lushest Foliage that night, woot!)<br />
<br />
So as of now, unless someone finds out how to do the event &quot;correctly&quot; I would say that getting the sword is a bit out of reach.</div></div><hr />
