<br />
What did you do that worked, i am thinking have a group in each room  then have a group in the middle room to take out the golems as they chase the banished tanks.<br />

As long as you have tanks to take up the MT position if the MT gets banished you should be fine.  IIRC, one has a nasty snare, that one all the tanks need to be in close melee range incase the MT gets banished.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A large large help especially for guilds in your &quot;tier&quot; of content would be to grab a golem or two as a charmed pet.  Don't even need to haste it.  Any enchanter worth his salt can maintain this pet as it's easily stunnable to recharm.  But one or two of these trivially turns the tables in your favor.<br />
<br />
Save for that, you just need to teach the raid to stay in the room, and any tank that gets banished to NOT run back unless they have no agro.  Training the raid is no good.  Have them at least run to the central room of the 3 so if they get agro they die in an easy to CR spot.<br />
<br />
I had always used Evasive to tank these as they are not hard hitters and I have assumed (not tested) that dodging more of their attacks means less chances to get banished.  A tip if you just want to kill one of them at least is the EAST lying prototype (not sure what its name is) has very low MR, to the point you can easily MEZ it (yes, really).  We used to open up with a mez, then tash/slow/debuff the hell out of it and go to town.  From my experiences the other two had too high of MR to reliably land Mez.  Each of htem have their only abilities.  One rampages, one flurries, one is uh.. i forgot.<br />

Hopefully that helps you.<br />

<br />
if the guys who get banished dont run aro0und, but just TURN around, and then run straight for the door, they wont aggro the other golems in the room<br />
<br />
i belive they banish you in a clockwise direction, so kill counter clockwise..(or vise versa)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another tip that I found helpful on them is to clear all the regular mobs as fast as possible before engaging the Protos. They respawn very quickly, but it increases the chances for you MT to make it back after a banish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Protos always banish to the room to their left (east banishes to west, west to south, south to east).  Pick one to start with, clear golems in the middle, the room with the first proto you're doing, and the one it banishes to, then kill the proto in its room.  If you get banished, try to run back (usually snared, so anglestrafe to the door) - protos are tethered so if you get out of its room fast enough to survive, you won't end up training everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tethering brings up another point.  It happened to us one time and I cried (course this was like over a year and ago).<br />
<br />
If a tank gets banished and is getting low hp, you run the risk of low hp agro causing the prototype to attempt to run at him.  This can cause the prototype to tether obviously since the tank is out of the room, and grats basically a &quot;Repopped&quot; dispelled blurred full hp prototype.<br />
<br />
I always taught my tanks that if they get below 30% hp when banished to just SIT and bunch a death quickly as possible to prevent low hp agro from causing the prototype to run for him and tether.<br />
<br />
Again its a rarity especially since they can just summon the tank.  But that one time it happened obviously the summon timer wasn't repopped and it caused us a lot of grief.  Just throwing some possible precautions out to you to take into consideration.  Prototypes aren't really that hard.<br />

If you do not have the DPS to kill the lvl 60 golems very fast with 3 groups, then don't bother with the prototypes.</div></div><hr />
