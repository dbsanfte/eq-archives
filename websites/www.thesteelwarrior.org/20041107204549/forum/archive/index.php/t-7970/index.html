<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Semien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I have access to 65ench and 65cleric (I could play all three at once on my comp) so any idea which zone is really best (fastest exp) Ive tried PoJ I have gained like 0,3% exp per mob.. PoV is much better but its pain even larvaes there pretty much kick my arse lol :] Thanks a lot for advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you can get there WW was all blues for me at 63 and decent AA's soloing there with my shaman trying to get the furs for the shawl quest...<br />
<br />
Chardok B is another place like this if you have the faction to get down there...<br />
<br />
Acrylia Caverns and the inner temple area... you will need a key or somehting to get in there i hear never been there my self<br />
<br />
If your a tradeskiller then hit CT and farm the drops for the CT crafted armor... they hit like tier one planes...<br />
<br />
speaking on the planes the PoN dock area is low to mid 50's mobs..<br />
<br />
PoD court yard is also mid 50's mobs<br />
<br />
just some thoughts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No key required for inner Acrylia anymore, and yes, it is fairly decent XP at a low difficulty.  Getting to the clicky to inner Acrylia is a bigger hassle than actually pulling and fighting once inside.<br />
<br />
For another alternative of similar difficulty to inner Acrylia &amp; Chardok B, try Nadox.  For a tougher challenge (but still easier than PON), try Torigiran Mines or Sol C.<br />
<br />
You will need a snare whip or root in Sol C and CT - that is the main reason why those two zones are less utilized than the others mentioned here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hunt nadox a lot with my shaman, and I think Ive run around in the mines, but what is Sol C and such, I hear them a lot but dont know where they are..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sol C (the Caverns of Exile) is attached to Sol A and B at the bug/bat zone line.  You end up at opposite ends of the zone depending on whether you entered from Sol A or B.  Note that in Sol C, the lava hurts about 4x as much, and you have to survive a short swim once you zone in.<br />
<br />
The mobs at the entrances are like &quot;normal L65 LDON&quot; mobs, and they get more like POI mobs as you go deeper.  There are several ring events that you can trigger, and there are quests that you can do in the zone, such as a quest for a souped-up cloak of flames.<br />
<br />
I have attached 3 maps to this message, showing you how to get to Sol C, plus a map of Sol C itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Michil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The place that I found was great exp from mid 50's to level 60 was Veskar.  With the bots your talking about would be great, after level 60 it slows down but still not to bad, just my opinion.<br />
