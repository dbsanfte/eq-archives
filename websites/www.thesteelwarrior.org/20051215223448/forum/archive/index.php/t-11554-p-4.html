<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-08-2005, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, I could care less how good Paladin's are in duels or one on one pvp.  All I care about is what a class brings to the table for group PvP, because with battlegrounds that is the way things are going.  Group PvP is all about combat multipliers and specialization.  Rogues povide pure Melee DPS with low surviviability.  Mages/Hunters provide ranged DPS.  Priest are your healers.  Warlocks, not really sure.  Druids, not sure really, but always sem to cme in handy.  Warriors provide melee DPS, but unlike rogues with survivability.  <br />
<br />
then comes the question of Paladins.  All these dumb mother------s run around trying to be warriors, the lone Hero who kills everyone with a swing of his blade.  Its retarded.  Paladins do not last long under combined arms fire, ie a group can demolish them before a Paladin can really do much.  Luckily for Paladins, that does not happen bcause no one wants to take the time to kill them.   So they run around trying to be hero's and ignoring their teammates.  It really pisses you off.  A paladin's pvp role is the frontline healer/dispeller.  They can increase the survivability of the &quot;whole&quot; group, not just them selves.  They won;t provide much DPS because of all the movement and how little &quot;burst&quot; damge they have, unless they get lucky.  However, the bests groups I have been in had a Paladin in them and the paladin provided crucial healing.  Priests are too fragile to be sitting right up there next to the warrior trying to heal him.  However a paladin can, and a warrior can become a juggernaut with a dedicated healer.  <br />
<br />
Yesterday, a 60 shaman and 60 warrior could not kill me becuase I had a paladin healing me in 2 on 2.  I suppose they ignored the paladin because they thoguht they could kill me quick at level 55.  They were mistaken, I was running around laughing my ass off as I demolished the shaman.  Only reason I died to the warrior was because my partner got disconnected.  A paladin can be a warriors best friend if they work together.  Paladins can be excellent healers and can allow priests to stay out of harms way.  One time I fought a 60 warrior with a priest instead of a paladin.  You know what happened, the warrior charged my priest and killed him in 2 hits.  If that had been a paladin, no way that could have happened.  This is the problem though, most paladins are wannabe warriors with healing for themselves, so they add nothing to the group.  As a warrior, I bring utility in addition to my DPS, ie hamstrings, a fear, 50% healing, intercepts to chase people down, etc, etc.  Paladins utility is healing, but they only do it to themselves.  That is why everyone hates them, they are snobbish, arrogant bastards who take delite in telling you how uber they are, but bring nothing to the group.<br />
<br />
However, humble Paladins keep it to themselves they beat you in a duel, and bring a ton to a group, exponentially increasing the power of the group if they are good with healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're going to be fucking invulernable healers for christs sake.  Does Horde have an invulnerable healer?  Fuck no.  Not hard to see who's gonna win battlegrounds 40 on 40 EVERY SINGLE TIME, as long as the paladins know what the fuck they're doing.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that there's gonna be at least 10-15 paladins out of 40 players in any random group.  Large scale PvP is where the class is the MOST broken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe. Yep, that's how it is.<br />
we have paladins taking Mail armor designed for shamans so they have more int / spirit. They're not going to get targeted either way, mail or plate (like anyone would take a closr look in PVP action)<br />
<br />
<br />
by the way, I just read your responses in http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=11203<br />
good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">05-08-2005, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can comment on them just fine, because I kill them daily.<br />
<br />
Their DPS is utter ass. Utility is unquestioned. Durability is so-so. They survive a good long while in PvP, but die just the same.<br />
<br />
Honestly, from the sheer number of paladins out there, if you have trouble dealing with even half of them, then you can't possibly be using all the tools at your disposal. A shaman and I killed 2 (that's right, two) of them at the same time...fuckin shaman didn't even use a healing potion. It's basically just the people who think they're so overpowered crying about it on every message board there is that leads to this perception that paladins are unstoppable. They're really not. A warrior should be able to put down an even con paladin no problem with just a fucking bandage in his inventory. And all of your PvE concerns make me laugh because warriors have a taunt button, and anyone who understands what that means should just be laughing at paladins constantly.<br />
<br />
Yup, pure gold.   With this thread it's as if Haass thinks he discovered America, and Leif Erikson is standing there with all his indian buddies going...wtf?  I recommend not shitting on the opinions of others so wildly when it appers they merely had a broader experience and came the same conclusions earlier than did you. <br />
<br />
And, yeah, paladins are overpowered.  I play with a good paladin.  He does shit I don't think anyone should be able to do.  But, hey, I soloed Mother Smolderweb and he never could.  We have to use, in Haass's words, the tools in our toolbox.  And class balance shouldn't necessarily mean that every class is exactly equal against every other class.  The largest part of this game is clearly group and large-scale PvP.  <br />
<br />
(As an aside, playing guildwars...and in that game every class really is pretty much equal against others.  LOVE the game.  LOVE the design.  LOVE the fact that when I PvP, it will be in an arena with opponents of equal number.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-08-2005, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still don't have issues with 99% of paladins.  In fact, I've only met one, in 111 levels who's done a goddamned thing to annoy me.<br />
<br />
Just because a class is overpowered, doesn't mean that there aren't people complaining about it who think that auto attack should be enough to kill them.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a better line should have been &quot;If you have problems with 99% of the wankers playing this game, you're not using all the tools in your toolbox,&quot; because honestly, the skill level is far lower than it ever was in EQ, and anyone whos' done anything in that game shouldn't have a problem owning people up one side and down the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lucky for you, 99.9% of paladins are leet dudes running around in warrior gear.  I was trying to get a BRD run and we had a Paladin.  I was tired of waiting around, so I said screw it, lets go and use the Paladin as a healer and see how far we get.  Come to find out, the paladin might as well have been a warrior, because he had zero intellect and spirit gear.  Everything was warrior gear, specifically for being a leet dude.  He admited he was embarrassed, but that is the way the majority of them play.  They want easy mode warrior, totally missing the potential power of their class.  So while some groups will rock PvP, the majority of alliance grops will not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not just paladins. IMO the warrior class can use some added survivability, be it more hitpoints, improved talents or refinement of our disciplines (special abilities like shield wall / retaliate that currently share a single very long timer). The timers on our abilities are just too fucking long, take intercept and shield bash for example.<br />
<br />
Another thing that annoys me a lot and is connected with the above is the rage penalty. Why oh why have they gimped us by making it so that rage bar will be empty if you switch stances. You spend 5 talent points to save 25 rage whenever you switch stances. Thats just like gimping yourself. When I just have to switch stance during pvp or otherwise (e.g. to interrupt) and I see my rage bar containing considerable points it just makes me sad but thats the way it is.<br />
<br />
Another annoyance is the charge ability. If you dont get off a charge before you're put into combat, chances are if its a duel you're screwed. In PvE if someone pulls something and it casts some AoE you wont be able to charge. The rage generated by charge is essential to use any abilities early on in a fight.<br />
<br />
My point is why call a nerf on another class. Why not improve what deserves to be improved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also: shaman aren't so great in group pvp. they can still contribute but they're not as strong as they are in straight duels.<br />
<br />
Dead on the money.  Not to say we're weak...but the shaman TRULY shines in 1v1.  The class is practically crafted for it.  In group we are skirmishers and b/u healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a couple things<br />
<br />
first, in large scale battles my side lost about as often as it won against horde. we always had plenty of paladins. their skill level wasn't immaterial, but we lost with good paladins a lot because the other side played smart. hunters and priests vanquish paladins; invulnerability means nothing when you're feared and unable to do anything. this is, of course, assuming that the horde forces smartly protect their priests.<br />
<br />
second, some of the crappiest PvE paladins were murderous in PvP, and vice versa. it's kinda weird.<br />
<br />
also, a lot of paladins have what I call paladinitis, the sense of invincibility one gets when one plays a class that's hard to kill. one of my guildmates sorta had this - he'd run up and attack a tyrant devilsaur at level 53, telling myself (55 at the time) and a 56 rogue, &quot;cmon let's kill this.&quot; he was pretty good in pvp but he got arrogant and died a lot when confronted by good players. that can be exploited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i just typed a long as letter here, or post but i'm at an apple computer at school and i accidently pushed a button and its all gone and i cant bring it back lol...<br />
<br />
So i will just quick post saying pallys Need to be Nerfed! and Grey! i Don't Suck!<br />
<br />
Things pallys could be nerfed on...<br />
<br />
Mana Pool<br />
Healing<br />
Armor<br />
Seals, Or Auras...<br />
<br />
Something to take away thier lifes and make them have 2 instead of 4 and make them easier to kill...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">unless there's a glaring, unintended bug (like the seal fix a while back), leave paladins alone. if any balance changes are made - and I'm not certain they're required in this case - other classes should be boosted so they give paladins more of a match in straight duels.<br />
<br />
I kinda like how one class isn't so great against another but rules against a third or fourth or etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt say they need to be nerfed.  Coming from a class where I see senseless nerf threads constantly, I just accept the fact they are a long fight and move on.  If they had DPS they would be monsters.</div></div><hr />
