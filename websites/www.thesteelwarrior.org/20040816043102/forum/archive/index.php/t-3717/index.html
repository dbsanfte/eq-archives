<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My Ideas of class balance and melee balance.<br />
<br />
DPS upgrades <br />
- Offhand weapon Damage Bonus.<br />
- Raise the attack levels of pure melee, move all pure melee up a table.<br />
- increase ratio of pure melee weapons<br />
- increase skillcaps  of pure melee to 305 for their weapon types (fix piercing/archery for warrior)<br />
- increase dodge/parry/ripost/kick etc skill caps to give pure melee an advantage over other classes <br />
- A critical hit should do a MINIMUM of weapon Damage x 4, 17pt crits are dumb.<br />
<br />
HP upgrades<br />
- Mana = HP's : ratio is up for discussion but 1-1 or 1-2 for pure melee <br />
- Allow AA's to affect Buff Spells for pure melee<br />
<br />
Mitigation <br />
- Upgrade Warrior Mitigation by a real amount - reduce Total damage from all melee attacks,<br />
  by 10-15%.<br />
<br />
Stats<br />
- Advanced Body AA - allow melee (str/dex/agil/sta)  stats to increase to 355 (pure melee only)<br />
- FIX Stamina- Stamina should give MORE HP/StA as it increases instead of less.<br />
- Make Agility a more usefull stat in regards to AC/mitigation<br />
<br />
Disciplines -<br />
- If nothing else UNHOOK all disciplines- each has its own refresh timer, <br />
  and have a BASE refresh timer between discipline uses of 3 minutes.<br />
- Ideally, make disciplines like quasi-spells/bard songs. Give us a book of tactics.<br />
  Use the SPELL GEMS for them. This has built in refresh timers etc. Easier to use, upgrade,add etc.<br />
- Take a look at the length vs refresh of several disciplines, and the effectiveness of them.<br />
<br />
Taunt -<br />
- GIVE A SUCCESS or FAIL MESSAGE!<br />
- increase range to 50'<br />
- increase effectiveness - ie 60% success is unacceptable for mobs levels less than player.<br />
- Add XXX pure hate for every taunt. <br />
  The XXX would be the skill level of the taunter OR Top Hate + 1 whichever is more.<br />
<br />
Ranged Taunt -<br />
- New AA ability - <br />
  Call Out (3 levels 3/3/3/3/3)- this ability allows a warrior to target a mob and Call Out them to melee combat. <br />
  Some Mobs can be flagged immune. This ability gives the warrior + 700 Hate.<br />
  Level 1 - Trainable at Level 51 Affacts mobs Up to level 50 - Range 100 - reset 1 minute<br />
  Level 2 - Trainable at Level 55 Affects Mobs up to level 55 - Range 125 - Reset 1 minute<br />
  Level 3 - Trainable at Level 59 Affacts mobs Up to level 59 - Range 150 - reset 1 minute<br />
  Level 4 - Trainable at Level 63 Affects Mobs up to level 63 - Range 175 - Reset 1 minute <br />
  Level 5 - Trainable at Level 65 Affacts mobs Up to level 65 - Range 200 - reset 1 minute <br />
<br />
Melee Focus effects-<br />
- Deflect Focus 1-4 - increases parry by  2,5,10,15%<br />
- Dodge focus 1-4 - increase dodge by 2,5,10,15%<br />
- Strikeback Focus 1-4 - increase riposte by 2,5,10,15%<br />
- Weapon haste 1-4 - Decrease weapon delay by 1,2,4,6<br />
- Weapon Power 1-4 - Increase weapon damage by 1,2,4,6<br />
<br />
AA abilities-<br />
- Advanced Body<br />
- Call Out<br />
- Deathblow - 5 AA trainable at level 65- <br />
  this ability allows the character to kill instantly with a single blow a mob that is signifigantly below its level.<br />
  this AA works on mobs that are green.<br />
<br />
Itemization-<br />
- Remove all stun spells from weapons. Replace them with a new line of effects that do a DD + hate equivalent to what they currently have.<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
a few changes I would make to casting is aggro.<br />
<br />
IMMUNE SPELLS - cast a spell on a mob that is IMMUNE to the spell, and this will cause +1 pure hate and that is all. <br />
RESISTED SPELLS - Spells resisted fully will cause HALF NORMAL Hate<br />
MITIGATED SPELLS - SPELLS MITIGATED will cause Hate = normal HATE x Mitigation factor.</div></div><hr />

Sounds great, but i think these may need a little work...<br />
<br />
Raging taunt would be great, but not sure that 15aa is worth an ability that would only work with xp mobs, could the cap go above 65?<br />
<br />
The melle focus items seem a bit like tiem item effects, they would be nice, but seems that they would be little over powering<br />
<br />
Everything else seems fine to me, melee stat cap up, skill caps up to give pure melee a little bit of an edge sounds pretty good<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems that our problem is ranged aggro and snap aggro in EXP groups. This would prevent it from breaking 'Raid' Content, which is what all paladins say would happen if we had the same aggro as they do.<br />
<br />
 <br />

 <br />
<br />
These are very similar to time effects, But I dont see how letting a wizard nuke for 20% more, for 20% less mana, 20 % faster is any less power ful than ANY or ALL of these melee effects combined.<br />
<br />
Focus effects completely left out melee, it is one part of balancing that many people overlook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your numbers for some of those abilities may be a bit excessive, but they're basically good ideas.  I'd make several of them innate abilities gained at various earlier levels and scale up as you level instead of making them AA's though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think some of your melee balancing may unbalance the game, especially the one that add hp/mitigation... However some of them I would to see those RIGHT NOW in game :<br />

- Ranged Taunt - New AA ability ---&gt; Why an AA ? make it an innate ability at level 45 (you know, the 40 50, where warriors gain nothing) and make it scale with level and upgradable with AAs.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the new AA... the insta-kill already exist (assassination, head shot)... I would prefer some Rampage and Warcry Revamp.<br />
- Rampage : make it a toggled ability allowing the user to AE fight, hitting everuthing regulary in a small radius, with a 20% penalty to delay and damage. The old rampage make it an innate ability called &quot;Cleave&quot; you can use once every 12 seconds (and you never proc on a cleave, of course).<br />
- Warcry : make it useful. It could be a group /shield, and it will justify the 12+3+6+9 you need to pay and the reuse time.</div></div><hr />

AA because of large ranged fixxed amount of hate on mobs that scales up as you level. Innate skill would be nice, but I feel we should pay for an upgraded ability such as this somehow. Ranged/snap taunt is not as much an issue pre POP so I see no problem with this. the AA requirement is not that steep and easilly attainable as you level.<br />
<br />
<br />

 <br />
<br />
This for one reason.. ever been swarmed by 20-30 green mobs, and just die? We are the only class that has no defense from this, all others do, this would help, plus sure would be fun..<br />

<br />
Good ideas, I love Cleave from D&amp;D 3rd ed, and Great Cleave, couldnt work the same way here, but your idea is cool.  Toggled may be  a little too powerfull, though... Would take looking into.<br />
<br />
 <br />
- Warcry : make it useful. It could be a group /shield, and it will justify the 12+3+6+9 you need to pay and the reuse time.  <br />
<br />
Warcry should be an innate ability, and always prevent fear for the cost it has. <br />
<br />
Group shield would be nice, if it was at longer range.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>corillis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/clap<br />
<br />
great ideas. The numbres should be crunshed down a little bit by SOE, but I really can see some of these applies in-game.<br />
Cleave would be great, I love it in DnD3ed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Instead of raising most skill caps to 305 for pure melee how about giving them an option to 'specialize', just like caster specializations. For instance you are given 100 skill points which you can spend on various skills evenly, say bring all skills upto 275, or you can specialize in one or two skills which can then be raised to 305.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">GIVE TAUNT A SUCCESS or FAIL MESSAGE!<br />

<br />
I think this may be a bit excessive.  If you add XXX pure hate even on a failed taunt then 60% success isn't unacceptable anymore.  My personal taunt suggestion is similar.<br />
<br />
Keep taunt the way it is now however add the XXX pure hate on a success or failure.  Make the XXX pure hate part work at range, whatever range seems appropriate.  This lets warriors generate aggro on the inc with taunt as well as a bow.  It still requires the warrior/knight to be in melee range to use the top of hate list part of taunt which seems balanced as thats a pretty powerful feature when taunt is adding pure hate as well.   <br />
<br />
I also don't really like AA to improve taunting.  From my experience low end warriors have the most problems with aggro, high end warriors the least, low end warriors can't afford more places to spend AA, high end warriors can.  It seems to target the wrong group for improvement.  Just make taunt good enough that it works without any AA.<br />
<br />
I agree with your other suggestions though I think your numbers are mostly too high for improvements, adding 50 to skill caps is a large change, focus adding 15% may be too high etc.<br />
<br />
One other suggestion I'd make is to make ripostes only effect main hand weapons and fix DMG bonus so that a 10/20 weapon performs as well as a 20/40 weapon in main hand.  This lets warriors use a high delay 1h in mainhand to maintain DPS and decrease riposte dmg against them by a large margin.  The balance then becomes you want a high delay weapon to avoid damage shields and ripostes but you want a low delay weapon for lower spikes in dmg and steadier aggro generation.  So you face real decisions when picking a weapon, instead of faster=better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solution #1.  Rampage + Charge Disc + Earthshaker<br />
<br />
Solution #2.  Two handed high damage sword + AETaunt + Furious Disc</div></div><hr />

Imagine mob is inc:<br />
<br />
I use /disc fort then /disc defensive then /disc evasive . <br />
<br />
I like the other ideas but I don't think they will ever unhook the disciplines.<br />
<br />
Hopefully SOE will at least pay this a bit of attention.</div></div><hr />
