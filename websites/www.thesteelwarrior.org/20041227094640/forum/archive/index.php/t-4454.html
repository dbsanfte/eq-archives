Can't use it in a group because the ninjalooters take advantage of it...  when soloing and I disarm a mob, I don't see any reduction in the damage the mob does to me.<br />
<br />
What good is this skill?  Anyone got answers, cuz I waited so looooooooong to get this skill and its the last one, and it seems to suck arse.<br />

They seem to have lots of problems getting their disarm up... that hasn't been an issue for me.  I practice all the time on dark elf guards in Nektulos and my disarm is at 199... not bad for a level 40 warrior.<br />
<br />
But I still don't see what good it does :P<br />

If you disarm their weapon, that allows you a few hits in while they can't attack back.  Unless it is a monk or beastlord.  Most people never bother to get h2h up.  It really just buys you a few rounds of free dmg without worry of them coming back at you.  Other than that, disarming orc pawns is always fun.</div></div><hr />

LOL @ Varaho...  Seems to be gettin' clearer... and ta think I was hoping for some ray of sunshine that would reveal that this is actually an Important skill worth waiting 35 levels for!!!!!  Arrrgh...<br />

Thats a good idea.  I've gotten in  the habit of always using it, regardless of whether my opponant is armed or not, just because I'm trying to max it out as quick as possible.  Seems to be working too, cuz my disarm is right up there with all my other warrior skills.  But binding it to one of the others is an even better idea.  Thanks for the tip :)<br />

<br />
However, I will tell you one thing...don't bind it to taunt.  If it's bound there, you'll never know when taunt is up or not, and you get railroaded into a mashing situation (and mashing is bad, mkay?)<br />

All those dual wielding mobs, occasionally they would be using one fine steel weapon, which could be disarmed, and drastically reduced their damage.  But since most of the time they were dual wielding no drop weapons, it was barely useful there.<br />

That is about the only time I have found it useful!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is also false, you can not disarm the offhand of a mob, hence you will never make it not dual wield, so you can never reduce a mob's damage output via disarm.<br />
<br />
It is basically useless, save for PvP.</div></div><hr />

I've had MOBs punch me for harder than they were slashing/piercing.  I got this skill, long ignored, up to max in Dulak.  Almost everybody had a broken bottle, or a board with a nail in it, or summat.<br />
<br />
Somewhere on these threads is reference that Disarm only adds a bit of aggro once, the first time you try it (iirc).  And that Beg is less of an aggro gain.  I'm still working on Beg, tho, as it's stuck at 196 and that bugs me ;).  There are peeps out there who, bless them, have spent hours and hours parsing such stuff.<br />
<br />
IMO, Disarm was never implemented in a way that lived up to it's potential.  Knocking a MOBs DPS down by 15 - 30% by stealing it's weapon would have been a nice trick, IMO.</div></div><hr />

Hi Doggabone :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.  'Fraid my beg skill is like a 2 or 3 or something :p  Never developed it.  I could try though, by coupling it with disarm, if it will help draw aggro.  Anything that would help draw aggro is a plus :p<br />
<br />
I sure agree it would have been nice to see Mobs DPS knocked down by disarming it, and would make better sense.  Oh well.... guess thats why I'm not making the big bucks, lol.<br />

It's all in your head.  Varaho proved disarm doesn't do shit quite awhile ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, originally, MOBs and pets could not dualwield without 2 weapons. They can now.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, originally, if you met a nasty MOB dualwielding 2 daggers, disarming it would be useful. Nowadays, it's only a gimmick for PvP and taunting a bit more on a mezzed MOB (gives 1 point of hate methinks), anyways ... no reason not to use it even if the aggro is neglible.<br />
<br />
But no real value in regular PVE.<br />
<br />
<br />

* = This all happened just before Kunark was launched if memory serves me. Plane of Fear and Plane of Hate was added though and groups was complaining about Necromancer pets dual who wielded finesteel daggers that could outdamage an entire group of regular level 50 players - AND - The necromancer could just stay FD'ed the whole fight.<br />
<br />
That last bit was changed too, now pets poof after 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go give some level 30+ NPC without a weapon a dagger - You will now see it have the same dagger in both hands. That has not always been the case. And before that chance was made, you COULD disarm both hands of a MOB, this was tested on necro pets in duels, whom where for all purposes a MOB under the old, old, old pet system.<br />

Yessir you have it correct.  The actual example cited at that time (July/Aug 1999) was that a Necro could solo the Lord room in lower guk, while FD, hell while AFK, with a pet dual wielding FS daggers.  Needless to say this really pissed people off.<br />
<br />
As far as disarm: I see no useful purpose for this.  It doesn't affect  mob dps, it doesn't affect mob hit speed, it doesn't generate any meaningful hate (well probably as much as beg does); heck it doesn't even help you farm FS weapons all that well.  I don't do PvP but I imagine as it doesn't effect magic weapons it isn't worth a hoot their either (I am not a PvP person so I really have no idea).<br />
<br />
All in all something that once had potential that is now sitting in the dustbin of everquest.</div></div><hr />
