<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We took him down lastnight. At the end of the fight there were 53 in the raid. Started with 35+. First tank went down at around 90% or so. I took over after that and tanked him to the end. I called for new tank when my /def ran out but he never steped up and healers just kept healing me. /shrug <br />
   This was the first AoW kill with just Incursion.  Its  a nice feeling to have taken this mob down with only our guild. I was in guild since it was formed.  Next  is flaging and VT.<br />
<br />
~EDIT~ The first tank is a Ogre I am an Iksar. Iksars rule Ogres drool. LOL :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats Conanix.  Looking to kill this bastage in up and coming time.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you were able to score a BoC out of it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gratz on the kill and the BoC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To let you all know..........he is now conerable in the obtuse corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Grats! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">2 helms and 2 bows. I already have the helm.  I have 2 swords that are verry nice. OSOW from Vallon and the blade of storms from BoT. I will be placing anger 3 augs on them and i think those will be my wepons till i get some nice EP wepon. I dont think I will be biding on the BoC if it drops. We have another tank in our guild that could use it more than me. Since both my swords were obtained from a raid and are nodrop. I would feel bad if i got the BoC also. Tell me my thinking is correct ! hehe that anger3 augs on OSOW and Great blade of the 4winds or what ever its called from BoT is better than BoC. Altho i guess BoC plus anger 3 would rock. /bogle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was going by your magelo which shows a BoC. But yeah OSoW and GBoS both with anger3 would be plenty of aggro, and better dps too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ya my magelo is wrong. it was turned into a wishlist along with some gear i already have. I should fix that tonight. will post back when its fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">our guild tried to take him down last weekend, but ran into a few promblems....basically not enough info on him. We had one cleric out of the rotation for rampage healing, we didn't know that he didn't rampage. anyhoos.. Good Job! hes a big bastard</div></div><hr />
