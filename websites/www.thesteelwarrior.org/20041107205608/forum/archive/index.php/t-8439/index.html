<br />
Dunno if this has come up before, but AE taunt doesn't work in PoFear, as of last weekend anyway.  I'm *guessing* this was broken by the AA database patch a few weeks ago the way bard's fading memories was perhaps?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wha? AE taunt works fine for me in Sky and Hate at least. Haven't been to Fear in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no, area taunt and rampage + other aa's will/do not work in fear.  (I believe its to prevent wizards from soloing golems with manaburn, even with it gimped golems only have near 7k hp, they can MB for about that, sometimes more.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They did some kind of stealth nerfing to fear a few patches ago. You cant use MGB buffs in there anymore either. But they never said anything about it in any patch messages, or why they made the changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lykke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just like em, Well I was in fear last wed, and I can comfirm that AE tunat dont work there. Thought no aa's work in  the old planes, but what do I know. I have not been in hate in 2 years. Nice to know that its just Fear Payn. Any other zones that has been Nerfed in this way Payn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Golems have a lot more than 7k hps.  I'd guess the standard 32k.  Last time I was there, maybe 3 months ago, I manaburned one of the death touching ones with my wizzie as the initial sacrifice for the SK to pull him to our group.  Manaburn landed for a high 7k (no crit).  The SK harm touched him on the way to the group cause he kept getting summoned and didn't think he'd make it back before the next death touch.  Harm touched him for 9k+ crit.  The golem was at half health from the two.<br />

Manaburn ain't no threat to these things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That is odd...  FYI AA abilities are working just fine in Hate as of last night.   Decided I want to smash me some inky scum. /cackle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi all-<br />
<br />
When they did the database update to AAs a patch or three ago, they &quot;broke&quot; a number of them apparently- for instance, fading memories (bard AA to clear aggro/invis) stopped working in PoFear and, believe it or not, Kedge.  Rumor is that they are making some changes so that they can disable AAs by zone, for encounter tuning/control in the OoW expansion... and screwed it up.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, it's &quot;broken&quot; and needs to be fixed at some point, /bug and /feedback if you get a chance.  Those zones aren't all that important perhaps, BUT it would be a Very Good Thing if they got the code working right *BEFORE* OOW SHIPS.<br />
<br />

RdT.<br />
p.s. /confirm, AE taunt/rampage/etc. all work fine in poh/posky, and did work in pofear... will pop over to kedge and see if they are broke there if/when I get a few min of free time.</div></div><hr />

Remf, are you saying PoFear AA's have been fixed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sucana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">mgb and ae taunt did not work in sky this past Sunday.  (two days ago)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm I haven't been to sky/hate since the AA revamp, I'll have to check them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This should be mentioned to the Dev's if it hasnt yet, this sounds wrong to nerf the AA abilities in the old world planes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">oh that's awesome, no aa's in fear, that actually sounds possibly ALOT of fun... fear used to be a blast back in the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hola again-<br />
<br />
Sorry if it was confusing- AAs *did* work in PoSky/Hate as of a few weeks ago, I haven't been up there since that AA database patch tho.  I had visited pofear after that patch (buddy's twink needed an epic drop) and the AAs weren't working correctly, hence the original post.<br />
<br />
Haven't been into any of the old planes since latest patch tho, so I can't confirm/deny that they are working... It must be a &quot;known&quot; issue, it's affecting other classes too (i.e. bard fading memories, mgb for casters, etc.).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, I think nerfing aa's in ANY zone is wrong as hell.   We paid for them to &quot;get ahead&quot; so to speak.  To get abilities that we didn't have before.  If they are too inept to tune encounters, taking into account the aa's they gave us to buy, then it's their problem.  Shouldn't be ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Rumor is that they are making some changes so that they can disable AAs by zone, for encounter tuning/control in the OoW expansion... and screwed it up. <br />
<br />
Wouldn't that be wonderful?  You buy the now really overpriced AAs, then they disable them at will in various zones.  I await the zones where all mobs are immune to slow (I hear in OoW beta that a huge number of mobs are completely slow immune), defensive/evasive disc doesn't work, AE taunt doesn't work... hey, maybe they disable stalwart endurance and weapon affinity while they're at it... fun zone!  <br />
<br />
Yes please Sony, it took years to finally give of some abilities to use besides auto attacking, staying in the mob's face, and mashing taunt.  Now take those abilities away.  That will be sweet. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cyquinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Some AAs have been disabled in the Old planes for quite a while. During a Sky raid 6-8 months ago, shaman spirit call for certain didn't work. Pretty sure AE taunt was working then. And I agree that if we pay for the damned things, we ought to be able to use them. They want to grind out AAs for me, then they can tell me I can't use them. /rude SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hola-<br />
<br />
Spirit call (and ranger pet weapon, etc.) doesn't work in some of the old world zones because the graphic for the pet doesn't exist in the texture cache iirc (If I Recall Correctly), been that way since the new pet graphics came out I think.<br />
