  I'm currently flagged for Crypt of Decay and nothing else.  I'm looking for any upgrades within reason.  I'm open for opinions on anything, including an AA path for someone who wants to join a guild.  Any input is appreciated, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could upgrade at least the solstice earring to bloodmetal, also bow could be replaced by a stonewood or similar one with 100 hp.  <br />
<br />
Arms and perhaps helmet definitely could be replaced by ornate stuff.  Either ornate, Vindi, or Statue BP would be nice upgrade for BP but not as much of upgrade as other stuff.  <br />
<br />
Neclace needs more hp too, anything with more hp is better-- even a velium black saphire neclace with 6 stamina aug from LDoN would be 65 hp + 6 stamina.  <br />
<br />
Not really sure if you have a lot of plat for some of that stuff, definitely need guild or about 24 good friends of similar gear to yours for the Vindi or Statue BPs.  <br />
<br />
The heraldic stuff is nice, wouldn't upgrade much of that unless you had a lot better item to replace it and you will need guild for that.  <br />
<br />
Basically the earring of solstice and the neclace you have kind of suck a lot and those are what I would lose first if it was me.  Earring will be expensive, neclace will be less than 1k and a few adventures to get augment for stamina to drop.</div></div><hr />
