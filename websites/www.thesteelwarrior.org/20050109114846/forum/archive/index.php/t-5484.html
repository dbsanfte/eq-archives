<br />
We were clearing the trash fairly deep in when suddenly Raex runs up the steps and engages us.   Surprise! MT goes down in a few seconds.  I engage and taunt and... uber Pally engages from behind, takes aggro, and dies in like 2 seconds.  I regain aggro and go Evasive since I read here somewhere that mobs can't proc if they miss, and that 5k lifetap terrifies me.<br />
<br />
I lasted 90 seconds before my luck ran out - Raex took all 72% of my remaining HPs in one round.<br />

 ...Raex lifetap for 5000...Also, these guys are EVASIVE folks. <br />

I have never before used Evasive and would like confirmation that it wasn't an ignorant choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But on Carpin cycle procs e.d evasive &gt; def<br />
<br />
As a rule of thumb I use Evasive on everything on/in Luclin, and Def/SW in PoP, *unless* they're proc bad mojo... then it's evasive :)</div></div><hr />

DI fired once early on, so really i died, but it worked out :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just use defensive and get a bard singing psalm in my group, resist the lifetap everytime.  Raex pounds pretty hard for guilds just starting tier 2ish stuff, seemed like his melee would be way too spikey in evasive.  Well all in all, have a bard singing psalm and you'll most likely never have to worry about the proc again, just make sure you have SS + that enchanter ldon spell, I forget the name, but have them both up incase.</div></div><hr />

It's gotten to the point where, with the PoP mobs that have the nasty procs, I just default with Evasive. I was sad when they nerfed it. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Evasive is on its original timer as far as I'm aware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have guard of druzzil from an enchanter and then tell your bard to play psalm of veeshan and guardian rhythms. They stack. Assuming he has im3 and sm3, and a vots, if your bard goes puretone he will reach the mod cap, and will reach 3.4 for drums. This will give 421mr from the bard alone. Guard of Druzzil is 75 so will put you at 496. Assuming you have at least 4mr, you will cap to 500 with ease. Bard could do even more if he had jamfest.<br />
<br />
Also not sure of your guild knows or not, but raex and his buddy vindor will move to seperate rooms after about 5 minutes making splitting them trivial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Psalm of Veeshan is singing.  :)<br />
<br />
Yeah, Raex will annihilate you in a heartbeat if you're not set up properly for him.  You need 500mr, so Guard of Druzzil + Psalm of Veeshan.  Hell, even Ferocity (+65 all resists) greatly helps as well.  With 500mr, you will resist every Lifetap, but it's still a good idea to go Evasive.  A missed note on the bard song, dropping your MR greatly, can mean death, and Evasive reduces the Rampage rate anyways (Raex rampages, Vindor flurries).  Raex and Vindor also melee for pretty hefty amounts, but it's nowhere near as ferocious as being lifetapped twice in a single round.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Evasive refreshes on the same timer as Defensive now, instead of faster, that's what I was referring to when I say it was nerfed. Mobs I used to be able to evasive on twice I can't anymore, for instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Er Evasive refreshes at 7 minutes and 45 secs while stonewall/defensive is like 12 or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect.  Both are on a 10:30 (I think) refresh timer now, where defensive was on 10 and evasive was 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stonewall/defensive is 10:30, evasive is 7:45.  I usually pop evasive every time it's up while clearing trash for the hell of it and it does pop faster for sure.</div></div><hr />
