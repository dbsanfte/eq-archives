<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About a week ago a warrior pal finished his epic and sold me his old BoC at the very fair price of 150k.  I promptly snatched it up and ever since I've been watching the prices for it go down very quickly.  A month ago, it was hard to find one in the bazaar and it would sell for maybe 400k, about two weeks ago it was rare to find one under 300k, a week ago they were 200-250k, and just this morning I saw four of them going for 170-190k.<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering if prices are dropping on all other servers too, or what's the deal?  There aren't THAT many viable alternatives for casual, non-time enabled warriors out there.  Sure, the Bygone Butcher's Cleaver is good, and so is the Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance but they're not as good as the BoC, I've swung them both and the BoC aggro is far superior.  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prices have been fairly steady on Stromm.  Typically they go for 200-250k and have for several months.  Occasionally I'll see one for 300k, but that's rare, and have never seen one for under 200k ever.  Recently there were 4-5 for sale from about 220-250k, now they are all gone though.   :(  I'm wondering if I should start saving for one, it seems like a logical upgrade for me since my other gear is mostly best in bazaar and I have experienced some, albeit not bad, aggro issues recently.  I think I'll lose a little dps from my current SoD, but am wondering how significant that dps loss is, and if the BoC will perform significantly better than the SoD for aggro.  I am thinking of keeping the BBC in my offhand for the stats and selling the SoD instead of moving the SoD to secondary and BoC to primary.  I can make a lot off selling the SoD, but nothing off the BBC.  Is that the best thing to do?  Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yeah, good to see they're holding their own on your server.  And I would probably buy a BoC and try both BBC and SoD offhand to see if they work well enough.</div></div><hr />

... but I think prices are still 150-250k. (afaik)</div></div><hr />

I think they may be coming down a little but still outragous.<br />

<br />
on Test; never saw one for sale so no help there; but I expect a lot of things dropping in value in the next few weeks until new year when the hype of the new games wears off.</div></div><hr />

Only thing that annoys me is the constant tells of &quot;you wanna sell your BoC??&quot;  They keep badgering me when I tell em no repeatedly.  I have 3 people on ignore from that, thus far.</div></div><hr />

Later decided to sell it off, after a couple weeks I got 250k for it. Then there were others in baz for 230 and 200k. Seems to be dropping.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On A. Ro they've been anywhere from 150k all the way up to 400k (though I do not know if that one sold at all) I bought mine for 250k. I've seen one for 90k, but unfortunately I was not quick enough to the punch and someone beat me to it. Generally speaking you can expect to see one or two, both averaging out to around 200k or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason I even bother to try to sell it(been collecting dust in my bank forever) is because I'm trying to gather up some pp to spend on augment making(would like an improved dodge 3 and ferocity 3 aug). <br />
<br />
I guess others could have similar motivations for cleaning up their banks and getting rid of stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johnjacobjingle</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So is this blade worth 500K. And if so, when would you expect a young warrior to be able to afford it? Am Lvl 60 now and can not fathom having 500K, nor would I know were to begin if I were to go after it. Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that there is much better ratio swords dropping that can be aug'd and their dps is superior to BoC at 1/20th the price prob has something to do with it. Also since Luclin the statue / KT / Zland have about a 2 second life span before they are one grouped or even less nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prices have been dropping steadily over the past few months on Torv, and are now holding at 280-300k or so. It's still hands-down the best aggro weapon available to anyone through purchasable means, and in my opinion it's worth it as long as you don't sacrifice tons of armor for one. The people I hate are those that have a Blade of Carnage and are then wearing a mixture of Crusty and cobalt with some orc fang earrings at level 55  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen them from 150-300k on Tribunal.  Usually the ones for 150k get snatched up and resold for 250ish or so.  They go in phases it seems.  Last week there were probably 3 or 4 for sale.  This week, it's 3 or 4 SoD's for sale.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as is it worth it?  It depends on how you play really and what means you have at your disposal.  Can you farm ornate to sell?  How about making level 2 or 3 augs?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's far better to upgrade your main gear first imo.  AC/HP &gt; BoC until you can afford to get one without sacrificing other slots.  There are a slew of alternatives that work well enough for general XPing that are far cheaper.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a BoC, SoD, and SoMV.  The SoMV sits in the bag most of the time.  I'm going to work on slapping a Force of Ykesha aug in it and see what happens.  I don't plan on augging the SoD since I like it tradeable for my other account.<br />
<br />
I don't get tells from people wanting to buy my BoC much.  It's usually the SoD they want, which is going to stay with me till the EQ servers finally shut down for good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apokolipse</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lately I've seen a few for sale around 250k - 300k.  SoD's are always for sale.  I don't think it's a matter of everyone upgrading all of a sudden, I think people are just leaving EQ and selling off everything that's droppable.  I've been considering selling my BoC just get get a HoRZ cause the OoW gear all lacks AC.  But now the HoRZ is dropping too, down to 105k last I checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why keep the SoMV in the bag?  Is the SoD better dps and aggro?  Stats and ratio are clearly better on the SoMV.<br />
<br />
I guess after I get my BoC I'll look at whether the BBC I have or the SoD perform better in offhand.  I sure would like to keep the stats on the BBC...  much better than the SoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think we sometimes worry about OVERAGRO too much.  Some fun in the game comes from looking good and just being effective.   If you have a BoC in your main hand and it's augged...the SoMV WILL be just fine in your offhand (and as mentioned, stats are better).  Esp if it's also augged.  Sure, the SoD might give you a few bits of extra agro which...if people aren't clueless in your group, probably isn't even noticable......<br />
<br />
But honestly...the difference imho is so minor that I'd rather take that .005% chance that the druid gets wacked for over agroing and look GOOD than run around waving that damn magical christmas stick.<br />

The seller must've missed a &quot;0&quot; when he was setting up his trader. I bet he was cussing up a storm!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Missing a zero would be my guess too.  I once bought an item for 12pp off of a guildmate who meant to set it for 12k.  I charged him 15pp to buy it back from me hehe.  That's not as bad as selling a BoC for 25k though, ouch.</div></div><hr />
