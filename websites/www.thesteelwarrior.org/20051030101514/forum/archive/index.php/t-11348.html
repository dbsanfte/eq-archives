I was curious as to where I can find more of the quest givers from this faction.  I am very interested in getting the trinket they give.  I have heard that the high end faction is much harder to get with them but I am sure thats not too much of an issue.  If you can link sites or have personal info on what I can do to get better faction it would be much appreciated.<br />

Each type of monster has a various 'cap' on faction you can get to by killing it.   The best I've been able to do with stratholme/scholo is about 1/2 through honored.  Now only the bosses, and doing the scourgestone turnins and using valor trinkets gives it.  (Some various quests do too, but there isn't exactly tons of them to build good faction on.)</div></div><hr />

Edit: Can't verify weapon plans, I guess they're TB.<br />
There is a signifcant boost in the number of items you can get from them at good faction though.</div></div><hr />

  Hrmm I found a quest in desolace from an argent dawn fellow that I did at around 35, got me a little chunk of faction as an alliance priest. I'm not sure if he is available for both factions, he is on the coast west of thunderaxe fortress, on a ledge just north of the large tower there, easy quest, kill a guy in thunderaxe guardtowers then go kill a couple nagas to get to a statue to spawn a lvl 38 naga and kill him also. Decent caster bracers iirc and some mail piece plus faction.</div></div><hr />
