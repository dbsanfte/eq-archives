<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doomdweomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
 I been playing casual for a few years as a warrior(and other alts) and it seems every few levels i outgrow my gear. It's become even more evident of late because on my server there seem to be way more 65 warriors than all other levels, at least when i am online. Most these fellahs , I'm sure you know, come geared and AA'ed. The disparity between them and I is broad. As a result , there is this lingering inferiorty complex coupled with some green envy.<br />
<br />
 Anyways, you knew the gear check was coming. I have a family guild that is starting to get into Teir one, Velius, and Kunark type boss mobs, occasionally.The real question i am askin ,i Spose is ,... might there be some peices of gear out there ... Group attainable ... that i missed? Have I tapped out the bazzar, without having to spend 100k?(just spent everything for the Kizrak's peices i gots) <br />
<br />
Put on this Toon and think 'what would i do?' (please dont say /reroll)<br />
<br />
<br />
 Hey thanks  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cazic Thule -- Amygdalan Chain Mask (1 groupable), 85 raw hp.  Also, Lizard Tooth Earring, 70x raw hp.<br />
<br />
Plane of Tactics -- Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement (must be crafted, but the parts drop here).  If you aren't flagged, you can either try to get in on a Behemoth raid, or you can farm diaku medallions in the desert in Plane of Storms (one groupable).<br />
<br />
You might want to think about grinding out some LDoNs with an eye toward gearing up to do hard LDoNs.  Going for some flags (PoV/PoS at least) will give you some free AA which will boost your tankability lots as well as giving you a fairly decent charm.  Once you get some more hp and AA under your belt, start eyeing hard LDoN drops: 90 hp neck and gaunts in Ruj, 85 hp boots, 100 hp ring in MM, etc.<br />
<br />
Grinding out normal LDoNs in Tak for the plate armor there (or go the bargain route in EF, which has a side benefit of unlocking the anger augs) might be a good midterm goal.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
edit: If you get the cash, keep a lookout for ornate helm mold, it would be a  fair upgrade for your current helm.  I wouldn't bother with boots/bracer though -- you can get better in LDoN.  If you take your guild to Kael and find King Tormax up, he might drop Boots of the Storm (75 hp) for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Doomdweomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Czai, <br />
<br />
 Thank you for your advice! Been grindin for adventure points and  AA's in LdOn anywhere i can find a group =) and i think this is the way I'll end up going.<br />
<br />
 Oh well, back at it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">May want to look into some quests as well.<br />
Strength of the Elements- 100hp shoulder item<br />
Dain Ring- 100hp ring (still have on my magelo if you want to look at the other stats)<br />
Spirit Wracked Cord-  shoulder,arm,wrist slot -  100hp.  You also get a 85hp ring from the quest. (also still using, if you want the addt stats)<br />
<br />
I think all of these would be worth your time if you are willing to put the time into them.<br />
You can find good walk throughs on Alla if you look for them.<br />
<br />
As stated above LDOn would be excellant for you.  You could upgrade alot of armor as well as Aug them for more hp's.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

Ornate wrists are a substantial upgrade to what you have, AC wise.<br />
<br />
Boots of the Storm are a bit pricey, but 75hp 35ac.  Alternatively, if hard LDoN is an option for you, there are the bloodied boots of forgotten rites, or something, that are 34ac 85hp ... these are usually cheaper than the boots of the storm, too.<br />
<br />
Ears and Wrists have already been mentioned.  I may also suggest buying the 40hp aug for your ring from NRo (1050 or 1150pts, I think).  Its expensive, but you will want some raw hp on your ring (either that, or get another Valorium Ring of Gallantry)<br />
<br />
If you have lots of plat to spend, you could look into getting a Helmet of Rallos Zek from AoW, 55ac 100hp.  Of course, that's gonna cost you a lot of plat :-\<br />
<br />
Really, LDoN and/or Ornate will be your best bet for gear upgrades, as has already been stated.</div></div><hr />

Some Cultural parts are way better than ornate imo, bang for the buck anyway.  Ornate price is often based around casters/hybrids who benifit from the effects, and so to a warrior very over priced.  Like our wrists are 35k on my server, because of clerics.  Or the Boots are 80K+ because of bards/pally.  Only ornate I like besides chest and legs, is the glove for the self haste</div></div><hr />
