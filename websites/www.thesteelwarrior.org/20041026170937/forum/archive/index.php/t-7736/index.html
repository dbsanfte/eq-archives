So we stand around pondering this, wondering if we somehow fubared the event.  Ten minutes go by, petitions get sent, all the while Barxt is getting tougher to kill.  Then the remaining add, which we figured out got punted to the zone in when they spawned, makes its way back to the raid...<br />

If not for the fucked up, bug ridden collision glitches that the sea monkeys at SoE STILL can't fix, we would be in Qvic now.  Right fucking now.<br />

The saddest part of this is that the GMs will do nothing, even when you wave a flag event in their face with screenshots, logs and all and explain what went wrong with the games due to a bug. I've done Xan in PoI 5 times, 2 times, mob warps high in the sky, 3 times, we get the kill but gnome despawns/ignores the raid. Each time we come prepared with plenty of force, and each time 45-50 people walk away still unflagged for the factory. The GM each time still refuses to give us flags. Despite our demonstrated preparedness/planning/ability to handle and defeat the encounter.</div></div><hr />
