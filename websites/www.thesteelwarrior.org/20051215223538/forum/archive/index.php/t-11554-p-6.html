<br />
Undead used to be permanently immune to fear, charm, mind control, and had permanent enduring breath, but were also vulnerable to undead spells.<br />
<br />
Somewhere along the line, someone bitched, so now we're flagged humanoid, and we have will of the forsaken instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the interesting things about these types of &quot;Nerf&quot; threads, is that they are silly, because Nerfs are so damnably dangerous.<br />
<br />
For example, if you say Paladin's (especially Protection Holy Shields) should be nerfed, then shouldn't warriors be nerfed too?? <br />
<br />
You must play a fucking monk. <br />
<br />
Listen here.  There's 2 ways to handle balance issues.  You can either nerf, or you can overpower everyone else.  Overpowering everyone else is bad, mmkay?  <br />
<br />
When you have ONE goddamned class that has durability FAR (and I mean ridiculously far) above every other class, and they trade next to nothing for it, then they need to be brought down to the level everyone else is on.  Otherwise, you have every class being invulnerable when you buff everyone else.<br />
<br />
And no, I don't believe in this &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors&quot; bullshit that everyone keeps spewing either.  That's not how the game should work.  We shouldn't be having discussions on boards about which class is the best to gank another class.  That's fucking crap.  Honestly, I do think warlocks need some love, because there is absolutely no way they can kill a UD warrior unless they bring a friend along.<br />
<br />
Balance is good.  Nerfs are good when necessary, and rock, paper, scissors is bad.</div></div><hr />

Used to in Beta...I thought it was a good trade off, too.  As Haass, mentioned the UD had their bennies and Pallies had a keg of UD whoopass.  Somehow someone didnt like that balancing act and changed it.<br />

<br />
It is NOT 1 class.   It's BOTH unique hybrid classes.   You don't seem to understand that Balance is NOTHING between classes....  Balance is Between SIDES IN THE WAR<br />
<br />
take a look at this thread, of druids complaining that Shaman crush them.<br />
That's a Balance Issue, because only Alliance Druids need fear Shaman Crushing.<br />
http://wow.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=8668<br />
<br />
If Horde Warriors have problems with Alliance Paladins.   Good.<br />
<br />
That's balance between not WvsP or DvsS but balance in terms of Alliance vs Horde.<br />
<br />
Hell look at your last statement and how much it contradicts your arguement.<br />
You said &quot;Balance is good.  Nerfs are good when necessary, and rock, paper, scissors is bad&quot;<br />
<br />
Notice again this thread....  http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/foru...ead.php?t=11391<br />
<br />
By the thread.... Warriors vs Warlocks are not balanced.   Warriors crush Warlock<br />
By your statement.... Balance is good.  Nerfs are good when necessary.<br />
<br />
Logical Conclusion.... Warriors need a NERF, to make them easier for Warlocks to beat.      Probable method.... weaken warriors vs fear.<br />
<br />
So Haass, do you support nerfing warriors fear resistance?<br />
<br />
Class vs Class Balance is impossible.<br />
Double so, when your talking different areas like PVE balance vs PVP Balance<br />
Triple so, when your talking 1-1 fights vs Group/Wars<br />
Quadriple so, when your talking raiding vs non-raiding<br />
Quintiple so, when your talking PVE groups vs PVE Soloing<br />
<br />
However, in terms of PVP.   The balance that matters is Alliance vs Horde.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're such a tool.  Paladins are invulnerable healers for alliance.<br />
<br />
The invulnerable healers for horde are........?<br />
<br />
OH WAIT.  HORDE DOESN'T HAVE ANY.<br />
<br />
Where's your balance now, genius?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see your point Haas, because it could be suicide to try to take the Paladin out first (and pointless due to shields) while everyone else is beating on you.  Nothing will be done about it though, because the balance will be maintained by numbskull paladins only worried about healing themselves and never healing their partners.  Too many leet dudes palying the class.  Its annoying as hell to die while watching the Paladin just sit there beat on the dude and enver once try to heal you and that is what usually happens.  They are only worried about their own survival.</div></div><hr />

warrior can not defeat a soul link warlock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So now we're halfway there...get rid of the goddamned paladins and we can get on to other things, like broken ass talent trees.<br />
<br />
(PS.  new blood craze is gonna be garbage too.  At least Iron will is getting fixed.  Glad someone else figured out that it wasn't doing a damned thing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">05-12-2005, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hunters can crush warlocks, paladins can crush warlocks, rogues can mages can druids can, so you wana nerf every other class? Clearly, you're using warlocks as a smoke screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">05-12-2005, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warlocks majorly buffed with the next patch too.<br />
most of the changes coming are minor, some are outright pointless (what's the point in spending 22 talents into demonology for a 6 damage increase on fire when you can put these 22 points into the FIRE tree?)<br />
<br />
the only excellent one is pet pathing, which has been around since beta.<br />
They're buffing a tree that is as useful for PVP as the protection tree for warriors, minus the - you guessed it - soul Link ultimate.<br />
We've been asked for quite a while what changes we want for the demonology tree<br />
#1 response: Improved Felhunter<br />
<br />
Guess what Eyonix didn't manage to get for us =P<br />
<br />
Hunters can crush warlocks, paladins can crush warlocks, rogues can mages can druids can, so you wana nerf every other class? Clearly, you're using warlocks as a smoke screen.<br />
I rooflezs at your cluelessness. <br />
I can crush hunters, I TOTALLY assrape mages. Paladins are a joke and druids are the toughest fight out there (if they have skill), Yet I can win on a regular basis<br />
Rogue only depends on one thing: Can he Cheap shot me? <br />
If the answer is no, I got a certain HK in my pocket.<br />
<br />
Highly amusing you missed the only class that can take me down more often than the other way around : Undead shadow priest.<br />
<br />
Warlock has serious issues when it comes to soulshards, when it comes to stunlocking rogues (which happen to be 25% of a PVP servers 60 PVP engaging population, hence the understandable &quot;whining of the vast majority of the class) but I believe a stun nerf to hit hard soon.<br />
And of course against shamans with a demonology talent build, because of purge.<br />
Blizzard is currently reconsidering which buffs should be dispellable, and I'll bet my left nut that after this change goes life, shamans will no longer be my arch-nemesis.<br />
A warlock with a bag full of soulshards, magical stones summoned and ready, a pet out and skilled is something you should damn well respect.</div></div><hr />
