<br />
Puller is puller.<br />
<br />
In LDoNs the MT can often be puller. In raids the MT is almost never puller.<br />
<br />
The other name you shoudl know is MA, Main Asssist. MA usually gets her target from the puller. The group or raid gets their target from the MA. The MT can be the MA, but as often as not she is not.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I kinda think the specific name for puller is &quot;puller&quot;, since I can't think of anything else you'd call it (and not sound silly).</div></div><hr />

MA = Main assist, can be a different person than the MT, but can also be the MT, depending on the situation.  Can also be the puller in certain situations.<br />
RT= Rampage tank, usually arrows the mob the puller is pulling before the MT arrows him, to set a rampage list.<br />
um...thats all i can think of right now.</div></div><hr />

Dont forget the SA- secondary assist in case the mt goes down for some reason on a multi mob pull. Or if you have a setup with two tanks handling seperate mobs, some people are assigned to the ma, some to the sa. It all depends on raid to raid.<br />
<br />
But yeah, puller is just the puller, no need for a special title, its self explanitory lol.</div></div><hr />

i must disagree with you here. i was the best in my guild to pull trakanon to the broken bridge (after successfully pull the protector with only 5 others juggs).<br />
<br />
and in ldons i prefer the term of &quot;single pack pulling&quot; :p</div></div><hr />

Its all dependant on a few things.<br />
<br />
1. Do you have a blazing bracer of fennin ro?<br />
2. Do you have a mage in your group to coh ya to clear aggro while you move mobs away from the named you want?<br />
3. Do you know how to use glob's of gooey goo for root pulling?<br />

I don't know that things but it sounds very interesting.<br />
Could you explain that some more please?<br />
<br />
- Why pull with that bracer? Because of long range (300)?<br />
- What does an invis potion help you while pulling?<br />
- How rare are these root items? Are there other items you could use for this?<br />
- Explain that CoH strategy some more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1)MT=Main Tank.A heavy tank used for the hardest hitting mob generally.Often     also the MA.He is the MT because he tanks(keeps aggro and eats the bulk of the damage ) the main mob.<br />
<br />
a)ST=Second Tank.A heavy tank that will normally step in for the MT if he falls,or, tank another heavy hitter.<br />
<br />
b)3T=Third Tank.Third tank in the order.Same basic job as ST....this can go on as long as needed with the descending order of heavy tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
2)MA=Main Assist.A person that designates targets for the dps.Often the MT.Often a tank when not the MT.However,it could be anyone who is best situated to call targets.Generally it's safest when things are busy for this person to be a good aggroing reasonable tank who can take hits from trash and or handle mez breaks.Doesn't have to be tho.The type of fight plays  role in the appropiate choice.<br />
<br />
a)SA=Second Assist.If the MA gets incapacitated the SA assumes his role.<br />
<br />
b)3A=Third Assist.As above and so on...<br />
<br />
Lots of fights are differant and benefit from differantfolks in differant jobs.Often certain people are more practiced and therefore get the jobs by default.  <br />
<br />
ie: When we were in POW I preferred a fast paladin to ma with their good ranged aggro on clearing . I would get aggro on their target and do the most tanking.I found it easier with a good knight because debuffs would start at range with multiple mobs in a slow to close environment.I still normally tanked the most when stuff hurt so i was MT and the knight was MA.Because folks were used to me calling targets and following me around I was often assingned the MA &amp; MT role as one.There are also lots of fights where you don't want the dps on the MT's target so they are directed to add targets by an MA.Folks here could go on forever with examples...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Add tanks are in there too, although that's somewhat squishy: often a function rather than a designated person.<br />
My guild's been running some lower-level small raids lately with a Puller, MA/MT, and a second tank who also add tanks as needed if crowd control is, er, busy. Add tanking does require situational awareness and some knowledge of how much and what kind of help is required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, add tanking is what most tanks do.A fellow above had a question about the titles I listed.We also use a number of pullers at any given moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Questions over questions  <br />
<br />
1. Bracer is line of sight, can nuke - run behind a wall and wait for the bolt to hit, you'll get a single, and you dont have to &quot; see your target &quot; inorder to nuke it with the bracer. So you can target a mob deep in a tunnel or hallway, get outside of that tunnel or hallway and use bracer, the mob you had targetted will come out single.<br />
<br />
2. Invis potions - once you aggro a mob, if you invis - nothing will add onto that mob, or on you when bringing it back to the group/raid/whatever.<br />
<br />
4. The globs of gooey go are common from HS for root.<br />
<br />
3. Coh clears aggro as long as the mob cannot see where you are summoned to (aka, put a mage behind a wall, door, pillar, rock or something and get coh'd and your aggro is cleared.) *this works espically well in ikkinz one group trials*<br />
You can also use CoH to pull raid targets if they are not tethered if you think about incite/bellow use &lt;I wont spoil this strat&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it is not entirely false nor entirely true.  <br />
<br />
As a Rogue I often pull creatively using stealth after tagging a target in fairly deep and it's far better than simple invis.  In most places though this will simply create  mammoth trains, some of which I've been famous for as well.  It depends on the mobs' assist range, aggro-sharing characteristics, spell-casting or lack of it and the pathing of the pull for the most part.  Invis can be very helpful in some places though for pulling singles out of what would not seem to be a possible place.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend adding good old pumice stones for pulling in a lot of places in GoD also, they are still excellent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The poster implied that mobs will not add if you are invis. That is simply wrong. If a mob has a small assist range other mobs will not assist even if you are visable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3. Do you know how to use glob's of gooey goo for root pulling? <br />
<br />
With the cast time on these your group will be asleep by the time the mob is pulled...not to mention the insane resist rate (you cant just chain cast these like a root class can).</div></div><hr />
