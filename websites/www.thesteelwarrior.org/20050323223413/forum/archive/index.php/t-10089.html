Before I was able to use sweeping, cleave and get five hits off one attack (would show damage above the mob's head), now it's only showing up as two hits (although it looks like each mob's health bar drops twice after my swing).<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this or did I miss it on the patch message?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mortal Strike (w/ its heal debuff) does still work with SS.  So war's can still AE heal debuff.</div></div><hr />

Its still there.  I tested it out right after the patch.  You dont SEE the damage, but its there.  Try it out, you still attack 5 times but you only see 2 numbers instead of the 5.  The mob's health bar drops twice.</div></div><hr />

Yar, that's what it looked like to me, I don't use it as much anymore so it's kinda irrelevant now, but thanks for the feedback guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ss is removed if you switch out of battle stance.  It works with Ravager though.</div></div><hr />
