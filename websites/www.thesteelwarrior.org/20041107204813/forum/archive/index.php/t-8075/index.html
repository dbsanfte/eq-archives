<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widjit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm new to the melee thing.  And I found out about /shield from a friend.  I had no clue of it's existence... lol I've been using Castersrealm for most of my info and it didn't list that anywhere.  Are there any other little abilities like this for wars?  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/shield is available at lvl 30 as a normal skill.<br />
to use it : target a friend in need of protection and tape /shield  (works great when hotkeyed, think of /assist to swicht rapidly from the mob to your friend and vise versa)<br />
what it does : it cut in half the domage receive by your friend and you get 1.5 time the rest (ie the overall domage is greater : 50% + 75% = 125%).<br />
limitation : it can be used only if both you and your target are not currenctly using a discipline. Morover it has an short duration and a very short radius : you must teach your friend to stay in your melee range if they want you to use your ability !<br />
bonus : it has an aggro built him that help often, but not always, to recover the top postion from the hate list (assuming you were on top before the little caster stealt aggro).<br />
<br />
Note : there is AAs that increase both its duration and radius, and that decrease the reuse time.<br />
<br />
Have fun,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Found this post so was wondering about 1 thing:<br />
<br />
/shield is said to decrease the amount of damage you are taking if you wield a shield, considering the CA of the sield, anybody got info on: How many CA your shield need to get 1% reduce dmg?<br />
<br />
I'm currently having fun with a shield with FB 2 (lvl 40, it's not a problem to keep aggro with it) and was really curious..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The greater the AC of the shield the less damage you take.<br />
<br />
Sadly, i dont remember the formula for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Suggest setting up a hotkey to activate it.  I never used it for real until I noticed a post somewhere on here that described the following hotkey:<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 2<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
Felt like an idiot for not thinking of it before, actually.  It does make using /shield actually feasible I find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, maybe a good macro, but not if you have two mobs :)<br />
<br />
Usually i just push F# and my shield key, wich is maybe a little slower, but work in every condition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just always typed /shield &lt;name&gt;, usually just the first 3 or so letters of the person's name. I could type it in a fraction of a second from doing it so often, could actually do that faster than using F# and hitting a shield hotkey, and wouldn't lose my target doing it. Using a /assist /pause 2 /shield type hotkey works okay sometimes, but you lose your target doing it and half the time (on raids) end up shielding another warrior. I also got used to just seeing someone's name show up getting summoned and shield them no matter what, unless i recognized the name as another tank.<br />
<br />
I was always one of the few ever using the skill though... not many people use it, because it takes some skill and ya hafta pay attention and it's a relatively small reward, but it has definately saved many lives and made me lots of friends by trying to play my class to the best of my ability.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The default &quot;penalty&quot; for shielding is 25% extra damage.  Equipping a shield is supposed to reduce that penalty by 1% per 2 AC.  But last I'd heard, the formula was broken and shields weren't really reducing the penalty at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
More stupid shield tricks:<br />
<br />
Shield someone and the mob takes damage shield damage from both of you!<br />
<br />
Shield someone who's fighting a mob that is friendly to you.  You won't take a faction hit and you won't join the hate list!</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe because with the nice shield of 50AC and more it would have been to powerfull (top end wars can have shield with 100AC and more so it would end up like a small deff for a short time : DW tank is shielded by a heavy turtle tank ~&gt; 50% + (75-100/2)%-= 50% + 25% !!! )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anyone ever been shielded by other mobs?  I was in Kael when I was allied with giants and some group was killing in the arena and I decided to help (No dain head for me), and when I got low on hp, an add giant actually shielded ME!  I had the screenshot but I think it's gone now.. anyone else seen this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe that giant got charmed, since pets do shield you sometimes, I would bet that is what happened, have you tried beating on the giant shielding you ?</div></div><hr />

/shield is sort of a stealth ability. Most of your other innate abilities are automatic (dodge, riposte, etc). You can disarm, but it has essentially no use value against mobs.<br />
The rest of the stuff you'll have to pay attention to have to do with your /discs and your AAs, but there's good info on the warrior specfic elements of those on this site, and you are familiar with the general concepts. <br />
Can't think of any &quot;ninja&quot; abilities like /shield that can slip in under the radar, to answer your second question.<br />
To my knowledge, no one has tested the &quot;+aggro&quot; element of /shield, but it has been widely observed that /shield does appear to pop you to the top of the hate list sometimes (caster gets aggro, you run over and shield caster, mob jumps on you). You can also use it as a kind of gesture at other tanks who gank your aggro when you are supposed to be main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tactical Mastery allows you to beat on a mob and the the mob that /shields it.<br />
<br />
I love that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tactical Mastery allows you to beat on a mob and the the mob that /shields it.<br />
<br />
I love that.<br />
<br />
I don't understand.<br />
do you mean that insteed of doing 50% + 75% domage, with TM you do 100% + 100%  ?<br />
if so it's more than a f**** incredible killing machine !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've noticed this in LDoN's more than anywhere else...<br />
<br />
I'm beating on a mob, another starts shielding it, then i get 2 lines of text (per hit) saying i'm doing the same amount of damage to each mob.<br />
<br />
Creating an example out of thin air:<br />
<br />
Azaza slashes a burrowing scarab for 56 pts damage.<br />
A Jeweled Guard Hero shields a burrowing scarab.<br />
Azaza crushes a Jeweled Guard Hero for 40 pts damage.<br />
Azaza crushes a burrowing scarab for 40 pts damage.<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
...until the shield effect wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">... Yeah, that's the base effect of shield, it's the same thing that happens when you shield a caster and the mob hits the caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I want a disc that would allow me to force one mob to shield another mob.</div></div><hr />
