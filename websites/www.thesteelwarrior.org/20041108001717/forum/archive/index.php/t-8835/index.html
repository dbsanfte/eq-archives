<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How would warriors feel about Pal/SK getting Incite? Not the upgraded warrior tomes / rune versions, just up to regular incite.<br />
<br />
Was talking with an SK in my guild tonight about how so much rides on response times anymore, trash mobs can literally kill casters in &lt;2sec, and it takes him 1.8sec to cast.<br />
<br />
Personally I would like to see them get it, not like they need help with agro over time but the insta-cast nature of Incite is very nice for adds spawning during events right when a heal is landing etc.. and to me the incite line is an extension of taunt, they get taunt, they should get incite. Their taunt should cap at 230 imo too but thats a whole other subject.<br />
<br />
Plus I'm sick of seeing incite on lists of why knights should tank better.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, it doesnt hurt my class yet it helps their classes, so it's win / win imo.<br />
<br />
edit: and they would actually have something to use all that endurance on then too!</div></div><hr />

As shadow knight, my biggest problem at times was too much agro.  I think knights are fine when it comes to snap agro.  There is no use for them to receive incite.  Incite was part of our tossed huge melee upgrade.  Why in any sense would they pass it on?<br />
<br />
Here is no news flash by anymeans.  Incite is not that great(meaning its no game breaker) and its best used on incoming.  They would be better of casting that 1.8 spell then relying on incite. As soon as you incite on a repop , you will lose agro to the next thing most people do (heal, ect).  Within the first 10 seconds that 1.8 cast time will help a lot more than one incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zekez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How bout ... No !!!<br />
<br />
Shadowknights and Paladins have enough tools to get aggro, they are the masters of snap aggro as it is letting them get incite would be ridiculous. It's the equivalent of giving us snare and stuns imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, incite was put in the game to close the aggro gap between warriors and knights,  giving it to them would take that away again. if they really want it they can give us FD snare stuns heals etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Incite line is not snap aggro. It is a supplement for warriors only, period.<br />

If pallies and sk's cant do the job with what they already have, which is alot of stuff, then you're hanging around the wrong people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No<br />

We need their stuns, not the other way around (them needing our incites.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think SKs need their Terror lines to do a better job than they currently do (maybe change it to be similar to Incite line, with the Hate over time).  I still haven't heard about it being fixed, a snare has more of a snap than their aggro spells, which is odd...maybe the 1200 Hate one in OoW will make more of a difference.<br />
<br />
Paladins, no...<br />
<br />
Maybe an SK viewing here can say whether it's been fixed or not, I stopped playing my SK a while ago (heck, stopped playing EQ a little while ago).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thats pretty much exactly what I thought the response would be, cant really blame warriors for being bitter still though.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's a retarded request to even consider. Not a matter of being bitter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm not sure I would know what to do with it if I had it.  The ONLY time I have issues getting aggro, is on raid boss mobs.  Warriors are way ahead of knights when it comes to building numerical aggro over time, once they've got it.  But when that Warrior dies, and 2 more warriors die before the healers wake up, I'm expected to get aggro.  It aint going to happen, our taunt is just as broke as yours, and we dont have AE Taunt (and we shouldn't).  Incite would do sqaut here, and I can't see using any new aggro skills during trash.<br />
The issue I see with SK's is that during trash clearing, the only way for them to get as much snap aggro as paladins, is if they use snare, and this usually isn't acceptable...the mob's about to be mezzed.  They can still get snap aggro better then warriors, no doubt, but they're going to lose it easier then a paladin, because our stun aggro stacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Incite has some notable advantages over stuns,  being able to tag mobs while moving, no fizzles etc, make warriors arguebly superior for getting attention of mobs on incoming, (in certain situations, but worse in others) but its not needed as knight, i'm fine with the differences, advantages and disadvtanages of them.<br />
<br />
What I'd really like is either have higher level stuns add more Hate, have an aggro modifier associated with furious bash for Knights (or just general spellcasting to make it work on sk fear line etc) or some Knight usable EoA items.<br />
<br />
Most people will probably flame me or tell me I suck at playing my class or something :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why exactly Besrikarle?<br />
<br />
Because knights get to much agro already? /boggle<br />
<br />
Because Incite was used to close the knight warrior gap? /boggle<br />
<br />
Because Incite isnt very good and hybrids have spells it would be stupid to even use incite? /boggle<br />
<br />
Because its ours damnit and they cant have it! &lt;-- best one<br />
<br />
All those answers sound pretty bitter to me, not one good reason why Pal and SK shouldnt get it. Half of the people didnt even read the post which is obvious by the answers, they read the first line and hit reply telling me something that was in my own post like it was news heh, thats pure bitterness. <br />
<br />
I was serious though, cant blame warriors for being bitter still, I'm bitter still too!, just not to the same extent I guess. When it comes to any tanking changes I'm totally against any ideas pretty much, but for agro? /shrug I couldnt care less if they want it<br />
<br />
Incite is a very small instant boost in hate, if its retarded to think pal and sk should get an insta-cast agro spell like Incite, then yez I'm retarded irl =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not really sure hybrids getting incite would be a wise idea.  If hybrids &quot;snap agro&quot; is deficient it should be addressed via their existing/planned spell lines...keeping the existing class framework intact</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No, Knights shouldn't get the Incite line.<br />
<br />
There's a fundamental debate that's been going on in EQ for almost a year that covers most class changes between Knights and Warriors. Put very simply, there are two competing views:<br />
<br />
1. Knights are Tanks. Versus all content except raid boss mobs (and Knight should be sufficient to tank these in a pinch as well) Knights and Warriors should be interchangable. IMO, this focuses the comparason of Knights and Warriors on a single aspect of the Knight classes, Tanking. Spellcasting that does not directly affect combat while it is happening would be free. The ability to cast on others is free. SK FD pulling, and much of the Paladin spellbook are bonuses. <br />
<br />
The most generous Knights propose Warriors get utility to offset the value of spellbooks beyond that which allows Knights to tank like Warriors. IMO this would trade the reason I chose to play a Warrior, unmatched survivability when tanking the most dangerous creatures in Norrath and being the Primary Tank, for a psuedo-spellbook vastly inferior to for example the Paladin spellbook. I eschewed the spellbook and being a melee/caster hybrid to be a 100% Tank and best at Tanking.<br />
<br />
Less generous Knights want an avoidance/mitigation/auto reposte discipline and to tank every mob outside of raid boss mobs just like a Warrior. If Warriors want Tanking superiority, let the Warriors that raid have it on raid day and when tanking a raid boss mob only. If they wanted a 90% res, heals, GRC, Root, etc they should have rolled a Knight.<br />
<br />
*** There is an alternate view ***<br />
<br />
2. Warriors and Knights are different classes that should be fun to play and have viable roles in every environment with distinct abilities that justify their existance as seperate and valued classes. Traditional roles should be preserved and it is acknowledged that classes are valued for the sum total of their capabilities.<br />
<br />
No Incite for Knights. Incite is lovely for tanking more challanging mobs. It's not so good when there are adds leaking into camp 2 at a time and you must quickly change targets.<br />
<br />
IMO Knights should have a rapid-fire aggro system that allows them to promptly switch mobs and to pull them off a beleagered Enchanter. Don't say AETaunt please - it's absolutely useless when there are 3+ adds in camp. The refresh of Incite and especially AETaunt insures Knights have superiority in rapid-fire aggro.<br />
<br />
IMO, Paladin aggro generation meshes well with a raid CC/Combat Medic/Add Tank role and is generally fine. Should a Paladin wish to build aggro more effectively and not be as dependant on stuns and a consequent loss of DPS, then they can start looking at weapons with an aggro proc and YKesha augs. The rarity of Knights in general trying to acquire aggro weapons suggests that they are not nearly as dependant on them as Warriors. The only improvements (and they aren't afaik needed) that should be concidered for Paladins is the ability to use the LDoN Anger augs and a 0.0 easily resisted stun component for the Divine Might weapon buff line.<br />
<br />
SK aggro generation could use some work. IMO and consistant with the SK Class Description they should be able to cripple mobs with debuffs (there's an aggro tool) and terrorize it (there's another). Ideally, they should be able to direct the aggro they generate to another PC with a short duration buff (they should be the masters of aggro manipulation and aren't) freeing up their ability to do reasonably high DPS in a variety of ways.<br />
<br />
Cloning class abilites like Incite blurs class differences. It is anathma to creating classes with &quot;distinct abilities that justify their existance as seperate and valued classes.&quot;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Any SK or pally I group with can still out aggro me, if they want to.  The resists from the low lvl stuns/snares are killer aggro, which they can spam repeatedly... while my incite is only once ever 30 seconds.  <br />
<br />
The only way I can hold aggro over a Knight, is if they choose to NOT take it.  They certainly do not need incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ryanosky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Knights whine about every fucking thing warriors have that they dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think it'd be pointless. Really, knights generate a fine amount of aggro, and they surely could generate more if they wanted. They could, for example, use the same tools warriors use: Hate/stun proccing weapons, WA5, ykesha augments for melee in addition to their spells. It's really a non-issue. It wouldn't really bother me if they got it, but it seems like a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Torrast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Any knight that feels they need Incite obviously doesn't know how to play their class.  What a stupid idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So was I honestly, but thats pretty much my sentiments exactly. If they want it I just dont care either way, since it doesnt hurt me in the least.<br />
<br />
Any knight that feels they need Incite obviously doesn't know how to play their class. What a stupid idea.<br />
<br />
Ahhh, the obligatory 'they must just suck because I dont agree' nice to see thats not a warrior only skill. Yea he sucks, youre obviously a much better player, I can just tell from a message board cause I'm cool like that. I'm sure you have np getting a small amount of insta agro when mobs pop during events because your spells just cast faster than anyone elses giving you the edge on response time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually I wouldn't mind if Knights, especially pallies, got an ability that was the &quot;Aggro-over time&quot; portion of the  Incite line.  I can forsee multiple mobs coming in on our casters during a raid, and a pally trying desperately to get aggro on 2 or 3 mobs and having trouble keeping their attention because he can only get quick single target stuns off.  I could envision how this would be a useful tool to them.  He stuns one &quot;Incites&quot; it .. or whatever the new ability would be called to generate aggro over time to help overcome the aggro generated by the  heals the cleric is throwing around and then stun lock's another mob.  SK's have Dot's they can throw around to sorta do the same thing.<br />
<br />
In general though, this is the only example I can think of where it would be a major benefit to them and as such it's prol not worth the trouble of making the program change as it would not add a great deal to the knight classes, and lord knows we dont' want to see SoE to start mucking around with aggro again.</div></div><hr />

A paladin doesn't have to play like a warrior to get aggro on 2 or more mobs. It just takes one group heal to lock them down hard. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I can't really see the balance of knights getting more agro for the simple fact that they can already get so much.  Stun/Fear on INC seems to work best for the knights in myguild and they can pretty much lock down agro for xp situtations.  For raid mobs/events that require many tanks, I think they have sufficient agro to do their jobs.  OK, maybe I am pigheaded, but if a knight needs more tools to generate agro, then I think they need to work out their skills.  I haven't heard any of the knights in my guild say &quot;Damn, I wish I could out agro that BoW.&quot;  I'll ask them tonight though.<br />
<br />
I just don't see the need for an agro dot for knights.  Though it would be nice if the SK agro spells were fixed.  I think they might apprecate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.) It doesnt really help most of them at all.<br />
2.) Most would never use it anyway<br />
3.) It would have no negative impact on warriors.<br />
4.) It removes Knight leverage in any debate on warriors having incite in regards to aggro.<br />
<br />
Not that it matters, they will get incite when we get DT and stuns anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't believe Paladins need it, their stuns (at least the correct level ones) serve an additional purpose other than hate.  SKs, however, have direct Hate spells that aren't as effective as they should be.  I wouldn't mind if SKs recieved or had the Terror line adjusted to be like the Incite line setup (initial hate plus over time), as controlling Hate really is part of their job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rhumba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Shadow Knight here. I've never heard of a SK even thinking that getting incite would be helpful. Just chalk it up to a clueless SK. More Aggro is the last thing that SK's need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Crathsor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">In my experience, Incite isn't really a reliable snap-aggro tool, anyway.  The initial amount of aggro isn't much unless you're stacking it on a successful Taunt, and the refresh keeps it from being available in a multiple add situation.  Even if Knights DO need something to help with this, Incite probably isn't the answer for them.<br />

This is a lot of lashing out to defend a really stupid idea.  Knights are quite capable of getting agro quickly as it is, any knight that can't probably needs to reroll a different class or go to their respective class boards and ask for advice.  Aggro isn't rocket science, especially for us knights.  If SK's need a boost in this area, perhaps their Terror line needs adjusting (although, I've never grouped with a SK that had quick aggro problems, unless they were just a slow player).  I know that I, as a Paladin, have no want of this skill, and any Paladin (or Knight in general, IMO) that can't seem to catch fast aggro with a 1 second cast time spell needs to stop searching for Lego porn while playing EQ.</div></div><hr />

It could be 5 million hate, and if it doesn't do the job of peeling a mob just out of melee range off my cleric(Don't forget, I can't chase a mob around and cast at the same time), it's still not useful to me.

There's a lot of things in the game sounds like a good idea but anything you do that makes players strongly ultimately forces the game to become harder too... or trivial.<br />

Speaking of Knight upgrades, Knights always wanted like a half of a defensive, so what about make a disc that has 50% chance of being like defensive, and the other half of the time it'd do the opposite (of course you can't click this off).

Also, that spell effect looks like there's some coding going on behind the scenes with it that Lucy can't pick up.  For example: Manaburn (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2751&amp;source=Live).  That spell definitely doesn't only do 1 damage.  Another example: Dread Gaze (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5336&amp;source=Test), which used to be the Voice upgrade.  AE hate spell perhaps?</div></div><hr />

So when mobs spawn, casters already have high agro with em and it doesn't just take a hit to take aggro, is this the case?  Good thing you've got warriors there to Incite if need be.  I don't see why other classes need Incite.  It's just a stupid, stupid idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">How would warriors feel about Pal/SK getting Incite? Not the upgraded warrior tomes / rune versions, just up to regular incite. -- Sure if it was to cost them 300/400 mana<br />
<br />
Was talking with an SK in my guild tonight about how so much rides on response times anymore, trash mobs can literally kill casters in &lt;2sec, and it takes him 1.8sec to cast -- So tell him to start casting a bit sooner<br />
<br />
Personally I would like to see them get it, not like they need help with agro over time but the insta-cast nature of Incite is very nice for adds spawning during events right when a heal is landing etc.. and to me the incite line is an extension of taunt -- So is there snares/stuns, although theres works better than the taunt button<br />
<br />
Plus I'm sick of seeing incite on lists of why knights should tank better -- huh?<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, it doesnt hurt my class yet it helps their classes, so it's win / win imo -- Oh, but it does help them and hurt us all at the same time<br />
<br />
edit: and they would actually have something to use all that endurance on then too! -- Dumbest thing you wrote. They have Endurance they can't use and I have Mana I can't, sounds like we both get shafted a little to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Watching this discussion between mostly warriors about paladins aggroing mobs has got me thinking.  Most of the one-liners say something to the effect of 'If a paladin wants another aggro tool then they must suck'.  I am a paladin, I am a damn good paladin.  Aggroing one mob on single pulls during an xp group is pretty damn simple, and any no brainer could manage.  Aggroing 2 mobs on a bad pull isn't so hard.  Aggroing 2 RAID mobs on a pull isn't hard.  Maintaining this aggro can be very hard.<br />
Like people have pointed out, Stuns/heals etc, have casting times.  When 2 level 69 Kyvs are beating on me for 1200+ at a rediculous rate, I can sometimes channel through a 1.0 casting time stun.  Channelling a group heal with 3 sec casting time is near impossible.  Getting initial aggro on the pull isn't so hard, stun one and the other will follow, but the first heal that hits you is going to pull that one off.<br />
Would it be nice to have an instant cast aggro tool, similar to incite, with a refresh time of, say, 30 secs?  yes.  Do I think Paladins should have this? no<br />
Do I think many warriors are fooling themselves by thinking that paladins have it so damn easy to aggro 80 mobs at once if they wanted to with these low level stuns or uber group heals? yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">It's kind of tough to have a good faith discussion about EQ classes.<br />
<br />
In my first post in this thread I stated:<br />
Warriors and Knights are different classes that should be fun to play and have viable roles in every environment with distinct abilities that justify their existance as seperate and valued classes. Traditional roles should be preserved....<br />
I didn't pull this out of thin air. I was paraphrasing and liberally interpreting a comment made probably by Brenlo.<br />
<br />
Paladin stuns/SK debuffs and terrorizing (if SoE ever matched in-game SK capability with the SK Class Description) having faster reuse time, FB shields to lower the rate of spell casting needed to maintain aggro, and all assisting with damage reduction/avoidance. This would all work hand in glove to give both Knight classes marginally superior capability in CC/Add tanking/off tanking in raids while helping mundane crap like handling the trials and Kod'Taz mini's. Unique, distinct, viable roles, preserving traditional roles, etc.........<br />
<br />
Yes, there would remain an issue that 1 second+ is a fair amount of delay in firing off a first aggro event. I imagine that SoE believed this was a major issue, a solution could be found.<br />
<br />
BUT, recently I read a post where it was flatly stated that Class Definition as such might not be done. Insted there would be some evaluation and adjustments. Based on what? To what intended end?<br />
<br />
Maybe SoE doesn't want to be &quot;held to&quot; any particular design philosophy because the player community (and especially yours truly) treats it like the Holy Grail.<br />
<br />
But for goodness sake, there ought to be a reason for a subscriber to play a Paladin, SK, and Warrior rather than the other two classes and all three should be highly valued for their unique and distinct capabilities in raids and groups. SoE ought to be able to articulate a direction that works for all three classes and a basis for their descisions beyond - 'for the good of the game we are making the following adjustments'.<br />

Incite won't do that either.  In fact I find that the only person I can get aggro from with incite is somebody that pulled with prox aggro.  If they did anything to the mob in inc it will take more than just incite to get it off of them.  I'm not too likely to proc on a mob if I have to chase it around either.  After all these years a lot of casters still haven't learned that if they want something taunted off of them they need to stand still.

That sums up incite. We still cannot aggro something without engaging it. Hybrids have a shitload of spells that they can cast to aggro mobs without doing a single point of damage and lock substantially from a range. Warriors have nothing of that capacity.<br />
<br />
And jesus christ, Incite is instant cast and you can use it on the run. (Keep in mind the above limitations.) I think paladins can live with their 1.5sec cast time Cease or a SKs 1.75sec cast time Clinging Darkness if they are really striving for some fast casting aggro.

That's sort of my position. In my view Knights certainly should not have inadequate aggro. If casting spells costs too much mana, are too easily interrupted, or the casting time is too great, then fix it.<br />
<br />
In my view Knight aggro should behave differently than Warrior aggro.<br />
<br />
Warriors should be able get aggro on incoming if everyone leaves the mob alone with an arrow and Incite. Hate over Time plus aggro procs ought to allow Warriors to hold aggro pretty well after say 6, 8, or 10 seconds if things go well.<br />
<br />
Knights ought to have much better snap aggro, a much higher repeat rate, greater flexability, and the ability to hold aggro quite adequately. If this is not true, SoE should fix it, but not by making classes virtually indistinguishable. FB shields, Knight aggro weapons, adding a 0.0 resisted stun component to the Divine Might weapon buff line, etc. all potentially help Paladins (for exmple) with aggro if help is needed.<br />
<br />
(I freely admit I once held a different view. But experiance using the Incite line [and Frodlin's arguments once I started listening] convinced me I was mistaken.)<br />

I suggested they should receive an insta-cast agro spell to see if it would be accepted since response time does make a huge difference on raids no matter how far you play it down on a messageboard. Discs have nothing to do with this discussion at all I'm not even going to respond to that.<br />

Yeah, that's about my experience with my little warrior and her .. I guess it's provoke.

I dont have a stun, I'm a warrior, if that was meant for me.<br />

Incite + proximity agro (standing in front of everyone else, casters rather) is enough to get the mob to come straight to me and not someone else, unless they do something major to it like snare it or something. Granted I usually tag with a shuriken before I incite to get the full hate value. Actually I'm pretty sure I've had a ton-po's pouch ever since incite was added, and I have always thrown stars like crazy the entire time something is incoming or spawns out of melee range before I incite so maybe I do have a somewhat skewed vision of incite /shrug<br />

That's not true actually.  I play an SK and Necro and spent a night trying different spells on incoming to see what I could out agro our warrior with.

Who was closest to the mob? Thats what matters 90% of the time with incite in my experience. High agro spells are obviously excluded.<br />
<br />
Doesnt matter if someone did a 50 dmg bow-shot the mob will still go to them unless the warrior is closer. If the warrior is closer anyone can do pretty much anything other than snare or stun etc.. <br />
<br />
Thats assuming a tag of some sort before incite to get the full hate value. it's definitely how Incite works for me regardless  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">A monk was pulling and tagged each mob.  I tried to stand next to the warrior each time.  Depending on the angle I was usually on his right shoulder and pretty close to even.  Most spells landed at a respectable distance since I can watch a mob change direction and my name come up on ToT....incite lands and it instantly changes.  Range or not, you are doing substantially more than prox agro to be able to peel it off an Sk or Necro that peeled agro off a puller.<br />
<br />
If I cast a Terror of Thule spell (600 hate) at distance the mob will not change direction and will not show my name on ToT until the monk runs it next to me.  Incite has a listed initial hate of 400.  When a warrior casts incite it peels the mob instantly and changes direction from a distance.<br />
<br />
Your Incite line reads like a terror spell but works substantially better....range or no range you can make a mob change direction, I can not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Oh I'm aware its doing more than just prox agro  :) <br />
<br />
I'm just saying prox agro makes all the difference in most cases, say proximity agro bonus is 500 (nfc what it really is, but its definitely not insignificant by any means) + 480 from Ancient Chaos Cry to give 980 total hate on inc if youre in front, its not a fair assessment to conclude your spells are inferior to incite or that incite is superior if youre not factoring in the proximity agro.<br />
<br />
I would almost guarantee if you stepped 1 foot in front of that warrior your name would pop up on HoTT, step 1 foot behind him it will go back to his name. Just 1 foot is all that matters,  I'm assuming prox agro is atleast 500 since ancient chaos cry alone wont pull a mob from anyone thats closer thats on the hate list for any reason at all (including the tag before the Incite ofcourse)<br />
<br />
If the monk didnt run behind the both of you the mob would have bee-lined right to him most likely, no matter what he pulled with. If prox bonus was &lt;480 then the mob should go for the warrior regardless of whose closer, like stuns, snares etc..</div></div><hr />

I dont think knights have an agro problem in the least, I suggested incite as an initial agro tool only, for that 2sec while youre spell is casting youre at a disadvantage that I think should be corrected, otherwise knight agro is fine imo. (SK's only on the 2sec issue, but I wasnt going to leave out paladins so the flames didnt turn in to a pal vs sk argument)<br />
<br />
At the very least they should lower SK's main hate spells to a 1.0sec cast time to even them out with paladins.<br />
<br />
Without getting in to strategies to much take Xxeric for example, you will rarely have free warriors to take care of the adds, pallys are root parking and that 2sec that a SK's spell is casting + the time to target when his mob pops is literally a life or death situation for a cleric / caster and even some melee classes, I dont think thats right when the oher 2 tank classes have very little issues if at all (zero issues for a warrior if they stand in front of the casters and use ancient chaos cry, tested and proven multiple times) in the same situation.<br />
<br />
But SK's apparently dont need nor want any help, so /shrug   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Barraind posted:<br />
scaling<br />
In another thread, Brael provides some evidence that Stun does in fact scale. Praraphasing his argument, the amount of hate generated appears to go up as a result of resisted spell aggro. He recommends in essense that Warriors use a Force of YKesha aug rather than an Anger III aug (if I understand correctly) - that's how good resisted stun aggro is.<br />
<br />
Frodlin once wrote that he would be concerned if the mana Knights needed to expend to maintain aggro introduced an imbalanced burden when the Incite line went live. Given the low cost of resisted stuns, 20FT/KEI/etc., this doesn't appear to be an undue burden on Paladins at least.<br />
<br />
I've suggested that a 1Hdr with a Force of YKesha aug and a FB shield (now that shields are an attractive tanking setup at least for Knights) should reduce the need of Paladins to spam cast stun to maintain aggro. Further, Brael suggest that vs. higher level mobs a resisted stun (or the stun component of a proc) produces more aggro than the Warrior Anger proc.<br />
<br />
While I understand the constant drumbeat of Paladins contending that their x, y, or z capability doesn't scale (btw, an unresisted stun prevents more damage the harder a mobs hits - stuns scale in that way too) to try to build a case to receive Defensive, scaling isn't a Paladin aggro issue and stun aggro (and stun mitigation) DOES appear to scale.<br />
<br />
Several Warriors have expressed a concern that Knight aggro event gneration is a bit too slow to be effective. Warriors will generally recognize genuine issues, but not go into Pavlovian drool reflex every time the &quot;doesn't scale&quot; card is played. It's old guy and inaccurate in this case.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">As for suggesting that Knights get an ykesha proc to maintain aggro, no thanks.  For the most part, when I'm fully awake, I'm pretty good at getting aggro when I want it, and not having aggro when I dont.  Having high aggro weapon procs is something I always avoid.  Not only is it up to the RNG, but the last thing I need is unexpected aggro.<br />
There's a few cases in which it can be harder for paladins to get aggro then warriors.  We both have the same useless taunt ability on raid mobs, so I wont even go there.  The Chanelling skill is very unreliable.   Sometimes I can stand there getting hit on by 4 mobs, get knocked 4 feet backwards from melee, and manage to channel through a group heal, yet many times, I'll have one mob on me and have 4-5 stuns interrupted in a row.  Of course I lose aggro at this point, but can get it back fairly quickly, seeing as I'm now free to cast spells :)  Do I see a problem with the current situation?  No.  It makes total sense that my spells should be interrupted when mobs are beating my ass.<br />
Aggroing a mob from range is still much easier for knights then warriors.  At the high end, keeping aggro on a raid mob, even trash, is pretty equal imo.  Warriors can generate a whole lot of aggro in a short time, with the right aa's and weapons.  Not to mention that once they've got aggro, there isn't much for them to do to keep it, it's just automatic (this is talking about warriors with high end aggro weapons).<br />
You said you brought this issue up as knights, so that you wouldn't start a Pal Vs SK discussion, but really, if there is an issue with SK aggro (and I think there is) then it needs to be discussed in this manner.  Paladins are more concerned about damage mitigation then aggro control, heh.  And all this talk about mitigating damage by chain stunning a mob...I assume you xp in tier2 PoP, cause I sure as hell dont, 80% of the mobs I xp on are immune to stun.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I like the experiance rate in Kod'Taz. Probably like you, 80% of the mobs I experiance on are not really a challange. You don't need stun mitigation and I don't need Defensive (both would just slow down the experiance flow).<br />

Up above you'll see a Paladin, Barraind, post that the &quot;fact&quot; (an incorrect assertion) that stun aggro doesn't scale is a &quot;problem&quot; that should be fixed. Such claims could result in an unwanted stun proc on your Epic 2.0, a stun component on the next Divine Might weapon buff and other undesireable &quot;improvements&quot;.<br />
<br />
Poor Paen started this thread suggesting Knights couldn't produce aggro events fast enough. Casting times aren't very debatable and they are surely greater than the time needed for a Wariror to Incite. Yet, not one Knight has agreed. Very very confusing  :D.<br />
<br />
BTW, my twink 53 Paladin would like Cease to have it's casting time changed to 1 second. Yes, it's still long compared to Incite, but it'd help. (He also wants all flag requirements dropped and recommended and required level removed from items).<br />

<br />
Half of that is to me and half is to Battleblade I'm assuming.<br />
<br />
As for not wanting to exclude paladins from any changes..<br />
<br />
I lumped you all together simply because everyone has such a competitive role mindset. I see the Paladins and Shadowknights I play with as my teammates and my friends, I dont see them as competition for my role anymore, my role and strengths are clearly defined as are yours, if either of you want something of mine or even something completely new that wouldnt unbalance our classes again I'm all for it. <br />
<br />
I group with the best paladin I have ever met in my history of playing EQ almost every single raid and for xp groups and have for quite some time (when I actually xp, will be a lot again starting tomorrow tho!) I'm aware paladins dont need help with agro, even initial agro generally.<br />
<br />
SK's do though imo, if the general population of SK's dont agree it's obviously a lost cause but I see his position on initial agro versus the other two tank classes and I can sympathize with it. It wasnt so long ago I was in the same boat, granted it was a much larger boat and had a big fucking hole in the bottom that was sinking, but still.</div></div><hr />

How many SK's in their right mind would admit to wanting their hate spells at a 1.0sec cast time when everyone will just tell them they suck and they dont play their class right heh.<br />
<br />
The bandwagon isnt going that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Cease didn't even exist when I was level 53, heh.  The level 62 stun, and the level 65 stun, both have casting times of 1.0 sec.<br />
I dont think I even understand what scaling aggro means in this case.  Like when I stun a level 30 mob it generates more aggro then when I stun a level 69 mob?  Why would that matter?<br />
Paladins do not need more aggro spells.  The first boss in Tacvi is a good of an example I can think of when incite would be better then paladin stuns, just in the fact that any casting time is too much...but I don't see any paladins complaining about wanting incite on PoN.  I would laugh at them if they did...warriors are very well off atm, compared to 2 years ago.  Anyone who watched the series 'Who needs warriors anyway?' of my guild's front page a year or so ago would see that ;)<br />
I am all for giving SK's a better way of aggroing without doing dmg.  Paladins have a huge advantage in this category right now.  If incite is the answer, then go for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno if incite is the answer since I'm not an SK, thats just what the SK and I were contemplating when he made me aware of the issue.<br />
<br />
I'm like you and would agree with any changes they think would benefit them agro wise and put them on par with Pal / War though. Their whole class revolves around hate yet theyre the worst at it in most ways, something wrong there.<br />
<br />
If people can stop telling everyone they suck or theyre stupid just because they dont agree with them for a day, maybe we can get some legitimate feedback of what they want and try to help them get it.<br />
<br />
That's a long shot though   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Zekez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">That's not true actually. I play an SK and Necro and spent a night trying different spells on incoming to see what I could out agro our warrior with. Incite instantly peels off 90% of my spells other than the ones we know are high agro...fear and darkness line. I can cast any of my DD spells and most dots on incoming (mobs hate dis/pois dots) and Incite instantly switches agro and peels off. I was quite surprised to see how many spells were below it. <br />
<br />
Incite will help a very small amount initially with its best benefits overtime. If the warrior got the mob off you while you were trying to generate aggro to test. He probably got off a good taunt wich will put him +1 on aggro list anyways so i doubt it was just the incite that pealed the mob off you.</div></div><hr />

Brael suggests in this (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8854) thread (if I read it correctly) that when you fail to stun a level 69 mob you generate more aggro than when you stun that level 30 mob. It's worth reading his coments.<br />

Well, don't be drinking coffee then you read PoN. There have been numerous posts where Paladins have alleged that Warrior aggro is vastly superior to Paladin aggro.<br />
Anyone who watched the series 'Who needs warriors anyway?' of my guild's front page....<br />
Read it. I think it was one of the most influential player series about EQ ever written. I hope you got your shot at the PoTime gods too. Only fair once they are trivial.<br />

There's a foolproof way of improving any class - log in and do challanging content regularly. Hopefully with OoW just released, people will focus on their own class and improving their characters by making some effort in game rather than in forum.<br />

<br />
I would actually love for you to have FD.  It's only 1.0 second cast, how hard could it be to FD.  If warriors complained about how hard it was to FD it might actually get changed and that would be nice.<br />
<br />
You can stun....they just added a stun disc for you (just not controlled like Pallys).  You can buff with clickies and they just gave you a rune proc....that is a buff effect.  Your list is getting shorter...life is good.<br />
<br />
I haven't been able to play around with warrior incite agro yet and test all the proximity variations yet, we have been hunting in areas where I can't get the spells off until the mobs are in camp.  I need some nice outdoor zone time with a clear LoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">1) Speaking as an SK, I don't particularily need or want your precious Incite. <br />
<br />
2) If the Incite line is worth stuns, buffs, group heals, rez, mana tap, FD, and summon corpses, I can only imagine what Furious would cost us. Our house, car, stereo and first born child, I wager.<br />
<br />
3) Other than perhaps 3 or 4 warriors on this thread, their reading comprehension hovers between 0 and -10. However, their bitterness and vindictiveness ranks almost off the scale. Should SK's get a horse with flaming hooves? No! They already have FD and lifetaps and rezzes and stuns WTF! Don't give em anything!<br />
<br />
4) I will try to simplify or summerize what poor Paen was trying to say, for what purpose I am not sure. <br />
<br />
a) SK's fastest cast ranged high aggro spell is between 1.6 and 1.75 sec casting time, fizzles not included.<br />
b) In today's environment 1.75 seconds of a mob on the loose is an eternity.<br />
c) Warriors have an insta cast hate spell called Incite.<br />
d) Would Knights, being the &quot;masters&quot; of snap aggro (lol) benefit from such a spell?<br />
<br />
Instead of a discussion based on these facts, we get this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Incite is not that great(meaning its no game breaker) and its best used on incoming.  They would be better of casting that 1.8 spell then relying on incite. <br />
So, Incite ain't that great and we shouldn't want it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How bout ... No !!!<br />
<br />
Shadowknights and Paladins have enough tools to get aggro, they are the masters of snap aggro as it is letting them get incite would be ridiculous. It's the equivalent of giving us snare and stuns imo.<br />
Here we are told that we are masters of snap aggro even tho our spell takes almost 2 seconds to cast vs the warrior instant version. It would be &quot;ridiculous&quot; if we got this powerful addition to our aggro kit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paen do you even play there is not much need for this.  Incite is not half as good as the spell aggro they can generate.<br />
There's the standard spiel about how great Knight aggro is, completely disregarding cast times whatsoever, the main issue being &quot;debated&quot; here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tell you what.  They can have incite when I can stun, buff, group heal, rez, mana tap, FD, and summon corpses. <br />
Here we are suggested to trade everything that we have and the kitchen sink for the ability to Incite, not to mention that those abilities belong to some kind of super SK/Pally meta-hybrid that can Feign Death AND Rez at the same time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So you see, this thread, while mildly entertaining, and excluding the few warriors that actually had something intelligent to say about early aggro and its place in the tanking hierarchy, only intensified my belief that most warriors are looking out for #1, all others be damned. Just don't come crying to me when the pendulum swings the other way, sometime around 2008 or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont have a hidden agenda or anything  :) , I just think we should work together on blatantly obvious issues.<br />
<br />
I would like to 'combine our forces' to get direct hate spells un-gimped also but thats not the reason for this post, its just another issue that all three tank classes should  agree is just plain wrong. (Why would a stun / slow / snare / any other spell accrue the same amount of hate on the first cast and not the terror line or incite? And why do we put up with it?)<br />
<br />
If all three of the tank classes agreed on something then it could get changed sooo much easier. It's a shame we cant even agree on something this simple that wouldnt even affect warriors in the slightest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">That's the thing. All I see is knee-jerk reactions saying NO to anything that could even minutely help Knights.

...I just think we should work together on blatantly obvious issues.<br />
The problem Paen is that the issue could be blatantly obvious and you still could be blatantly obviously wrong about both the &quot;issue&quot;, if one exists, and the fix should one be needed.<br />
<br />
I contend that the methods used to secure and hold aggro should vary between the 3 plate tanks for very good reasons.<br />
<br />
We are different classes with different tanking roles with some overlap in raids and greater overlap in groups.<br />
<br />
Incite has a slow refresh. When properly used it's very good for tanking a single mob (as in a boss mob). It's next to horrible should you Incite a mezzable mob and miss an unmezzable mob that must be tanked before it refreshes. In this case the Wariror becomes reliant on the Taunt button and procs - not as you'll recall all that dependable.<br />
<br />
Stuns, for example, may be &quot;slow&quot; but they are available much more freqently. Should adds be present in a raid, a Paladin is in a unique position to handle them.<br />
<br />
It is differences like these that don't prevent a tank class from grouping effectively, yet gives Paladins greater desireability in an add tanking raid role than Warriors.<br />
<br />
Rather than try to blur capabilities and make the classes identical, IMO it better to insure those difference give classes role preferences in raids based on their unique qualities. Give a Paladin one of the newer 1H weapons with a stun component and a Force of YKesha aug, an FB shield, and 1 second stuns and you've the making of a superior raid add tank. That's why Paladins don't have Incite - they don't need it, they need the tools that strengthen themselves as a distinct class able to make unique contributions, blah.... blah.<br />
<br />
SK's in my view need the same sort of attention to their aggro capabilities with an eye to carving them out a niche. I've suggested a short duration buff they can cast on another to credit them with the aggro an SK produces, when for example HTing, casting spears, and doing higher busrt DPS than a Warrior - aggro assignment, a role not really fleshed out in EQ yet. They already have a &quot;Kick Me&quot; hate buff, perhaps further thought along that path would be useful. The SK Class Description suggests they ought to be uniquely good at aggro creation and manipulation. I'd like to see it happen.<br />
<br />
It's a mistake, I think, to look through a class's abilies and disciplines and pass them out. That's why Warriors didn't simply get a discipline the cloned resisted stuns down to the casting and refresh times. Better to try to analyze how to differentiate classes and if something like faster initial aggro event generation is needed for Paladins or SK's to suggest something tailored toward making them well-crafted capable seperate classes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">So you dont think we should have got incite Battleblade? Since it blurs the classes and all? After all we werent 'meant' to have initial agro capabilities before we did get it. Are we the initial agro 'masters' now? Better keep people out of our territory and all?<br />
<br />
Whether I'm right or wrong makes no difference, thats not the way it should be imo, so I'm right in my eyes, it is my opinion after all.<br />
<br />
If you disagree thats fine, I respect your opinion, but you still havent given one valid reason why warriors should be superior at initial agro. You just keep mentioning class blurring which is exactly what Incite did for us and I for one am very grateful for that 'blur'.<br />
<br />
Also, class blurring is giving class defining abilities to another class, such as giving all melee classes defensive, or archery equal to a ranger, backstab etc.. Not a tool that would have no impact whatsoever on class balance. Not to mention incite was just an idea, they could give them 'Shout of Innoruuk' instead if it would be less blurring, or just fix the terror spells and make them 1sec cast.<br />
<br />
I think theres an obvious problem, no matter how many times you or anyone else tells me there isnt though.</div></div><hr />

The aurguments presented by Warriors were sufficient to persuade SoE and I agreed with them.<br />
<br />
We got ranged aggro and it built up over time. Quite adequate for our purposes. But SoE did not give Warriors a fast re-use capability. Nor do Knights have (afaik) Hate over Time capability. Differences were established and there are some positive consequences as a result.<br />
<br />
It is one thing to present a case (which has not been done with anywhere near the thoroughness of Warriors prior to the Phase 1 Melee Upgrade) that Knights need instant speed ranged aggro event generation. It is another to insist the best solution is to give Knights Incite.<br />
<br />
It's a &quot;Good Thing&quot; (tm) to, as you have done, suggest how a perceived game issue might be addressed and discuss it openly. Differences of opinion may occur, but that doesn't take away from the usefullness of exploring a topic.<br />
