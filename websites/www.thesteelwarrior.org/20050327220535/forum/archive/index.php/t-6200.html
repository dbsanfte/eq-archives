<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm considering doing this quest, however, I heard horror stories of people spending days upon days in lower guk factioning. Hence, I'm asking, how bad is this really?<br />
<br />
Some background: I never touched a single live frog in upper guk (for some reason I like the little green buggers, don't ask me why) and therefore I'm not kos to them. I believe I'm dubious.<br />
<br />
Provided I kill in lower guk - I can still exp there as I'm only 51 - how long will it take me to go from dubious to warmly? If you went down there and AE'd the wntire place, don't chime in, I know AE makes this easy and I also don't have a way to AE this. Not going to drag guild into an old dungeon for something I want as a toy ;)<br />
<br />
Also as a reference, going from dubious to warmly with Thugardin dorfs was really not that big a deal for me, just 3-4 days of killing giants, couple hours each day.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance everyone ;)</div></div><hr />

There is a head item with a faction modifier on it if you follow an evil deity.  That would cut down your faction farming immensely.<br />

When we did it for hers we AE'd(eathshaker + rampage + every undead frog in the zone = fun! and good faction). <br />
But when i was doing it when this quest just came out, i was doing it by myself. At 60 you can just go solo frogs for a day or 2 and you'll have your faction. At 51 do the same only with a partner or group i guess. I can't use the scalp from ghoul lord by the way I had some quite a bit of hunting in seb though, so i started out with decent faction(forgot about this part). So...probably will take ya 2 days in lower guk.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I had heard that killing the frogs in Sebilis offered better positive Guk faction hits than Lower Guk...<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume that judging by the above posts, this is incorrect...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends Azaza I did a bit of both. Seb offers a bit of Xp and some loot, but if you decide to solo or duo without a friend that can snare bring snare weapons. Those runners are nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You gain faction by farming that Reet Crown.  So i guess you can start factioning in LGuk solo and then when you get some friends you can camp the Reet crown guy and get more faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the slower killing rate in Sebilis, the faction earned per hour is about equal between Guk and Sebilis.<br />
<br />
The best thing about Sebilis is the unlimited supply of mobs.  In Guk it is surprisingly easy to run out of mobs.  There are about 100 faction-raising mobs in Lower Guk last time I counted, respawning every 36 minutes.  This is a hard cap on your rate of earning faction in Guk, and the presence of other people will reduce it further (especially now during the Fabled mob month).<br />
<br />
Yes, you do earn faction while killing reet frogloks.  Unfortunately, you do not earn faction while killing dozens of shrooms and juggernauts on the way to the reets.  Only the frogloks in Sebilis raise faction, not the other mobs.</div></div><hr />
