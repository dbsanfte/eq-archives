<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dual SoDs. 1handers out DPS 2handers at 52, due to 2hand damage bonus being very low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You started getting high damage bonuses on 2handers with 28+ delay at level 51, but the damage bonus still has some ramping up to do.  I would guess that you will get more DPS from generally available dual wield weapons until level 55 or so.  Many POP weapons have required/recommended levels of 55-60, and the GOD tradeable weapons are recommended level 62-63, so the better choices are still ahead of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zkath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sod is a really good idea only problem with that is the 100k each. any other ideas as 200k might be a little harder to get ahold of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I would look at Fleshgrinder/SBoZ/Shortblade of Lightening for just DPS at 52<br />

<br />
When you asked for what the &quot;best&quot; DPS available was, I assumed money wasn't an issue.<br />
<br />
You gotta pay to play.<br />

;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zkath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it was acutally a really good idea i had forgotten about the sod. that is more of a future thing for me atm though since on xegony they are way overpriced and extremely rare hehe.<br />
<br />
that and i only have about 110k hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">CT has a 44/44 warrior only axe...Stonebladed Axe of Dismay I think.  It's only req. 51, so should put out some reasonable hurt for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You might also consider that you won't be level 51 all that long, and the difference in dps that you put out with outrageously expensive weapons and &quot;merely&quot; good weapons is unlikely to make or break a raid.<br />
If you are not in a raid, but rather in a group, then be the MT and go with aggro weapons; dps ought to be a small concern for you compared to aggro.<br />
If you don't have at least 36% haste, I'd spend my plat on haste long before attempting to maximize my lvl 51 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zkath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hehe this my is naggy and vox killing char with my guild when we break out the twinks.<br />
<br />
