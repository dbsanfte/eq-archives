<br />
<br />
i have my epics and this CHSD.....i know i'm going to want the chsd in main hand....is red epic fine in the off hand or should i look for something else?  I know there are some issues with the red epic being resisted a lot.   <br />
<br />
<br />
or Is the CHSD good enough agro that i may want to go after a dps weapon in my off hand till i get another no drop agro weapon?   <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
That even a resisted proc STILL GENERATES AGGRO? (Think of it like the mob is resisting a debuff spell ... that still pisses a mob off).<br />
<br />
If you want to generate hate, your spike driver and your red epic will do the job admirably well.</div></div><hr />

Both proc extremely well IMO, and thats only with 1440 attk.</div></div><hr />

Resisted spells DO generate aggro, but it's not the same as if the spells land.   There's one direct benefit to SK's getting a numerical hate spell, and that it that one can pretty clearly measure and parse aggro for the first time.   It has been shown that aggro on resisted spells is numerically lower than that from landed spells even on non-hate based spells, but I think we can all be pretty clear that a spell which has as it's function numerical hate will generate less aggro resisted than one which lands.   Granted, it'll produce some hate, just not at the same level.<br />
<br />
For proof, I offer only the following, which admittedly is anecdotal:   When CT was first revamped, the taunt skill was completely disabled in the zone, we had to totally rely on procs to generate aggro.   The other thing is, that the lizards in that zone are almost 100% fire resist if not 100% FR.   Since the red epic was a fire based spell, it was kind of a double whammy to warriors, who could neither land their epic proc, NOR taunt.   I played around a lot with different procs to see what worked best among the weapons I'd had at the time, so I pulled out every proc weapon I had at the time, and found that Veldrak's Shortblade was #1, Gnoll Hide Lariat was #2, and Dirk of the Dain was #3.... lagging WAY WAY WAY behind was resisted red epic proc.</div></div><hr />

And grats btw, at least it dropped the second time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm, my results of testing the aggro of resisted red epic proc is totally backwards from what Frodlin said. I was exping in PoV at level 61 or 62 ish, wielding my epic 2h at the time. Had a shaman who was slowing without even attempting to cast Malo/malosini first, and in one particular fight that I noted (being very interested in what a resisted epic proc would do at the time), I only had 3 rounds of combat before his slow landed. In one of these rounds, my 2h epic proc'ed, but was resisted. Without a single taunt or hate-increasing buff, that resisted epic proc was enough to hold aggro through the slow, which says to me it's got to be the full 500 hate generated. You just lose the 100 DD component of the spell, which granted is a nice extra dps / aggro boost by itself.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, not to hijack the thread or anything. I use CHSD and Red Epic for max aggro as well when I'm MTing something big. In exp groups and other random fights, I will usually just wield my AP staff in second hand full-time for dps and less hassle over avatar. Xana hammer proc by itself with 305 dex is enough to hold taunt 90 percent of the time. Against the big mobs, I try to get as fresh of an avatar as possible (either with my weapon, or from a shaman on the raid), and let the hammer / epic do their thing with max dex.</div></div><hr />

My issue isn't the numerical value of a resisted hate proc like Rage of Vallon ... it's the misinformation/myths that are propogated by some who seem to think when Rage of Vallon is resisted, it generates NO aggro, whatsoever. Thus continuing to believe and even convince others that the red epic proc is trash.<br />
<br />
Take the red epic to Skyfire Mountains, and watch it get resisted all the time by every wurm in the zone.<br />
<br />
And then watch it STILL do its job.<br />
<br />
The resisted procs generate aggro.<br />
<br />
I don't know the numerical value.<br />
<br />
But is that important?<br />
<br />
The weapon still does its job. It procs and pisses the mob off.<br />
<br />
Are there better weapons than the red epic? Sure.<br />
<br />
The original poster would be much better off replacing the red epic with a blade of carnage, or hategiver or bloodfrenzy something along those lines.<br />
<br />
But barring those upgrades ... he's better off sticking with Rage of Vallon ... even when it's resisted.<br />
<br />
That's all my point was.<br />
<br />
Resisted Rage of Vallon proc STILL pisses a mob off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My unbuffed dex is about 110. When I have no dex buff, I normally use CHSD and Blue epic instead of the red epic.<br />
<br />
When I am buffed with high dex, as other said, the general consenus is mainhand CHSD and offhand red epic. <br />
<br />
Btw, do not underestimate the power of 2hs epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roshinbertson</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i love my 2hs epic...it works great....but i would think that 2 hate proc items are better then one...yes/no?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
that is why i wanted that hammer so bad...<br />
<br />
now that i've used it...i think its great....after first proc i can afk and not loose agro /grin  j/k....but its sweet i love it</div></div><hr />
