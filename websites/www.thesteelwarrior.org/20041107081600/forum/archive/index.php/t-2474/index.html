<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">FECK IT FECK IT FECK IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
I am an Elemental geared Warrior, <br />
I have close to 100aa.....<br />
<br />
and yet... If I were another class, NO WAY would I take myself into a group.<br />
<br />
Due to the fact I was unlucky on Cursed or Rallos Zek, I suck at my job. <br />
Period.<br />
<br />
I was in a group that consisted of 2 rogues, Shaman, Druid, Wizard, in PoFire.<br />
<br />
There was maybe 5 times out of 50 times, where I had no problem with aggro. And kept the mob on me from the start.<br />
<br />
The other 45 times, I was doing what I could, struggling to get that aggro... to no avail.<br />
My Taunt failed OVER 10 times on one mob, with no procs during that time.....<br />
the shaman FUCKING tanked the mob till it was at 10% and my Taunt finally took off....<br />
<br />
<br />
People are saying we have more mitigation that knights?<br />
well FUCK THAT... it's an illusion.<br />
If we seem to take hits better then knights, it's for the simple reason that the mob is on the other people 10% of the time if not more.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can spend 300 more points into AAs, I can get all the fucking armor I can get from the EP planes.....<br />
I will alway SUCK at tanking because I have shit luck on two FARM mobs!<br />
Cursed and Rallos Zek not being farmed enough?<br />
or not dropping what you need?<br />
Well then FUCK YOU and SUCK!<br />
<br />
I am extremely pissed off now....<br />
<br />
Realising that my &quot;Skill&quot;, my &quot;Class Knowledge&quot;, my fucking use anywhere...... burns down to TWO things...<br />
Get a Blade of War,<br />
or get a Bloodfrenzy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not only is it now hard to find exp (I hardly care about it now)...<br />
but it's just friggin impossible for a warrior to go out and have fun!<br />
<br />
No matter where you go, you gotta struggle with that aggro, and no one gives one ounce of shit wether you're a 10k uber tank, or a 5k little fucking paladin piece of shit.<br />
You don't have the aggro? then fuck off.<br />
<br />
Just about every god damn class can go out and have fun!<br />
Even the two other melee classes.....<br />
<br />
Rogues can go scout an area, then help on the damage nicely.<br />
Monks can go pull mobs with no risk, and also help damage nicely.<br />
Every fucking Caster class has very sweet abilities, even mages and necros, who were once hated in groups.<br />
Knights, Bards... do i have anything to say here?... hell, they hardly even need a group to have any fun... <br />
knight could just duo almost anything....<br />
<br />
but Warriors?... oh no... they get to take the blame for every dead group member.<br />
They get to be told non stop to use that FUCKING TAUNT BUTTON! and still not be able to improve their aggro...<br />
<br />
FUCK IT<br />
<br />
and just watch Lost Dungeons of Norrath come out with lots and lots of dungeons with Undead mobs.....<br />
where is gonna be the reason to get a Warrior then?.... they're undead... why the FUCK would you think twice about get a Paladin or a Warrior?<br />
<br />
(sorry for all the fucks and shits and other random insults, I need to vent once again... good ol frusterations from playing a useless piece of shit excuse for a Class, oh yeah, we're not useless sorry... we got DEFENSIVE)</div></div><hr />

What weps do you use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hear you Bunnie, and I feel much the same.  I'm using NToV weapons and a willsapper.  And I absolutely beyond a doubt hate PoP.  My success there has nothing to do with my abilities as a player and everything to do with whether or not I get procs or if taunt happens to be cooperative.  This blows goats, seriously.  I haven't been in PoP for weeks specifically because of it.  If I could unbuy the expansion and get a refund, at this point I would.<br />
<br />
And do you know what pisses me off the most?  The fact that it is so obviously screwed up for Warriors without EB weapons but that SoE has continued to put the situation on the back burner for 9 months and we still don't have any idea with a change might be in the works, if ever.<br />
<br />
I can't quite convince myself to completely ditch my Warrior, I keep hoping SoE is going to do something.  I can't quite get myself to play my numerous other characters because I've spent so much time and energy on working on the Warrior.  And I can't get myself to go to PoP and deal with the frustration of our aggro control woes.  Which means I end up double boxing a lot, off in LoY or Veksar, or even Sebilis these days.  Basically my enjoyment of my character in the one expansion everyone is playing in is completely hosed to hell.  And I don't like it.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'm waiting for the next good online game to come out to give me a good reason to dump EQ, because frankly I've pretty much lost all faith in SoE's abilities to run the game reasonably.  They're far more interested in releasing the next expansion and dinging me for another $20 or $30 than in actually making the game fun for me.   How much of a glutton for punishment do they think I am?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it's still pretty obvious that,<br />
having to rely on two extremely rare drops off two extremely farmed Raid mobs, <br />
to just play your class Decently... is pure bullshit.<br />
<br />

After having read that Live Chat, I really see SOE now as a bunch of excited unprofessional kids, that are sucked into inventing new Spells!!<br />
Making spells is great!! You get to give them jazzy names, give them cool new effects etc... FUN!!<br />
<br />
Funner then fixing a class that's been needing a fix for 5 years, that's for sure!</div></div><hr />

I didnt answer to that question because I agree 100% with the above quote ;)....<br />
but if you must know, my primary is a Blade of Carnage,<br />
the other used to be a Sceptre of Destruction &quot;updated&quot; to the Rotting Fist,<br />
and lastly updated to Aegis of Earth, which is proving to be quite the aggro machine, as long as your primary procs once at least.<br />

What else would SOE be in business for? That is why they host this game..to make money. I'm not disagreeing with you in the least bit. That's just how I look at the world, in dollar signs. <br />
<br />
  I've seen lots of bad implimentations of money in my line of work because ppl don't want to think ahead (I understand how much of a pain thinking is since I don't have the luxury of being a mindless drone following orders then claiming stupidity when I do my job wrong) or shell out a few extra bucks up front to get the job done 100 percent right but instead they will pay 3 times as much later to fix it.  That's how I get my cynical views of the world and I just deal with it as it finds its way down to my shoulders. Solutions? I have none that can help in game...but if it really maddens you this much why not just cause some mayhem on a major level to get you moneys worth and leave with a grin on you face? (c=<br />
<br />
Beside all SOE is doing now is testing different implimentations for EQ2 and keeping us on their subscriber list till it comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Me and another warrior guildmate routinely tank in Earth and Fire using 4wind staves. Sometimes I use OG. Sometimes I use agro weapons. Sometimes I use JSoFF and that Rune2 thing from water. Occasinally I lose agro regardless of my weapons, generally agro is not a major problem. I have minimal agro increasing AA's(Fero3, Flurry1). I really don't see how other warriors are having this impossible agro issue every single day like this board indicates. I'm not special. I don't have any top secret tricks to gaining and holding agro. And I would like a somewhat more reliable taunt for those occasions(fairly rare ones mind you) where I completely lose agro in an exp group and it takes some effort to get back(because AET is down). But these fucking doom and gloom posts 20 times a day are so overblown and full of shit that it makes me sick. But I'm a big asshole and lots annoys me, so uh carry on.</div></div><hr />

I grouped in valor for 2 aas the other night, with a 55 enchanter slowing.  She got a LOT of resists, but didn't die all night, neither did anybody else.  The cleric was rooting on inc, it was no disaster, we had non-stop exp the whole time, nobody had mana problems.  What a freakin tragedy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the problem overblown?  Maybe, to a certain degree.  It's human nature that when you see a problem and it goes unaddressed and apparently ignored, it grows in your eyes.  Maybe it's perceptions, maybe it's reality.  All I know is this.  I really freaking hate it when the slower repeatedly gets aggro and I have to work my ass off to try and get it back, and once in a while it just doesn't happen.  I've done it all.  Used everything in my bag of tricks.  And unless someone else in the group is intelligent enough to do just that little be extra, then someone dies.  Do you like being powerless?  Having no real ability to impact a situation?  Particularly when the classes that compete against you for groups don't have the problem, AT ALL?<br />
<br />
To me, this sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">a pally/sk would NEVER lose aggro and tank as good as you and bring more to the group.<br />
<br />
OMG if you believe that you should delete your warrior and play a knight!!!1!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I really hate to break it to you Tasso but a resisted slow on inc can pull agro whether a paladin or a warrior is tanking. I've pulled agro from a pretty uber 65 SK with my 58 rogue before.<br />
<br />
 I can get 4-5 AA in a 3-4 exp session *easily* with me tanking the entire time and no one dying or even coming close. With a druid healer. In an Elemental plane. Virtually non-stop pulls. Somehow my class must not be as completely hopeless as it appears.<br />
<br />
 I have no delusions that we are completely balanced or perfect or anything. But these daily posts about how worthless we are because of paladins and SK's sicken me. *I* am very fucking useful to any group I am a part of, so long as there's not another warrior tanking, because then a DPS class would be more useful(though hey I can maintain 135dps I'm not that bad!). I can't think of any recent exp group I've been in where a knight would be any significant improvement, but I know for a fact of some where they would be dead while I was still there tanking away.<br />
<br />
 And Glat for once I agree with you. Your slower sucks, fire the fucking retard and get someone with half a brain, or a ToD. Speaking of ToD's! Have done exp groups with me as slower in Earth =) I pull I snare I slow I crowd control, fuck I better stop posting before I get nerfed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Your slower sucks, fire the fucking retard and get someone with half a brain, or a ToD. <br />
<br />
Naw, see what happens is they fire ME.  They don't have to deal with my screwed up aggro.  They don't have to do that little bit extra to do the job.  All they have to do is get a knight.  And there isn't a hell of a lot I can say or do about that.<br />
<br />
So you want to say the group is lame and should be replaced, fine.  But they say the Warrior is lame and should be replaced instead, and that's exactly what they do, by not getting a Warrior the next time.  From their perspective, it's a no brainer.  A slam dunk.  Hardly worth thinking about.<br />
<br />
And there lies the problem Grimm, regardless of what we think, the other players are the ones who really determine who they use, unless we set up all the groups.  And you know we don't.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I'm going to make an educated guess on a couple of things as well Grimm.  First, I'm going to guess that if people want to exp in PoF rather than say BoT, that the pool of available tanks is much smaller.  Which means people will go that little bit further for a PoF Warrior that they wouldn't want to bother with for BoT. And then I'm going to guess that you are probably geared and AAXPed well enough to allow a bit more leeway in how the healer and slower behave, allowing them to hold off longer than for most other Warriors.  Just guesses on my part though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just dont let it get to you.<br />
I was in 2 groups in PoEarth yesterday for about 4 hours total and lost agro maybe 5 percent of the time tops, that was 1,5 hours with a guild only group and 2,5 hours with 2 other guildies (cleric and druid) and 3 members from a PoTime guild (chanter, ranger and monk)<br />
Then i joined a another guild group in solro and lost agro to our chanter about every second pull (for some reason she just loves to slow, tash and cripple before mob is at 95 percent and in exactly the order i said).<br />
After having grouped with her before i just stopped caring, especially because she regularly was out of range for /shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SEWS is tolerable if you're not lucky with EB weapons.  A ratio 1.5 weapon can usually stop the first slow from aggroing on its ratio alone (not the first tash + slow though).  <br />
<br />
I find that Warriors are really good at tuning out the fact that a Warrior is as efficient than a Knight in almost all XP groups as long as your group is capable of clearing eveything within a reasonable vincinity because you're not going to suddenly get more mobs to kill.  Do people's groups just not have any DPS or something?  I have waited 1 minute for a pull in Gib with 4 people (Druid/Enchanter/me/Rogue) because that's where the closest mob is.  How can you possibly be less efficient than a Knight since he has to wait 1 minute for the nearest mob to come in as well?  That 1 minute certainly dominates the 5 seconds you think you've gained from being able to kill a mob faster (even though that's not even always true).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You know Phantron, you may have a point.  It's fairly meaningless though, becaues it really doesn't matter whether or not you have enough mobs to kill if you don't get the group to begin with.  People aren't taking your thought into consideration when picking a tank.  They're considering solely the fact that one tank will allow them to play the game the way they want and in a fashion they perceive as more efficient, while the other one won't.   Kind of hard to argue with that.  Regardless of our perceptions, our feelings of the group not knowing their business, our beliefs that the slower or the healer or whoever doesn't understand aggro control or what not, these things, true or not, won't make people take a Warrior when a Knight is available.<br />
<br />
So it is more important you convince the rest of the EQ world of the righteousness of your perspective, because convincing us doesn't get us groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every single group I've been in, the slower tends to be as far away as he/she can be without being out of range for slowing...they run away after the tank regains agro, as if the distance helps any.  They aren't meleeing!  These mobs don't have AEs or rampage!  Why the hell are they trying to get out of melee range when there's no way in hell the mob can even touch them if it's fighting the tank?  I know from personal experience on my cleric, I've sat down right at the mobs feet a short bit after I've been summoned from a CH and the tank got agro back.  I don't get touched, even right there, so how am I more safe 5 miles away instead of right next to the tank?<br />
<br />
I'm a beastlord!  I'll eventually be one of the 3 main slowing classes in the game!  My own PET can hold agro through one of my slows most of the time!  If I'm slowing, I'm going to be standing right next to the tank!  Why?  Because I know how much it absolutely sucks to hit Taunt to get agro back and get that message &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; because the slower decided to stand way back behind me and it went after him/her.<br />
<br />
  I played a SK, got her up to 60 before I became tired...sometimes I didn't have the chance to get agro (interrupts or just plain stupidity) and it went chasing after the shaman/enchanter...they always stood 5 miles away while slowing...as if the mob won't want to run all that way.<br />
<br />
Can someone please give me some reason why, when a warrior is tanking, they think it's somehow safer to stand just within casting range to slow rather than right on that warrior's ass so the warrior doesn't have to chase the mob to get agro back?<br />
<br />

<br />
Pretty much.<br />
<br />
All this talk about &quot;maximizing efficiency&quot; - what does it really change? Do the people really get more exp than you do by having the perfect group? Probably not - once you factor in the time it takes them to get the &quot;perfect group&quot;.  I've lost count of the number of times someone has spent hours LFG while I've been racking in exp (albiet slower than the perfect group) in a group that they won't join because &quot;the exp isn't fast enough&quot;.  Guess what.  I got exp, they sat in PoK and whined. Heck I've watched em log to alts in disgust because they couldn't get into a PoS group at 55. Boo fricking hoo.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm 60 and guess what.  I still log in and press auto attack and loot when the stuff is dead.  Just like when I was level 59, and 50, and 40. Whoopty doo.<br />
<br />
If the only people you know are so hung up about optimal exp rate they won't group with you, that's pretty pathetic. Unless you have no friends - that's pretty pathetic for different reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
instead, they stand waaay back from the mob, i lose aggro, try and taunt but surprise surprise the mob is out of range, i then have to turn, run to where they are standing, wait for taunt to refresh by which time they have take a few rounds of damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Slowing is not an easy thing my main is a shaman and I play a warrior also. The reason most slowers stand away is control if I get a resist and get argo I root and back off. The farther away I am the more time I have to react. Understand I dont mind a warrior as my tank but many hate it, for one reason argo. Talk all you want about I can hold argo Im uber but A pali stuns on incoming once stuned I slow and I never gain argo unless I get 2 or 3 resists. Now I can pull argo from anyone if Im an idiot and over dot but When I have a warrior in my group I dont dot at all because of the argo prob. I know how to control my own argo and thats great but to many people today feel  that they should not have to control their argo just get a knight problem fixed. Is it a fair perception maybe not but its out their weather you like it or not. Warriors need to be fixed. I know many of you think their is no problem what I would say to you is try playing a 50 something warrior today in POP. You will be looking for a group for hours while every 50 something knight out there gets a group with little problem. Warriors argo should not depend on how uber your weps are but lets face it right now thats the way it is. FIX IT Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha, in my upper 50s I just about quit grouping with shamans altogether because I got into such a string of them that stood 50 feet away, slowed before I got 3 hits on the mob, and then ran around in circles like a headless chicken while getting beat on.  I finally just started saying /g when you're done screwing around with that thing bring it over here and I'll taunt it off of you.  Luckily since then I have grouped with some much more competent shamans and they are off of my h8 list for now.  In fact, using a GBoS I rarely lose aggro to a shaman from slow unless it's resisted a time or two.  Enchanters are another story.<br />
<br />
Glad to hear you know what you're doing as a slower, tanks really appreciate that believe me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have been in groups where the pally was tanking. malo, tash on inc, slow (resisted maybe 2 times in a row without him losing aggro). As soon as its in camp land cripple. <br />
<br />
try that with a warrior. <br />
<br />
A warrior will not be able to hold aggro unless he gets lucky with the rng and has some real aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
argue that they should wait till you get aggro. with a pally as the tank for the group they dont have to wait. This alone makes pally/sk &gt;warriors in exp group. <br />
<br />
Im sick of people saying they can hold aggro as well as a pally. Its not true.. dont belive me.. grab a mob and tell the pally to try to take aggro off you. he will and you will maybe get aggro when taunt works and then it will pop right back to the pally.<br />
<br />
and if he has the same class gear as you have he will be able to tank as well as you. only disadvantage is he will have 400-1000 less hp. And no defensive (rare that its used or needed)<br />
<br />
Again my oppinon is our aggro is FINE. Exactly as it should be. Pally/sk aggro is nearing the point of game breaking. <br />
<br />
People should have to wait for the tank to get aggro, they should  worry about overnuking. They should worry that slow was resisted 2 times.<br />
<br />
It makes the game a challenge. You might as well have a /kill button when you have 0 risk. And pallys/sk's bring that feeling of no risk to a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
then again i could be wrong</div></div><hr />

about not being the favorite....<br />

I still dont belive in that. I just think we have been on the crappy end of the stick for the last 2 expansions. <br />
<br />
every expansion hybreds/casters get upgraded spells. we get.. better armor/weapons. But lack of warr only drops has allowed hybreds to increase in power 2x over pure casters or pure melee.</div></div><hr />

Nobody has every said that in the history of this board.  To say so would make you a flaming moron.  What people are saying is that they can hold aggro well enough to tank in an efficient group, even though a paladin or SK would make it *more* efficient.  Exxaggerating things to extremes like this<br />
<br />
we are a SHIT class<br />
<br />
is the main problem this board has if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Bloodied Berserker's Blade or pretty much an DW setup where I put my BBotE mainhand, I often hold aggro in exp, very little bouncing around, though it can happen if taunt is being bitchy after an early slow.  BUT, I don't dare go for a dps setup. I'll never see aggro again if I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Glad to hear you know what you're doing as a slower, tanks really appreciate that believe me.<br />
It's my pleasure.  And to the person who said slowing isn't easy...it's about as easy as timing a CH.  That's it.  Perhaps on raid mobs you have to time it better, but you also have to time CHs better there too.  Takes about as much worry to time a slow in an exp group as it does to time a CH.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is, I believe more group members die in warrior groups not just because warriors lose agro, but because warriors need to run halfway across the zone (yes, an exaggeration) to get to the slower because he decided he needed a bit of a reaction time.  Screw the reaction time!<br />
 <br />
Tell your slower:<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're going to stand far away and pull  the mob away from me with slow, then you better be ready to bring it back to me yourself so I'll taunt it off you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Act like you're rooted...that'll help. Any time he pulls it away, just sit down and wait for him to bring it back.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">If you believe slowing is easy then you clearly dont know what the hell you are talking about. Try slowing a mob and get resisted 3 times you will be a hole in the ground. As far as bring it back to you kiss my butt. Thats the point with a pali or SK I dont have to. Oh but you so uber well good for you but if you dont even try to get it off me Ill find a tank who will. Its no wonder people hate warriors with Idiots like this.<br />
<br />
Oh and one more thing clerics yell slow it im wasting to much mana healing that warrior. Oh crap now Im wasting to much mana healing you dont get argo. Root and back off. Warrior why the hell did you root it on this hill. I love people who have prob never played a class telling me how to play it. Sit you ass down Or petend your rooted. Ok no prob oh dam I keep getting resisted Oh no cleric is out of mana. oh know warrior is dead oh look slow landed poor warrior. Dont worry we can Kill it without him now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Dandaar, you appear to be one of those shamans we hate grouping with.  Good shamans stand next to the tank when they slow.  If you get aggro, chances are better than 50% that one taunt will get it off of you, if not we can /shield and the next taunt is only 6 seconds away assuming that we aren't chasing you all over the zone.  If you've been resisted, root before you cast slow again if you're that worried about it.  Get some Scaled Avatar legs from BoT or the bazaar and you can click them while waiting for your spell gems to refresh, by the time your slow spell refreshes, they will be almost done casting root.  Go ask the old-school shamans on the crucible.  I think they will tell you the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I slow on a second screen.  It's easy, takes about 5 percent of my attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Oddly enough I seem to rarely loose agro (using a GSoT and no offensive AAs) on a resisted slow. It can be streaky, yes, but a fair amount of the time I will be surprised when the slower say something like &quot;Resisted slow 3 times.&quot;<br />
<br />
2 Weeks ago, mid sands group never lost a slower, don't think at anypoint the slower was hit for more than 1 round.  This week same camp, slower died twice (with an extra death when I nearly lagged out). <br />
<br />
The times I really miss the snap agro, in BoT at least, is on the place holders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">First dont assume. <br />
<br />
Second I have been playing a shaman for since right before Knark came out. You dont know my play style or me. I dont mind getting hit. And if you believe taunt well get something off me 50% of the time if I get a resist you really dont have a clue. <br />
<br />
Third I never said I stood off I said thats why most do it. Chanters die very quick if they get resists so they stand as far off as they can. You may not like it but thats why most do it. When I play with a warrior I slow as late as possible so you can grab argo but in todays game many dont so its turns into ping pong the mob.  <br />
<br />
 Fourth My point was that with a Pali or SK we really dont have to worry about where we stand because unless we screw up we wont get argo. Like I said I play a warrior I to hate chaseing things and once again that is the point we should not have to have uber weps to do our job.<br />
<br />
Last I never move if I get argo I root it and back off if it sticks. If I die I die. Ive been playing far to long to worry about a death from agro. Call me what you like and if you think I dont know how to play a shaman thats fine sticks and stones. Just rember not everyone plays the same I may think you suck as a warrior but that does not make it so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">People need to relax. :-/<br />
<br />
The shammy standing far away thing... yeah, it's annoying... but only once have I ever said &quot;Go ahead and bring that mob back when you're done tanking&quot;- And that was only because the shammy was freaking 50 feet above me in a wall, and was no way I could climb it.<br />
<br />
We aren't talking so much about the shammies who stand 3-4 steps away instead of RIGHT next to us. The point to understand, is that taunt is short range, mobs are fast, and even the BEST system has a little lag on it- So running around in circles like a chicken with its head cut off with an unsnared mob is not gonna get the mob off you. It's gonna tick off the warrior, and prevent him from getting aggro. But you already knew that!<br />
<br />
You rarely, if ever, see the TRUELY bad people who play your class. Enchanters never see the enchanter who assists the MA to cast mez on the mob at 70% hp, and bitches when it's broken. Shamans never see the shaman who winds himself into some hole in a wall that he can barely squeeze in and casts slow on inc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Pff, any slower that dies too fast to a resisted slow is fuckin around too much.<br />
<br />
ARCANE RUNE.  If that's not good enough, get Eldritch Rune too...so when your arcane drops and the mob is still on you, you can re-rune again instantly.  That's MORE than enough time to recast or get the mob off you...well, assuming you're not an idiot and standing too far away to /shield or taunt the mob.  Oh, here's another idea.  BOGGLE THE MOB OFF YOU.<br />
<br />
Not a chanter?  Oh well then your shaman should have 1000 ac no problem, and they've got FUCKIN TORPOR.  Cast it before you slow, you get aggro YOU WILL LIVE.  Jesus christ.   I don't know you, I don't know your play style, but what you're saying pretty much makes you sound like an idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You sir, are the clueless one.  The taunt thing has been parsed, and it has about a 60% chance of working on the first try, and when it does work, it will put aggro on the warrior, whether it's a resisted slow or 20+ stuns by a cleric.  This is a fact that has been proven on these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Chanters die very quick if they get resists so they stand as far off as they can. <br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the chanters I know stand right next to the mob so I can taunt it off of them, and /shield (or /hero :D ) them.<br />
<br />
Tell your slowers to stand right next to the mob, or start pulling into the casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I duo a 62 war and 62 shammy and in a normal exp group slow grabs aggro about 1 in 40 mobs.  It's easy, just malo right at the start, wait about 2 seconds and slow.  Doesn't matter if I'm using a dps weapon for when I duo or an aggro weapon in groups.  Also the shammy's range from the mob does matter and believe it or not the further away he is better.  Since I duo it's easy to time my taunt for the second slow lands in cases where I have to slow right away and if the shammy is far away 1 taunt takes aggro right back 90% of the time.  If he's next to the mob it takes 2-3 taunts on average.<br />
Also have to consider the lvl of the shammy vs. the mobs your fighting.  Red cons are going to give him a lot more aggro than lower cons.  I'm sure of this because I've seen it first hand for many lvls, and because I can go farm low dk blues/lt blues without ever drawing aggro from an early slow.<br />
Of course, none of this really helps since a lot of shaman's out there like to just slow on inc, sit, then bitch how you can't hold aggro :/</div></div><hr />

I can do just fine in nearly any group if people are willing to wait until I've had 10~ or so seconds time without them attacking/casting, or if I get a proc off. After that, I can hold agro through the entire fight without problems. The only thing that could possibly get it off is a class using every nuke and dot they have in a chain cast...<br />
<br />
I can also hold agro if the other classes im playing with know how to control agro, and use their abilities to drop it if they get it. Its not that hard, but the thing is most groups would rather get a knight class than have to deal with a different play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Yeah someone who gets it. If they can cast with little or no danger with a Knight Why get a warrior.</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone was arguing that a hybrid isn't a better exp group tank than a warrior.  Hell this whole forum is for people to rant about that very fact.  That doesn't mean that the misconceptions in your posts shouldn't be refuted though.</div></div><hr />
