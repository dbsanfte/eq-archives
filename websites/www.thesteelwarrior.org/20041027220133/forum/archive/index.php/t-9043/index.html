<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK made a Warrior on a new server MR a couple of weeks ago to avoid twinkage etc. And I am thoroughly enjoying it.<br />
<br />
I spent the first 4 levels or so on 1HS then the next five on 2HS so both skills coming along ok.  However I am now Lvl 9 2HS is in front of 1HS and Bash has been neglected a lot.<br />
<br />
So what I am thinking is it is time to get a 1HS and especially a Shield. So I can get both skills up before Lvl 13 (I think) when I get dual wield.<br />
<br />
For your info I am Lvl 9 Bertox Gnome Warrior - With the full set of Plague Warrior Armour bar the Final task - which is tempting for the 1HS, but I cannot find the lil git I have to kill. And I have the heady total of about 30pp.<br />
<br />
(Oh and not a comlete newb - 3 lvl 50's on SZ good team)<br />
<br />
<br />
SO WHAT IS THE BEST COMBO 1HS and SHIELD FOR NOW THAT IS ACHIEVABLE ??<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">shiny brass thingy in crushbone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>milloeq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shiny brass shield from the orc trainer at the hilltop just to the right of the zone in to Crushbone, is an easy drop at that level.  Also bazaar hunting for a chitin shell shield or cracked darkwood shield (highpass gnoll named drop) should be easy, maybe 10-15p for either.  As for 1hs, without much plat you might be able to find a crystallized longsword (the 11/29 one not the 10/38 or whatver) or anything in the bazaar that has better than 10/30 at that level.  <br />
<br />
Also dont neglect 1hb and 1hp, both are equally viable anymore since they fixed the skill cap on piercing, and both have some super choices for low and higher levels.<br />
<br />
some cheap 1hb include a mudman enforcer (8/20 +3str), velium etched stone mace (8/24 +3wis i think) centi warhammer (15/32 +stats not sure which) etc etc.  1hp include slime coated harpoon, jade chokidai prod, and a bunch more i cant think of.  <br />
<br />
Good luck on MR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the quick help guys.<br />
<br />
While looking these items up on Allakhazam I noticed the Velium Etched Stone Mace is not listed as usable by Warriors - Can this be correct ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes it is not war usable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cracked Darkwood Shield comes to mind, I used that for a long time way back when...I think it drops in Upper Guk?  At work so can't check :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">cracked darkwood shield drops off Vexren Mucktail; gnoll side of highpass.<br />
over there if you get Granix Mucktail you can get a poished granite tomahawk as well ( 8/27 i think with proc with a 20 second invul. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It does? Never knew that.<br />
Shiny brass idol has a clicky invulnerability too (one charge). Drops off named orcs on eastern side of the pass. You can't melee (or cast, for that matter) while the effect is up. But handy for certain classes under certain conditions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well, it's not really invul..i think the proc is Berserker Strength .<br />
<br />
but yeah, i hunted in highpass a lot when i was a newb. the lines to get in those groups was quite long ( you usually moved into highkeep with the same groups you were with in highpass )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Miloeq,<br />
  The Jade Chokidai Prod is Shaman only</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At level 9 I had a langseax and shiny brass shield. :)  My buddies alway made me tank the caster bandits in WK because of the +10mr on the shield.  Ahh, the memories...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OK Thanks guys. Great help there let me update you on my story so far.<br />
<br />
I have progressed to lvl 12 and a bit of Bazaar hanging, also means I got two +2str rings and a +4Sta +3Agi necklace,  plus a Zraxthril Forged Axed 10 38  +2Str +1Wis +5hp and a Shiny Brass Shield 10AC +10MR.<br />
<br />
So I am feeling pretty cool and proud of myself for an untwinked lvl 12.<br />
<br />
I now have a problem though no plat left and about to ding 13.<br />
<br />
I believe I get Dual Wield then.  So here is my questions<br />
<br />
Do I ignore Dual Wield and continue bashing away or is there a throw away 1HS or 1HB I should pick up and just train Dual Wield up.<br />
<br />
eg I think I have a Rusty Short Sword on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Try to equip the fastest weapon you can get in your offhand. This way your DualWield-skill will increase faster. If you have nothing else take a rusty dagger. It's faster then a sword and you will train your piercing-skill at the same time.<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Oh, one thing i forgot:<br />
If you can't afford a rusty dagger then go and kill an Orc Pawn first.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">imo, the best 1hs for your level that you can buy, and it's cheap if you can find it (it came from old droga, no longer drops)...Whip of Strangulation....its only 6/24, but the proc is nice...20dd + 12hp/tick, agi/str debuff, starts procing at level 10.  I don't know of any other weapon that has any sort of a agro proc that procs so early.  At 16, you can also pick up an obsidian shard, 6/25 30dd + AC debuff.  I used this combo into my mid to upper 40s, and could hold agro easily over another warrior dual wielding short swords of the ykesha (and back then, the SSoY was all the hype).<br />
<br />
edit - see you are on morden rasp, which I believe went live after the droga revamp, so no whips will be on the server.  You could pick up a packmaster's lash, which has the same effect, but it is only 4/24.  I'm not sure if a 4/24 is effective or not, proc or no proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK thanks for the quick replies guys so I will try to get another one hander and dual wield asap.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the heads up on the delay helping skill ups.<br />
<br />
Apart from 1HS and 2HS would you also keep up 1HB or 2HB or Piercing or two or all three of these ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>arganax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can just slam to train up your bash and do all 3 at the same time...can't believe no one has said this yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">But I am a Gnome ??<br />
<br />
That means no slam right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yeah, no slam.....<br />
<br />
and try to keep up all weapon skills. don't kill yourself but to have max skill in all weapon types is a nice thing; especially later on down the road you turn level 50+ you get this gorgeous 2H blunt stick and have ZERO skill in it.../em whistles innocently</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'll suggest you forget shields and bash. With the new AAs for eliminating riposte to your offhand I think the days of shieldtanking are pretty much gone. Just hit that kick button every time it pops up. Get a solid bag of weapons with a 1hs, 1hb, piercing, 2hs, and 2hb and work all your skills as you can. Some will end up falling behind for a while and don't stess about them as you'll have plenty of time in your 50's to get them all caught up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Woot 14 now and wielding an ornate runed blade which was given to me.<br />
For Dual Wield I am using a Velium Mace for 1HB and a Zraxthril Forged Axe.<br />
<br />
I am thinking ...<br />
...I dropped a couple of points into DW, but next level I get Double attack, what I am thinking is would it be worth dropping a lot of points in here because the more double attacks I get the more skill checks I get for DW and 1HB and 1HS etc.<br />
<br />
Seems logical but is it right ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oh and one more thing .....<br />
<br />
I have nothing in my ear slots...<br />
<br />
thinking of taking in Qeynos Aqueducts for the 5hp alligator earing ??  Is this a good call or is there a very cheap or easy to get earing for a warrior.<br />
<br />
Remember lvl 14 main (ie no twinking going on here) think I got about 20pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aciphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">pick up a pair of orc fang earrings, should be right in your price range</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Drozan_RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Smoldering Brand 9/22 I think with 30 dd proc starting at lvl 1.  Not sure what they sell for on your server but just keep an eye out for one.  I wouldnt forget shields all together but I would focus on keeping all of the various weapon skill close to their max.  Down the road this offers you alot more weapon choices.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Heh thanks again guys....I getting to kinda like the steel warrior community, very helpful.<br />
<br />
I will keep my eyes peeled for the smouldering brand and the orc fang earings.<br />
<br />
I have 1HS and 2HS in the high 60's now DW and 1HB are in the 30's and I just trained up DA as I dinged 15 last night.<br />
<br />
As you may of guessed I am looking to be the best Warrior I can be in the game (for a Bertox Gnome) with no twinking etc.<br />
<br />
At the moment things are going pretty well but I am finding that if I group with someone say one level higher than me I have hell of a job getting/keeping agro.<br />
<br />
For example a Berzerker with snare and a shaman with slow - is this normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">welocme to the world of being a warrior...it never ends :D<br />
<br />
oh, and a good tip for looking for stuff in the bazaar, pick your class, than slot...than max price of what you want to spend. it keeps all the high end krap out of view and sometimes...sometimes...you can find someone unloading stuff really really cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, one thing you can do is to whack spiderlings and spiders, then sell the silk. In short order you should have enough plat to get stuff like centi swords/hammer/spear, sarnak battle hammer (30/40 --don't bother until you're level 20), and a bow with some good range on it. If a centi short sword (12/25) and warhammer (15/32) in offhand won't hold aggro at lvl 20 anymore, then, um...gack I'll feel really old. So if it doesn't work, for godsake don't say anything.<br />
Not sure if the level restriction applies to the Sword of Sky Fire, but if you can get the full 10/22 damage/delay out of it, it's a useful weapon primary weapon *until* it starts to proc (procs rain of fire, which is area of effect, heh, so tricky to use in some places).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you want a couple of piercers to keep Piercing skill up, then I would recommend a Shaded Dagger (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?level=14&amp;id=32155) / Crystalline Spider Fang (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?level=14&amp;id=25285) combo.<br />
<br />
I dunno what the prices are nowadays, but I think they'll be fairly cheap since one is Lore and the other drops a lot. They perform quite nicely and have no level caps as far as I remember. :)</div></div><hr />
