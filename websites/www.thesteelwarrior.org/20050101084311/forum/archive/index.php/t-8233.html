<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on the situation, this information you've given isn't specific enough to allow us to help you.<br />
<br />
Yes, sit will work in a pinch if the mob runs away to a caster and you just need to buy some time. However, since you don't attack while sitting, you can't build agro. Sit agro is completely temporary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sit is for moving mobs and just delete beg.Be closest,be first,use taunt and incite well.None of that will be enough if your gear sux tho.<br />
<br />
ps Doh, couldn't see a magelo when I posted this hehe.</div></div><hr />

I try to be the main tank, the go to guy, I prefer to have a more agile party member bring my prey to me.  I only have one item that procs, and Ive descided to do nothing but LDONs untill i get some decent augs that proc hate..What LDoNs do you reccomend.  Also, I have my macros tied in to kick and taunt..Would it be better to have it tied all into one key, or should i keep my kick seperate for when the mob tries to cast a spell?</div></div><hr />

Work on LDoN in EF and get some anger augments that will help tons. <br />

then pray you will get lvl fast to help you with better proc, more proc, more stats, ...<br />
in the meanwhile, nukers and doters have to learn to controle they aggro because they will allaws have better aggro than us, so if they don't want to die, they must learn to slow down and wait for you to built up more aggro.<br />
But if it's your healer that gets aggro then sure it's your fault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to take and hold aggro, you need to pay attention.  I know, it's not the most popular advice here but warriors do have the tools to hold excellent aggro if they choose to employ them.  This is mostly germane to trials and exp groups of course, in raids the aggro-lock becomes far more a function of equipment and strategy.<br />
<br />
Yes indeed, some of this is things like hate-proccing weapons, intelligently using taunt and bellow and such as well as simply having the stats and AAs to do the innate things even better.  A lot of it however is simply being attentive and proactive.  Tag on incoming, not after a pull is running around camp.  Save taunt for when it will help, don't just chain it meaninglessly.  Use your discs at appropriate times and know what to use when and precisely what effect they will have.  Hold position when aggro is fragile, proximity is not only useful for rooted mobs.  Have various weapons available and know what to use when and realise that short of the very high-end, there are often different aggro setups for different situations.  Also pay attention to when you are losing aggro and perhaps why.  If it is healer aggro because of your AC/HP that can be addressed differently than slower-aggro where perhaps it is over-aggressiveness on the slower's part.<br />
<br />
Most of all though, communicate with your groupmates about aggro if there are issues.  It is (generally) in the group's best interest to have you maintain aggro from start to finish, so let them know how best this can be accomplished.  Don't freak out though if someone occasionally takes aggro temporarily.  A good group should be floating on that edge anyways, not gimping itself to ensure 100% aggro-lock at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't combine kick and taunt under one macro. Only use taunt when you don't have agro (unless you're still building up the skill). And yes, get a Copper Hammer of Striking, usually for sale in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's nothing wrong with your gear.<br />
Levels 50+ can be a bit discouraging to warriors; you can easily be grouped with a ranger 5 levels higher than you are and who has basically your weapons and better haste. He'll have aggro if he wants it, and he may be still learning that he doesn't want it. You are well enough geared that it is likely that your healer will want you to have aggro, though it's also (somewhat sadly) true that in some cases where you are plowing through mobs fast and healing manna is not an issue, it actually doesn't matter which melee gets hit unless things suddenly start to go badly.<br />
As Yoda says, try to hit the mob as early as possible on incoming. I'm an advocate of warriors pulling in situations where singles can be had or one or two adds can be contained by crowd control, because if you do the first melee damage to a mob, you have a big jump on aggro.<br />
At level 50 you might find that sometimes you have to remind (teach with tact) some players that provoke on a mezzed mob generates a graphic response on the part of the mob (looks like the mob got hit). That doesn't necessarily mean you are calling for assist, however. Ask folks to wait for your /g assist message on mez breaks.</div></div><hr />

I should have been working it much earlier.. I did my first ldon last night  in EF and it was a nightmare.  Lots of blind corners and mobs seemed to come in waves of two or three..Our group was myself lvl 50 fighter, a 51 Cleric, two 50 necros and a SK 51 who seemed to be out of her mind.  She wanted to do the pulling but at her level either she had crappy hp or AC and the healer was like..screw this, Warrior, you pull..That and in the middle of melee she kept trying to loot..What a nightmare... Ive heard that the best hate augs drop there and thats about the only reason I could see going back there..<br />
     I usually pull but shooting with my bow, my archery sucks but it seems to get the job done..Then when the mob gets close I go spastic on him and start whomping the mess out of him..not much finease but it seems to work..I only use the provoke if the mob turns away from me..

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You erm, really keep that shield in all the time or it it just for magelo padding?  If you are swapping it in, ignore the remander.  <br />
<br />
Still, I've had a few of my regular tanks (I am a Rogue) try out Furious Bash shields at various points in their careers and all I can say is I despise them.  I don't care about the description, they simply do not provide value in getting aggro or keeping it.  While I can pretty much flat out only evading when it cycles on a tank DWing any reasonable aggro weapons (or using BoW or better two-handers) I simply found I had to lay off entirely at the start of fights and slowers were getting early aggro far too consistantly whenever my tanks tried to play with them.  Sure, I could imagine uses for them but KT certainly is not the place for them in my opinion.  Perhaps tanks that like them can shed some light but this rogue hates them entirely.<br />
<br />
As to exping in KT, it will depend on your role there.  Learn what assists what and learn what pops pets and such.  Additionally, some mobs are undercons and some overcons.  Nameds are all pretty nasty but are doable in most well-designed groups.  If aggro is bouncing a fair bit though, it may well depend on who it is bouncing to and when.  Mostly though, KT is short fights against targets that you want debuffed fast. An augged BoC is wonderful long-term aggro but will need a lot of attention to maintain aggro pre-proc.</div></div><hr />

Ok, I smell thread derailment.  :P<br />
<br />
I can't give much advice since I haven't been to KT yet (not been past sewers), I have read this info elsewhere:<br />
Furious Bash has p*** poor agro, use it only in the same situation you'd use a shield w/o Furious Bash.<br />
<br />
It seems there are at least a few people that are of the mind that a good two hander is better for the higher end content in terms of not getting killed from riposte damage (assuming that is your reason for not using a DW setup).<br />
<br />
Lastly, has your normal group changed?  Is someone slowing too soon, is someone missing SCS3, assisting too soon in melee?  On (non open) raids, everyone usually knows they a) don't want agro and b) need to wait for assist.<br />
<br />
I don't have Bellow, but if you suspect it, try using incite for a night and compare your results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eww what warrior would ever use a shield as opposed to 2 good 1handers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm.<br />
<br />
Disarm will put you on the hate list if you are not already there. But whatever hate it generates is completely trivial. It's not an aggro tool, as far as I know. The only time I use it is when I'm farming and want to amuse myself. Or when I'm in a pick-up group with someone who is ninja looting. Then at least I get the weapon if the ninja looter doesn't notice the disarm, heh.<br />
<br />
And, uh, yes, concerning aggro. Bash, slam, kick, melee, incite line and procs are all additive. That is, they add to whatever hate you have built up, regardless of what anyone else has done. In theory, if you were far enough behind in aggro, you could bash, do rounds of melee, incite and all of your weapons could proc and you still wouldn't have aggro if someone else had generated more aggro that that already.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, you successfully taunt, you will have aggro--you'll jump to the top of the aggro list plus some small amount. If you successfully taunt and then do all those other things (bash, melee, incite, proc) immediately before anyone else does anything, you have aggro from the taunt *plus* the hate all the other things generate.<br />
<br />
Thus, if you are in mid fight and taunt and the incite line have both refreshed, and you lose aggro, you are better off hitting taunt first, then immediately hitting the incite line. <br />
<br />
However, if a bard is pulling a mob into camp, you may find that you can draw aggro by shooting the mob with an arrow. If the mob comes to you, save taunt, but go ahead and use incite to get an early jump in hate on everyone else.<br />
<br />
There may be an argument for holding back on incite in that situation to see if the slower is going to yank the mob off of you onto himself, but someone else will have to make that argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah that stuff is fluid not a rule in stone.Just understand your tools and use them in a common sense fashion situationally.<br />
<br />
Warriors can hold aggro on raids only so long as people let them.Time wars running lots of effects and great weapons can better affor the loss of an offhander depending on the situation and raidforce.I'm not there yet so /shrug.<br />
<br />
When an ep warrior uses a shield he lowers his aggro considerably,but, often it may be enough depending on his raid/groups hate production.If you doubt your aggro in a given situation park the shield in your bags.I'd never use one ma'n up to this point personally.</div></div><hr />

I do use the shield as it helps it seems with dmg i take with that added AC it gives. Also it may be the fact that in KT, you really don't have time not to slow asap and heal asap. Usually only losing aggro to a Shaman slow and even sometimes a Rogue. Pouring that DPS on to begin i guess before taunt is successful. Thanks for all the info as well.<br />

<br />
Yes the Highend GoD zones have horrible agro problems , mobs keep harder agro on the puller spells seemingly have different agro numbers  and they hate healers more than normal hehe .. also on some of the named our defensive type discs including furious acts as a memblur so should look more into the names of those that last part apply to<br />
<br />
<br />
 I would suggest putting disarm into your line of agro work <br />
<br />
 and yes high end GoD zones its just murderous using duel wield with less than 2000ac 12k hp  I have 10.2 and 1900 and have to use my BoW or I get scared that my clerics gonna go on strike heheh<br />

<br />
why is this? provoke adds a certain amount of hate per tick as well as the initial dose of hate. so the sooner you use it the more agro you generate during the fight. you cant have too much agro. the more you have the more aggressive the rest of your group can be.<br />
<br />
now many casters i think actually want agro. they double dot and then when they get agro they run circles around me (kind of like a fly) which is how i know they are trying to prevent me from taunting off them. there is no cure for this. you can instruct them not to do this but they will give you some excuse about how &quot;they are trying to root the mob&quot; or some other cryptic response. some of the best players ive had the pleasure to group with still would torment me with this one behaviour.</div></div><hr />

/taunt (if it's up)<br />
/disc incite line (if it's up)<br />
/slam or kick<br />

Heya Yethuy!!<br />
<br />
I now also use BoW. Seems to work great, just had been using 1 weapon and that shiled because of ripostes from mobs in GOD. Those mobs come in hasted, well some do in KT. I believe i am going to get some of those crystalizzed items...the ones that annul magic to use on pulling. That won't be so bad than. Now that i am using the BoW, I do reduce my AC but aggro seems to be doing a tad better than the combo i had before. I stopped spam hitting taunt and only use it if mob wants to thuink about running. And hopefully it is a success, if not, to save the grp I hit AEtaunt to make sure no deaths. It will refresh soon enough. I am working on Ikinzz trials atm and aggro in there does seem to be working better in there than in KT. /odd<br />

One thing that was mentioned only in passing that I'd like to draw some more attention to is proximity aggro -- staying right on top of the mob can have a signifcant effect of aggro control, particularly in the low-end game (30's - 50's or so) -- I've found  that this can be the &quot;easy fix&quot; to a lot of situations where ping-ponging has been a problem.  Not always, but often enough (and it's easy enough) to be worth considering.</div></div><hr />

Incite or watever hate disc your using adds raw hate so think of it as on demand added aggo.Use it according to your needs to boost your hate generation as your endurance will allow.If you have good aggro weapons the hate from the disc is small relatively and has it's most useful effect early in a fight or any time after you have to taunt.Use it as you will ,just remember if you taunt after expending endurance on incite you've trumped yourself.<br />

Use taunt to regain aggro after having lost it.This  means you were not generating enough hate and had to piggyback on someone else's to get back on top.Your lead in this case would be small so it can be a good time to use incite/bellow/provoke for a headstart in the hate race.So only use taunt when you lose aggro.If say a chanter tashes on incoming then I automatically wack taunt then incite as I engage.Hitting it once in awhile while your aggro is good just locks out taunt for when you might need it.</div></div><hr />

When the Mob turns from you however is when incite alone can be a waste more often than not as it won't be enough by itself to pull aggro back.  After a good taunt though its generally enough to hold aggro till some more procs kick in.</div></div><hr />
