Thats what I hope happens. Also I had a great idea I posted on the Safehouse forums.... What if the server could be chronological? Start the server with old wolrd (keep luclin graphics, cart map, bank slots, etc) and then after 3 to 6 months introduce Kunark, then 3 to 6 months Velious and so on. That would be a great way to bring new life to Mistmoore, Sol A, Guk, Karanas... all those wonderful zones that seem to be ghost towns now adays =(. What do you think?</div></div><hr />

They try and monkey with adding content over time, and something will break, people will go back to old servers, and never look back.  Just to have the no transfers (hopefully ever) is enough for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things wrong with that idea Venox:<br />
1. The new races, (Iksar, Vah Shir, and Froglok) wouldn't all be playable for quite a long time<br />
2. By the time the server reaches the current state of EQ, EQ2 would be out and the smaller population of people that still play EQ would likely play on the regular servers.<br />
Interesting idea though.</div></div><hr />
