I currently plan on doing the Bracer of Benevolence and the Draconic Pauldrons a upgrades to my current gear.  Does anyone else know about any good quested items that would be nice upgrades to what I currently wear, waiting in line for Chestplate of Vindication and hoping from some HoT drops also.  Any ideas would be appreciated as I have never cared to do quest until here recently, so I haven't read into that many.</div></div><hr />

You can see the result of the 9th quest in my profile.  Most of the quests can be done with 2 people, you and some sort of healer.  I did rings 1-8 in a weekend and 9th took me a week or so off and on.  If you don't want to involve a lot of people, go to Kael and politely ask a guild doing platehouse cycle if you can help kill mobs in return for the dwarf head needed from there.  Most people could use another tank that doesn't want armor from there and most times the head rots.</div></div><hr />

You simply start the cycle and have a druid/wiz evac you out of there.  It does screw up the cycle though from being used for 2-3 hours though as I understand it.<br />
<br />
I did it this way and had a cleric and wizard to get me out.  I did ask in OOC though if anyone was planning on doing the cycle soon and no one was.</div></div><hr />
