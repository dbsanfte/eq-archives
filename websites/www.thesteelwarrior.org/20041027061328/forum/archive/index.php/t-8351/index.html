<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">my guild did dust ring this weekend but had some questions on if what happened to us was normal. we cleared the island and kited the minis while pulling down and disposing of the archwalkers/spawn and when sigismond became active the mini spiders depopped. so we pulled sigismond and all our kiters back down to the junction and started killing him when boom, here are the little spiders again. we had a decent sized turnout (we were anticipating a Fro spawn) so we barely pulled through, but i was curious if the mini spiders always despawn and come back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Been a long time since i've done the Dust ring, but iirc we used to setup enchanters to chain AE mez them (the little spiders) then pull small loads of mobs and kill them off.   Best I remember the lil spiders stayed mez locked until after Sigis was dead.  Once you kill Dust a few times and complete your Xegony key... stay away, very far away.<br />

PoAir + Spiders = Death!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tamov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">mini spiders are not supposed to despawn until sigismond is dead. if they depop before so, they are in the process of resetting and will reaggro raid once they repop. Be ready for them, they tend to reset for a few times if your guild finish the archwalker script in more than 30 minutes... One of the rogues told me you have to reaggro the spiders when kiting to keep them from resetting, I have no clue what he was talking about tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make sure peoples damage shields are clicked off or the spiders will summon the kiters, and once the kiters die they'll rush people with low life aggro who are killing the pulls, which will probably result in a wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The last time we did it, the little babies came while siggy was getting his ass beat.  Just have chanters CC them, or tank them if you have the resources too.  They're not too horrible, just inconvient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not bieng able to see my screen for the vomit spewed forth on it is more then inconvient if you ask me =p</div></div><hr />
