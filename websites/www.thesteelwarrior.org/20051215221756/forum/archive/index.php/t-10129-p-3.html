<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a level 45 Warrior in WOW currently.  And while much of what other people have said is true, I find that as a Warrior it is not as true for my character.<br />
<br />
1.  Soloing is doable, but fraught with difficulties.  Warriors miss enough that occassionally an even con will kick the crap out of me when normally I would own it.  While some classes can easily solo mobs that are two or three levels higher, as a Warrior I'm very much limited to no more than two levels higher and then with a fair amount of risk.  If I should get an add, usually I'm toast unless I have retaliation available and that's on a 30 minute timer.  And casters are a serious problem.  Shamans and Warlocks can put a serious hurt on me even when a level or two lower.<br />
<br />
All melees suffer from the miss rate problem when dual wielding, as a warrior go 2h its just plain better.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  For the mount that a poster above was ranting about, I'll have to scrape together something like 100g, so I've been told.  And at 45 the most I've seen at one time is about 25g.  The constant need for gear upgrades and money spent on smithing means that getting that kind of gold together isn't going to happen for a level or two.  Meanwhile, unlike Paladins who basically just talk to an NPC at 40 to receive a mount or Warlocks who have a fairly easy quest to get a mount, I'm walking.   Which means just traveling from one place to another takes a pretty long time, particularly as places to hunt get further and further apart.<br />
<br />
Don't spend so much money on professions, etc.  Honestly there's no need!  I broke 100g at level 33 or 34 *solely* from skinning and selling everything I skinned.  After you hit 40 and get a mount its fast and easy to gather enough mats to skill up a real profession so don't bother with smithing until after you have your mount.  Also don't spend lots of cash on items, be a bit frugal and its easy to get the 100g.<br />
<br />
<br />
4.  I can't fight elites solo.  <br />
<br />
You're not supposed to. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was talking about instances, I was refering to the lower lvl ones. If you are lvl 40+, doing the Stockages should yield some pretty fast returns. You could solo thru there in no time, get out of the instance, sell your warez, then run back in (you have to reset it though). SM is a bit higher than normal and takes a little more time to clear. Were going for cash here, not exp. <br />
<br />
I did that to SFK a few levels ago and just wasn't bringing home a whole lot of cash out of it.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if everything on the alliance side sells for a gold and a half tho :p</div></div><hr />

You're not supposed to. :)<br />
<br />
Well mabye you're not supposed to, but given the right talents you can solo elite casters.  At 43 I could solo the lvl43-44 elite troll casters in Tanaris.  I run a defensive talent build (http://wowvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Templates.Detail&amp;id=9979) most importantly with 40% Stun Revenge and Concussion Blow.  I start with charge and use the rage to shield bash the first cast, then I dump any extra I have and switch to defensive, I use Concussion blow to stun away the first cast I can't Shield Bash away, then using Revenge as much as possible sometimes forcing it with a Shield Block if I'm having a bad run, with all that I mabye take 2-3 nukes max and finish the fight with anywhere from half health to almost dead, but its doable.<br />
<br />
Don't spend so much money on professions, etc. Honestly there's no need!<br />
<br />
I agree wholeheartedly, the only money I've spent on smithing is one or two dropped plans I really wanted and a few pearls for armor/weapons I was making for myself.<br />
<br />
Any hints on where to get mithril, truesilver, or thorium? I doubt any of us are on the same server so we shouldn't really run into eachother.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there are probably lots of people that read here but don't post, I already have enough competiton in my regular spots as it is, if they become common knowledge it'll just get worse.  I WILL say that the best way to find these is to look for out of the way places even in regularly populated zones, especially areas that are rocky/craggy, this generally doesn't include caves since those are usually well known.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So for a few questions of my own, what level and where are SFK and Wailing Caverns?  and does anyone know how tearing through these lower level instances compares to killing humanoids a little lower level than you in open areas such as Tanaris?</div></div><hr />

Shadow Fang Keep is in Silver Pine Forest, far west side.  It's level 22-28 elites<br />
Wailing Caverns is in Barrens, really pretty place near the Oasis. Same level as SFK.<br />
<br />
Reason I like instances &gt; &quot;killing humanoids a little lower level than you in open areas such as Tanaris&quot; is no other people.  Jump out of instance, re do it, go at it again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We tried this shit out this morning, and we disagree.<br />
<br />
Shaman netted 2g with a full inventory out of WC.  I did SFK and netted 2.5g.  Took me about an hour to plow thru SFK and fill up my inventory.  Some simple math on the 70g I need for my horse = 28 hours of farming.  No fuckin thanks.<br />
<br />
In an hour and a half in Arathi I made almost half a level and gained 1.9g.  I'm not seeing how it can pay to farm low level instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-01-2005, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally broke down and bought WoW. I'm reminded how much I hate low level characters. Good news is that I can't decided what I like to play more. I'm mostly jumping around checking different servers and class/race combos until I get something that I like. Current lead character is a Human rogue. I've rolled a hunter and warrior as well. Warriors are fucking awesome at low levels, you almost have to try be trying to die. Hunter hasn't changed much since beta. I never played a rogue in any game before, but the stealth really fits my exploration style, although at times I do find myslef fighting my way in  somewhere when I could just be stealthed. Old habits dye hard I guess.<br />
<br />
I started with a druid in EQ and a warlock in wow, and mostly caster types in other games, but I don't like being so frail, so i don't think I'll go that dirrection. but really it comes down to soloing, Are rogues still the solo machines they were in beta? Its seems like every level that my rogue makes his dps gets better and better. At 10, most mobs even 2 or 3 levels above, don't last more than a few seconds.<br />
<br />
So what, in your guys opinions, is the best soloing classes. I know hunters can solo, but I don't think Bow dps, even with the pet, keeps up to rogues at higher levels. At least that was my impression from beta.<br />
<br />
Any good servers I should check out. I'm not big into PvP, but I'm willing to try most anything once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotten my Warrior in WoW to level 44 now.  Despite the issues folks have with the class I'm having a blast.  The nature of the game hasn't really changed as I level, although of course you do start to encounter harder mobs, different boss fights in instances that require different strategies etc.   There are still great quests, some I can do solo, some I can't.  Tradeskills are fun as you can actually make stuff you'll use!  I can solo easily, although Warriors are not the best soloers we do really well imo.  Dunno.  Not having any of the issues getting up in levels in WoW as you seem to be detailing out in EQ2.  That being said there's still a TON for me to see, and a lot of the battelgrounds and high end raid content has not been put in the game yet.  So only the future will tell, but at least from 1-44 its been a great game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After being a bluebie EQ player since last century and getting beaten in duels by every other class, it just took me 5 minutes reading the manual to decide that I want to play a warrior on a PvP server. Unlike the hell holes that were the EQ PvP servers, WoW PvP is very amazing and tons more interesting than EQ PvE could ever be. I can go on saying how exciting WoW is, but I'll summarize a few things I like about the game.<br />
<br />
Btw, my warrior is a level 33 on Crushridge server, Tradeskill = alchemy, herbalism. Secondary skills = Cooking, First Aid.<br />
<br />
Things I like about this game.<br />
<br />
- No &quot;Loading please wait&quot; screens (YAY!) .. I can traverse the whole world without having to see that again and again and again.<br />
<br />
- The phat lootz! I have never really grouped for exp grinds or quests (except for elite quests) and I have managed to acquire a rare 2hander and other single weapons, three rare armor pieces etc. Really, I say good riddance to the 8 hour long raids and all the DKP hording bs. I have savings worth 20 gold right now, and i think thats quite good for a level 33 warrior who has been constantly upgrading and learning skills from trainers.<br />
<br />
- No mob/rare spawn/named camping. You can get uncommon (green) and rare (blue) items from what we called 'trash' in EQ. It seems to be random.<br />
<br />
- The ability to solo creatures that are two levels higher than me. And elite creatures that are green. I almost soloed one of the elite quests in stockades when I found a group and did all stockade quests with them. I have soloed almost all the way to lvl 33 except some occasional groups with friends, and beaten many a horde players in alone or grouped scenarios.<br />
<br />
- Tradeskills are actually useful. The breastplate i'm wearing is rare and was made by a player blacksmith. I can make heal potions and +armor +stats potions that are useful. I make good money selling greater heal potions and elixirs of defense.<br />
<br />
- Health regen is very useful so far. My gear gives me lots of +Spirit (like 75) and I regen in a few seconds, just enough to get ready for the next kill. I rarely use food/bandages.<br />
<br />
- Tradeskill and quest items are easy to acquire. If you have group mates and they are doing the same quest everyone gets the quest item drop independantly, you dont have to wait.<br />
<br />
- Quests are fun and good xp. The best way to level and acquire actually useful rewards. Unlike EQ where you have to wait months for a quest, gather raids, spend days camping the rare spawn, or like the belt of the four winds quest that almost all of us could never complete. I have soloed every single quest uptil now except elite quests.<br />
<br />
- No need for CR's or other players to rez you, every zone has a GY where your ghost will spawn. You run back to your corpse and click 'Resurrect' .. lol. No exp/gold penalty. Infact you get exp bonus everytime you spemnd time logged off from the game.<br />
<br />
- No more exp grinding or mindless hacking at creatures for hours. You can play when you want and as much as you want without having to spend hours putting a group together and all that bs.<br />
<br />
- The sound effects are cool, the music. In EQ I always had music off and had mp3's running. When I'm in Duskwood I don't wana miss the spooky ambient environment. ;)<br />
<br />
- The graphics are great and the game runs smooth on my 2 year old computer and a 56k connection. My guild tabard is amazing. :)<br />
<br />
- PvP is actually good. No penalties for dying, no one can grief / corpse camp you since your ghost can just come hide somewhere near and click rez from afar, or alternatively, you can take a rez at the GY. If you're deep in enemy territory you can take rez and gate out. Your opposing side cant send you tells, cant say anything bad to you because what they say appears in a different language. You can however, learn each others languages by knowing what those words mean, if you're that crazy. I just yell 'kek' when i kill in pvp, kek = lol in orcish.<br />
<br />
- The combat system is good. Use of abilities like overpower, execute, retaliate, battle shouts, heroic strike, its cool. You can get a lot more improvement from just talents than all the AA's from all EQ expansions combined. I like the range of choices in everything.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to put it short, everything we disliked in EQ is non-existent in WoW. I haven't played EQ2 and a friend bought it, but me and everyone else who used to play EQ refused to buy EQ2, due to our experience with EQ1. And after reading the original poster's comments, it makes me sure I made the right choice afterall.<br />
<br />
There is currently only 1 problem with WoW though, and its very irritating. That is the Blizzard Downloader that will run for the whole night just to download 20 mb worth of patch data, because it used peer to peer and i think its seriously broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In an hour and a half in Arathi I made almost half a level and gained 1.9g.  I'm not seeing how it can pay to farm low level instances.<br />
<br />
AH the items instead of vendoring them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AH the items instead of vendoring them. <br />
<br />
It hasn't netted good results for me.<br />
<br />
The only things that I personally would consider using out of an instance are bind on pickup.  The rest of just is seriously..just fuckin trash.  On top of that, I've had absolute piss poor luck getting any results out of the auction house, and I just end up losing deposits.  Clearly it's not because the price is too high, because people tell you what they want to pay and you sell it to them.<br />
<br />
The auction system in my opinion is a piss poor excuse for the bazaar in EQ.  It requires a lot less lag, and doesn't require you to be online, but the results and the cost to do so, are far inferior.<br />
<br />
Edit : Just logged in and the 30.2 dps 2h I found yesterday was happily returned to me in my mailbox.  I think I'm 1 for 8 now on AH shit.  Fuck that game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The AH is difficult to judge regarding what will and won't sell.  Basically it takes some knowledge of what's pretty commonly available at that level range and what is somewhat hard to acquire or better than average.  If it's common, it's vendor trash for sure.  If I check the AH and there are already half a dozen of them on sale, typically it's not worth my time.  If it's hard to acquire it might be worth trying to AH it, once.  Only if it's a blue or purple item are you almost certain to have a sale.<br />
<br />
And as you go up there will be more of a market, because people aren't leveling as fast and therefore they're changing gear within their range more frequently.  If I'm going to go from level 20 to 25 in two or three days, I'm not likely to worry too much about upgrading my gear a lot in that time frame.  I might make a change at level 20 and then another at level 25, but not much in between.  If I'm going from 50 to 51 in that same time period, I'll start paying more attention to my gear.  I think most people are like that.<br />
<br />
Also people need to put buy out prices on their items.  In 8 hours a lot can happen.  And I don't know about you, but I'm not particularly inclinded to want to camp the AH waiting to out bid any of my competition.  Nor am I inclinded to want to have to interrupt what other things I may be doing to pop over to the AH and up my bids.  Many times if there is a buy out price and the current bid isn't too much under that, I'll just pay the buy out price, because it saves me time and annoyance.  People who expect to just have bid prices are probably in for a rude shock, not everyone is interested in bidding.<br />
<br />
However, overall I agree with Haass, the AH can be a huge money sink with very little return, if you're not very careful about what you bother to try selling.  I made that mistake early on and learned from it.  Either vendor the trash or give it to a guild enchanter for disenchanting, you're better off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used the AH the first time for the elemental (whatever) I've piled up from killing elementals.  I set the price at the default and the buyout at either 2 or 3X the default prize.  Managed to sell 2 elemental earth, and the 19 elemental water and 7 elemental air were no go.  Though one nice thing is that I can now store the extra stuff in my mailbox from a failed auction for 30 days.<br />
<br />
Obviously one example don't prove anything but I don't really see AH as a useful way to unload what you got.  I seriously doubt you'll be able to make much, if any, out of some generic X's whatever of the Y.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you put something up in the AH ask yourself, if I were such and such level how much would I likely spend on this item?<br />
<br />
I usually only sell about 1 in 3 items I put up for sale.  The things that don't sell I just eat the deposit and vendor.  However, the money I make by reselling that one in three items easily offsets the deposit lost on the items that don't sell.  Yesterday I sold a level 30ish green 2H sword for about 1.5g, would have sold to a vendor for maybe 60s.  Blue stuff goes for bucks in the AH.  I sold a blue 2H level 30 hammer for 3g.<br />
<br />
Oh, and be sure to search on the item you are selling first.  If there are any like it, set your minimum bid below the other item.  Also don't set your buyout so high, make it about 50-75% over your minimum bid or higher if it's a blue item.  Don't expect to make a lot on green items...  but you can sell at a higher price than you'd get from a vendor.</div></div><hr />
