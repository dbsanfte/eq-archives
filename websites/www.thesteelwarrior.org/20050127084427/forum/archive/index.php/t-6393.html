<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akuros</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, so I have had this weapon banked for a long arse time.  I picked it up back when ToV raids were actual common place heh.  Anyways, I had it banked in place of the BoC my guild gave me, and used a CHoS for offhand.  <br />
<br />
Recently my guild merged with another guild that I don't really like too much so we parted ways and I gave the BoC back since it wasn't by right mine.  Anyways, I'm wondering if I should shell out the cash for a SoBS for aggro, or just aug the katana with an anger proc.  I would appreciate any advice.  Not sure if the proc and stats on the katana are worth taking it outta the bank and putting it to use again.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was the BoC simply given to you from the guildbank or were you actually present for the AoW kill?  In the first case I can understand you giving it back, I would as well.  But if you were present for the kill and awarded the gear then its yours and you shouldn't give it back just cause it happens to be droppable instead of ND.<br />
<br />
As for the Katana, the ratio isn't bad, but 80DD proc isn't really anything in the way of agro.  I wouldn't waste 1150AP on it, wait for something worthy of an Anger3 aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What kinda raiding do you do?<br />
<br />
Only because if you're at the BoT level go hit up the towers for a Greatblade of Storms....reeeeal nice aggro weapon and a step above the sotB/CHoS level.....and/or hit up Xanamech in PoI for a Cord Hilted Spike Driver.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the guilds rules on droppables wiether he should have returned it or not.  My last guilds rule was every droppable was guild material to be returned when upgraded or whenever you decided to leave.  His guild might have had a similar system in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akuros</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually heh, I came into the guild while they were doing VT/PoP content and they had already moved past AoW.  They let me use a &quot;banked guild BoC&quot; that they had.  When we parted ways I felt it best to give it back since it wasn't mine...i'd rather lose aggro than lose face heh =)<br />
<br />
One thing I wondered was if I should pop an Anger II aug on the katana and offhand the CHoS or just pop and Anger II on the CHoS and then offhand a SoBS.  I haven't really done LDoN a whole lot so I only have about 700 points atm so I am like 25 or 30 runs from an Anger III aug.  I kind of enjoy DW, although I did pick up a GSoT for like 300pp in the bazaar the other day...would throwing the Anger II on that be best or stick with DW?<br />
<br />
Not many people really have the katana cuz I think they removed it from the game, but not sure lol, I havent done ToV in like over a year /shrug.  Anyways, thanks again for all the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">unguilded; most definately buy a GSoT and augment it with Anger. Cheap fix and good for most if not all of your aggro needs.<br />
<br />
and yeah; the katana is bye-bye. they were nice in it's day and a nice bragging piece but it'll look nice hanging over the fireplace now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I had a Jaelen's Katana I would put anger III in it and use it just for the old-school points it would get you hehe.  In your case though it doesn't sound like you were running the account when they got the katana so it's most likely just another weapon, but with anger III in it you would have a solid weapon for aggro, dps, and stats.<br />
<br />
(Apologies if you actually got the weapon yourself, but from your post it doesn't sound like you did.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akuros</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I was the one running the account when I picked it up.  The problem I always had was bagging a sweet looking nice stat weapon simply because it blew for aggro.  Lifetaps generate little to no aggro and the proc rate on it is a bit lower than I would have wanted...however its prolly one of my favorite looking weapons in the game /shrug.<br />
<br />
Anyways, like I said I bagged it after I got the BoC, but if throwing anger on it would make it a decent aggro weapon, I would consider using it.  I havent really done a whole lot with LDoN really so I can't say that I know how well anger augs really affect aggro (i.e. I don't know their proc rates etc /shrug.)  Was just lookin for a little advice from some old schoolers who have used it more than I and know ldon better than myself.<br />

Use it mainhand when you are ST with an aggro weapon in the offhand so that you do some dps and aren't too far behind in aggro if you have to take over MT position.<br />
<br />
GSoT w/ AngerX is good solid aggro, I have one myself. You can easily get the Droga combo to last you until CHoS/GBoS/BoC etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodheart</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woo, not sure how I missed this thread.<br />
<br />
I've got a Jaelen's which I pair off with a Bloodfrenzy for normal exp groups. The resists and lifetap are a nice addition. It's a damn fine weapon, and while not an &quot;aggro&quot; weapon per se, it's versatile to some point. If you really wanted to throw an anger aug on it, I'm sure it wouldn't dissapoint you too much.</div></div><hr />
