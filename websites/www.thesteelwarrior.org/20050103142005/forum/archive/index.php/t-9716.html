i'm not sure if this has been noted, i'm pretty sure i've never seen it mentioned but this past week i've spent a good amount of time in dranik's scar working my loyalist faction against nocs, kyvs and ukans. most people i'm sure have noticed the chaos claws proc these guys dish out and as we all know (or should if you've been keeping up with the info here) that mobs need to land a hit in order for their innate procs to land. <br />
<br />
now after running around for hours and hours i've started to notice that i never get hit with chaos claws while rune is up. my elf shoe procs rune3 which negates 230 damage. against green mobs it actually lasts several rounds, not too suprising with all the AAs the mobs usually land minimal damage. usually with my elf shoe in primary and a lucky streak of procs i can keep rune up almost the entire fight. however the fights where i dont have rune up or i just get unlucky with procs is when chaos claws is sure to proc. <br />
<br />
unfortunatly i dont have a phrase of this...and even if i did it's close to impossible to prove soemthing *didnt* happen when it could of. i was wondering if anyone else has noticed this or if anyone knows the answer off the bat. what i assume is happening is the rune is negating the melee damage showing a miss and EQ is reading those swings as misses even tho they actaully did hit me.</div></div><hr />
