<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Weapon has a proc<br />
You add a proc augment <br />
You have a proc spell on you (like call of sky, or instrument of nife, or whatever).<br />
<br />
Are all those proc rates 100% independent, or does proccing one reset or mess with the timers for the others?<br />
<br />
I know this has been talked about, but I have never seen an analysis of actual logs or anything.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any insight.</div></div><hr />

Close, but not exactly.  If a weapon has both a main proc and an augment proc, the augment proc only goes off if the main proc fails to go off.  In other words, when you swing, the game checks to see if the main proc goes off first, then if the main proc doesn't it checks to see if the augment proc goes off.<br />
<br />
So if a weapon has both a main and an augment proc, the main goes off slightly more than the augment.  Because the chance to proc per swing is fairly small, the difference isn't too great.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a hypothetical example, let's say each proc has a base chance of 1/20 to go off per swing.  Then:<br />
<br />
- every time you swing, there is a 1/20 chance to get the main proc.<br />
<br />
- Every time you swing, IF the main proc fails there is a 1/20 chance for the augment proc to work.  Therefore the chance for the augment proc to work would be 19/20 * 1/20, which is just barely less than 1/20.<br />
<br />
<br />
So mathematically they're not independent.  The difference is so slight, though, that for practical purposes they may as well be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Irregardless, the point is moot if you have an augment...get one, love it...  The yak augment I added has made my week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two procs in one timestamp isnt inconceivable though is it?  Dual wield plus ambidexterity, ferocity, and flurry...thats what, 7 swings in one round?  5 swings with primary?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen several logs where the augment went off more than the primary proc. So I'm unsure of the truth behind only going off on a fail.<br />
<br />
It makes sense.  Procs fail constantly the majority of your swings.  They roll to see if they go off every swing.  That leaves a lot of rolls for the auged proc.<br />
<br />
If you swing 20 times and never proc, the original proc rolled it's dice 20 times to see if it went off.  The aug proc also rolled it's dice 20 times to see if it went off.  If the original proc wins 1 roll out of those 20, that still leaves 19 rolls for the auged proc to try and win.  It could very well win 3 of the 19, making it proc 2 more times than the original did during those 20 attacks.  Random roll of the dice.<br />
<br />
If the original proc goes off 3 times out of the 20 cleaves, that still leaves 17 chances for the auged proc to win it's roll.<br />
<br />
Think of them as completely independant, with the added rule that if the original already went off that swing the auged proc won't even throw it's dice.  They can both go off any swing if they win their roll, only they both can't occupy the same space at the same time.  And the original proc takes precidence over the auged one as to which one gets to go off that swing.  It's the default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe ya guess that's true.  <br />
<br />
I Guess the only thing that matters really is that from the parses Augments proc very very close to the same amount that your weapons normal proc procs (except for the odd weapons like bloodfrenzy and the cleric hammers), and that your weapon's normal proc doesn't decrease by adding an augment to it.  <br />
<br />
In other words augments are purely an addition to your weapon and a fairly nice one at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So by this logic, weapons with lower innate proc rates ( like BoC ) benefit more from adding a stun or hate proc than one which proc more frequently ( BF ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure it works like you're describing it though Alisdahre, the reason is that proc rate doesn't change with the amount of swings.  <br />
<br />
Now unless they put some complicated code in there (which would contradictory to making an efficient game, but possible I suppose) to change the proc rate with haste or weapon delay you would have an increased proc rate with an increased swing rate (haste).  Which I've seen alot of parses that confirm that haste does not affect proc rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Korinn's point is a good one, the cleric hammer test should of had a much lower rate of procs from the augment, and I'm pretty sure it was also 2 a minute like all the other parses.</div></div><hr />

I ran a 20 minute parse today with my zek hammer. 200 dex, no yaulping or anything. Not a single 'Your target is too far away!' or 'You cannot see your target.' (tho there were 3-4 self heals). This was against the kromrif recruiter in kael. (banker in katta is way too spammy for me) <br />
<br />
20 mins 200 dex: 196 procs of Hand of the Gods <br />
<br />
I added a cheap (20 point blast of frost) proc augment to my zek hammer and went back to do another 20 minutes. <br />
<br />
20 mins 200 dex: 203 procs of Hand of the Gods, 19 procs of Blast of Frost <br />
<br />
The sample size is really small. Probably a few more runs would give a more reliable result. The frequency of the proc is amazingly low when you're used to hand of the gods hehe<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be interesting if someone would do an 8 hour test (like some of the other parses) on the Katta banker with this to see if this trend continues.<br />
<br />
So possibly the double proc thing on the same time stamp was a fluke caused by a double attack or riposte or something of that nature.   <br />
<br />
Although it looks like to me that the procs are independent of each other for the most part, there may be something keeping the innate proc and the augment proc from happening the same round.  I wonder if the other procs you can add (call of sky and I believe some bard thing also) also make this check, or if this is limited to augments.<br />
<br />
Anyhow for most &quot;normal&quot; weapons the proc rate of the weapon is so low that conflicts tend to not happen very often.  And still only happen it seems twice as much for a weapon with a 5x proc rate.  Assuming a longer parse of that data would return the same info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course the proc rate might be lower because of the lower dex of the cleric also, most of the 2 per minute are done with maxed dex (ie 280-305)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gryzx, I'm not sure what your disagreement with Alisdahre is.  Proc rates are a function of time, yes, but they still go off on the swing.  No matter your haste, 20 swings is 20 chances for the main proc to go off.  With haste though, your chance to proc per swing is lower.  When slowed, your chance per swing is higher.  But you still have a chance each swing.  So yes, there is code in there to change your proc rate based on how often you swing.<br />
<br />
The procs are mostly independant.  The only part that isn't, is that two procs can not go off on the same swing.  So if the weapons original proc goes off, the aug'd proc won't.  If the original doesn't, the aug has a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chackle</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I performed 2 x two hour tests in ST soon after LDON came out, both against the same mob with the exact same equipment and no buffs.  The only change between the two parses was that for the second parse I added Vampire Talon.<br />
<br />
The result of the four hours of parsing in total was that the primary proc for Caens, Serpents Bite, went off the exact number of times per swing regardless of whether there was an additional proc in the weapon or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hussar my argument was the implementation used to achieve the proc rate per time, as a programmer and former game programmer, I would doubt that they would modify the calculations used for your proc rate depending on your haste or dly of your weapon.  If the plan is to make it proc fairly reliably at a certain rate per time there are much simpler ways to go about that, code wise.  It's much simpler to make some code that just automatically does a 2 ish proc rate per minute that is general enough to not care about haste/dly/etc, my guess is that they have something like a 30 second timer that your chance to proc goes up as the seconds get closer to 0, that would make it not worry about any of that and not have to do a bunch of checks each frame of the game, it would be much less computationaly expensive to do that rather than adjusted abunch of values for different situations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think some of you are confusing swings with rounds.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can proc multiple times in a round, but not multiple times on a swing. <br />
 <br />
So you can't proc the 2 procs in the same swing, but you can proc them in the same round.<br />
<br />
Example!<br />
<br />
<br />
Swing            Proc y/n<br />
20                    n<br />
0                      n<br />
14                    yes proc  (proc 2 cannot proc now in this current swing)<br />
15                    n<br />
16                    yes proc2<br />
<br />
<br />
All in one round. That is just a random round, which would be a triple attack + a quad.<br />
<br />
So while it looks like you proced 2 times in 1 swing, you just proced twice in that one round.</div></div><hr />
