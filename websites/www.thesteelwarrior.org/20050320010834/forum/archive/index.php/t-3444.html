Many UIs are just too crowded though. I can't stand those UIs crowded with lots of things, takes away the beauty of the game. It's one thing fighting a mob head on and seeing it on the big screen, it's another thing seeing the mob through a tiny opening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use 1280 x 1024 myself, which does help with crowded ui's.  And, as others have said, Sars &gt; all =p</div></div><hr />

I want to see whats going on and not have it look like every window in the game is opened and crammed into the bottom of my screen.<br />
<br />
just download target with %<br />
<br />
a mini player hp with xp and aaxp<br />
<br />
mini long buffs (the ones that have the spell name instead of the icon (put this half way off the screen) same with song buff.<br />
<br />
get a mini group window.<br />
<br />
now break your chat boxes up into 3 windows. hits and gethit with hitsmode on goes in 1 then eveything elsedevided into 2.<br />
<br />
lower the tint and you gtg.<br />
<br />
<br />
just my opinion</div></div><hr />

Its a bit of a mixing of every light info UI i could find &amp; WC3 spell icons.<br />
Not pretty, but no extra useless spam/info.<br />
<br />
A friend made me a modified pet info window that can hold either:<br />
2H weapon + Spare 2H weapon<br />
Current Range + Spare Range<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
Current Mainhand , Current Offhand<br />
<br />
<br />
PS :Having a really hard time linking the JPG from a friends FTP :(<br />
Anything that can be done ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can just attach the screenshot...or I could do it ;) <br />
<br />
Page widths be damned!<br />
<br />
Also had to lower the image quality a little to get it under 100k, hence blurriness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ugly as hell, i will agree on that.  <br />
But the only solution i found to keep needed information<br />
available, and get rid of all that flooding.<br />
<br />
I dont want to loose chat (hence channels + various combat info)<br />
I dont want to loose mob dps (hence special miss + hit)<br />
I dont want that extra BS SPAM (so the various crap box)<br />
I want to keep an eye on my DS (agreed could be 2 lines not 5)<br />
<br />
What i do hate is you cant separate : My spells &amp; Spells on Me<br />
(Trying to see proc messages from the CH line spam)<br />
(Why CH ? caus i want to be able to see avg CH value)<br />
<br />
And i hate all those &quot;fancy good looking UI&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Me too.  Another thing to /feedback.<br />
<br />
I would like to see my procs in my main window (I only have 2), but I can't handle group spells and MGBs and such there so it's in with my melee spam.  Haven't gone so far as to give it it's own window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got sars UI...not too bad. The buffs are nice and out of the way, chat screens don't have too much crap on them. Group window is small, but horizontal...that kills me - but might get used to it. Great compass. The rest of the stuff is in one window: hotkeys, quick buttons from inventory, exp and level and stuff, and stats etc. That part is somewhat too big and useless. Stats could be shoved into a smaller window, no need to look at them all the time. Hotkeys are ok, but quickbuttons could be smaller.... I moved stuff around so it's more usable(by me), and made 3 chat windows - one for tells, one for all the chat, and one for all spells and me hitting/taking hits. Not too bad a UI though.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you're not comfortable with all spells, DSs, and your combat being in the same window, this UI might be too crowded for ya, another chat window would make this really cramped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the ui I use.  It's basically Sars.  I shrunk it a good bit so it's not extremely annoying for those with smaller resolutions viewing this page.  So with high resolution, you don't have a problem with it being crowded imo.  Took some time getting used to the horizontal group window (across the top of main chat windows).  I personally love having all things available to me easily.  I use every one of the 10 inventory boxes on the right half of the hotkey window daily.  Oh, and the text isn't really that small, like I said, it's shrunk, it's easy to read the text normally, and I changed it to .jpg which lowered it's quality (but made it easier on dialups).</div></div><hr />
