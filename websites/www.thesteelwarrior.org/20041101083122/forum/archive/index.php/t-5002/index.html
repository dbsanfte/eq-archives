<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently joined a new guild, They Farm VT..I know for sure i want a shot at the clicky gloves that drop there. But what other drops should i keep my eye on. I have Never been to VT why i am asking.. Take a look at my Magelo and see what ya think i should keep my eye out for...Thanks 4 ya time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is frankly very little in VT that would upgrade you much. AHR neck would, of course, and be on the look out for Cord of Midnight for haste on your belt slot. A Gorget of Superiority would straight upgrade your neck slot in both haste and stats. Look for maybe a ring upgrade, but that's about it. If you can't get a pair of the AHR gloves, get an orb of the sky. It's about the same for aggro, but the cast time on it is much worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Orb of Sky is cool, but you'll wind up using it much less than you'd ever use the gloves. I'm 3rd tank in my guild most nights and I use mine sometimes, but when MA'ing it's a pain to have a 10s cast time every 10 minutes. The usual guild MA hardly ever uses his.<br />
<br />
Once guild gets to the point of awarding people a 3rd Aten loot, I'll be going for gloves unless I get a new haste item so I can upgrade my haste neck to Aten neck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The orb works wonders right before a boss mob, but I definitely don't use it in exp groups. It's not nearly as good as the gloves, no doubt, but it's an extra proc nonetheless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trying to pull up the stats on those items and cant get them to pull up, If ya dont mind could ya post them in a link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Orb of the Sky (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28975) <br />
Gorget of Superiority (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28885)<br />
Cord of Midnight (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28890)<br />
<br />
Check my magelo for the VT stoofs alternate profile for a mixture of what I'm wearing plus the best VT stuff I could find. Rings and belt from it are excellent upgrades for you, as well as the Earring of Erradication. The Crimson Runed Mask is also huge, but you can seriously only expect so much AHR loot. You'd be wanting 4 of her loots, btw.<br />
<br />
http://www.darkwind-guild.com/SoL/ is the link I used to track down the good stuff, it'll even tell you the mobs to watch for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dont know where you guys got the idea that orb does anything for agro. I for one never noticed any difference with it or without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The extra proc is dd + 0.0 second stun, warriors have been using it for a little bonus aggro for a long time. It's nothing phenomenal, but it is somewhat effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Casia<br />
The Orb was recently changed from knockback to stun. It might be why you haven't notiched much difference earlier.<br />
<br />
The gloves are great though. I use them none stop and you can get it off between hits while you are tanking. The differens in early agro is most noticeable as it increases the chance for an early proc considerable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Haste boots.. forgot name =p<br />
Aten Talisman of Vah'Kerrath<br />
Aten Earring of Eradication<br />
TVX Cloak of Icy Shadows<br />
Blob Belt of Mastery<br />
DXXT(I think) Ring of the Crimson Bull<br />
<br />
you're set</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can the gloves be used from an inventory slot ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slammer, yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That Rocks !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm in the same situation actually.  I've been looking at the Umbracite Bracers (38ac 10dex 75hp and some other stats).  Should I shoot for those or wait for other bracers?<br />
<br />
I've tried to narrow my Aten loot to just one thing.  I think I'll go for her mask, but that BP sure is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The AHR mask is nice, but the mask from mini-Aten is same hp and frees up your Aten loot for the BP (this is what I did anyway). Plus if you don't have a clicky invis item this has the bonus of a clicky (albeit with an atrocious cast time- I'm seriously thinking of pulling my invis-BP out of my mule's satchels).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Eriatha, those bracers are very good. If you get a shot at them, snatch them up. Bracers tend to be a very hard slot to fill, and those have very nice ac and hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A few items I can think of (and also trying to test our new vb code). These should last you through elementals into potime.<br />
<br />
gloves of the crimson sigil<br />
<br />
crimson runed mask<br />
<br />
great shadow platemail<br />
<br />
talisman of vah kerrath</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A few items I can think of (and also trying to test our new vb code). These should last you through elementals into potime. <br />
<br />
Yes, awesome stuff.  All four being Aten loots, lol.<br />
<br />
Here's my situation a little more extensively.  I'm in a relatively new guild that raids a ton, but has been more focused on planar progression than anything and is only Rallos/Solusek away from elemental access.  Most all of you know that killing gods isn't exactly the most rewarding thing on Norrath, so I don't receive much loot, if any.  In fact, my only rewards so far are a Blade of Carnage and Helmet of Rallos Zek, though I did receive the Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates while helping my guildies kill Vhaksiz the Shade for the Secret of the Planes quest.  <br />
<br />
I'm not a loot whore, so I'd like to keep the pl00tz down to what I need vs what I may receive in the future (shooting for Raex hopefully).  The biggest upgrades for me at the moment from Vex Thal are the Aten BP and Mask, but being Aten, I'll most likely see one at most, if even at all.  I'll definitely be shooting a tell for the mask, hehe.  If the BP drops, I'll shoot a tell as well, but I won't cross my fingers for it.  Talisman of Vah Kerrath has pure badass written all over it, but I was maybe thinking the Magmaton neck for later on down the road.  There are a lot more people in my guild who would benefit from the Talisman over me, especially since I'm using one of the Korucust necks.<br />
<br />
As far as personal stuff goes, I have a high playtime and bring my 65 cleric on every raid.  I'm rarely a part of the CH rotation, but if called to do so, I will.  Raid buffed, I sit at ~8620hp and ~1590ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1) Gloves of The Crimson Sigil<br />
<br />

- Instant click<br />
- From Inventory<br />
- Imbue DD/Stun<br />
<br />
2) Every other VT loot (AHR first of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gangleri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Had them drop for us last night. Went to a paladin. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We've farmed VT pretty heavily and only got 1 or 2 pairs of gloves to date I think- which went to hybrids. We've operated on the &quot;you get 2 AHR loots until further notice&quot; premise and our warriors all wanted the BP and neck/earring/mask.<br />
<br />
In hindsight I should have held out on the earring and gone for gloves since a comparable earring drops off agnarr fairly commonly. Hopefully the officers will open Aten up to 3rd loots soon though ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why is the Aten BP so much better then the Seru BP, looking at the resist the Seru seems much nice. I am /boggled about this ..I just want to spend my Dkp points wisely.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd go Seru bp any day. ATK isn't that hard to max, and the resists on Seru bp just makes it better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'd go for the Heavy Yttrium over the Great Shadow as well, however isn't the Heavy Yttrium exceedingly more rare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Any Warrior who is at the VT level is not likely to be maxing out his ATK without taking a serious hit to his potential AC / hp. At that point in the game, I'd wear Aten bp.<br />
<br />
Edit: I just noticed he already had Seru bp. If I had to pick between the two at that point I'd go with Aten, but if I had Seru already, forget it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wycca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yea, youre fine in seru bp slamm, matter of fact, the resists are better imo.<br />
<br />
As far as aten gear, you'll really hafta save your dkp to have a shot.  On the bright side, if youre patient, everyone will spend down.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, dont bank on more than 1 aten loot at the most, even tho we have plans to keep doing VT for a long time, and it will likely depend on whats lucky enough to drop.<br />
<br />
Look around at other VT loot, some of it isnt contested as much.<br />
<br />
I also use www.darkwind-guild.com/sol<br />
the database there is simply amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Gloves,Mask, and Neck, you will not take my wish list away !!!! &lt;3 I dont plan on going in and getting these items with the snap of a hat. POP taught me to sit back,watch, and be Patient =)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">VT loot that I would keep my eye out for are:<br />
<br />
Aten Neck - Its just godly and nothing will upgrade it till time. <br />
<br />
Aten Earing - I still use it great AC at 25 great saves again no real up grade for it till time unless you spend tons of time doing Trade skills and do aid Grmili quest or want to lose lots of AC.<br />
<br />
When we did VT we had no gloves drop for us (least none I can recall)<br />
<br />
Invis mask is ok  stats wise, invis takes 10 seconds to cast, I have one and use it in combination with 1-2 potions if i need to reinvis instantly. <br />
<br />
-Grap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Slayyerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">We have done Aten maybe 17 times. We have had 1 pair of gloves drop. I have used ERP (same as DkP somewhat) for mostly Aten loot and got lucky on Seru. If you had to choose on upgrading any slots that i have as far as Aten goes would you replace anyting in the elementals or wait for time loot on those slots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Drops to watch for in VT - apologies if any of these have been linked before<br />
