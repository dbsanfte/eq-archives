<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Several of my guild members have finally gotten flagged for tactics.  However, we have no idea what to expect, what the camps are, what the mobs are, etc...  A couple of us are trying to get in pick up groups there to learn, but that's not as easy as it sounds, especially for me a 64 warrior.  Any wisdom that you could impart would be greatly appreciated and I'll warn all of y'all on Mith Marr server when we head in ;) :p :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You zone into a long hallway, at which end lies the arena. in the arena, various champions of Zek roam around, looking for fights. Exping is mostly in the arena, as the mobs down there dont mitigate slow. EVerywhere else, you have Diaku, the 12 feet ogres which partially mitigate slow. So if ya wanna exp there, invis and levi at zone, run straight ahead into arena, float down into a corner and start fighting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Down there, if you see the phrease &quot;You hear the sound of  pounding blah blah blah&quot; hold your ass in your hands and hug a wall! You will know why the first time you see it..... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol why's that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trust me, its something you will want to experience without any spoilers :D<br />
<br />
You will laugh your ass off the first time you see it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tactics is one of the most fun zones in the game I think.  Another piece of advice which I doubt will happen when you first zone in you can take some left or right stairs.  Each stairs have two Ogres guarding them do NOT mess with them.  They are uber or at least were to me at 60 duel wielding hitting for 750's :).  The pit like they say is usually where everyone hunts for exp.  Be rdy for adds though.  Had 8 mobs at our camp once gotta love root.  Had no cleric or chanter either now that is fun :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bjarki_bearskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am a little late to this thread, but I think you might really enjoy the Armorer/Supplier area.<br />
<br />
This is a great area for pulls and the two nameds drop ornate armor.<br />
<br />
I am not exactly positive on how to get there because I usually just hit auto-follow on guild mates.  I do know that the basic way we head there is invis, go to pit, head to right a little, drift down to other side, go through the doorway there and at the T, we bear off to the right hallways.<br />
<br />
The nameds are fairly tough.  But the rewards are decent.<br />
It's never camped hardly on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">most everyone gets a levi to float to the far side the arena and goes in the left tunnel there. it opens up to a &quot;T&quot;. left is the boar pen, right are the barracks and kitchen. in the back left corner of the &quot;T&quot; intersection is a safe spot you can pull to. normally we xped in the mess hall or barracks just for more pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We usually exp in the 2 tunnels leading off the arena so we have more mobs to kill.<br />
Second good camp is the armorer/supplier area.<br />
They drop some nice loot like my clerics gloves, a int caster headpiece with extended range 4, some nice hybrid boots although they are not that bad for a cleric either and of course runes.<br />
Northwest and southwest tunnel as the camps are called are pretty safe although they seem to have changed northwest somewhat.<br />
Last weekend when we were in NW (to get shikarii level 65 and i was on my cleric) i saw a ton of adds coming from further inside, not to mention a lot of tortured soul spawns (they are roamers that spawn upon a npc death randomly) i never seen before in that number.<br />
Btw. the first crossroads mentioned with the diaku elite and other nasty mobs leads to the Vallon Zek (right side) and Tallon Zek (left side) spawns.<br />
I hear people exp there as well but i wouldnt bother.<br />
Gindan Flayers can split around 40 health in 2 similar mobs with full health(mezzable but hit for 800+), Hendin Assassins have a nasty 800 point AE and a knockback that removes top buff.<br />
Although some nice stuff can drop off the named around there, like a 15/22 damage piercer (droppable) and ornate drops (my ornate pants dropped on a raid when we killed the named clearing to VZ) i havent exp'd in these parts of tactics.<br />
<br />
And if you see 'You hear a pounding of hooves' it is usually followed by an /ooc Piggy, at least on Terris</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyone know if the corpses that lay around the arena are for anything? They have life bars but no names, I usually kill them for fun or to keep avatar up when we have downtime. just wondering if I kill enough of them does something happen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yup..pounding of hooves=pwnage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tactics is by far my favorite zone to exp in. The pit is the normal exp spot where you will have unlimited pulls if there are not 4 groups down there. <br />
<br />
And yes, the Piggy is the coolest thing I have ever seen in EQ. There are some other great exp camps other than the pit in this zone. I advise you to explore with your friends and find a good spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tamurlane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">first time i saw the pounding of hooves, the ranger puller was standing by one of the arches.... at least for an *extremely* short period of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
tamurlane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">not surprised ... rangers generally only remain standing for an extremely short period of time ... it doesnt matter where they are, fighting in tactics, or farming in crushbone, they will die either way.</div></div><hr />
