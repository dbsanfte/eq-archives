We're going to hit it in the next couple weeks and I'd like to at least get an idea of what to expect. I've not been able to find much here using search.<br />
<br />
Any tips/hints much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avelariel</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, all the ikkinz trials and raids use the same map, just with some parts closed off depending which one you're doing.  Ikkinz 1 is the easiest ikkinz raid pretty much, and it's really just a case of making your way in, clearing as you go, and killing obvious named mobs who drop parts of keys, or sometimes loot.  Iirc, the order is<br />
<br />
Kill 3 priests 1 at a time, to get key and 1 loot<br />
Kill 2 defenders 1 at a time to get to custodian<br />
Custodian is a little tougher, always hits for his max and flurries unslowable, also mem blurs or so, he drops 1 loot<br />
Guardian is behind custodian, rooted in a pit, slightly trickier fight with mobs activating and deactivating throughout, plus some 4.5k dd+FD proc or something like that. Once you aggro him he will nuke you even at zonein, caused some chaos our first time. <br />
Spirit is final fight, really straightforward, but kinda cool mob model, keep an eye on it<br />
<br />
That's my recollection, been a while since we've been there.  It's not too complicated but there's some variety in the fights.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I guess while we're on the subject... I'm interested in anything about the rest of the ikkinz raids too. I don't really expect we'll stomp over ikkinz1 on our first try, but if we do I'd like to be able to move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Custodian's min is like 1300 and max is like 1350 and actually hits for min most of the time, but not like it really matters.<br />
<br />
Ikk1 and 2 are both really straightforward.  Ikk3 has the class specific kills that can be a bit of a pain.  You're probably going to do this anyway, but it's a real good idea to have the same person to loot all the random key parts that drop in this zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't take the 4.5k DD if you're in the pit when he gets aggro'd.  So, MT rushes and everyone is one step behind, everyone in the pit before aggro starts and no one takes the nuke.<br />
<br />
Don't float too high above the pit either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The golem does 3X Bury on random targets on his aggro list (at least it looks random to me).  It'd say like 'golem attempts to bury an opponent!'  Not much you can do about it really other than to tough it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Class specific kills on ikkinz3?  What's that referring to?<br />
<br />
I hadn't noticed anything on that one.  It's the only ikkinz trial I've actually attempted to finish, and we rolled right through it in a very short amount of time.  We had a warrior, SK, cleric, shaman, bard, and I forget the 6th.  There was no mention of any particular strategy needed.  hmm... I was with people who'd done the trial before.  Are there keys they'd gotten in previous runs and been able to save?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in ikkinz 3 there are 4 mini golems which give you an emote when you kill them hinting what class needs to kill them, something like &quot;a true veteran&quot; = war or whatever. After those 4 a black golem spawns called Marauder. He shudders every 1 min or so and the shudder = change in archtype that needs to kill (priest, int caster, pure melee, hybrid). Since there are 4 arch's we usually let him shudder 3 times then burn it and see what emote was then recount 4 &quot;shudders&quot; then kill with that archtype.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the one person event.  Most people use Ikkinz3 to mean the third 54 person Ikkinz raid, in which specific classes must get the kill shot on some targets.<br />
<br />
Later you get to have an archetype get the kill, but which one changes every 30 seconds to keep you amused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we rolled into Ikkinz 1 last night and mowed it down. Thanks for the help guys. Ikkinz2 on the menu now :)<br />
<br />
Heres the rundown.<br />
<br />
Kill 3 priests, unlocks doors to 2 defenders. 1 loot from 3rd priest.<br />
Kill 2 defenders, unlocks door to Custodian. <br />
Kill Custodian, 1 loot.<br />
Kill Guardian in the pit. Offtank the adds as they activate. 1 loot.<br />
Kill Crumbling Monolith, loot shawl.<br />
Hand shawl to Spirit to activate. Kill for 2 more loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the archtype one, we just go FFA, figuring on average we'll get it right 1 in 4 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the wrong archetype gets the kill, what happens? Does he just respawn? <br />
<br />
Judging by how fast the mobs were dieing in ikkinz1, I can easily see FFA being the most efficient method...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes he just respawns.  You can just zerg it but I hope your healers have deep mana pools if you do as you are gambling.  Hint: pay attention to shudders if you want to actually learn the event.  Except to wipe a number of times learning to pull and engage the class kill golems.<br />
<br />
Ikk2 things start procing FD and AE knockback.  Be ready for that as people can get raped pretty fast by junk if you aren't thinking.  Assist heals and smart tank mezzing is godly on the end encounter.<br />
<br />
The most important thing about ikkinz: leash can be your best friend or worst enemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When u get to the final room in ikkinz 2, there is one golem, and alot of unharmable mobs.. setup on the ramp, and pull the golem, kill him to 50% and he will split, when he splits RUN OUT of the room, and let him leash.. then have your rangers/caster kill the callers on the back wall, and move your raid into one of the corners.. then your monks can split the 2 golems down and pull one, around 50% it will split into 2, that dont hit to hard.... Just split tank them, and kill one fast, then kill the other... Each has loot... Res/Med up, then pull the other one, same thing it splits, and both have 1 loot...  *Note : the mobs on the back wall arnt killable until the golem hits 70% ish, thus dont worry about them until u make the first golem split*<br />
<br />
Ikkinz 2 is the best of them for loot farming, u get 4 better then quarm loots, and then u also get 1-3 of the typlical named loots on the way.. Once u get it down, u can do it pretty fast, we used to do it in right around a hour from zonein, to all 4 golems dead..<br />
<br />
Ikkinz 3 is where it becomes a pita~</div></div><hr />

This method u never hace to kill the mob more then twice, unless someone does something stupid the second time around.</div></div><hr />
