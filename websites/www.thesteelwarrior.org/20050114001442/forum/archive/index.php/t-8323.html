<br />
Hits main target for around 1100 max.  I parsed it at around 500dps.  AE rampage hits for 2kish max.  Casts the 2 spells listed below but the real kicker of the fight is that it has a 2 damage unresistable knockback proc on the main target.  I got knocked across the zone and summoned back a few times.  There was no spell cast message and with 500 to all resists i never resisted it.  It would hit me 3 or 4 times in a row sometimes so it procs very commonly.<br />
<br />
We basically tried him with 8 people and the only reason we lost is because of the unresistable knockback.  His main target dps is horrid so just make sure all the melee's are max melee range.  Make sure everyone has 500 to all resists.  Then just make sure when the main tank gets knocked across the zone and doesnt get summoned back that you have someone to fill his spot.<br />
<br />
His ae rampage is really unforgiving.  He one rounded my fully time geared rogue friend with rampage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The combination of his effects can be a real kicker too.  One time when fighting him, I was hit with the snare and then knocked back (to like the other side of the fire lake).  With snare and not getting summoned back, it looked like it was going to take me a good 10 minutes to make my way back to the fight.  But I did not have to worry about that because his 2K AE, was still able to hit me and take me out long before I made it back to the fight.  Missed out on the books that eventually dropped too because of dying so far away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. He wont ae rampage once slowed; slowing asap is a key to victory<br />
2. His KB isnt bad if you get knocked into lava as opposed to into the land (esp with lev)<br />
3. His AE can be resisted if you have max MR (I think its a -300 check)<br />
4. Use pallie to tank for agro lock...warrs get knocked back too often and then take too long to reaquire agro.<br />
5. Casters must be in melee range to hit...time the AE to cast<br />
6. His ae has a godly range (300+?)<br />
7. He is rooted (for what that is worth)<br />
8. He sees through SoS (CR is a fun time heh)<br />
9. His KB effect is in a forward arc.</div></div><hr />

He still rampages after slow, his knockback isn't that bad if you're lev'd (sort of like Yelinkak), the aggro problems aren't from 'aggro' persay as proximity aggro, there is a range between his AE Ramp hitbox and caster spell landing box...but it's small, and his KB is single target only on the MT.<br />
<br />
Basically, you can pretty easily kill him with a couple clerics, shaman, tank...and rangers.  Rangers are key, really, because they are the only force there that can continue to hit him while remaining at a relatively safe distance and only worrying about the AE's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This guy reminds me of Manaetic Behemoth and Cazic Thule.  His various effects are designed to cause chaos.  In terms of melee, he is really damn easy.  No CH rotation required on a 10k tank.<br />
<br />
I was unable to get him to summon me back after knockbacks.  We used COH to bring back our two tanks after knockbacks.<br />
<br />
On a previous failed attempt, the mage (with smattering of EP gear) tanked him for ages after the MT went linkdead, and survived on chain fast heals from one cleric.<br />
<br />
It was a pickup raid, and the groups that didn't have group-heals died pretty early.  Groups that did have group-heals ready lasted the whole fight.</div></div><hr />

Not borne out by my direct experience.  But /shrug observation is hard when you are lagging like a SoB  :) <br />
<br />

<br />
Ya I heard that last night as well...just need a server team Ranger (lol echos of team mana burn) to step and kill him.<br />
<br />
 So if you get knockbacked away, and immediately sit down, he still doesn't yoink you back to his feet? <br />
<br />
Nope bastage doesnt appear to summon at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope bastage doesnt appear to summon at all<br />
<br />
He does summon...just usually when folks fight him he's got alot of little melee and casters around his ankles that he turns to after he pushes the MT back.  If you're light on folks in melee range, though, it's pretty easy to get into a Yelinka groove with the yo-yo action on knockback.<br />
<br />
Also, I had 4 instaclickies so the dispell AE wasn't an issue when it hit (note that the 10th coldain ring will be overwritten by the manadrain/snare dot...so don't count on that for an insta-click.  9th-8th ring still works)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DG-Slider</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 9K Hps raid buffed, probbly less when equipping my instant click items with him and when I was engaged with him, only once, I never saw or suffered a knockback. The PU raid I was with failed, but it seemed to me his rampage was the major issue. The raid also overcompensated for his DPS putting several healers on the MT and ST and not supporting any of the other group members. I died slowly but never received a heal. At one point, I thought about backing out of the fight and healing myself up with band-aids. It was a total cluster and I would love to see a guild or raid take him down the right way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His DPS on the MT once slowed is pretty trivial.  I tanked him buffless once for what seemed like a long time with just one cleric still alive.  Key to this fight is keeping your DPS people alive so you don't get down to the point where one tank and one cleric are duoing him, like Tavari and I were hehe.  AE heals + group heals are very important.  Keeping the MT alive is easy, but he can't kill the dragon by himself :).  Start out with lev in your last buff slot (if you're not going to bother with the 4x clicky thing) and hopefully by the time you lose it you will have enough aggro to get summoned back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone give us a rough estimate of what sort of numbers you need to kill him, and a very general breakdown of what class types? Might have to break it down by what type of gear the people have: i.e 15 peeps if Time+/GoD, 30 peeps if Elemental, 50 peeps if VT/Ssra, or whatever. Any help appreciated.<br />
<br />
edit 1: the numbers above are just for EXAMPLE. I have no clue what it takes to do this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The event produces 48 dragon bloods, and that is a good number to aim for, if your guild can kill Rydda'dar, and is close to being able to beat RZTW.  Success lies mostly in preparation; I saw one of my server's Qvic guilds fail with 30ish because they didn't plan for the dispels, but in theory he's probably doable with 12 people.</div></div><hr />

absolutly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we tried him last night with about 39 Lvl 65's. Was a combo of our small family type guild and another casual raiding type guild, most folks arent elemental flagged, or Vex Thal equipped.<br />
<br />
  I ended up as MT and the first try we got him down to about 25%, second time we actually had a few more people but only got the dragon to about 35%.  The Melee damage wasnt a problem, I was one of the last to die both runs. Its the AE's and AE rampage that took us down and lowered the DPS too fast.<br />
<br />
   I would say if we had a few more healers so every group had group heals, we probably could have won. Also a couple more groups to get to at least the 48 that can get keys would of been good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Key to sucess -<br />
<br />
Bard with MT<br />
<br />
Lev song &gt; knockback because you can refresh it every dispell.  His slowed melee damage is gimp, with bard you can get resists jacked way up and resist about half of the knockback's, and most of the snare/mana drains. <br />
<br />
If your melee aren't packing some serious gear, just range him.  It'll take longer, but if your tank has decent aggro, there won't be any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also key to winning if you like your buffs = Crystalized Pumice<br />
<br />
<br />
Well not really key, but if you dispell that snare when your knocked back across the zone this will help ya. Its a single buff dispell at times and a 4-buff dispell at others, anyone know the deal with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iyacc</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did  him as part of a pickup raid last weekend. Ended up with 41 people and from what I could tell about half were EP or higher geared. <br />
<br />
We had a mage in tank group in case one of us got pushed across the zone but with lev up it was never an issue that I saw.  We lost a half dozen people or so. I got knocked back a couple times but it wasn't ever very far. <br />
<br />
Clickies helped a lot and lev near the end of buffs helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The knockback itself is not really an issue, the issue is that you might be snared and unable to get back to the fight in a reasonable time.  When my levitate finally got dispelled, I was thrown halfway across the lava lake.  Clearly I was not going to get back before the end of the fight without COH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The KB sends you so far out that it's outside of a mob's chase range, so you won't ever get summoned back because you're too far away to be considered a target.</div></div><hr />
