Actually it won't. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Total protonic reversal.  Imagine every molecule in your body simultaneously exploding at the speed of light.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you just attack it like you're not furious and it's not enraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tillaan</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tested this on quite a few named mobs.  As has been said it's bad for you :)<br />
<br />
However Fortitude + enrage = a winner ! Good way to stop big mobs turing on rage or people getting summoned through rage if you have the endurance left after the fight...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Explain to me, how using furious during enrage is bad for you, please. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found a log of me using furious during enrage, nothing bad at all happened, in fact, everything went along just as if i wasn't using the disc, and the mob wasn't enraged, which I stated earlier. I clipped out other people's hits and heals and all that junk, and only included my melee, and Quavonis's.<br />
<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:16 2004] Quavonis Firetail has become ENRAGED.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:20 2004] A consuming rage takes over your weapons.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:20 2004] Niafix is no longer berserk.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:20 2004] Auto attack is on.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:21 2004] You kick Quavonis Firetail for 16 points of damage.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:21 2004] Quavonis Firetail hits YOU for 3161 points of damage.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:21 2004] Quavonis Firetail tries to hit YOU, but misses!<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:21 2004] Quavonis Firetail hits YOU for 3028 points of damage<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:21 2004] You try to slash Quavonis Firetail, but miss!<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:22 2004] You avoid the stunning blow.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:22 2004] Quavonis Firetail bashes YOU for 511 points of damage.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:23 2004] You slash Quavonis Firetail for 167 points of damage.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:23 2004] You slash Quavonis Firetail for 209 points of damage.<br />
[Mon Feb 09 17:52:23 2004] You slash Quavonis Firetail for 220 points of damage.<br />
<br />
This clip of the log shows that while Quavonis was enraged, I used furious disc, and attacked as normal through the enrage.  There is a bunch more I have, but I didn't want to have a post that was too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hit furious while RZ was enraged in Time a couple nights ago. I was actually second warrior in the order so it wasnt like we had $$$ healing at the point of the night, I lived just fine. Dude with th trippy anime sig is right, hitting furious while mob enraged is like fighting the mob  normal.</div></div><hr />
