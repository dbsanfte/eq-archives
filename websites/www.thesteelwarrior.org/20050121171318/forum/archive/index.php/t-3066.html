<br />
Something that does not take an uber guild to do.<br />
Maybe just a group in there 50's.<br />
<br />
I know that would make me happy so that I could at least solo when finding a group is a pain or if I want to farm.<br />
<br />
They could make it like 15 or 20 cast every 10 minutes so it would not replace a true healer.<br />
<br />
And make it warrior only. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only champion piece I have is a bracer and that took a full raid party to get not one group and they are not a clicky full health thing.<br />
Please reread my post for other reasons why these do not fit the bill.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think he meant he wanted a BP that was like the clerics Trak BP but warrior useable. <br />
<br />
I do not know what this is can you give the full name so I know if I am insane or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The BP he is talking about is a Cleric BP that has Complete Healing clicky.<br />
<br />
Champion, Myrmidon and Warlord BP, all have a 100hp heal.<br />
<br />
If warriors could CH themselves by a clicky, thats what he means would be insane, and I agree :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can single group to get a plate BP for champion's armor, just do the cycle in the plate house.<br />
<br />
As per reading your post, I was quite clear what you were asking for... I just thought you were out of your mind for asking it.<br />
<br />
If you're going to solo, either 3 bp's listed give you the effect you want.  Now that I think about it, Champs probably the only one up your alley for the time being.  You can solo easy with that thing in your backpack, I use to carry a cobalt one around while I sat bored in PoJ while lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merkell</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok thanks for the info on the BP's<br />
<br />
You can single group to get a plate BP for champion's armor, just do the cycle in the plate house. <br />
<br />
I will have to check this out. <br />
So you are saying a group of 50 somethings can do this?<br />
If so that is cool.<br />
<br />
Yeah I know what I am asking is far fetched but hey wtf.<br />
Everyone can solo but us.<br />
Maybe if we start asking for the ability to heal ourselves then maybe they will fix some other things to shut us up.<br />
<br />
There are healing potions in the game but they are to exp and I am not sure how far they heal.<br />
<br />
I don't know why you all would call me insane?<br />
That is a little harsh.<br />
I say fix aggro or give us the chance to heal lol.<br />
I would be happy if it only did it every 30 min or 1 hour.<br />
<br />
I am tired of being poor cause I can't solo and not being able to get good drops without having to roll against everyone cause so much of it is not warrior only.<br />
<br />
I am going to make a Druid just so I can support my Warrior and I think that is pretty sad.<br />
<br />
If any of you guys know where I can go solo and make 1 to 2k an hour I am all ears.<br />
Or even 500p.<br />
<br />
Untill then just let me dream a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, personally, I've never had over 3k on me... ever.... I prefer getting those items with a group/s of friends, they are more valuable when you did sweat for em, imo. When I was around your lvl, I used to partner in RM with my druid friend, and we used to get quite some money (on the EC days lol). I guess you can try there with a healer partner, I've never found another place with low lvl mobs that drop 40pp each time :)<br />
<br />
As far as my Kael experience goes, yes, you can go and happily camp for your Champ BP, Arena is one place, the Icehouse is the other... I did it for 5 months and I never saw 1 :p On the other hand, our guild started to go to HoT and the mobs there drop armor pieces almost all the time (a single normal mob dropped my BP, plate legs and silk), I have to say that you cant compare the drop rate in Kael with the rate in HoT.<br />
<br />
And again, I personally I dont like the CHing idea... if you want to heal yourself, raise your Bind Wound, I did it, capped at 210 I believe, and you can bandage up to 70%, just make sure you have an Embalmers Knife (procs Summon Bandages) and you are set for healing :) Sure, it will take some time to heal yourself... but thats life hehe.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Spelling... sleepy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merkell</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I go to kael every friday night with guild and drops are poor.<br />
Never saw a BP and never went with just one group and we all are over 51 and many in the 60's.<br />
<br />
Our guild is lacking in healers so getting one to partner up is tough.<br />
Also I am on EST and seems like everyone I am friends with are on PST. duh<br />
<br />
I do have the knife and gauze press for emergencies.</div></div><hr />
