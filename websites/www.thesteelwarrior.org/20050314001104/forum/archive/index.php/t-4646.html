<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand it:<br />
1: Discs are unlinked and tied to endurance<br />
2: Using a new disc cancels any currently active disc/opening effect<br />
3: Using an new opening cancels any currently active disc/opening effect.<br />
<br />
So from first impressions, a tanking warrior will follow this timeline:<br />
<br />
-00:02 Provoke on inc for 100 hate <br />
00:00 Engage mob: Disc furi for immunity to frontal attack and extra swings for agro while you back into a corner <br />
00:07 Disc stonewall for 3 mins of 45% mitigation <br />
03:08 Disc defensive for 3 mins of 55% mitigation <br />
06:09 Disc evasive for 3 mins of 50% avoidance <br />
09:10 Oh noes! No duration disc! Finger over fortitude button if you think heals won't land! <br />
10:37 If you survived those 87 seconds without a disc, stonewall will be up again. Rinse Lather Repeat for as long as endurance holds out<br />
On top of all this, there's latent 5% mitigation <br />
<br />
Oh, and you won't even bother with openings because adding a 35ds for one tick will cancel your 3 minute disc. HPs, AC, veng, shielding, avoidance, etc. are ALL now secondary to endurance pool and/or endurance regen. Get ready for wholesale re-equiping, because unless fights last so long that endurance runs out (ie: VT) maintaining a disc that reduces damage by 50% is gonna be worth so much more than a couple of thousand hp.<br />
<br />
If discs drain endurance too fast to chain them like this, then opening based endurance gains won't be used in case you need to chain some discs later in the fight. It's the same vicious circle that made 90% of Kunark discs redundant for the past years <br />
<br />
It seems I'm missing something major here that this hasn't been mentioned before - am I just stupid?</div></div><hr />

What you're missing is that there is no way in hell you can do /Disc Stonewall, /Disc Defensive, /Disc Evasive in a row.<br />
<br />
Once you pop any of those, you will have to wait for the timer to reset since they are all linked. <br />
<br />
And I doubt you'll be using Furious on inc. It's still best saved for an 'oh shit' moment. <br />
<br />
Basically, you won't be doing anything different than you're doing now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll go sit in a corner with the pointed 'D' hat on now, ignore me</div></div><hr />
