<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im looking for some help with tanking issues on VZ in Time.  We got him to 6% on our first attempt tonight.  The only issue we had was mainly the FD on the MT.  We had the MT stand up immediately and taunt but they couldnt keep agro.<br />
<br />
So we tried tank switching which worked fair but not the best.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on this fight please.<br />
<br />
If you wish email me at shaffer0420@hotmail.com<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you got him to 6% on your first attempt, what more do you need? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are several different ways to do VZ, and what works best for one guild wont always work for another. If you got him to 6 on your first attempt, you are on the right track, some guilds take weeks to get him that low while learning. <br />
<br />
just keep trying what you did before, work out a few kinks and youll get it.</div></div><hr />

First few tries you got it to 6% and still not happy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kleth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Easy to do when you've been fed the strats :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
6% on first try with the strats is still pretty good, though you'll get more out of raiding figuring it out yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">all other attackers   must watch...... must watch aggro................. can't say more..... must to watch aggro..... think it as bigger version of lord seru.  :D</div></div><hr />

I died several times so I wasnt able to watch everything.<br />

This problem isn't that hard to solve. Won't exactly say how, but just remember back to Luclin and how to deal with cursed and seru.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not here to waste peoples time, I dont mind learning myself but I wasnt sure if I was doing something way off.<br />
<br />
I do appreciate everyones responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Headboss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LoL dont mind learning? Obvious your lying to yourself, cause you posted here asking for info, plus 6% first try? Meaning you already had pre-info to the fight.<br />
<br />
Anyways since this game is ruined anyways, and theres no surprises anymore. People beating uqua 2nd try? Heres how you do vallon zek time, 20 warriors, 20 clerics, 32 wizards, should do the trick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Next week...&quot;Thanks guys, Quarm down but how do you loot because we kill him and release Zebuxoruk and get ported out...plz help kk thx&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">when you, or the MT is stunned make sure you tell the raid that you're stunned and not building agro so they know when to lay on the DPS and when to hold back.</div></div><hr />

Will make a post when I stop laughing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">for all FD mobs just make a button:<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
Spam it throughout the fight.<br />
<br />
You'll use the hell out of it in Ikkinz raids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/stand<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
<br />
That's all fine and dandy until he enrages ;p  I don't use /attack in my key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>MezViia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That's all fine and dandy until he enrages ;p  I don't use /attack in my key.<br />
<br />
I just turn towards the wall when he enrages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Why would you turn away from a mob when it enrages? The mob is still attacking and if I'm not mistaken, you lose your defensive abilities IE dodge, parry and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I appreciate the info, like I said I don’t mind learning but if I think I maybe making a major mistake I figure it’s best to ask those that would know more about it then I do. But, instead of being told I was on the right track a few people wanted to flame me.  That’s fine, thank you to those that told me I was going in the right direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I was mistaken when I thought forums were there as a source of information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">That's all fine and dandy until he enrages ;p  I don't use /attack in my key.<br />
<br />
<br />
wow, ok, don't spam it the whole fight, just spam it for 90% of the fight.<br />
<br />
I figured a guy tanking Time VZ could be trusted with some common sense....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>MezViia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Why would you turn away from a mob when it enrages? The mob is still attacking and if I'm not mistaken, you lose your defensive abilities IE dodge, parry and so on.<br />
<br />
If you can tank him for 90%, turning to the side a tad when he enrages shouldn't kill you, while leaving attack on while facing him will, and letting him turn on rage due to a slow /stand, or dying because of /stand /attack on during rage would likely wipe half of the melee not paying attention. Could make two seperate hotkeys I suppose, but I do what works for me.... use the same hotkeys for the ikkinz mobs, where if you dont have attack on you can actually lose aggro, granted they die in about 60 seconds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I just count to 10 and pay a lot of attention durring enrage. Having to pay attention for 10secs in a whole fight is soooo much work =(((</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hrm. You can still dodge/parry/riposte while ducking, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You do, you don't swing back on your riposte because you're ducking though. In fact, you dodge/parry/riposte while sitting! Don't ask how I know this... =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I guess I was mistaken when I thought forums were there as a source of information.<br />
These forums are a source of information, just not a source of spoilers, atleast not for end-ish game content.<br />
<br />
I like to think most people who ran up against Vallon got owned getting him down to 90ish% on the 1st try and thought &quot;fuck that was hard, how are we going to deal with that&quot;.  Then they tried again and again with a couple of different ideas, then went back to their MBs and discussed it while they were at work the next day, some bright spark came up with some different ideas so next night they cleared phase 1 again and had another 3 goes... and repeat until you beat it.<br />
<br />
The reason no one here wants to just tell you how to do it is because the people who went through the above senario know how fucking awesome it feels to beat what is one of the hardest encounters in PoP after working it out for themselves.  Everyone deserves to get that kinda buzz outta EQ.  Its what we play for isnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">if you multi tank, raid doesnt have to worry about controlling agro or MT standing up fast enough, just send in 2 tanks defensive on him. you should try to single tank of course, it is easier if they do, but plan on him switching agro. just re-assist heal after each heal. you will have to leave at least 2 dedicated healers on the secondary tank.<br />
<br />
i dont know what the trick is, i know everyone uses the stand hotkey, but agro still bounces around to 2nd tank at least twice or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">That is because the second tank is useing aggro weapons no? While the primary tank is massive stunned =D We single tank him and have since we tried to multi-tank for our first like 2 goes. We didnt have the healing power to do that so we worked out a solution for single tanking, and found that the stand hotkey is not the only thing thatll mitigate the fd...<br />
<br />
I always tank VZ because our other tanks are lazy and dislike spamming a key over and over again. The only times I lose aggro is when I die or some silly melee engages at 100percent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>bractos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Click snare items (swollen fungusbeast gland, sceptre of the forlorn).   Best way to keep him on the MT and from jumping the clerics if he stuns your MT  instead of the RT  early on.     Pretty common knowledge and something you likely know already.<br />
<br />
Vallon is a pain, and it is a hell of a feeling beating him the first time,  almost as big a rush as that first tallon kill.   The first Rallos was the biggest for me though, even more than Quarm, he's a beast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Clicky items are one way to do it, but that is more work then is really needed.<br />
<br />
Our first Time Rallos kill was my high point also, I had those few but great feelings of yay-ness that I rarely get in EQ these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well we killed VZ and broke into phase 5.  Then killed CT and Bertox and wiped on RZ at 50% then our time ran out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hehe,I got lucky and one tanked TZ this weekend on our first day trying him.Blew a lot of di's and wore out the $$ healers.VZ got us at at about 70 pct ....sigh.Gawd, those guys pound the stuffin outa me. :eek:</div></div><hr />
