<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what is the difference between a 100dd and 100LT?  other then you get healed for 100hp on LT?   if we could choice between the two .... wouldn't it make sense to pick the one that heals also?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are right, but iirc the DDs you can buy do more damage than the lifetaps do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In addition, to the extent you are talking about the Ykesha DD's, you get the stun as well.  That stun is worth 19103983749409HP of lifetap. <br />
<br />
I think the lifetap was thrown in there for the non-MT classes.  SKs and Pallys will love it (they aren't dependant on their weapons when they are the MT); and rogues will probably also be happy little clams. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't touch one of those procs with a 10-foot pole.  Like 100HP doesn't blow my skirt up when mobs are hitting me for 1k+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What if your not mt but taking aoe dam, 100 lt might come in handy if your on the mobs butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">but taking aoe dam<br />

Hold off on this one. Wait for the jury to come back in. Why?<br />
<br />
I just read something that contradicts what I'd seen earlier. Looks like Spell Guard may work on AEs and DoTs after all. If so this would be &gt; LT IMO if you aren't looking for aggro or DPS.<br />
<br />
Spell Guard IV would give you a 5% reduction in spell damage over 4,000 total spell damage or 5 mins (whichever is shorter). And, if they stack it the way I think they should/would, a 2nd proc would overwrite the first Spell Guard so you'd always have a 5% reduction in spell damage. The disadvantage is it woudln't stack with Bulwark of Alendar (20% over 8k total spell damage).<br />
<br />
If anyone can confirm that Spell Guard DOES indeed affect DoTs and AEs please post.</div></div><hr />

Uh, nice visual :eek: <br />

If this is a rune like people say it is then it will generate alot of aggro. Lifetaps generate low aggro and add to dps and your hps its like the perfect non-tank proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this is a rune ... it will generate alot of aggro <br />
<br />
Runes don't generate agro like they used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Has to be more aggro than a lifetap~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keep in mind this is only a 5% rune vs. a full-on rune. The aggro differences might be similar to an HoT vs. a Cheal.<br />
<br />
It's still speculation, though, as I said. I have yet to see any reliable information on this yet.</div></div><hr />
