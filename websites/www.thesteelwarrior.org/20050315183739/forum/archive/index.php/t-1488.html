<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onyxgem</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a small guild, and we were thinking about going over and giving NTOV a try.  We have are flagged up to PoT, and have taken down Gly and the Overseerer without any issues most of the time.  <br />
<br />
The Main force most of the time is:<br />
<br />
3 Warriors - 65<br />
2 Chanter - 65  (200 AA's) other like 60<br />
3 Clerics -  (2)65  62<br />
2 Druids - 65<br />
1 Paladin - 62<br />
2 SK's - 65 and 63<br />
3 Monks - 2(65) 1 63<br />
3 Shammys - 2 (65) 1 62<br />
1 BL - 62<br />
1 Mage - 20<br />
1 Ranger - 65 <br />
1 Bard - 65<br />
1 Necro - 65<br />
1 Rogue - 64<br />
<br />
<br />
It would look fairly similar to that.  Alot of that is fairly well equipted but nobody really out of there minds.  Our top tank probably buffed is around 8500 hps.  Other 2 tanks top out at 7k hps.  <br />
<br />
Both of our 65 monks are very good at pulling and splitting mobs and our other monk is getting pretty good at it also.  So not sure we would have much of a problem with Adds.  (ok there is always a chance lol).<br />
<br />
We just figure we would be able to help equip ourselves a bit better in NTOV.  Think we would be able to handle most of the mobs in NToV?<br />
<br />
Is there anything special for any of them we should know about before heading in and trying it?  Like anything in there mezzable if we need to get it mezzed?  What mobs are linked, where would we have the most problems with adds?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />

<br />
1 Mage - 20<br />
<br />
is a typo...  Can't get into the zone if it's not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rest should be cake...read the strats for a couple of them and yer GTG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many guilds your size have problems with Aary still..if you get by her your on your way.. <br />
<br />
Vyemm and Lady Nev will be your biggest challenges then; Vyemm due to his only being able to be disease slowed and AE knockback interrupting casts and Lady Nev due to her whirl till your hurl ae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That force should tear NToV apart. Guide on TT took out Aary on their first try recently with 14. Even Aary is a shadow of her former self with mudflation.</div></div><hr />
