I use the Sars 4 melee UI and recently when I have to assist I hit my hot key and wait for the call before attacking the mob and still have a problem with targeting the add. It is getting frustrating and I am not intirely sure it is all my fault. Any ideas or know of any causes, could you please post. Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN Bard out pulling, gives his inc message. I assist. I check and see that I am assisting targeted mob, for example a phosphorescent golem. Bard comes through door, has an elemental defender with him also. Bard brings mobs to me in middle of room. I'm still on golem. hit attack/taunt/my own target message/incite/kick. Look up and I have the earthen defender targeted. after fight, scroll back, see my target message calls the earthen defender. My LDoN group, especially the Bard bless him have adapted and he'll just mez whatever I don't call out. But this does not go over so well with pick-up exp/adventure groups</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked on Sony's TNZ board, and actually got several cognizant helpful replies. In my case, I had mapped auto attack to the &quot;`&quot; key next to the number 1 key, not remembering there was a patch back in October that had assigned the same key to target nearest mob. Next time in game I will look and see if both are mapped to same key. Much more helpful than &quot;LDON sucks ass&quot; was</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can give you one possibility about that re-targeting problem.<br />
<br />
At some point, one of the patches remapped my hotkeys and added F8 to my attack.  So, when I press attack, I automatically re-target whatever is nearest to me, which is not necessarily what I had targeted before.  Check your keyboard mapping, this might solve your problem.<br />
<br />
As an aside, 95% of the time, it's very useful to have attack and F8 mapped together.  The other 5%, it's a royal PITA.</div></div><hr />

I too have noticed my target changing on me and the mapped F8 key would explain alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakatsu</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys, really appreciate all the input.  Abividad and I seem to have the same exact problem and my attack is (`) as well. Gonna check the keyboard mapping. Man you guys rock!, if this is the problem. If it's not, then you still rock but just take the exclamation point off the end. :D</div></div><hr />
