<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a lvl 50 barb warrior..I havent played him in a long, long long time, I even went so far as to strip all his gear way back.  My cousin quit eq and dumped 100k on me..What a pal!  Anyways, What do you reccomend for a lvl 50 Tank..Where should his ac and hp be at this level and what should I concentrate on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hola-<br />
<br />
A couple suggestions below, hope they help.  The short answer is to shoot for about 1200+AC by your mid 50's, should be very doable nowdays.  After that, go for HP and some type of aggro weapon and you should be good to go.<br />
<br />
-decide what you want to use your warrior for.  I.e. MT in a raiding guild (at whatever level of raids), tanking for pickup groups, tanking with a family guild, etc.  Keep this in mind when you make your equipment decisions.<br />
<br />
-don't buy anything you can reasonably camp yourself or with friends in a few hours, unless you just can't be bothered.  Camping for upgrade gear should get you XP and levels, and perhaps more PP to dump into gear.<br />
<br />
-browse a site like magelo or allakazams (sp?) to see what is available for your race/class/level combination.  Might be a pay site, but iirc magelo is like twelve bucks a year, and the search interface is pretty spiffy.<br />
<br />
-CAREFULLY consider what you buy, especially items with REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED levels.  I personally wouldn't buy anything with a required level much greater than your current level unless it was a really smoking deal; prices tend to drop over time.  In some cases tho, buying &quot;recommended&quot; level gear greater than your level and growing into it can be quite cost effective.<br />
<br />
-don't buy anything right away just because it's for sale; select the bits you are interested in and watch the bazaar prices for awhile to see what high/low prices for those items are.  That way if you see a good deal, you can grab it, and if you don't you'll at least know you aren't getting ripped off.  There's usually a LOT of quite good LDoN gear for sale, and some player made gear is quite good as well.<br />
<br />
-purchasing priority: this is a tough one, depends on what you want to do with your warrior.  Depending on your preferences, you'll probably end up with some mix of the following: HP gear, AC gear, DPS weapons, utility items.  Tons has been written about the tradeoffs of HP vs. AC, but a decent target is 1200ish+ AC by your mid 50's.  That should be good enough for most all the content thru LoY + regular LDoNs.<br />
<br />
-You really want to be &quot;smart&quot; about your purchases if that is your budget, you could blow almost the whole 100k on a single item (fungi tunic, hate proc weapons) and end up with... a useless warrior with a single nice item.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some, pretty much common sense stuff, but never hurts to write it down. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd price haste for a week or so (along with cultural armor) first. But enough haste, then see how much pp you have left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, I really appreciate it.  Ive got some loot saved up and still have my sword of the bloodsworn..I may even try to get a good 1hB and work my skill up with that..or maybe a bow..Ive never even thought about using that..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lionk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are going to play a Warrior, you will have to keep aggro and be able to take a beating.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what deity you are, but if you are an RZ worshipper, get some Fierce Heraldic armor for high AC, some HP and stats. If not RZ, get your cultural armor which would be similar to FH armor.<br />
<br />
Mainhand Copper Hammer of Striking with Sword of the Bloodsworn in the offhand.<br />
<br />
Utilities<br />
Get yourself a silken whip of ensnaring, a group of friends, and go camp the Armsman in OS for the Truncheon of Doom. It procs a 50% slow.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Greaves or Incarnadine BP for right click invis, or keep a bunch of invis potions.<br />
<br />
Should be a good start for you, have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with just about everything that Lionk advised with one tiny modification.<br />
<br />
I chose to mainhand the Sword of the Bloodsworn and offhand the Copper Hammer. I give up 104 pts of proc damage, but the stun in the SotB actually lands. For the folks I group with most often, interrupting casters is more important than the small amount of extra DPS.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary. :-)<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />
