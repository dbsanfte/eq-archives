<br />
Anyway I was thinking, Critical hits are nuttin but eye candy for the most part, why not give ONLY critical hits a + hate modifier?  Would make critical hits actually worth something, as well as making some of our aa's a lil less worthless.   Perhaps it should apply only to warriors, as other classes that get melee crit's can either get agro by other means or dont want it to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they did this they would have to most likely adjust the discipline Mighty Strike. All you do is Crit for 14 seconds. I like the idea personally but I could hear the whining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and it would make Mighty Strike actually usefull...<br />
<br />
you get massive aggro... but no defensive disc to back it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats actually not a bad idea. If we use mightystrike we have to wait a long time for Disc to refresh. Might be something to think about maybe make crits double the normal aggro of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Previn</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would make the critical hit AAs um, well, terrible for every class but pal/war/sk, rogues and monks want massive aggro? ewww.  Maybe add like a seperate warrior AA adding hate to THEIR criticals, but not just mess with criticals in general.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oops, missed your last sentence =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glorf</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally i don't think i could agree to say simply &quot;It should only work for warriors&quot; either it should work for everyone and you would simply have to use the warriors ability to maintain more crits when having the same AA level, or you could say it would not work for AA crits, that would prevent non warriors from criting, but the problem then is how do you decern a warrior's normal crit from a warrior AA crit... if there is a difference in the programing easy to apply, if there is no difference in the programing would probably never get used this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackulle</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saying it should only work for non AA crits and saying it should only work for warriors = the same thing.  Warriors were previously the only class that had normal critical hits before AA, which leads me to beleive that perhaps we should get some sort of a bonus for being the only original crit hitters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glorf</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is one slight difference, if you say it should only work for warriors then even AA warrior crits would count, Personally I can't say as that would be a fair change, if Non AA crits are the only ones that do it then yes warriors are the only ones to get it, but not ALL warrior crits will count if you have AA...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Non-AA crits would include Ranger Bow Crits.  Just imagine tacking aggro onto those 900 point crits every few seconds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FarlanderB</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would the aggro be proportional to the damage? Or simply a base +hate equal to X for every crit? I think a standard value would ease the burden of the 2k criticals from rangers and rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Change it,<br />
Warriors no longer deal critical hits like other Classes do...<br />
<br />
but instead, they deal Cringing Blow or something ;p....<br />
<br />
instead of being just a damage bonus, it has the hate addition as stated above.<br />
Make it that warriors go from Criticals to Cringing at level 45 or so.<br />
<br />
And Crippling Blows would double the hate.<br />
<br />
Bunnie has dealt a Cringing Blow (172)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only major problem I see with this is in a raid situation where there are multiple warriors. <br />
<br />
With no ability to turn off crits the other warriors would have to sit out the fight for fear of ping-pong aggro on the boss mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Previn</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe make it a timered buff, like the Beastlord feral rage thingy, make it stack with everything, and just add hate to every crit/crip.  Make it have a 15min recast with a 15 min duration.  Make it a warrior AA in the class teir. Thus, you could choose for it not to be active.  Name it like Critical Mastery or something</div></div><hr />

I like the timed part, but another AA to get? Maybe if they unlock the discs it could be used that way to be a more general fix for the warrior class.</div></div><hr />
