I would have thought they did, but someone told me they didn't.  Anyone know for sure?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lykke</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before U at least got the xp though. Then U could PL a low char fast with it, but now if the mob dies of ds compleatly like a rat in Wfreeport and U don't get to do ANY hit the mob before it die's, the mob just wanish and no one gets the xp. I have herd from diff peps that Verant tried once to add agro on DS, but that mainly solwed the agro-problem compleatly so that go removed fast :(<br />
<br />
So the Rule on DS these days is:<br />
NO agro from DS<br />
NO xp from a compleat ds kill<br />
The DS damage goes to none's damge-counter at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why don't U just try the newbie trick<br />
<br />
Make a lvl 1 newbie. <br />
Use a slow 2hs or 2hb (DON'T train that skill!!). <br />
Make someone DS you.<br />
When that rat is killed compleatly by DS without U hitting the mob, the rat will wanish from the face of Norrath. <br />
<br />
That means none eaven gets the dmg-count any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but it's a good thing to, imagine the druid/mage in the group casting group ds. shaman slows gets resisted and  agros the mob. now not only would he have the slow agro but the dps agro from the ds. so a ds not creating agro is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okies 3 things.<br />
<br />
1. Group DS is pointless at higher levels, and GOD I hated people who did it at lower levels too :) It was almost as if they wanted their casters to get hit by the mob...All this for less Damage per hit too for more mana /boggle<br />
<br />
2. It has always been that way forever. You must do one point of damage to the mob to get some exp.<br />
<br />
3. If DS could assign the same value of agro that it does in Damage to the tank it is on, it would have made a TON of content starting from Vindicator onward much much easier to learn.<br />
<br />
That being said, most of that stuff has been trivialized by AA's, etc anyways...and now a days, I would love to see the DS dmg added to the MA's agro generation.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's also the fact that group DS hits the caster so they can be sure when it's fading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">09-27-2003, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not assigned aggro but i've always found it does help make mobs stickier. Used to be able to tell a big difference if I didn't have it on Emperor or Seru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not refreshing every few mins = laziness hee hee<br />
<br />
Knowing when it is fading = you lost more DPS from it hitting 4 pts less every time than the 5 seconds it takes you to re-cast it when someone tells you it is fading.<br />
<br />
On the margin, it doesn't really matter, just a personal gripe as a warrior :)</div></div><hr />
