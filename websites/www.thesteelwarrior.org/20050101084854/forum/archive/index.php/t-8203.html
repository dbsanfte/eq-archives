But, no matter the strength of the warrior, I dont have any experience to back the warrior up. Could you guys post everything I should need to know???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Attack, Kick, Taunt, Incite. Repeat for each new mob. <br />
Only Taunt when you lose aggro. <br />
Incite is only needed usually at the beginning of the fight. <br />
Plunk arrows into mobs as they are inc. <br />
Use Furious to save yourself from dieing for 8 seconds of the heal will be late.<br />
<br />
And so on</div></div><hr />

The dumbest question is the one not asked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question ... have you played eq before and if so how much and what classes?<br />
<br />
ie- are you a real newb or just a warrior newb?? if you hvae some basic eq knowledge then you'll catch on fast .. there isnt anything overly complicated about being a warrior.  Mostly it is just about getting your feet wet and going out to actually do it.</div></div><hr />

So make sure you have some agro weapons.  One thing I have found to work in groups is to taunt+incite after a mob is slowed or tashed.  If I can get agro after that, I normally don't have a problem.<br />
<br />
Anger Augs are your friend, get them for your weapons. If you don't have anything better, LDoN provides good gear and good learing experience for you.</div></div><hr />

If you've had a high-level character before you should be able to pick it up pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />
