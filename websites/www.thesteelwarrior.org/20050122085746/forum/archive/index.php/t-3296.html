<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't get the chance to ask the taunt question, another warrior beat me to it.  The response was IDENTICAL to the last FF response (i.e., when we create a button, we know it ought to actually do something in game and, no, this button doesn't.  We are working on it.)  He went on to admit that the state of some melee was &quot;embarassing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Although we were specifically told not to bring up class balance, I questioned Scott's promise to fix melee balance given the brand new released product messed up itemization even further by giving knights the identical AC/HP on gear and augmentations.  They, again, said they were looking into it. (Which just fucking ignores the fact that they've BEEN looking into it for months and promise to look into it in the future, but in between those two statements they made an armor itemization system in LDON that refutes both, wtf).<br />
<br />
Okay.<br />
<br />
The only really good statement came when a caster whined about spells and asked whether they were looking into XYZ spell for ABC class.  Scott replied with something like &quot;Honestly, we don't have any intention to further mess with the caster classes until we've completed our melee revamp.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's my report.  You can read the transcript at some point or other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">magnes</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was in this forum also, it was informative. i and a few others sat and drank with some devs in the hotel bar and they seemed to find int. casters whining very funny and realy did seem to thing warriors needed some work and asked our oppinion on them and what warriors needed. i unloaded on them (being one of two warriors at the table) on dev took many notes the other nodded alot and said much of what i had to say was &quot;one the table&quot; now.<br />
maybe, its starting to sink in....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to wonder why so much side stepping and refusal to discuss the topic?  Do they always treat class balance questions so off handly or are Warriors just lucky that way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same reason the president dodges any questions about weapons of mass destruction.<br />
<br />
There ain't no class balance going on and they fuckin know it.  Their refusal to talk about it proves it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they were working on it, you'd think they'd like to hear the opinions of the people who have been playing said class for a while, and knew the way they worked.  Asking people to not speak about it to me shows that they are just trying to go the &quot;If we ignore it then it will go away&quot; route.  Sure, they'll probably do something, but in my mind if they refuse to hear the facts, then they'll just screw up again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was pretty clear to me from the way that several other questions were answered that the staff is currently working on a graphics engine reconfig.  Numerous questions were answered with a sly &quot;we can't really talk about it, but we are implimenting a new system that will address that question.&quot;  There was no need to be so sly since the entire graphical engine revamp was discussed in detail in various magazine articles provided in propoganda with our FF materials. <br />
<br />
The new engine is due out around December (i.e., Christmas presents).  So, yeah, we know exactly what the dev staff is working on.  And it ain't flippin' warriors. <br />
<br />
Although the brisk shut-down of any caster request was rather refreshing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going to copy the lyrics to the song &quot;the sidestep&quot; from the movie &quot;the best little whorehouse in texas,&quot; but couldn't find them.  It seems like that best represents the current stand of the dev team with regards to Warriors...  It starts off something like, &quot;Oh I like to dance a little sidestep.  Now they see me, now they don't, I've come and gone....&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yet agian, no one asked about the peircing cap. :(<br />
<br />
I swear I would have to go to one of these fan fare thingies just to ask that question...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, I hope they change the Troll models to not totally SUCK.  And put in battle animations for Trolls that actually look somewhat decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wish they'd reconfigure the system to make innate abilities and commands (like the discipline system) more easy to implement and add than how it is now.  It sounds like they must go through a ton of old code to add stuff for pure melee (emphasis on &quot;sounds like&quot;).  Yet, the system for adding new spells is very simple and quick.  Wish they'd set up the system where not only new spells, but new abilities could be added without major changes.<br />
<br />
This is the only thread I've seen on any board dealing with the FF.  It wasn't really that good, was it?  I've heard almost no information from it other than here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the forums were on other games like EQ2 or Planetside, or on the LDON expansion.  Only a couple of EQ Live forums.  And before they took questions they instructed us not to ask questions about class balance.  <br />
<br />
So, no, it wasn't that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The public's chance to raise questions with the Dev's - so long as the questions are those that the Dev's want to answer.<br />
<br />
/laff :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">folks, the thing is, online, on web pages, they can ignore it and side step it and say &quot;well its a big internet, we cant read everything!&quot; but when they have fan fairs and enough people bring it up they HAVE to answer, now they may not call on you again but if more people in the aud. say something after they get picked out of the crowd they get flustered enough to talk about future plans.<br />
<br />
sony makes money off of fan fairs, and the most loyal EQers go to them(so they think) so they do listen, but it takes you buying some of their sitty mugs and tee shirts first</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those new spells look to be a tradeskill made item that simply increases mana pool.  Doesn't even stack with KEI, as KEI already has a mana pool increase in same slot.</div></div><hr />

perhaps that is a paladin group buff for mana regen, perhaps they are narfing paladins into pure utility spots like bards /shurg</div></div><hr />
