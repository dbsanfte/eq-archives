However, with the advent of PoP and the parses done by some showing that whilst there were gains to be made post 1400 ac up to 2000 ac, they were not hugely significant, i am wondering where the equation now lies for those above 1250 ac.<br />
<br />
what do you all think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you aren't raiding things that AE, or aren't going to be soon, then AC is mroe important.</div></div><hr />

1k AC and 5500 HP won't be nearly as useful as 1500 AC and 4500 HP.<br />
<br />
Although that's just from looking at the AC tests in The Library.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

Anywho, I'm not putting on 5AC 55 hp Chokidai shoulders even tho they have some of the most hps for the buck (11k on my server and 15STA 55 hps = a lot).<br />
<br />
I'm not wearing barbed dragon pauldrons anymore either, found a cheaper better alternative (mantle of ill omen 12AC 5STA 35hps and 10 poi 10 dis).<br />
<br />
If there is some sort of equation in my upgrade path it's an eyeball old-school grandma-cookin-teh-pie sorta thing not a scientific measurement :P<br />
<br />
In all cases where I'm able to I sub in +HP gear for roughly equivalent +STA gear, minding that the AC doesn't go too far the downside.<br />
<br />
Matter fact if it wasn't for the 18AC hit, I'd bought barbed rubi pants :P</div></div><hr />

Also could some one look at my magelo and suggest where I should go from here on my AA's?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 displayed AC is somewhere between 5-6HP if you've at least 9000 HP buffed.  Obviously this only applies to tanking (AC don't reduce AE damage at all).<br />
<br />
How much an AC is worth is actually dependent on how much HP you have.  For example if you only have 1000 HP, then if you add enough AC to cut down average damage by half, you'd only gain an effective 1000 HP.  Now if you have 10000 HP, for the same amount of AC you basically gain 10000 HP.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking most gear are balanced between both.  Since 0 AC 150 HP item or 70 AC 0 HP item don't really exist, it's usually just common sense and pick the best balanced item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elvenphox01</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, the people that continually say HP &gt; All with no clarifying information do not offer anything useful. Obviously HP are needed but to just claim HP is the only thing worthwhile is just plain retarded. 100AC and 10HP is clearly superior to something with 10AC and 30HP despite the latter having more HP. But what if the numbers are closer? At some point, there is a shady area where at first glance it is not so easy to tell which stat to sacrifice for the other.<br />
<br />
Here is my 2cp on that matter:<br />
Parses have indicated that there is an aproximate mitigation gain of 4 percent for every 100ac ranging from 1200ac all the way to 2000+. This is going to vary slightly depending on the mobs DI/DB, but lets say on average, damage taken is reduced by 4 percent per 100 raw AC. Now your ability to tank is also dependent on HP, but every tank has a different amount of HP when buffed. So to determine the HP/AC optimal tradeoff value, you take your target raid-buffed HP (for me that will be about 7khp because i currently have about 6400hp buffed) and calculate 4 percent of that. For me, that 4 percent of 7k is 280HP. We then equate this 280HP to 100 raw ac. 100ac=280HP ----&gt; 1AC=2.8HP<br />
<br />
It makes sense that it would vary for each tank because the same amount of HP will deliver a smaller percentage of gain the larger amount of HP the tank has. So for example, if the tank has 9khp buffed up, AC will be relatively more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you get 4% damage reduced per 100 AC, then if you have 10K HP that's sort of like getting 400 more HP, but since 1 raw AC is worth a bit more than 1 displayed AC, I'd estimate the actual value of 1AC to be around 6 HP.<br />
<br />
Of course, reducing damage is better than having more HP.  Reducing damage by 50% is the same as having 100% more HP, so in that respect, given 10K HP, you get an effective 10000 HP for having 1250 AC... or roughly 1 AC = 8 HP.  Of course, this is slightly an overestimate since the last points of AC are worth more than the first and you're unlikely to just add an 1250 AC on demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elvenphox01</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your point about damage reduction being more valuable than HP increase is technically valid. I failed to mention it because at a low percent (4% marginal increase in mitigation) the effect of this is also low. To be more exact and to account for this effect, a target HP of 10k leads to the equation 1AC=4.17HP; and a target of 5k gives 1AC=2.08HP<br />
<br />
You also mentioned that the AC listed on an item actually gives 1.5x the AC. By raw AC I did mean the adjusted AC, apparently I switched around the term &quot;raw&quot; by mistake. <br />
<br />
And as a final note, these equations are very dependent on the 4% mitigation factor I mentioned. This amount could be wrong. I have not parsed any data and reached that conclusion on my own. I simply took what others have said and proceeded on as if that info were true. The ultimate point is that there are very real tradeoffs and it would be folly to dismiss a significant amount of AC for a smaller amount of HP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would imagine that ac is constantly beneficial, rather than in discrete chunks of 50. It is easiest, for the purposes of statistical testing, to use large jumps in ac to test whether or not there is a trend. <br />
<br />
  That being said, it's going to be near impossible to tell if there are, and what the exact number is if there is one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a tough call ...<br />
<br />
Black Sapphire Electrum Earring ...<br />
<br />
Or Vah Shir Claw Earring?<br />
<br />
I just swapped out from BSEE to Vah Shir Claw, then the next day got a Jagged Bone Hoop in the newly opened Chardok B ... so I never really got to gauge which was better.<br />
<br />
All I do know is, I was never happy with the low AC on the BSEE's.</div></div><hr />

Back in teh day I had diamondines, then got orc fang, then went BSEE and had those until the solstice earring / BM earrings I got now.</div></div><hr />
