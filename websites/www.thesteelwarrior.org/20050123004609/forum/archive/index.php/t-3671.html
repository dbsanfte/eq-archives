<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">same question over and over, and therefore i deeply apologize if it has already been answered (just point me the thread as i didn't find my answer :b)<br />
<br />
i commonly use BoC + Shortblade of Lightning for tanking and pulling agro purposes.<br />
<br />
i'll soon get my hands on a Swiftblade of Zek and i can also manage to put a group or two to go get myself a Copper Hammer of Striking.<br />
<br />
so here is the list :<br />
BoC<br />
SoL<br />
SoZ<br />
CHoS<br />
<br />
which combo would you recommend me to try and glue the mob on me (and thus humiliate all those nasty knights :b) ?<br />
AND if you recommend me BoC + CHoS should i put the CHoS primary or secondary ? the BoC as laughable proc ratio... that's why i ask :b<br />
<br />
<br />
and another question, i'll get to be the main rampage on most mobs fo my guild.<br />
i, for now, use the SoL and a Zek Crested Buckler. the shield is nice and i don't see an upgrade before long, so that's not my point.<br />
which weapon should i use : SoL ? BoC ? SoZ ? CHoS ?<br />
<br />
once again i'm really sorry to annoy with my questions but... i need answers :b<br />
<br />
thx in advance<br />
<br />
ps : magelo is up to date</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The BOC has just as good a proc rate as the CHoS or any other weapon.  Read the threads recently which went to great effort to show this with numbers, and not anecdote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i'll read the post...<br />
<br />
but as for my questions... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely use the BoC in mainhand and the CHoS in offhand.  The hate generated by the BoC proc is infinitely superior to that of the CHoS.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with the BoCs proc rate.  On average it procs for me at least a couple of times per mob, sometimes up to 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
Aggro for a warrior is best generated through the use of procs, not dps, so the CHoS with its stun+DD proc is the choice for offhand, not the non-proc weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">point taken.<br />
i've read a few msgs about the proc rates in fact... weird how numbers are different from how things appear to us :p<br />
<br />
and about the &quot;rampage combo&quot; ? i'd go for Swiftblade of Zek + Zek Crested Buckler... nice extra AC/HP... do you guys think of another good (better ? :p) combo from my list ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a rampage tank, why not just get yourself a good DPS 2h weapon like a windblade or a WMBS? You can still do your job effectively and do some DPS while you're at it. Unless you are fighting mobs where AC over 1200 makes a significant difference, there is no point in equiping a shield to rampage tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a WMBS... but i fall below the 1200AC.<br />
<br />
currently my guild mainly needs a rampage tank for vindic, the extra hp/ac brought by the sword/shield combo comes handy as we are a little low on healers :/<br />
<br />
and also, i've heard that a rampage tank should use low agro weapon not to mess the rampage and hate lists up, and as for now, i still manage to gain agro over an epic war 61 with my WMBS :/<br />
<br />
but i'll give your advice a try, i'm here to learn :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe.....<br />
<br />
Get ONE (1) more level 58 or higher shaman or druid into your guild!<br />
<br />
Ta da! You can now do DPS and you win every time wheeeeeee<br />
<br />
Alternative options:<br />
<br />
Get some levels. Get some AA's.<br />
<br />
Any of which should take a week to 14 days and will be 1000x more useful than equipping a shield :)<br />

SoZ is hardly that great anymore really.</div></div><hr />
