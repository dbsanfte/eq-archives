Most of the infomation I find on the net seems to be rather vague and we have lots of nice posts around here, but none of them actually give her exact location.  I've taken a group into SG a few times now and had a look around, mostly in the area of the siren tower where High Priestess Sercema spawns (heading right under the water after zone in).  After a few trips I brought my tracker over and camped him out at the SG/CS zone line and have been tracking 3-4 times a day for this mob and have yet to see her.  So I have just a few questions:<br />
<br />
1.  Can anyone confirm that she does still spawn?<br />
2.  Where exactly does she spawn?  Get specific with me please :)<br />
3.  Does she have a PH?  If not, whats her spawn time?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

We were doing the circuit around the south/east which gives access to that castle via some bridges over the water.  She was visible when looking into the castle from either of the bridges, so going from memory, I think that means she was in the NW corner.  It was a normal siren spawn point from what I could tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zorum</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">She still spawns, I killed her last week.  Take a right when you zone in from CS, keep going straight past the tower with the hanging bridges and the next room area to the east will have an above ground building/castle.  She has been spawning in that building/castle and she does have PH where she can spawn.<br />
<br />
She is a chanter so she tashs, mezzes, and charms from time to time.  Hits for about 350.  watch push mobs like to get stuck in the water in the front wall for the above ground part.</div></div><hr />

I think thats where I found her when I got my mask. I dont remember if there was a ph since she was up but I would guess she does have one. Good luck.<br />

As said take the right and head under the water, go around the siren tower and swim further down till the land ramps up from water to a building. She spawns on a platform or rock in the middle of that room.</div></div><hr />
