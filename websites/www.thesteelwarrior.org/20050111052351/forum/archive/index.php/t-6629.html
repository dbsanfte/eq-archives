<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing it's like a rage meter. The more angry they get the higher their water boils until the cover pops and the steam is released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have actually run into this on some mobs in Qin, it did seem to be an AE Rampage. Only occured when the mob was low HP, but then they died fast so....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing that infuriate is a multi target triggerred rampage.   It's not quite the same as AE rampage, because many people in rage and on the mob's hate list don't get hit or even swung at during infuriate, just a large group of people.<br />
<br />
AE Rampage is the biggest misnomer in EQ anyhow, no mobs actually &quot;AE Rampage&quot;, they simply have a rampage list that's large enough to include everyone on the hate list.  If you didnt' do something to actively get on an &quot;AE Rampage&quot; mob's hatelist by either performing a detrimental act on the mob, or performing a beneficial act on someone who was performing a detrimental act on the mob, then you will NOT be hit by the &quot;AE Rampage&quot;.   I used to stand next to RZTW the entire fight and not get hit when I was tank #2 because I simply didn't engage.  The same is true with any AE Rampage mob... be it Fennin, Ginto, Hinvats, whatever... if you haven't performed an active act to get on the mob's hatelist, you will NOT be hit by it.<br />
<br />
Based on what I've seen, infuriate is similar to AE Rampage, but the list is simply shorter than AE Ramp, and the mob can leave off a number of people.</div></div><hr />

I've never been hit by it and I jump into the fight right after the MT. I think it's frontal only, or her melee range is so short that I can attack from far enough away. Anyone know? Just tossing out an example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andrath</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saryrn in time does not AE rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I meant Saryrn in PoTorment as the example. It just seems to me that mobs with AE rampage never hit me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a limit to how far away a mob can hit you with rampage.  Usually mobs that have AE rampage don't hit quite as far as their hitbox allows you to hit them.<br />
<br />
AE rampage never hits anyone not on the aggro list but that's only useful if you're afk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember sitting under Fennin as a placeholder for where all the people contributing to push were to keep him, so it can rarely come in handy, but no not real practical overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saryrn in Torment has a normal AE rampage; she'll still hit those not at max melee behind her. As someone stated, you have to be on the mob's hatelist to get on the AE rampage.  As a rogue, I can run in and grab bodies and not get hit by AE ramp until I get on the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, infuriate is similair to bertox in codecay's rampage.  While infuriate allows the mob to hit multiple targets, it dosen't hit *everyone* in melee range.  Kind of like Bertoxx's rampage, where he can hit 3 or 4 targets, I forget how many exactly.  The distance on the infuriate rampage is also very limited, so it's not hard to avoid.  Just play it smart with where you fight the mob and you should have no problems with the rampage.  As far as people not being on the rampage list during fights -- crowd control teams and pallies in the LoH line-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormbear</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks to be 8 targets<br />
Also seems to be a disc. I have not timed it but from when you see &quot;so and so is infuriated&quot; til &quot;so and so is no longer infuriated&quot; I have seen the mobs get 1 -2 ramps in.<br />
<br />
Very amusing to watch the rogues and monks get raped</div></div><hr />
