<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to get some 50s folks in my guild interested in doing Veksar a bit more; some of these folks are alts, but a few are melee mains without a lot of pp. Having a lootable enduring breath item would be handy for some of them (both for Veksar and later) &amp; I'm wondering if any of you have some suggestions for that (other than the bazaar, where drops I know are pretty steady, heh).<br />
I know about Hadden in QH, who is easy to kill but a pretty darn rare spawn.<br />
I know there's a quest out of Katta involving the Shissar organs--I think this can be done killing a shissar in Echo Caverns, and is the easiest EB I know of (still involves a bit of running around, though). (Ah, this shows up in a search of this site, too.)<br />
Anything easier for folks this level? Quests, solo or small group of low 50s would be best, though tradeable EB drops that require a higher level helper would be okay. Obviously, the easier the mob, the more certain the drop and the fewer the man hours the better (duh). Would rather some of these folks fought for and looted their own gear in this case, though.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Sells in the bazaar for 10-20k on my server. Or you can camp lodizal in iceclad for the part and complete the quest for it in cobalt scar. A full group of solid 50's could probably take him out. I can duo him with any healer easily. Catching him up is tough as he's just about perma camped. He's on a roughly 11.5 hr spawn time, and spawns just south of the boat gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyrfalcon</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some easy to get No Drop EB items (a neck and Ancient Fishing Pole) in Siren's Grotto that can be easily accomplished with a single group of 50+ characters, as well as the relatively easy to complete quest for the Amulet of the Grey. There is even an inexpensive (less than 400 points) LDON type 2 augment that gives EB, though you will have to have an item with a type 2 slot for it to fit into. It's also handy to have a mage to summon EB items for the group/raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a type 7 EB augment in Guk for 510 points. That's the best impact one, especially in an item slot that doesn't have many options such as bracers or gloves.<br />
<br />
  Other than that, the EB neck quest from Katta is easy. I'd suggest you get over to the Gray using EB spells, and just kill lots of shissar. You can get various upgrades in that zone off of named, in addition to very decent exp for 50s. The necks can be MQ'd as well, as I recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diminia</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amulet of the Grey Wastes (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31744) is the one I have on my Main.  The quest is very easy.  Kill Shissar in the Grey until you get 3 of their organs and then turn them into a guy in Katta.<br />
<br />
The quest is as follows:<br />
<br />
The quest starts with Drenic Garrison on the Moon of Luclin in <br />
Katta Castellum. Drenic can be found within the great hall (the one with the huge red carpet), and his location is approximatly 283, 32.<br />
<br />
'Hail, Drenic Garrison' <br />
<br />
Drenic Garrison says 'Greetings Bodi! I am Drenic Garrison, Governor of Science here in Katta Castellum. I am currently involved in several scientific endeavors with the other governors and am in need of assistance supplying my researchers with the proper [materials and samples] for their studies. <br />
<br />
'What materials and samples?' <br />
<br />
Drenic Garrison says 'The Magus Conlegium are assisting with some studies on the physiology of the Vampyres of the Coterie of the Eternal Night and are in need of [ash and blood] samples. Maralicis Dilsm our Governor of Health is assisting in research on [counteragents] to the venom and diseases native to Luclin. Finally, there have been reports from the agents of Erikal Wolfeye that there is a civilization of [snake people] that live on the furthest reaches of the light side of Luclin in a region devoid of atmosphere. <br />
<br />
<br />
'What snake people?' <br />
<br />
Drenic Garrison says 'To the west beyond the Twilight Sea is an airless grey region between the light and dark sides of Luclin. Some time ago our scouts cooperating with powerful members of the Magus Conlegium attempted to chart the expanses of the barren treacherous region. During this excursion the scouts and magi encountered a small group of strange snake like men. The magi detected no magical aid that was allowing the creatures to move freely in the airless void without danger of suffocation. When approached the snake men quickly fled. We wish to know how these creatures survive in such conditions. If they prove to be a hostile species then we will have to resort to examining their [anatomy]. <br />
<br />
'What anatomy?' <br />
<br />
Drenic Garrison says 'I wish to examine the lungs or whatever breathing organs these creature have. It would not be prudent to hunt and kill a living member of this species and society we know practically nothing about but there are several undead snake men in the region as well. I will require three such organs however to perform the proper experiments. <br />
<br />
<br />
However, if you do not have EB to get the oragns from the Grey(Which requires you to have EB to be in the zone) you might want to turn and go EC and kill the TaskMaster over and over again until you get the organs.  My guild just take a couple of groups to the Grey and lay slaughter to the snakes and come out with two or three people getting the organs for the amulet.<br />
<br />
Option two, you can go kill Lodizal for Lodizal Shell Shield (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22816) .  Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taskmaster Torkazh (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7129) in Echo Caverns also drops organs.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also theres a new(ish) tradeskilled ring velium blue diamond ring maybe? since GoD they upped the stats to where its like 65hp/mana with enduring breath which definately isnt shabby for people in the 50s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/bow to all<br />
thanks for the speed of and detail in your responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taskmaster Torkazh (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7129) in Echo Caverns also drops organs.  :)<br />
<br />
I too have heard Tork drops organs but they seem to be obscenely rare, I pop in and kill him when i'm near as does another guildmate of mine, but not a single organ drop in about 20 kills. So the Grey is much better for a gearing session.<br />
<br />
Also be wary that killing Torkazh can spawn Xilniov (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7235) which would cause some serious problems to the unprepared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knotte Turtlebone ring is another option as well as Shissar Eye earing?<br />
<br />
Both of these have EB iirc.  I believe there is a neck item that has EB as an effect dropped from the sirens in Cobalt scar or Sirens grotto as well.  No stats but EB worn iirc and looks like a seashell.  Some have charges but I think one has worn effect.<br />
<br />
Also, can you get EB with tribute?  With being able to turn tribute on and off it cuts down on the cost of using tribute buffs for situational use now.<br />
<br />
Personally though, I did some S Ro Ldons and just bought a type 7 aug with EB.  Unfortunately at lvl 50ish, this may take a lot of dungeons though :(<br />
<br />
One final note, isnt Veskar once inside a zone with air?  I have only been there once. but I do not remember swimming once past the zone in Lake of Ill Omen.  If this is the case, simply buy a stack of fish scales and have a druid or other class capable of buffing the raid with EB for the swim down.<br />

<br />
I haven't been anywhere you need EB. The swim in is the longest and most dangerous and is easily done without EB. There are a couple swims inside but they are all short. EB would make it a lot less stressful for people that aren't confident of where they are going, etc though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dags</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, you can use tribute EB as well.  Gills of Bass is the name and it costs 10 tribute points every 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Veksar is an air zone; the only real swimming you have to do is to get in there (at the bottom of Lake of Ill Omen), which actually does not require an EB if A) you know where you are going or can follow someone without getting lost and B) your swimming skill is above, say 50 (well, that's a guess).<br />
I partly want some of my guildies to get some sort of easy EB piece so that when we get to other places that actually require such things they'll already have it. Normally we have a shaman with us anyway for this, I'm just thinking it would be less hassle if everyone can swim for however long they need to.<br />
Also generally trying to convince people they can kill stuff for their own gear without camping the bazaar, so this is a long-term project, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Grey would probably be your best bet then for non evil races for the Katta quest.  If you hunt by the Scarlet Desert zone you might get a named here or there as well for some other decent items while you are there.<br />

It drops off the Revenant Zsshta.  5 AC +15 hp/mana.  Not a hard item to get at all.<br />

The east and south sides often get trained during raids into ssra due to occasional see invis mobs in traps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EB items are plentiful :) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemswitheffect.html?id=86)</div></div><hr />

Brutal, would you call the IT guys at corporate where I work and explain to them how vital it is that I be allowed to use Lucy searches and sign up at Magelo here at work?<br />
This whole work-while-you're-at-work thing is damn inconvenient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest EB item is a mage waterstone...usually you can 4-5 for a small donation on any given night.<br />
<br />
To get to Veksar you really dont need it...swim on the surface until you are just over the entrance (see in game map).  The swimm is less than 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Within Veksar there is a brief swim between the entry undead area and the deeper dungeon.  But again the swim is 10-15 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would just skip the EB items and use EB tribute when you need EB.  As others have said Veksar doesnt require EB.  In fact the only zones in EQ that require EB are plane of water, the grey and kedge keep.</div></div><hr />
