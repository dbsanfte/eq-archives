<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ugle Smashur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A woman in a hot air balloon realized she was lost. She lowered altitude and spotted a man below. She descended a bit more and shouted, &quot;Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don't know where I am.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man consulted his PLGR (GPS) and replied, &quot;You're are in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation of 2346 feet above sea level. You are 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west longitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be enlisted,&quot; said the balloonist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; replied the man. &quot;How did you know?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; answered the balloonist, &quot;everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost. Frankly, you've not been much help so far.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man responded, &quot;You must be an officer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I am&quot;, replied the balloonist, &quot;but how did you know?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said the man, &quot;you don't know where you are or where you are going. You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. You are lost due to your own incompetence and negligence but you want to blame someone else. The fact is you are in exactly the same position you were in before we met, but now, somehow, it's my fault.&quot; <br />
<br />
Just wanted to share a small part of my life, lol.<br />

<br />
All of it is funny if you can keep from getting stressed out over it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I heard the same joke a while back except for it was republican/democrat instead of officer/enlisted.<br />
<br />
It's a great one though... easily adaptable to fit any situation :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could substitute Sys admin for enlisted man, and senior management (or customer) for officer, and have a pretty fair account of what my life's been like recently.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe, yea when I heard it it was engineer/senior managment.</div></div><hr />
