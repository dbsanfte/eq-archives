<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">both are nice, depends on if you have sta maxed or not but i would go with second one but that is because i am not maxedyet and it has more raw hp then the first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd take the latter.<br />
<br />
More raw HP, more endurance, +atk, slightly better saves, more agility to make up for the AC loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tamov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you tank in GoD+, take thulian.<br />
<br />
Only good thing about the second one is charisma / resist. 10 ac is strictly better than 35 HP for a tank.</div></div><hr />

Sell the Thulian and get some other gear :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure on your server economy, but you could consider wearing the VP quest Mask, selling the Thulian, and buying Kizrak BP to replace Vindi. On my server those masks fetch a good price, and those changes would net you both AC and HP gains over your current set up.</div></div><hr />

If you can't get to at least 250 in the relevant stats for a warrior buffed, it's your other gear that is at fault, not the thulian.<br />

Having lots of stats and extras (like regen) are nice and/or amusing, but for me, I try to keep my eye on the ball and my priorities on what a warrior needs most.</div></div><hr />

The problem is with the warrior class is we are 99% focused on items to make ourselves. anyone of us could click a and defensive, that's a given. I know I personally try to get as MANY things as I can from ffa stunts that me and my friend pull from time to time (6-18 person gigs, ei primals with 18, seru with 6) to upgrade as much as you can, without spending dkp/merit favor. In this situation, he can quest that sky mask, remove the augmentation from the thulian and sell it (for good money I might add) - to buy better stuff for other slots. Looking at the Magelo right now, could probably trade that mask for a Crystal Acid Bracer to replace his mana-threaded one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On the surface the Thulian +10AC seems to be worth keeping.<br />
<br />
But if you get VP Mask, sell Thulian and buy Kizrak BP, and you will be ahead by +8AC and +50hp.<br />
<br />
If you have money left over (which I bet you will, since Thulian sells for $$$$$$), save it and see if you can buy a better belt/bracer after OOW comes out in 5 weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why one earth would anyone suggest buying an ornate BP? What a waste of plats. In the time he will spend questing the mask, he could rack up LDoN points and get an NRo BP and end up with 24ac upgrade, and still have 3 aug slots to add another 100hp to his chest. Trading 10ac for 35hp is a bad choice. Since when has 1ac = 3.5 hp been a good trade? Never, that's when. Selling the mask is not going to accomplish anything, Brokkah already has either the best tradeable item, or a better no drop item in every slot. Plats are meaningless at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would not trade 10 AC for 35 hps.  That AC is too important.  When you consider that you can aug it with a 10 AC aug, thats 20 raw ac you are adding, and about 32 AC total.  Thats a good chunk of AC, I would not trade it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Er, I disagree with wandor.  The mask quest takes far less time than 1492 LDON points.  He already has his Cipher of Veeshan and RoS faction.  Time spent in LDON is better spent doing the VP mask, ring and bow quests in Brokkah's case.  Again, the tradeoff is not 10 AC for 35 hp if the Thulian mask is worth additional stats in another slot, and in this case it is.  Why not spend plat on his remaining crap slots not covered by VP quests, what else is there to spend it on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why one earth would anyone suggest buying an ornate BP?<br />
<br />
A few reasons, I'd guess. He's wearing Vindi BP - Kizrak's would be an upgrade.  The ornate BP is a clicky you can carry around in a backpack long after you upgrade it - even if you're wearing Raex or Vadd BP, Kizrak's is good to have. You say ornate BP is a waste of plats, but that's what plats are for, spending. IMO, time is more precious than plats - it's easy to farm plat quickly if you're smart. Farming a few thousand LDoN points is going to take an assload of time no matter how smart you are - you can't get more than 105pts per 45 minutes, period. In the same amount of time, you could farm enough plat to buy a few dozen ornate BPs.</div></div><hr />

What &quot;crap&quot; slot would you recommend he upgrade with a tradeable item?<br />
<br />
In the same amount of time, you could farm enough plat to buy a few dozen ornate BPs.Or he could just farm an ornate BP and be done with it. Having a click that is marginally useful just isn't as good as having the LDoN points. When he upgrades, he can always trade the BP in for the points, not like they are going to waste, he could use several augments still. The BP is only useful for the click, and only when there isn't a shaman around.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, there is the small matter that warriors are nt exactly the best plat farming class. I would guess that he could probably farm 1400 LDoN points in the time it would take him to farm 100k+ plats to buy the BP. Not to mention the AA he would gain from doing LDoN as opposed to no exp farming plats. (I am assuming you mean solo farming)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Interesting discussion, and lots to think about. Thanks for all your advice so far :) The mask quest pieces  would not take me long to farm as I can 3 box when needed, but having said that I can also farm pp rather easily the same way.<br />
<br />
I have to say though that LDoN does bore the hell out of me, and all the points I earn there are gong towards 40hp augs and saving for an Anger 3 Aug, so the Tak BP is not really an option at this time.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm leaning towards keeping the Thulian Visage and going for a P3 time mask when we finally get Coirnav dead! :)<br />
<br />
I am an AC junkie and just really wanted some confirmation that the 10AC was worth keeping over the miscelleneous other stats on the questable item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lykke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ohh no, not the hp/ac descution again :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">At this stage of the game, I wouldn't trade out decent ac for minute hp gains. 10khp means nothing if you're still at like 1600 ac, unless you live in luclin.</div></div><hr />
