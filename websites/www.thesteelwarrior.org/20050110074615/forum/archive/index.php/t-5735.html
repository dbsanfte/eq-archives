<br />
While level grinding the easy levels.<br />
<br />
Popped on my  36 SK alt, ended up group leader, got 20% of a level and 20% of a leadership AA. Considering how painless XP can be at levels 1-50 and a few other scattered levels, I would strongly supect the best time to get leadership AAs is while leveling up. <br />
<br />
Sure it will take you 20% longer, but that is nothing compared to what I needed (time wise) to hit 50th (the then max) the first time... 75 days. My 53rd rogue may have 20 days played.<br />
<br />
How fast are leadership AAs at 65 in normal LDoN?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">leadership XP seems to be a standard AA, except only 20% xp turned on<br />
Just from what I have seen. good idea way too much aa cost to implement</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Leadership xp is not some fixed pool that diverts 20% of your XP in.  Otherwise people at level 35 should never even see that bar move.  What it does is that it takes away 20% XP, and then computes the leadership xp you gained by some other criteria that has nothing to do with how much total XP you're getting.<br />
<br />
Raid is probably the best time to get leadership XP.  It is surprisingly high and you lose the least amount of XP that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RJs68Olds</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Phantron here, it's definately not the same amount as a regular AA.  I've been comparing my AA/LAA gains with my wife's chanter in our XP groups and she gets 4 AAs for every LAA I get, approximately.  In the same amount of time I get pretty close to 3 AAs.  I haven't broken it down mathematically yet, though I was thinking of giving it a shot this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to vary based on how many people are in the group.<br />
<br />
BTW, they seem to have made a change, originally you couldn't get leader xp on lt blue mobs.  A couple days ago I was PLing a necro and cleric on ledge in velks, and I made 2 leader points in about 6 hours.  I gaiend about 1/2 an AA, the necro went from 54 to 55, and the cleric from 46 to 49.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if this is a change or not, but LAA skills don't become active unless you have 3 or more in a group.  Even though the skill is green instead of the brown inactive color with just 2 in group.  I had thought that originally just 2 were needed to activate the skill.  Maybe I'm just loosing my mind. ;)</div></div><hr />
