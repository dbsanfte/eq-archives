I'm currently the leader/main tank of a guild that can do Halls of Testing and we're setting our sights on Vindi.  <br />
Do not even think of saying &quot;get RZ cultural&quot;, I'm a tunare worshipping wood elf, heh.  :o <br />
I'm currently not flagged for PoV/Storms, so my exp time has been spent grinding out AA's.  (currently have run3, sta4, nd3 and ae taunt, working on PE next)<br />
My magelo is in the sig.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">-Neck - First Brood Talisman, Bile Etched Obsidian Choker<br />
-Ear - tons of options, Mosquito Leg Earring for example<br />
-Finger - 2nd reward in Spirit Wracked Cords quest (if ya wanna do faction), Ssra Emperor key<br />
-Wrists - Crystallized Acid Bracer, Silver Bracelet of Speed if ya later do Doze w/any regularity<br />
-Hands - Gauntlets of Stability, GoDS if ya ever jump ship and start killing Yelinak<br />
-Shoulders - Strength of the Elements, also a number of decent shoulders in PoP, one with +65 HP drops in PoN for example<br />
-Chest - Vindi BP, but you probably already knew that<br />
-Back - Cloak of the Fearsome, Loyalist Shield of Honor, Cloak of Flames<br />
-Waist - Runed Bolster Belt for another haste option<br />
-Legs - those smithed greaves from CT are pretty hot, not too hard to get if you have a smith in your guild<br />
-Boots - Boots of the Vindicator, or Boots of the Storm if ya later move on to Tormax<br />
<br />
Also Spirit Wracked Cords would be great for a few slots if ya want to do the quest. Of course I recommend ST as an eventual stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanori</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You said you are HoT capable, so I am not sure if you are doing it now, have some of the pieces etc...<br />
<br />
Ear - I know a lot of people like the Solstice, but I am guessing you will be doing HoT gear next.  In light of that - pick up 2 Electrified Earring of the Tempest - 7ac 35hp 35mana 12svm 12svc 12vf.  By doing so, you will have to swap out less gear for resists and keep your ac/hp gear.<br />
<br />
Back - Again, from an HoT MT standpoint, kill Lodi and get a Lodi Shield.  By getting the shield piece, you're saving yourself about 13k instead of outright buying it, and getting 20svc and 20svf, as well as EB.<br />
<br />
Shoulder - get an Imbued Granite Spaulder.  I see them as low as 3k on DRo.  20ac, 10 save to all.<br />
<br />
Finger - get another Valorium Ring of Gallantry.<br />
<br />
Those are the things I would get in your situation since the upgrades will flow well once you hit HoT.  You're looking to spend about 23k on all of them, easily farmed in a week if you know the right spots and have the time.<br />
<br />
For me, the difference tanking in HoT with those resist items, versus using BD gear was night and day.<br />
<br />
As far as AA's, you may consider doing CA2 or 3, and CS2 or 3 before you do PE.   The extra 2.5% hp you'll get will probably be outweighed by the increased mitigation from those 2 AAs.  Just my line of thought...</div></div><hr />
