<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DG-Slider</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone used one of these yet and parsed it out? I know that procs are better as everyone is concerned about aggro, but I also know that many high level warriors have high DPS weaps they carry for when they are not MT'ing. I was thinking of setting up my an extra set and was looking at Augs like:<br />
<br />
Blazing Flecked Crystal - FireDMG:2<br />
Restrictions:1hWeaponsOnly,MinDly:16 <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Freezing Nickel Fragment- ColdDMG:2, BaneDmg:Undead+1, <br />
Restrictions:MinDly:30 <br />
<br />
My question is two fold:<br />
First, if you parsed it out, does the increased damage from Augs like these overcome a good weapon proc?<br />
<br />
Second, when it talks about minimum delay, this means that your weapon has to have that delay or lower right? Or is the opposite meaning yor cannot put it on a weapon with a lower delay? Sorry, I don't know why this confused me but it reads to me like you can only make a good weapon better, and not a bad one, which confuses me. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help as always!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
As far as I know, there are no augments available in type 4 that add DMG to a weapon. Perhaps there's an augment dropping in pre-Kod'Taz GOD that I'm not aware of.<br />
 <br />
As for elemental damage in general, I usually weigh it at half value, on the assumption that most mobs will resist it half of the time.  So for example, a 14/19 dirk from Everfrost camp with 2 Fire Dmg augment added, I would expect it to have the same DPS as a 15/19 weapon in general (it would perform worse in a &quot;fire-based&quot; zone like SolRo, and better in a &quot;cold-based&quot; zone like most of Velious).</div></div><hr />

[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
<br />
You are correct. I don't currently any weapons that can take these but I haven't seen much on the boards about them and was wondering if that was b/c these items are just not worth while. I know there are some nice weapons you can get from LDoN and upgarde them so I thought about researching that route.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the second part is right.<br />
<br />
for a Minimum Delay 16 aug, the weapon must have 16 or greater delay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The high-level LDoN 2-handers aren't impressive and generally, you want a 2h for DPS.<br />
<br />
The 1h are nice looking but because they don't have an innate agro proc, high-level warriors avoid them because they need more agro.  Your 1h combo is excellent.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest either a War Marshal's Bladed Staff or a Windblade for DPS (WMBS is slightly more DPS but Windblade is slower for fewer ripostes if you're helping position from the front)<br />
<br />
If you're looking to burn LDoN points, consider Ykesha or Anger augs, Armor, or AC/hp augs for your nicest pieces of armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but you can make a decent 2HB weapon.<br />
Steelcrown War Mace<br />
Type:2hb, Dmg:34, Dly:32, AC:10, Str:15, Agi:8, HP:85, Mana:55, MR:15, type1,type4,type6 <br />
<br />
Add in a +3 damage augment, and for 1910 AP, you have a decent 2H 37/32 weapon that should outdamage WMBS, imo, or at least keep up with it.  While not what I would spend adventure points on myself, it may be an option for someone.<br />
<br />
-edit- Or, if you have altogether way too many adventure points, build a 16/19 and 17/20 1H combo that will out-dps a WMBS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is true, if all you want is DPS and you have the points, the 1 hander LDON pair and the 2 hander LDON weapon are probably equivalent to each other in DPS.  But as stated so many times in this forum, the LDON route will give you inferior aggro to simply augmenting your existing pair of weapons.  And for DPS, it is far too easy to go kill Auliffe in BOT to get a DPS staff that will significantly outperform the weapons you've described.</div></div><hr />

Go for the pure dmg (+2 dmg) raw.<br />
<br />
Dont forget the augments you are talking about can only be put on LDoN bought weapons.<br />
Which makes them totally useless, since LDoN weapon suck.<br />
<br />
Want a dps combo ? Spend 1-3k in the bazaar to get a 1+ ratio 2H and you are done.</div></div><hr />
