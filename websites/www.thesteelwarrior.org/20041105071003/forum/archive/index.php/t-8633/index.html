<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mbahansen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can you guys take a look at my Warrior and help me with a path for him.  My main is a Shammy, but I have played a warrior up to about 40 when a friend stopped playing and gave me his 65 warrior to play a few month ago.  As you can see by his gear he is an old retired warrior with nice stuff.  Alot of the AA are not what I would have picked and I have changed that path based on some stuff I have seen here since I started playing him.  Currently it sounds like WA and Ferocity are the ones to get.<br />
<br />
My guild is not yet raiding much in POP, but we are working on SSRA and VT.<br />
<br />
BTW:  My friend stopped playing after a high level guild told him he couldn't get in.  What did they not like about him?  I just want to make him well Rounded so I could use him more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LDoN man.....the 1492 armor will be quite nice and easier/cheaper than Kizrak ornate pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's lot of reasons your friend might not have gotten into whichever guild, two of the most likely reasons are: 1) They weren't looking for warriors 2) They weren't looking for warriors without their defensive AAs finished.  <br />
<br />
Getting Combat Stability, finishing Lightning Reflexes, and getting Innate Defense should be pretty high on your priority list. <br />
<br />
Gear-wise, your weapons arent bad, but niether are really agro weapons.  AHB really isnt a bad weapon though, pair it with a Copper Hammer of Striking, Sword of the Bloodsworn, Blade of Carnage etc. and he should do fine. <br />
<br />
There's plenty of upgrades you can get, bazar or otherwise, looks like the most needed upgrades are a replacement for Myrmidon Bracer, your Boots, and you Bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have friends willing to camp with you, there are quite a few good upgrades to be had.  If you're already over 1492AP in NRo, I suggest doing some hards in BB.  There's a very nice pair of boots there, &quot;Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites&quot;.  Other than that, LDoN armor is pretty nice if you aug it correctly......little low on the saves and AC, but much nicer than bazaar bought stuff.<br />
<br />
Another suggestion is, if you have friends that can help you camp then, the Secrets of the Planes quest is pretty easy other than the final piece, which is MQ'able.  It's not a bow, but it's a good range item with 100hp and a dodge mod.<br />
<br />
You might think about putting Anger3 augs on your blades (if you don't have the cash for a heavy agro wep).  Or, the GSoT is decent agro with the aug....and you can buy it for pocket change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mithlani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how's it going bro? Good to see you still playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Mith, pretty good, I haven't seen you around :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mithlani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">and Pynke no longer plays. Everyone else who went to MR is still there.  Gib and Aenile are in Leviathan and Chrance is in Phantasmic Dreams.  <br />
<br />
I am still with IL atm. <br />
