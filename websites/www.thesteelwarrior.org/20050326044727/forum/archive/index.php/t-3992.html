<br />
we tried Seru last night....we only had 1tank(me) monk and a rogue with bane .... 3 maybe 4 mages 2 wizards and a coupel druids shamns and clerics.......<br />
<br />
we took him down to 90% pretty fast...then we wiped cause of adds killing our clerics.....<br />
<br />
is there any way we can position him and not have to deal with adds?  <br />
<br />
next time we will have more bane....we didn't have our full raid force last night and the ones not on were the ones with bane...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">11-01-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shouldn't really get adds during this fight... There are only 2, really, that can possibly aggro, unless folks are wandering around.  And those 2 are now mezable with Bliss.<br />
<br />
Or, just kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grobble</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That should have been plenty to kill him.  Don't worry too much about bane, it's really more of a hassle then it's worth with seru... just bring along some nukers instead and let your melee go afk until loot ;)<br />
<br />
Wall aggro can be very bad in Seru's room.  Here's what we do, and we get zero adds every fight.  Not even respawn adds.<br />
<br />
Enter Seru's room and hug right.  If you're looking at his pad, you'll see a couple pillars right next to it.  You want to hide your clerics behind them, while you tank Seru near the wall straight ahead, but far enough away from the closest door that you won't aggro respawn.<br />
<br />
Everyone else with the possible exception of a bard stands on the pad where he spawns.  Have debuffers do so from melee range so Seru doesn't run over your casters and clerics and dot them in case debuffers get aggro.<br />
<br />
As long as nukers watch their aggro, fight should go smoothly.  Mages and bards make this much easier due to rods and chorus...Seru's melee is pretty gimp so clerics should have no mana trouble.<br />
<br />
If you do happen to get adds, you'll have a ton of melee standing around doing nothing to take care of them.  Just have a knight get aggro, shamans and druids should be able to handle heals np.<br />

Here is my painfully bad map!:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krauth Isuber</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also have a small question about Seru.  I have read many things about him, including you DO need Seru bane weapons.  But, on the contrary, I have also read that you do NOT need Seru bane weapons.  My guild is low end PoP (Behemoth level), and high end Luclin (anything pre-VT), and I figure Seru would be a nice target for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't hit him with melee without Serubane.  Procs work, however, and spell sland pretty well.  Many folks just tank him and have casters kill him.  Others, if they have serubane on their melee, will dodge the AE and melee him, or simply have someone cure the AE each time it goes off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do pretty much the same thing as listed above.  Once we port upstairs, we clear the hallway and when ready, send two tanks into Seru's room, hugging the right wall to the first corner where the pillar is.   Then the MA pulls seru to the corner while the rest of the raid rushes to the middle of the room by his spawn point.<br />
While the MA esablishes agro, we debuff.  At the same time, the 2nd tank is attacking and taking agro when the first tank gets stunned (usually lasts about 20 seconds).  Once the stun is off, the agro just about always reverts to the MA.<br />
After about 3-4 minutes (depending on # of EB procs) the casters will SLOWLY begin nukes.  This goes on for a while until about 50% when you can start speeding up nukes a bit.  <br />
Just keep on doing this until he's dead.  When and if you get any adds, just sick the melees on him who are standing around with their thumbs up their ass.<br />
We have no seru baned melees, so your tactics may vary if you want to use them.  It takes a while the way we do it, but for what its worth, we've never failed with our system.<br />
<br />
Good luck next time :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure they can...at least out Beastlords are always sickin their overgrown pets on him when we do him. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do seru similar to what others have posted.  The key is to tank seru between the pillars so that he doesn't agro the guards that will respawn during the fight.  If they do respawn and agro just mez them and have all of the non-bane melees beat them down.  Another hint is to not use AoE taunt for any reason during seru.  Lots of times it works fine, but sometimes if you are tanking seru too close to a wall it will agro guards on the other side and you might wipe cause of a huge guard train.</div></div><hr />

DoN can do him.  Just need the planning/logistics.</div></div><hr />

Aye...we're kinda on the rebound now though.  After majority of the guild decided to go for VT, a lot decided to change their mind two weeks into Ssra / Shards.  Ended up getting a few AL kills, and a dozen or so people baned...around 30~ish Emp Keyed.  May eventually go back and try that again.  So now we're back to PoP / High End Luclin / High End Velious.  On a side note, after 14 effin' kills, AoW FINALLY dropped me a Blade of Carnage =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grobble</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pets cannot damage seru with their melee, but their procs can.  Beastlord warders proc a nuke of some kind, necro pets proc lifetaps.  <br />
<br />
We generally don't use pets to avoid positioning problems (our necros don't anyway, they're too busy dotting to watch pet, we do have a beastlord that uses his warder when he's there).<br />
<br />
Also, using a Weaponshield pull can be useful here to get the MA a ton of aggro from the get-go.  Less chance of debuffers getting aggro and if he/she gets stunned fairly often early on, less chance of your damage dealers stealing aggro as well.  The only time we didn't use WS pull, MT was stunned a few seconds in and a chanter pulled seru off her after tash.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">771 max hit, slowable with disease slow i think, does flurry<br />
<br />
think the di/db ratio is like .12 also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once slowed seru's melee is pretty weak.  I think the general CH chain timing on him is like 5 seconds or longer.  The most annoying thing about seru is that he has a nasty stun proc that lasts maybe 15 seconds or longer.  Make sure to have a bard in the MT group to keeep the MTs MR very high or you will be stunned for most of the fight.</div></div><hr />
