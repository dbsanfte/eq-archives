My guild is 3 years old and is a small family style guild. We are not hardcore raiders. Even so I am still looking for my next step in upgrades</div></div><hr />

I would certainly recommend better agro weapons, and you probably already know about the Greatstaff of Thunder, Sword of the Bloodsworn, and Copper Hammer of Striking, and any of those would be a nice addition to your weapon selection.</div></div><hr />

You're doing just fine for your level but there isn't a better upgrade than grinding out those levels and getting the extra HP, AC, ATK and skills that go with them.  Everything you do will be easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bordaaf</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey thanks all<br />
<br />
Looks like I'm heading into CT and Droga wish me luck )<br />
<br />
uggh gonna have to slowly work my way up to CT looks like<br />
<br />
That crystalized acid stuff looks nice but drops off of a lvl 65 mob in the end of a ring event.  An Acidic Mass (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=9223)  I am not so sure this family guild could handle that. /sigh<br />
<br />
I do carry the Greatstaff of Thunder also. Being one that is usually just a duo with the cleric, I am also trying to finish the Eyepatch of Plunder quest, damn Stormfeather.<br />
<br />
Obviously being 3 years old and still only 57 the race to 65 was never a concern of mine. I decided to take the scenic and frustrating route of tradeskilling along the way.<br />
<br />
I have managed to hit 200 in all short of Pottery 193, Tailoring 158, and Fishing 130s</div></div><hr />

If you guys could muster 3-4 groups with some good healing, and a little CC, it would be super easy.<br />
<br />
Just rare as hell!  Damn mass never drops a bracer!</div></div><hr />
