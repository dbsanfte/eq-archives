<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barangi~E'ci</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We usually have 1-3 tanks assigned to tanking duty on clearing and depending on zone we're in, we'll either tank up to 3 mobs at the same time and just assist down the line or if the mobs can be mezzed snatch one, attack and kill, have 2nd tank build up aggro on mezzed mob during fight and when first mob dies, 2nd tank breaks mez and assist is called. Seems to work well most of the time. In some cases, if the mobs we're fighting are the fleeing kind, I'll leave my current target when it turns around to flee and move on to the next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">depends on zone for us.   in mpg and rs, i or another warrior usually runs ahead and aggro's about 5-8 mobs and trains the raid, enc's sort out mezzes and we have a knight do main assist while warriors hold stuff on aggro till it gets mezzed.   in anguish, we usually keep 2-3 in camp at all times, off tanking reds (warriors) and mezzing yellows, again a knight is usually main assist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Uqua I have a key that cycles through all the npcs in range, and I press it fast as I can until I see a mob w/o a tank, and get on it. in RSS, unless 5 mobs are pulled, I just assist MA, and Jump on whatever adds.<br />
<br />
During Ink i ussually do the same as I do in Uqua.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">depends entirely on how your guilds works.  if you have warriors as main assist like most people do, never worry too much about whos going to pull arggo so long as its a plate tank that takes the hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
shadow knights can pretty much take any arggo from anyone anytime the want to. and if they can't tank it and are pulling arggo..  let em die =p <br />
<br />
so if your shadow knights are feeling left out make them MT on trash clearing. while keeping MA on a warrior or rogue  who ever.<br />
<br />
building arggo isn't terribly important on trash so long as its a tank getting hit.<br />
<br />
HoTT is the plate tanks best friend.  if its a class that shouldn't be getting hit after a mezz break,  taunt.   and tank it or dump the arggo to someone else  your choice.<br />
<br />
our tanks do this method.   we have at least 3 main heavy tanks on pretty much on any raid.   <br />
<br />
 If the main doesn't get the arggo right off then the other tanks all taunt.  this methed you don't even have to worry too much about breaking mezz since you have all the warrriors taunting right off.  someone is bound to get a good taunt in..   it makes for faster clearing. keeps the entire raid busy instead of sleeping.</div></div><hr />

Our paladins were given the duty to do CC along with enchanters. Stuns can be laid on thick even while the mobs were mezzed.<br />
<br />
MA was our heaviest tank, and he alone breaks the mezzes. As SupportTank mentions above, we don't really care whether it was paladin or warrior that gets hit upon mezz break, so long as it's a plate class.<br />
<br />
You can imagine our joy when our raid leader got his raid MA ring hehe.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't let a warrior MA on raids unless it was a very easy no brainer, even less the raid leader. if your fighting something faily difficult for your guild chances are the first one to die is him, 10-15 seconds of noone knowing what to hit, even with SA and people reassisiting you've lost alot of DPS and possible your raid, we've used many classes but generally Rogues and rangers are the best MA's because of thier innate dislike for taking dmg (and rogues ability to escape).<br />
<br />
Though saying that whatever works best for your guild at the end of the day, but I know that I lead my guilds raids and am one of the top 2 tanks so usually drop first if anyone is going to, and I hate it because there 10-20 secs of being unable to communicate and delegate what is going on, similar to MA'ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild generally uses pally's and SK's for MA. We assign warrior MT, ST etc for bosses and let people continue to assist the MA. Warriors for trash clearing is a joke imo, pally/sk have so much faster and better aggro it's a no brainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On raids where u cant mes mobs... like ugua, someone like a ranger or Rog work best... all tanks need to be able to switch mobs at anytime, incase someone else dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the start of our raids I assign our tank order  via hp/ac/aa    me-&gt;?&gt;?&gt;?&gt;?&gt;?   that way if all of us end up dying people know who's up next and who to target fast.  Then again my guild only has 2 warriors now, me and my recruit hah but anyways...<br />
<br />
Just bellow the mobs on inc. If its a named your switching to from a trash mob, /disc spirit of rage and bellow it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rokkar</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we use warrior MA's for clearing and never have a problem keepin agro other than having one of the other warriors pull agro off you.  the crap dies fast enough that it wouldnt be an issue if it ponged once or twice anyways.  Besides, who doesn't get a kick out of seeing a wizard pong and go splat anyways!<br />
<br />
and as far as gettin targets fast goes, i use a key for cycling through nearest NPC's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha rokkar.<br />
<br />
I don't taunt off wizards.  its policy for me.  or necros or BL or mages Or rangers or rogues or zerkers. or any plate -p<br />
<br />
the only thing i taunt off of are shammys druids clerics chanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild has a lot of paladins and SKs.  Genereally they handle CC tanking, and get zero-damage aggro on mezzed mobs.  That way the MT (generally a warrior) can pretty much just taunt/bellow and break mez and worse case a knight will take a round or two before you get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tetzou</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assist the MA first in line, then I cycle targets (mine is Shift+Tab).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saio</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We generally use a ranger for the MA....as a MA...he can stand back and pick through the targets. We generally have enough warriors/pallies/Sks to take care of the tanking responsibilities. Warriors generally have enough tasks to tank raid mobs without having the extended duty of having to MA through all the mobs. Rangers/rogues work well in these circumstances.<br />
<br />
In past guild used to use warriors....so i was used to that....but now seeing both sides of the coin...ill have to say that the ranger/rogue MA idea is much more to my liking. Its all a matter of preference really. <br />

Afk getting a drink<br />

All the complicated answers above are a bunch of lies only trust F8 !<br />
<br />
Shame on me I  ve reinstalled some stuff and needed to check if i could still post  :D <br />
Sadly tho, way too many people are using the process i ve just discribed and for being MA myself sometimes I wish i could disabled F8 from their keyboard forever and ever ...</div></div><hr />
