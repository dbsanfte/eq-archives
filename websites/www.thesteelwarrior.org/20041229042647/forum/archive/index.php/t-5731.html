<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barja Bardagi</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I searched.  If I missed this somewhere, I appologize in advance.<br />
<br />
Okay, brief run down... 65 level Ogre, MT for a guild doing BoT Towers, Vindi, Statue, King Tormax, etc.  Gear is on Magelo below and to the side.  Should be 90% accurate.  If they removed the cap, STR would be 305 and STA would be like 335.  I should be getting a GSo4W soon, and have the points for an Anger 3 aug already set asside for it.<br />
<br />
Current AA's are up to date, but simply put, I've got:<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
ND3<br />
AET<br />
CA3<br />
CS3<br />
PE<br />
LR5<br />
ID5 (finish it tonight)<br />
<br />
Now, I was thinking PD 3 and PP5 next, but with the introduction of GoD, I'm reevaluating that line of thinking.  I'm seriously considering Sturdiness 1, WA 1-?, then back to Sturdiness for 2 maybe up to 3, and then not sure from there...<br />
<br />
Any input?<br />
With tanking / agro-control being #1 priorities, what is the new line of thought for AA's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, sturdiness vs PD is a pretty easy comparison. Plug PD into your magelo, and find out how many hp you get per AA. Sturdiness 1 is 25hp/AA. If PD is less than that, get sturdiness 1. PP5 is a similar comparison, use the atk and dex as a bonus to the hp.<br />
<br />
 I AM interested on peoples' opinion of how early people should get WA. I'm not really sure how I'd prioritize it myself, frankly... Hp are good, and aggro is good, but where's the tradeoff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that getting WA depends a great deal on what weapons that you have and what procs those weapons have.  Personally my main xping weapon is a BBB with anger 3 aug.   Both the anger 3 proc and the rune proc from the BBB are pretty damn good so I plan on maxing WA as fast as I can.  If I was only using an unauged GSo4W for my main xp weapon I might not train up WA so quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barja Bardagi</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I stated, I have the points already banked and waiting for an Anger 3 aug for the GSo4W.  I'm just waiting on the GSo4W.  Should be sometime in the next week.<br />
<br />
As for the remaining AA's, I did the math.  I think the following maximizes my return for the effort:<br />
PD 1-3  (Return of 27HP/AA)<br />
Sturdiness 1  (Return of 25HP/AA)<br />
PP 1-5  (Return of 9.5 HP and 2.2 ATK/AA)<br />
Sturdiness 2-5 (12.5 and dropping/AA)<br />
<br />
So, the question really boils down to when and where do I insert Weapon Affinity?  Or are there AA's I should look at before that?  Punishing Blade?  Flurry?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PB and flurry and whatnot are nice, but not likely to add more aggro than a higher proc rate. In my opinion, it's going to be a choice between more aggro via WA or more hp. Hopefully, someone with WA can shed some light on this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing to consider, which helped me choose which order to get the rest of my old AAs, as well as the new ones, is the fact that as your guild progresses, raid mobs tend to have bigger and harder to resist AEs. I am one of several similarly-equipped warriors in my guild, so we end up switching the tank responsibility around on raids. Because of these two facts, what I concluded was that extra HP will always be useful, while getting more procs is situational. Be it in exp groups, while tanking a raid, or just adding more dps at a raid, more hp is better. While I'm not tanking on a raid, and using my GSo4W for dps, and extra 50% procs (which is what WA5 seems to add, as posted in other threads) would be a minimal dps increase in the grand scheme of things. <br />
<br />
I ended up getting PD3 and PP4 just before GoD went live, and had 12 AAs banked to buy sturdiness1 and 2. Now I'm probably going to finish up PP5 and get some levels of WA while I get the last few flags i need to be ele, where I can get AAs faster, and work towards sturdiness3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The WA stats are pretty well documented now.<br />
<br />
You can get approx. 50% more procs if you have WA 1-5.<br />
<br />
I was sitting on 12 AA's that I had saved for Sturdy 1 and 2. I ended up taking them.<br />
<br />
I am hp-challenged, but I have aug'd CHOS and SOTB. <br />
<br />
I can exp in elementals atm with my agro. <br />
<br />
It may not be perfect agro, but usually I have no problem.<br />
<br />
I made a commitment at the beginning of LDON to get my hps up.<br />
<br />
Since then I have gone from 7700 buffed to 8700 buffed.<br />
<br />
I am done with Sturdy for now. I am actually going to finish PP. I dont exp very fast and the fact that I get an upgrade ever 2 AA's, that I am digging up around 10 hps per AA PLUS going from 280 DEX to 305 DEX actually increases proc rate per minute as well....<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, I am sure I had everyone up till I said PP lol.<br />
<br />
But I made an hp promise to myself. <br />
<br />
I intend to keep it. <br />
<br />
I really just have to be secure with myself atm that Ykesha+Force Strike+Ykesha+Force Strike+Planar Strike+Anger II per minute+Incite+Incite+AET+Spirit of Rage is sufficient to do my job.<br />
<br />
WA waits for about 6 more AA's.<br />
<br />
Jakle<br />
Iksar Overlord<br />
Drinal<br />
<br />
p.s. thought WA was 5 and 10 AA's. my bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first poster mentioned the GSo4W.  I currently use the 15/20 1hb from everfrost ldon with a +2 dmg aug, so it's a 17/20.  I also use the 14/18 1hs with force shock (179dd/stun proc) off a tower boss.  I plan to add anger augs.  First off, the 17/20 is likely better dps than the 14/18 with 179 proc.  But is it enough better to be my primary hand weapon if both weapons get anger augs?  Or would 14/18 with force shock proc in primary be better than 17/20?  I want to anger aug both, but I ask because I'll probably anger III the best of those 2 weapons and maybe just do anger II in the other one.  I'm getting kind of tired of LDoN and there are other things I want points for too.<br />
<br />
These 2 weapons are clearly outdamaging windblade for me.  I have both ambidexterity and PB3, so 1 and 2 handers get bonuses.  I'm also wondering if they'll outdamage GSo4W and if I can expect them to outtaunt it assuming everything is equal (ie. they all have anger augs).  We're doing some tower bosses and I'm debating whether spending raid points for the GSo4W would be worth it.<br />
<br />
As for AA, I had all the old defensive and hit point ones before GoD except that I hadn't done PP3-5.  Since then I've added Sturd1 and 2, but still no more PP.  I don't feel like saving 12 points for sturd3 or 9 points for flurry3 or 15 for the ambidexteriy upgrade, so I'll probably buy something fairly cheap next.  It's a tossup right now.  I could finish PP3-5, start doing Fury of the Ages, do Run Speed 4, or start the WAs.  hmmm..... any thoughts?<br />
<br />
I currently have all defensive and hit point AAs from Luclin/PoP except the PP mentioned.  Also have ambidexterity, PB3, TM3, SE3, CF3, Ferocity3, AE Taunt, Flurry2, sturdiness2... that pretty well covers it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can get approx. 50% more procs if you have both WA 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
You mean WA 1-5?  30 AA total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly...<br />
<br />
IMO, if you tank, probably one of the best AA you could ever buy is SE 1-3... I recommend that highly to any up and coming warriors. The ~80% stun mitigation is huge. Where before I would get stunned regularly, now it is a very rare occurance.<br />
<br />
No Stun == Better aggro, more dps<br />
<br />
SE3 is imo, probably the best Warrior AA we get besides AoE taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am getting sturdiness 2 and WA4 before doing any offensive AAs.  I have SE1 and I like it a lot...might get that to at least 2 as well.  <br />
<br />
WA is amazing.  I have more problem losing aggro than getting it these days.  I grouped with a tank in earth using a DBotW and an  Obsidian Battle Sword and still had to ditch my aggro weapons to keep from stealing aggro non-stop.  His weapons were probably not augmented but still, WA has really changed my play style.  I am looking hard now for a good low-aggro, high-DPS 2-hander so I can avoid aggro when I want to.<br />
<br />
I too am having a hard time prioritizing Offensive AAs and things like Sturdiness 3-5 though, I may just wind up making a list of everything I still want and doing it in order of least points to most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that I am really liking so far about WA is that it helps out in lots of other ways other than just agro.  If helps my Truncheon of Doom proc faster when I am 2 boxing with say a druid or cleric, it helps my tash stick proc faster if I a mob is resisting slow a lot, it helps my Workman's sledge and primal proc faster.  These are all in addition to the primary reason that I bought WA which is for more EB procs and more rune 3 procs on my BBB.</div></div><hr />
